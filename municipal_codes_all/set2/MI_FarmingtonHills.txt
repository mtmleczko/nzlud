PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Farmington Hills of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code, as supplemented through March 21, 1983, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 4 is numbered 4-1 and the third section of Chapter 1 is 1-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-1.1, 3-1.2 and 3-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he or she is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be available to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Editor-in-Chief, and Laura Johnson, Code Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. JoAn Reynolds, former City Clerk, Kathryn A. Dornan, City Clerk, Mr. William M. Costick, City Manager, and Mr. Paul H. Bibeau, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
PREAMBLE 
    We, the citizens of this community, in spirit, conviction and purpose, have declared our intention to create a system of home rule government to insure that local laws and institutions shall keep pace with the progress of human endeavors. 
    We recognize that nothing is more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, than to initiate a new order, but the facilities of the past often are inadequate for the present and the future. 
    We fully acknowledge the traditional precepts that this government must provide for the public health, safety and welfare, that every citizen must be guaranteed due process under law, and that civil order and preservation of the peace are necessary if we are to insure the orderly administration of our affairs. In such matters as zoning, taxation and public improvements we recognize that our citizens expect self-willed growth subject only to their collective self-discipline and initiative. 
    Our community derives from a semi-rural tradition. Pastoral areas are not uncommon, and among us there are still those who gain their livelihood from the soil. Our residents sought and wish to maintain this tradition within a community which recognizes that the old can exist and thrive with the new. Home rule government need not mean urban life and urban strife. Commerce and industry can be a part of a tranquil suburb and, in concert with our citizens, can contribute to the quality of community life which we all seek. 
    We willingly assume the responsibilities and obligations of home rule government, knowing that becoming a responsive city is the most difficult of all civic achievements. Respect for ourselves, respect for the dignity of human individuality and continued self development underlie its attainment.

    The election and naming of a survivor beneficiary must be made on a form furnished by and filed with the retirement system prior to the date the first pension payment is made. An election of form of payment may not be changed on or after the date the first pension payment is made. A named survivor beneficiary may not be changed on or after the date the first pension payment is made, except that a named survivor beneficiary may be changed, or may be more than one (1) person, only if form of payment SL is elected. A named survivor beneficiary must have an insurable interest in the life of the member or vested former member when named. Payment shall be made under form of payment SL if there is not a timely election of another form of payment.

    Form of payment SL-Straight life pension. The retired member is paid a pension for life under form of payment SL. All payments stop upon the death of the retired member. 
    Form of payment A-Life payments with full continuation to survivor beneficiary. The retired member is paid a reduced pension for life under form of payment A. Upon the death of the retired member during the lifetime of the named survivor beneficiary, the named survivor beneficiary is paid a pension until death in the same amount the retired member was receiving. Should the named survivor beneficiary die before the retired member, the retired member's pension shall be recomputed (pop-up) to a straight life pension (form of payment SL). 
    Form of payment B-Life payments with three-quarters (3/4) continuation to survivor beneficiary. The retired member is paid a reduced pension for life under form of payment B.

The retired member is paid at retirement the retired member's accumulated member contributions, as defined by city policy or collective bargaining agreement; and a reduced pension for life thereafter under form of payment D. Contributions made pursuant to section 2-300(b), as well as any other contributions deposited to purchase credited service, shall not be refunded. The pension shall be reduced by the amount for which the actuarial present value shall be equal to the amount of accumulated member contributions withdrawn. The actuarial present value of the pension reduction shall be computed using (i) the interest rate prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as the immediate annuity rate for lump sum valuations for the month that includes the member's retirement effective date, or other rate adopted for this purpose by the retirement board; and, (ii) the mortality tables and blending percentages adopted by the retirement board for this purpose.

(h)  Application; payment of eligible rollover distributions to other retirement plan; definitions applicable to this subsection. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this subsection, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the retirement board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee as a direct rollover. The following definitions shall apply with regard to this subsection: 
(1)  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one (1) of series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more and any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. A portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution because it consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. Such portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity under section 408(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code or to a qualified plan under section 401(a) or 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that agrees to account separately for amounts so transferred including the portion of the distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution which is not includible in gross income. 
(2)  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an eligible plan under section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code, which is maintained by a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to account separately for amounts transferred to it, or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relations order. 
(3)  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the surviving spouse. 
(4)  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the retirement system to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(i)  Rollovers from other plans. The retirement system will accept an eligible rollover distribution for the purchase of intervening military service (section 2-300), repayment of previously withdrawn contributions (section 2-292), and/or permissive service credit which is authorized pursuant to the express provisions of the retirement system and amendments thereto. The retirement system will accept a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, including after-tax employee contributions; an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, excluding after tax employee contributions; an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The retirement system shall provide a separate accounting for all pre-tax and after-tax contributions received, and earnings thereon. 
(j)  Plan year. This plan year shall be the twelve (12) consecutive calendar months beginning each July 1. 
(k)  Maximum compensation. Compensation during a plan year in excess of the limitations set forth in section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be excluded from the determination of all benefits provided by the retirement system. For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989 and before July 1, 1996, the annual compensation of each member taken into account for determining all benefits provided under the plan for any determination period shall not include any amounts in excess of the annual compensation limit (originally two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00)) provided for in IRC § 401(a)(17) prior to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA '93") and adjusted for inflation in the manner provided by IRC § 401(a)(17). For plan years beginning on or after July 1, 1996, the annual compensation of each member taken into account shall not exceed the annual compensation limit provided for in IRC § 401(a)(17), as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA '93"). This limit may be adjusted as required by federal law for qualified government plans and shall be further adjusted for inflation in the manner provided by IRC § 401(a)(17). Annual compensation means compensation during the plan year or such other consecutive twelve-month period over which compensation is otherwise determined under the plan. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. 
(l)  Military service. The years and fractional parts of a year that an employee serves in the military service of the Armed Forces of the United States, the United States Merchant Marines or the United States Coast Guard, voluntarily or involuntarily, after separation from employment as an employee of the city to perform training or service, and reemployment on or after December 12, 1994, shall be added to the member's years of credited service for all purposes, provided that all of the following apply: 
(1)  The employee must return to employment by the city within the time period required by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (P.L. 103-353), as amended. 
(2)  The employee deposits into the retirement system the amount of money that the member would have contributed had the individual remained an employee during the individual's absence. The deposits for the absent time must be made during the period beginning when the employee returns to city employment and ending at the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the employee's return to city employment and the elapse of a period from return to city employment equal to three (3) times the period of the individual's military service under this section. 
(3)  The credited service for military service under this section shall not exceed five (5) years. 
(4)  The employee was discharged, or released from service, under honorable conditions or other circumstances meeting the minimum conditions of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (P.L. 103-353), as amended.

(m)  Vesting. A member shall be vested in his/her accrued benefit in accordance with IRC § 411(e) as in effect in 1974. 
(n)  Death During Qualified Military Service. In the case of a death occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a member dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Internal Revenue Code § 414(u)), the survivors of the member are entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under the plan as if the member had resumed and then terminated employment on account of a non-duty related death.

Sec. 2-702. - Medical benefits waiver.

Sec. 7-318. - Specifications. 
(a)  All property upon which houses, dwellings, buildings, house trailers, businesses and other such structures are constructed or located within the city shall be considered developed property and shall have property identification numbers which shall be posted on the face and/or other appropriate side of the house, dwelling, business or structure in a manner and location so that the identification numbers are clearly and readily readable to a person of normal vision from the adjacent roadway. House trailers shall have an individual space identification number at least three (3) inches in height on the side of the trailer facing the access road. The operator of the trailer park shall be responsible for assigning such numbers. If the house, dwelling, house trailer, business or structure is located on the property so that the posted numbers are not clearly readable from the roadway, due to distance or intervening sight barriers such as, but not limited to, shrubbery, terrain features or structures, the identification numbers shall also be posted separate from the main structure (i.e. on a yard light post, entrance gate, driveway marker, mailbox, etc.) in a fashion that is clearly readable from the adjacent roadway. Such additional identification numbers shall be either located centrally between the side boundaries of the property or located immediately adjacent to the driveway providing ingress to the property, and shall be located on the same side of the adjacent roadway as the property it identifies. 
(b)  The property identification number or address shall use numbers not less than three (3) inches in height. If the dwelling, house trailer, building, business or structure is located more than ninety (90) feet from the centerline of the traveled portion of the adjacent roadway, the identifying numbers shall be not less than six (6) inches in height, but in any case such numbers shall be of a size sufficiently large so that they are readable from the centerline of the adjacent roadway by a person of normal vision. 
(c)  The color of the numbers shall be in contrast with the immediate background on which they are mounted. 
(d)  In the case of multiple units, either business or residential, it shall be clearly indicated at each entrance the property identification numbers of those apartments or businesses accessible through such entrance. The purpose of this identification is to facilitate the rapid movement of emergency units to a specific apartment or business unit in apartment buildings or business complexes which have multiple entrances bearing the same number and series of such units that are not accessible except through a specific entrance. 
(e)  The occupants of all buildings in the city used for commercial and/or industrial purposes that are connected with or located so close to other buildings as to prevent access between such buildings and which requires a different route of access to the rear than that to the front of the building shall cause the correct business name and street numbers to be placed on the rear entrance door or immediately adjacent thereto. Such names and numbers shall be not less than three (3) nor more than six (6) inches in height, and may consist of standard manufactured letters and/or numerals. If painted on the building or door such names and numbers shall be applied with standard-type numeral and letter stencil. The name and number shall be placed as to be plainly visible and readable from the alley, service drive, easement, parking lot or any other rear access.

ARTICLE VIII. - SINGLE-FAMILY RENTAL DWELLINGS 

Sec. 7-340. - Purpose, intent and findings. 
    The purpose of this article is to help protect the health, safety and welfare of city residents and citizens, to prevent blight and property deterioration in neighborhoods, and to promote and maintain healthy, sanitary conditions in all single-family rental dwellings located throughout the city, recognizing the importance of such to the persons who do or may reside therein or in the vicinity. The city also recognizes a compelling interest in establishing standards for the maintenance of sanitary and safe single-family rental dwellings within the city which will provide for the maintenance or property values of nearby properties; and the reduction and elimination of blight and other deleterious factors affecting neighborhoods and the quality of life within the city. 
    The city has received recommendations from citizen visioning groups indicating that an ordinance to address concerns relating to single-family rental dwellings is necessary to protect the health and welfare of the community, and the city recognizes the unique nature of single-family rental dwellings versus multiple family and non-residential rental buildings because, in the city's experience: 
(1)  The maintenance of single-family rental dwellings is typically the obligation of a non-owning tenant or a non-occupying, off-site owner rather than an on-site manager or management company; 
(2)  Unlike non-residential rental buildings and apartment units, single-family rental dwellings are typically located in neighborhoods consisting of owner-occupied single-family dwelling units where the deterioration and non-maintenance of homes has a much more significant and direct negative impact on the quality of life, character, vitality, appearance and value of property in the surrounding neighborhood affecting residents on a broad and large scale basis in the city; 
(3)  Single-family rental dwellings are more often located in close proximity to other single-family residential structures and they therefore have a greater effect on the general health, safety, and welfare of the city's residents; and, 
(4)  Therefore, regulating single-family rental dwellings is the most effective way to reduce neighborhood and city blight with the resources available to the city. So in order to address this unique situation and help to protect residents of neighborhoods surrounding single-family rental dwellings, the city finds that a single-family rental dwelling inspection program is warranted and necessary.

(Ord. No. C-6-00, § 1, 5-22-00) 
Sec. 9.5-2. - Purpose and findings. 
(1)  Pursuant to section 29 of article 7 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, use of the highways, streets, alleys and other public places for operation of a public utility requires the consent of the city and the transaction of local business in the city by public utility requires that a franchise first be obtained. This chapter is adopted for the purpose of confirming and providing the process, terms and conditions for suppliers of electricity and natural gas to obtain the required consents and franchises and to fully exercise the city's constitutional authority which includes the reasonable control of its highways, streets, alleys and public places. 
(2)  As a result of regulatory changes that have or may occur, and interpretations of existing laws, at the state and federal levels, specifically including the Michigan Public Service Commission (deregulation), the persons that may be authorized to supply electricity and natural gas to customers in the city are no longer limited to the public utility that owns and operates the facilities used to deliver electricity and natural gas to customers. This chapter is adopted in recognition of the deregulation which has and may continue to occur, with the intent and purpose of confirming that all persons supplying electricity or natural gas to customers in the city are required to have a franchise as provided in this chapter, regardless of whether it is required as a condition of state or federal regulatory permits, approvals or certificates. 
(3)  The city will incur costs and expenses in reviewing and acting on franchise requests, and upon granting a franchise, monitoring and enforcing its terms and conditions, the city and such costs and expenses should be paid by franchise applicants and holders as provided in this chapter.

One (1) marked-up plan, along with review comments, shall be returned to planning to be incorporated into a single review. A copy of the review comments shall also be forwarded to the engineering division. Site plans shall be designed to comply with the following fire department requirements: 
(1)  Site access: 
a.  Sites must be designed to accommodate fire apparatus with a fifty-foot turning radius. The fifty (50) feet shall be measured to the centerline of the roadway. The minimum drive width shall be fourteen (14) feet (eighteen (18) feet for open perimeter increases and fire lanes). Generally, dead-end drives longer than one hundred (100) feet shall not be allowed. Roadways shall be capable of supporting fire apparatus weighing up to twenty-five (25) tons. 
b.  The minimum clearance between the finished roadway surface and any overhead obstruction shall be thirteen feet, six inches (13'6?). 
c.  When appropriate, large sites, or sites which contain high-life hazard occupancies, may require more than one (1) point of access (one may be designated for emergency use only). The location of any additional access points shall be coordinated with the planning department and engineering division. 
d.  Unless specifically approved otherwise, paved access for fire department apparatus shall be provided on at least two (2) sides of all buildings or fifty (50) percent of the perimeter, whichever is more. Such access shall be within twenty-five (25) feet of building(s). Some high-life hazard occupancies may require additional fire department access around the building. 
e.  When necessary, the fire department will designate fire lanes which shall be properly posted and maintained in conformance with the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices prepared by the Michigan Department of Transportation in conjunction with the Michigan Department of State Police. Fire lane signs shall be no further than one hundred (100) feet apart. 
f.  During construction, site access shall be maintained. Roadways capable of supporting fire apparatus weighing up to twenty-five (25) tons shall be provided. 
(2)  Hydrants. Hydrants shall be provided for both public and private street and shall be spaced approximately five hundred (500) feet apart in single-residential areas. Whenever practical, the hydrants should be located at intersections to provide ease in stretching fire hose in more than one (1) direction. Hydrants shall be placed approximately four hundred (400) feet apart, on-line, in commercial, industrial and multiresidential areas. Unless specifically approved otherwise, the following requirements shall be met: 
a.  Hydrants shall not be closer than forty (40) feet to the building. 
b.  Hydrants located in parking lot areas shall be protected by a minimum six-inch curb or standard hydrant guard post. 
c.  Hydrants shall be installed within fifteen (15) feet of the adjacent roadway (no closer than eight (8) feet) with the nozzle outlets at least eighteen (18) inches above the finished grade, with no obstructions to the outlets. The largest outlet shall face the adjacent roadway. There shall be no parking within fifteen (15) feet of a hydrant. 
d.  All points on the exterior of the building shall be no further than two hundred fifty (250) feet from a hydrant. Distances shall be measured along the shortest feasible exterior route for laying hose. Hydrants located on the opposite side of major thoroughfares shall not be considered in computing the 250-foot distance. 
e.  In those occupancies which have a fire suppression system with a fire department connection, the maximum distance between the connection and the closest hydrant shall not exceed one hundred fifty (150) feet. Landscaping shall be such that future growth does not block or interfere with the operation of the fire department connection. 
f.  Where a ditch or deep depression lies between the hydrant and the edge of the roadway, a culvert (minimum length twenty (20) feet) shall be installed in the ditch or depression and fill placed to allow access to the hydrant. 
g.  Hydrants shall be capable of providing the following minimum flow rates with a residual pressure of at least twenty (20) psi: 
1.  Residential: 1,250 GPM. 
2.  Multiresidential and commercial: 1,500 GPM. 
3.  Industrial: 2,000 GPM. 
h.  In all cases hydrants will be located in highly visible and accessible locations. All hydrant locations shall be approved by the fire department. 
i.  The approved hydrant type shall be the East Jordan Iron Works No. 6-BR-Traffic Model or Mueller No. 24015 (Improved AWWA type). Self-draining hydrants shall not be used. Hydrants shall have two (2), 21/2-inch male outlets and one (1) four-inch male outlet. The 21/2-inch outlet shall have National Standard threads and the four-inch shall have Detroit threads. 
j.  Hydrants are to be painted red above ground and black below, with a finish coat of Glamortex 501 enamel, color 314-Vermillion, or approved equal. In addition, the three (3) hydrant caps shall be painted with a special reflective yellow paint (paint number 3M-7211). On those sites where the hydrants are not properly painted, the fire department will complete the painting and backcharge the contractor/owner. Any such charges must be paid prior to final approval. 
(3)  Underground mains. Private underground mains and lead-in connections to fire suppression system risers shall be flushed and tested in accordance with NFPA 13, 14 and 24. The tests must be witnessed by the fire department. Upon successful completion of the test, the contractor is to complete the Contractor's Material And Test Certificate For Underground Piping and forward a copy to the fire department. 
(3.1)  Water supply availability for hydraulically designed sprinkler systems. Hydraulic calculations shall be based upon a maximum of ninety (90) percent of the available water at the lead-in connection for the fire suppression system. Flow tests conducted for such calculations shall be witnessed and approved by the fire department. 
(4)  Alternate protection. In some cases, an owner or lessee may find it impractical to comply with the minimum site plan review and design standards. If the owner or lessee is willing to provide additional built-in fire protection over and above the minimum code requirements, it is possible that some variance may be granted whereby the site plan standards may be modified by the fire marshal. Additional built-in fire protection would include, but not be limited to, complete suppression systems, complete detection systems or an upgrade in the type of construction. Persons wishing to propose variations from the strict application of this section should apply in writing to the fire marshal. The fire marshal may grant a variance upon a satisfactory finding that the proposed variance will provide a higher degree or, at least, an equal degree of fire safety if the minimum site plan review and design standards had been strictly followed. Any such variance shall be reduced to writing and forwarded to all applicable divisions and departments.

d.  The boundaries of each proposed historic district in writing and on maps. 
e.  The history of each proposed historic district. 
f.  The significance of each district as a whole, as well as a sufficient number of its individual resources to fully represent the variety of resources found within the district, relative to the evaluation criteria. 
g.  Transmit copies of the preliminary report for review and recommendations to the local planning body, the State Historic Preservation Office of the Michigan Historical Center, the Michigan Historical Commission, and the State Historic Preservation Review Board.

Public notice of the time, date and place of the hearing shall be given in the manner required by Public Act 267. Written notice shall be mailed by first class mail not less than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the hearing to the owner(s) of the property or properties within the proposed historic district, as listed on the most current tax rolls. The report shall be made available to the public in compliance with Public Act 442 of 1976, as amended. 
(6)  After the date of the public hearing, the historic district study committee and the city council have not more than one (1) year, unless otherwise authorized by the city council, to take the following actions: 
a.  The historic district study committee shall prepare and submit a final report with its recommendations and the recommendations, if any, of the local planning body to the city council as to the establishment of a historic district(s). If the recommendation is to establish a historic district(s), the final report shall include a draft of the proposed ordinance(s). 
b.  After receiving a final report that recommends the establishment of a historic district(s), the city council, at its discretion, may introduce and pass or reject an ordinance(s) or ordinance amendments. If the city council passes an ordinance(s) or ordinance amendment establishing one (1) or more historic districts, the city clerk shall file a copy of the ordinance(s) or ordinance amendment, including a legal description of the property or properties located within the historic district(s) with the register of deeds.

( Ord. No. C-1-2009, § 1, 3-23-09 ) 
Sec. 15-36. - Work within historic districts; permission required; review procedure. 
(a)  Requests for permission. Before commencing any work affecting the exterior appearance of a structure or the construction of a new structure or part thereof within a historic district or interior work that will cause visible change to the exterior of the resource, the person, including any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, organization, institution, or agency of government, proposing to take such action shall apply for and obtain permission to do so from the historic district commission. 
(b)  Application. The application shall be on a form and shall include such information and materials as prescribed in guidelines to be adopted by the city planning and community development department director and provided to all applicants. No fee shall be charged for the review and decision by the commission of any application. As part of the information and materials to be supplied pursuant to the above referenced guidelines, the application shall generally consist of two (2) parts: 
(1)  A written proposal of the action for which commission approval is sought with an explanation of the reason for the requested action; and 
(2)  Plans and drawings sufficient to clearly illustrate the proposed actions and depicting the structure in question and its relation to adjacent structures. 
The application shall be submitted to the city planning and community development department director before obtaining a building permit. A permit shall not be issued and proposed work shall not proceed until the commission has acted on the application by issuing a certificate of appropriateness or a notice to proceed. A certificate of appropriateness or notice to proceed shall not be issued unless the applicant certifies in the application that the property where work will be undertaken has, or will have before the proposed project completion date, a fire alarm system or a smoke alarm complying with the requirements of the Stile-DeRossett-Hale Single State Construction Code Act, 1972 PA 230, MCL 125.1501 - 125.1531. 
(c)  Transmittal of application to commission; building division certification. Copies of the complete application shall be transmitted to the historic district commission immediately after filing with the city planning and community development director. No work shall take place, nor a permit of any kind issued therefor, until the commission has issued a certificate of appropriateness or a notice to proceed and until the building division has certified that the plans and drawings meet the requirements of all applicable ordinances and regulations. 
(d)  Guidelines, standards, and criteria. In reviewing plans, the commission shall follow the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's "Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings" as set forth in 36 C.F.R. part 67, as amended. The following standards are to be applied: 
(1)  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(2)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
(4)  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(8)  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(9)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
The commission shall also consider all of the following: 
a.  The historic or architectural value and significance of the resource and its relationship to the historical value of the surrounding area; 
b.  The relationship of any exterior architectural features of the resource to the rest of the resource and to the surrounding areas; 
c.  The general compatibility of the exterior design, arrangement, texture and materials proposed to be used; 
d.  Those features of the particular resource identified in the report of the historic districts study committee, which supported its recommendation of the site or structure for inclusion within a historic district; and 
e.  Other factors, such as aesthetic value, that the commission finds relevant. 
f.  Whether the applicant has certified in the application that the property where work will be undertaken has, or will have before the proposed project completion date, a fire alarm system or a smoke alarm complying with the requirement of the Stile-DeRossett-Hale Single State Construction Code Act, 1972 PA 230, MCL 125.1501 - 125.1531. 
Additionally, the quality of materials and craftsmanship used in a rehabilitation project must be commensurate with the quality of materials and craftsmanship of the historic building in question. 
Owners are responsible for procuring copies of the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation to consult as part of the planning process. The commission may also adopt rules of procedure and additional review standards and guidelines for resource treatment in order to carry out its duties under this article. The commission may also adopt rules of procedure and additional review standards and guidelines for resource treatment in order to carry out its duties under this Article, as long as those rules and additional review standards and guidelines are equivalent in guidance to the Secretary of Interior's Standards and Guidelines and are established or approved by the State Historic Preservation Office. 
(e)  Decision of commission. Upon its review, the commission shall first approve the proposal and secondly approve the plans if, in its judgment, the standards, guidelines, and criteria enumerated in subsection (d), above, are satisfied and there is adverse affect caused by the request. In approving the proposal and plans, the commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness. The approval of a certificate of appropriateness may be with or without conditions; provided that any conditions shall be consistent with and for purposes of fulfilling the values embodied in the standards, guidelines and criteria set forth in this section. The commission may approve the proposal but reject the specific plans if it determines the plans are contrary or detrimental to the values embodied in the standards, guidelines, and criteria set forth in this section. In that event the application shall be deemed denied, but the applicant shall have the right to submit revised, amended or new plans addressing the issues raised by the commission for further review and consideration, which submission shall constitute a new application for purposes of subsection (j), below. Denial of any application shall be based only on the considerations set forth in subsection (d), above. A denial shall be accompanied by a written explanation by the commission of the reasons for denial, and a notice of the applicant's right to resubmit its application addressing the issues raised by the commission for further review by the commission. Further, the denial shall notify the applicant of the right to appeal the denial pursuant to section 15-41 of this article. 
(f)  Review limited to exterior features. The commission shall pass only on exterior features of a resource and shall not review or act upon interior arrangements or use of the structure, unless interior work will cause visible change to the exterior of the resource, or unless specifically authorized by city council. 
(g)  Filing of decision. After due consideration, the commission shall file with the building division its certificate of appropriateness or denial of the application submitted to it for review. Such certificate shall be signed by the chairperson or secretary of the commission. The commission shall state the reasons and grounds for its action in its minutes and on the face of its certificate. 
(h)  Compliance with approved plan. After a certificate of appropriateness has been issued and the building or demolition permit granted to the applicant, the building division shall take such action as is necessary to require compliance with the building plan approved by the commission, including any conditions of such approval. Certificates of appropriateness shall remain effective for a period of one (1) year; provided, however, that any plan submitted with the application for a building permit shall meet all of the requirements of this code in effect at the time the permit is applied for. If a building or demolition permit is not obtained within one (1) year, the approval shall expire and become null and void. 
(i)  Denial; no permits issued; re-submittal after modification of plan. A denial shall be binding upon the building division and no permit shall be issued in such case. In the case of denial, either before or after a denial the commission shall endeavor to work out a feasible plan for preservation with the applicant and may give suggestions regarding changes in the application it deems desirable to the applicant. 
(j)  Failure of commission to act. The failure of the commission to act within a maximum of sixty (60) days after the date of a complete and accurate application filed with it, unless an extension is agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the commission, shall be deemed to constitute approval. 
(k)  Plan for preservation of structures. In case of an application for repair or alteration affecting the exterior appearance of a structure or for moving or demolition of a structure which the commission deems so valuable to the city, state or nation that the loss thereof will adversely affect the public purpose of the city, state or nation, the commission shall endeavor to work out with the owner an economically feasible plan for preservation of the structure.

ARTICLE VII. - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 

Sec. 17-101. - Noise. 
(a)  General requirements. No operation or activity shall be carried on that causes or creates measurable noise levels that are unreasonably loud or that unreasonably interfere with the peace and comfort of others, or that exceed the maximum noise level limits prescribed in Table A below as measured at any point on property adjacent or in close proximity to the lot or parcel on which the operation or activity is located. 
(b)  Method and units of measurement. The measuring equipment and measurement procedures shall conform to the latest American National Standards Institute (ANSI) specifications. The sound measuring equipment shall be properly calibrated before and after the measurements. 
    Because sound waves having the same decibel (Db) level "sound" louder or softer to the human ear depending upon the frequency of the sound wave in cycles-per-second (that is, depending on whether the pitch of the sound is high or low) an A-weighted filter constructed in accordance with ANSI specifications shall be used on any sound level meter used to take measurements required in this section. All measurements below are expressed in Db(A) to reflect the use of the A-weighted filter. 
(c)  Table of maximum noise levels. Except as otherwise provided in this section, noise levels shall not exceed the limits set forth in the following Table A: 
TABLE A 
MAXIMUM PERMITTED NOISE LEVELS 
Use Time Sound Level 
(A-Weighted) 
Decibels 
Db(A) Residential (see uses included in RA, RP, RC, SP, MH districts) 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. 60 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. 55 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. 50 Business/Office (see uses included in OS, B, ES, P districts) 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. 65 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. 50 Industrial (see uses included in IRO, LI-1 districts), where all adjacent properties are used for industrial/business purposes Anytime 70 Industrial, where any adjacent properties are used for residential purposes Anytime 60  
(d)  Background noise. Where existing background noise exceeds the maximum permitted levels specified in Table A, the noise caused or created by a specific operation or activity may exceed the levels specified in the table, provided that the sound level on property adjacent or in close proximity to the lot or parcel on which the operation or activity is located does not exceed the background noise level. For purposes of this subsection, background noise shall mean noise being produced by permitted uses conducted in a legally-accepted manner from all sources other than those occurring on the lot or parcel on which the operation or activity is located. Background noise levels shall be determined by measurement at substantially the same time and location as the noise levels caused or created by the complained-of operation or activity. 
(e)  Intermittent or other unreasonable sounds. Intermittent sounds or sounds characterized by pure tones might be a source of complaints, even though the measured sound level does not exceed the permitted level in Table A. Such sounds shall be prohibited when found to be unreasonably loud or to unreasonably interfere with the peace and comfort of others. In making such determination, the following shall be considered: 
(1)  The proximity of the sound to sleeping facilities; 
(2)  The nature of the use from which the sound emanates and the area where it is received or perceived; 
(3)  The time (day or night) the sound occurs; and 
(4)  The duration of the sound. 
(f)  Special exception. An application for a special exception from the provisions of this section may be submitted to the zoning board of appeals, sitting as an administrative review board for purposes of this provision. The owner or operator of equipment on the property shall submit a statement regarding the effect of noise from the equipment on the overall noise level in the area. The statement shall also include a study of background noise levels, predicted levels of noise measured at the boundary line due to the proposed operation, and justification for the special exception. If it appears to the zoning board of appeals, in the course of its review of the applicant's application and statement, that the expertise of a sound engineer or other expert shall be necessary in order to review the application, the zoning board of appeals shall be authorized to obtain a reasonable escrow for consulting fees from the applicant and retain such expert for such purposes. Upon review of the request for a special exception, the zoning board of appeals may grant a special exception where such relief would be within the spirit and intent of this ordinance, would not adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare, and would not be materially injurious to surrounding properties and improvements. The zoning board of appeals may impose conditions of operation in granting a special exception. 
(g)  Exemptions. Noise resulting from the following activities shall be exempt from the maximum permitted sound levels provided such activity occurs in a legally-accepted manner: 
(1)  Construction activity (see section 18-164); 
(2)  Performance of emergency work, including snow removal; 
(3)  Warning devices necessary for public safety, such as police, fire, and ambulance sirens, tornado and civil defense warning devices, and train horns;

(2)  Fully shielded luminaire: A luminaire constructed and installed in such a manner that all light emitted by the luminaire, either directly from the lamp or a diffusing element, or indirectly by reflection or refraction from any part of the luminaire, is projected below the horizontal plane through the luminaire's lowest light-emitting part. 
(3)  Full cutoff fixture: A luminaire light distribution where zero candela intensity occurs at an angle of ninety (90) degrees above nadir and at all greater angles from nadir. Also, the candela per one thousand (1,000) lamp lumens does not exceed one hundred (100) (ten (10) percent) at a vertical angle of eighty (80) degrees above nadir. 
(4)  Glare: Lighting entering the eye directly from luminaires or indirectly from reflective surfaces that causes visual discomfort or reduced visibility. 
(5)  Hardscape: Permanent hardscape improvements to the site including parking lots, drives, entrances, curbs, ramps, stairs, steps, medians, walkways and non-vegetated landscaping that is ten (10) feet or less in width. Materials may include concrete, asphalt, stone, gravel, etc. 
(6)  Illuminance: A measure of how much light is arriving upon a surface, measured in footcandles (lumens per square foot) in the English system or lux (lumens per square meter) in the metric system. 
(7)  Lamp: A generic term for a source of optical radiation (i.e., "light"), often called a "bulb" or "tube." Examples include incandescent, fluorescent, high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps, and low pressure sodium (LPS) lamps, as well as light-emitting diode (LED) modules and arrays. 
(8)  Light trespass: Light that falls beyond the property it is intended to illuminate.

(12)  Nadir: The angle that points directly downward, or zero (0) degrees, from the luminaire. 
(13)  Skyglow: The brightening of the nighttime sky that results from scattering and reflection of artificial light by moisture and dust particles in the atmosphere. Skyglow is caused by light directed or reflected upwards or sideways and reduces one's ability to view the night sky. 
(14)  Temporary lighting: Lighting installed and operated for periods not to exceed sixty (60) days, completely removed and not operated again for at least thirty (30) days. 
(15)  Strip lighting. A device or devices installed that attract attention to a non-residential use wherein a source or sources of light are arranged to be visible from the exterior of a building or structure including, but not limited to, strips of LED lights or neon tubes placed along the perimeter of building windows, along building edges, and other locations that serve to attract attention to a non-residential use. This definition shall not include any device or devices classified as a sign by the definitions and regulations in the zoning ordinance. Temporary lights otherwise regulated by this section are also excluded from this definition. 
(b)  Lighting shall be permitted and regulated as follows: 
(1)  Exterior light under one thousand four hundred (1400) lumens. Exterior light sources with a lamp or lamps rated at a total of not more than one thousand four hundred (1400) lumens shall be permitted, except for flood or spotlights and illumination at building entrances, as permitted in the zoning ordinance (section 34-5.16.3).

ARTICLE IV. - NATURE PARKS 

Sec. 19-80. - Designation of Woodland Hills Park as nature park. 
    The seventy-eight (78) acres that comprise Woodland Hills Park are unique to the City of Farmington Hills. Not only do they contain a diverse mix of surface features and natural settings that are aesthetically pleasing, but also they provide much of the last remaining habitat for many unique wildlife species within the community. This community asset is worthy of unique care and preservation and is determined to have merited designation as a nature park. 
(Ord. No. C-5-97, § 1, 4-28-97) 
Sec. 19-81. - Management principles. 
    The land management principles to be followed in the care and preservation of the Woodland Hills Nature Park shall be as follows: 
(1)  Restrict encroachment into the site's critical habitat core to minimize impacts on unique wildlife and preserve existing natural processes. 
(2)  Articulate the park's environmental education opportunities. 
(3)  Establish long term habitat management strategies which promote its sensitive and dynamic ecology. 
(4)  Provide access through the site in such a manner as to enhance the visitor's appreciation of its natural setting which is distinct from other city parks.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. C-5-2010, § 1, adopted July 19, 2010 , amended Ch. 20 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 20, §§ 20-1-20-10, pertained to solicitors, and derived from Code 1981, §§ 51.110-51.190; Ord. of 9-17-1984, § 1; Ord. No. C-16-92, § 1, adopted 4-20-92 and Ord. No. C-15-97, § 1, adopted 8-18-97. 

Sec. 20-1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to help protect citizens and community members from fraudulent and unwanted harassment from peddlers and solicitors, and from peddlers and solicitors having criminal backgrounds who may pose a threat to persons or property, while also protecting the constitutional rights of peddlers and solicitors. Also, with respect to certain solicitors' constitutional right to free speech, it is the purpose and intent of the city to narrowly tailor the provisions of this chapter in such a way as to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens while at the same time not unduly burdening the right of such solicitors to engage in soliciting. To these ends the registration provisions of this chapter seek a minimal amount of basic information from solicitors that is tailored toward providing information that is necessary to protect against criminals entering onto the private property of residents and their families under false pretenses, to assist in the investigation of complaints if received, to deter at least some solicitors having a criminal or fraudulent intent from posing as solicitors in the city, and to provide a reasonable method of differentiating between solicitors and peddlers in the city. While it is acknowledged that some persons may still engage in fraudulent or criminal activities regardless or in disregard of the registration and licensing provisions of this chapter, such provisions will enable: 
(1)  Residents to identify nonregistered solicitors and unlicensed peddlers, and to thereby discern between those solicitors or peddlers that they wish to engage or not engage based on whether or not they have registered their information at the city or been licensed; 
(2)  Legitimate solicitors and peddlers to provide proof that they are registered or licensed with the city when engaging with residents; 
(3)  The city, peddlers and solicitors to benefit from a clear differentiation between peddlers and solicitors, which will assist in preventing unlicensed peddling; and 
(4)  Police officers to advise residents of safety precautions and undertakings in their dealings with solicitors and peddlers to help protect themselves from fraud or criminal activity (e.g., by asking for a copy of their registration form) as well as identify unregistered solicitors and unlicensed peddlers when complaints are received. 
    With respect to all of the foregoing, the Farmington Hills Police Department's Crime Prevention Advisory Committee adopted a resolution on April 7, 2010, identifying public safety concerns regarding unlicensed peddlers and solicitors and the need to enforce and control peddling and soliciting. Furthermore, a study conducted by the neighboring City of Farmington in 2008 and 2009 shows that the Farmington Public Safety Department issued seventy-five (75) tickets to unlicensed solicitors during that two-year period, and twenty-four (24) of those tickets were issued to persons who were arrested on outstanding warrants. Accordingly, it was found that roughly one-third ( 1/3 ) of all unlicensed and unregistered peddlers and solicitors have outstanding criminal warrants in the immediate vicinity of the City of Farmington Hills. Additionally, the city acknowledges that incidents of criminal and fraudulent activities in connection with door-to-door solicitation and peddling have been documented in court cases across the country, some of which have even been documented in writings of the United States Supreme Court (see, for example, Justice Rehnquist's dissent in Watchtower Bible and Tract Society v Village Of Stratton , 536 U.S. 150 AT 172-73, 122 S.CT. 2080, 153 L.ED.2D 205 (2002)). As such it is the intent and purpose of this chapter to establish a system of licensing and registering for the different types of peddlers and solicitors defined herein, and to establish certain regulations concerning the conduct of peddling and soliciting in the City of Farmington Hills, in order to prevent fraud, crime, undue and unwanted annoyance and harassment and to protect the peace, privacy, safety, health and welfare of the residents, businesses and persons in the city, while also respecting the constitutional rights of those involved in these activities.

    In accordance with Act No. 33 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 2008 (MCL 125.3801 et seq.), as amended, and section 3.11 of the charter, there is hereby established a planning commission to be designated the planning commission of the city. The planning commission existing in the city on the effective date of this Code shall be the city planning commission provided for herein and its members shall continue to serve, subject to the provisions of Act No. 33 of 2008, and this article. This article shall be officially known and described as the "City of Farmington Hills Planning Commission Ordinance." 
( Ord. No. C-6-2011, § 1, 6-13-11 ) 
Sec. 21-27. - Members; appointment, removal. 
(a)  The commission shall consist of nine (9) members appointed by the mayor with the approval of a majority of the city council elected and serving. To be qualified to be a member and remain a member of the commission, the individual shall be a qualified elector of City of Farmington Hills. 
(b)  The membership of the planning commission shall be representative of important segments of the community, such as the economic, governmental, educational, and social development of the city, in accordance with the major interests as they exist in the city, such as natural resources, recreation, education, public health, government, transportation, residential uses, industry, and commerce. The membership shall also be representative of the entire geography of the city to the extent practicable. 
(c)  Members shall be appointed for three-year terms and until their successors are appointed and qualified; provided, however, the initial appointments effective on or after June 30, 2011, shall occur in such a manner as to create three (3) sets of staggered appointments, with the initial term of the first set of three (3) members to be no more than one year, the second set of three (3) members to be no longer that two (2) years, and the third set of three (3) members to be no longer than three (3) years, such that, as nearly as possible, the terms of one-third ( 1/3 ) of all commission members will expire each year.

(b)  The established grade on all types of homes in the city shall be not more than twenty (20) inches above or below the sidewalk or crown of the road. Special cases, where natural topography has an adverse effect upon drainage and where this provision would serve no good purpose, must have special approval from the department of public services; such approval shall be conditioned upon a determination by the department of public services that the proposed grade will not be injurious to the adjacent properties.

In special cases, where natural topography or other unusual conditions of the land make adherence to this requirement impractical, special approval of slopes in excess of twelve (12) percent grade may be granted by the department of public services under such reasonable conditions as may be determined to ensure no adverse consequences to adjacent property or to the public safety. 
(Code 1981, § 20.325) 
Sec. 24-29. - Responsibility for maintaining grade. 
(a)  It shall be the responsibility of the building contractor to erect any home, building or structure in such a manner as to permit it to be graded in accordance with the requirements of section 24-27, and to construct and maintain such a grade until title to the property passes to another or until an occupancy permit is issued, whichever last occurs. Thereafter, the owner of such property shall maintain such grade or slope. 
(b)  The building contractor shall also be responsible for the structure thereon so that it is in accordance with the drainage plan that may have been established in any approved subdivision plat. If there is no drainage plan in the plat or none which will accomplish the requirement of this section, then the grading must be accomplished and maintained in such a manner so as not to obstruct, impede, accelerate, channel or concentrate the flow of rainwaters or surface waters onto or from the lands of another so as to cause damage thereto or create a nuisance thereon. The building contractor shall maintain such grade until title to the property passes to another or until an occupancy permit is issued, whichever last occurs. Thereafter, the owner of such property shall maintain such grade or slope. 
(c)  The building contractor shall be responsible for the adjustment of public utility structures, including, but not limited to, sanitary sewer and storm sewer manholes, watermain gate valves, fire hydrants, storm drain catch basins and cleanouts, located on the property upon which the structure is to be built or within the confines of his site grading or access in accordance with standards and specifications established by the department of public services.

The costs incurred by the city for any inspections that are necessary due to other violations requiring the city to construct, implement and maintain soil erosion and sedimentation controls on the property and for which the escrow is insufficient to cover, due to a failure to remit payment pursuant to this section, shall constitute a lien against the property for which the permit was issued, which lien shall have the force, effect and priority as provided under Section 9120 of Part 91. To the extent such an escrow exceeds the actual cost and expense of the inspections for the project, as ultimately determined, the excess shall be returned to the person or entity that posted the escrow.

(Code 1981, § 5.280) 
Sec. 25-21. - Insufficient assessments. 
    Should the assessments in any special assessment roll, including the amount assessed to the city at large, prove insufficient for any reason to pay the cost of the improvement for which they were made, then the council shall make additional assessments against the city and the several lots and parcels of land, in the same ratio as the original assessments, to supply the deficiency; but the total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement. 
(Code 1981, § 5.290) 
Sec. 25-22. - Excessive assessments. 
    The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than the actual cost of the improvement and expenses incidental thereto may be placed in the general fund of the city if such excess is five (5) percent or less of the assessment, but should the assessment prove larger than necessary by more than five (5) percent, the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro rata basis to the owners of the property assessed. No excess of less than five dollars ($5.00) shall be refunded in any event. Such refund shall be made by credit against future unpaid installments in the inverse order in which they are payable to the extent such installments then exist and the balance of such refund shall be in cash. No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured in whole or part by such special assessment. 
(Code 1981, § 5.300) 
Sec. 25-23. - Reassessments. 
    Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the council, be invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal, the council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment. Whenever the assessment, or any part thereof, levied upon any premises has been so set aside, if the same has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. 
(Code 1981, § 5.310) 
Sec. 25-24. - Collection of delinquent assessments by suit. 
    In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien therefor, any delinquent special assessment, together with interest and penalties, may be collected in an action in assumpsit in the nature of the city against the person assessed, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If in any such action it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant or upon the premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the city which is the proper charge against the defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such premises. 
(Code 1981, § 5.320) 
Sec. 25-25. - Assessment confirmation to precede project. 
    No public improvement to be financed in whole or in part by special assessment shall be made before the confirmation of the special assessment roll for such improvement.

Sec. 25-26. - Single lot assessments. 
    When any expense has been incurred by the city upon or in respect to any single premises, which expense is chargeable against the premises and the owner thereof under the provisions of this Code and is not of that class required to be prorated among the several lots and parcels of land in a special assessment district, an account of the labor, material and service for which such expense was incurred, with a description of the premises upon or in respect to which the expense was incurred, and the name of the owner, if known, shall be reported to the finance director/treasurer, who shall immediately charge and bill the owner, if known. The council shall, at such times as it may deem advisable direct the city assessor to prepare a special assessment roll covering all such charges reported to it together with a penalty of ten (10) percent. Such roll shall be filed with the city clerk who shall advise the council of the filing of the same, and the council shall set a date for the hearing of objections to such assessment roll. The assessment roll shall be open to public inspection for a period of seven (7) days before the council shall meet to review the roll and hear complaints. The city clerk shall give notice in advance by publication of the opening of the roll to public inspection and of the meeting of the council to hear complaints and shall also give like notice to the owners of the property affected by first class mail at their addresses as shown on the current general assessment roll of the city, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of such hearing.

(a)  Application-Nonrefundable fee. An application for an initial cable television franchise (not a franchise renewal) shall be submitted to SWOCC in accordance with the procedures established by SWOCC. The application will contain facts and information SWOCC deems appropriate. Applications shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) to the order of "SWOCC" which amount shall be used by SWOCC to offset direct expenses incurred in the franchising and evaluation procedures, including, but not limited to staff time and consulting assistance. 
(b)  Grantee to pay costs of granting. An applicant to whom the city grants an initial nonexclusive franchise, in addition to the nonrefundable fee specified hereinabove, shall pay to SWOCC, within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the amount, an amount set by SWOCC, which shall represent the remaining out-of-pocket costs incurred by SWOCC, in evaluating the franchise application and not defrayed by fees forthcoming from the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  Procedure required SWOCC to process an application and/or require a request for proposals: 
(1)  Upon receipt of an application, SWOCC may either: (i) evaluate the application pursuant to subsection (c)(4) below conducting such investigations as it deems necessary; or (ii) issue a request for proposals after conducting, if necessary, a proceeding to identify the future cable related needs and interests of the community. Any such request for proposals shall be provided to the person applying for an initial franchise and made available to any other interested party. The request for proposals may contain a proposed franchise agreement. 
(2)  An applicant shall respond to a request for proposals by filing an application within the time directed SWOCC that contains the information and material set forth in subsection (d) below. The procedures, instructions and requirements set forth in the request for proposals shall be followed by each applicant. Any applicant that has already filed an application need not refile the same materials with its response to the request for proposals, but must supplement its application to include any additional or different information or material required of the request for proposals. SWOCC may seek additional information from any applicant and establish deadlines for the submission of such information. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), a person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting an unsolicited application containing the information required in subsection (d), and requesting an evaluation of that application pursuant to subsection (c)(4). Prior to evaluating such an application, SWOCC may conduct such investigations as are necessary to determine whether the application satisfies the standards set forth in subsection (c)(4). SWOCC may seek additional applications. 
(4)  In evaluating an application for a franchise, SWOCC shall consider, among other things, the following factors: 
1.  Whether an applicant has the financial, technical, and legal qualifications to provide cable service; 
2.  Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established by SWOCC and is otherwise reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests; 
3.  Whether, to the extent not considered under subsection (c)(2) above, an applicant will provide adequate public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or financial support; 
4.  Whether issuance of a franchise is in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way and private property that would be affected by the cable system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the public rights-of-way; the effect of granting a franchise on the ability of the existing franchisee, if any, to meet the cable related needs and interests of the community; and the comparative superiority or inferiority of competing applications; and 
5.  What effects a grant of a franchise may have on competition in the delivery of cable service in the city. 
6.  Public comment received at not less than one public hearing conducted after at least ten (10) days published notice and any written comments received following submission of the application. 
Upon completion of its evaluation, SWOCC shall issue a report to the city council containing its recommendation for approval, denial or no recommendation on the matter. The city shall file the report with its clerk for public review and comment prior to the public hearing upon the application. If council determines to issue a franchise, it shall be by ordinance enacted as required by City Charter. If council denies an application, it shall do so by written resolution setting forth its reasons for the denial. This article is not intended, and shall not be interpreted to grant any applicant standing to challenge the denial of its application or the issuance of a franchise to another. 
(d)  Application. Ten (10) copies of the application shall be filed with the SWOCC and shall contain such information as SWOCC may require, including, but not limited to:

(7)  An estimated five-year operations proforma which shall include the initial and continuing plant investment, annual profit and loss statements detailing income and expenses, annual balance sheets, and annual levels of subscriber penetration. The proforma shall also state the average return on investment anticipated by an applicant for the five-year operations period and shall state the method of computation thereof. Costs anticipated for voluntary services or contributions shall, if presented, be incorporated in the proforma as required in this article, but shall be separately identified in the proforma; 
(8)  A list of existing franchises held by an applicant indicating when the franchises were issued and when the systems were constructed in each respective governmental unit, together with the name and address and phone number of a responsible governmental official knowledgeable of an applicant; 
(9)  A statement detailing an applicant's prior operational experience in cable television systems and/or microwave service, including that of its officers, management and any staff to be associated with the proposed operation; 
(10)  A general statement of an applicant's ability and intent to incorporate technological improvements and advancements in the cable television system as such improvements or advancements are generally available in the industry; and 
(11)  Any other reasonable and applicable information which SWOCC may request. 
(12)  A demonstration of an applicant's technical ability to construct and/or operate the proposed cable system, including identification of key personnel and their qualifications.

(f)  An applicant shall not have filed materially misleading information in its application or have intentionally withheld information that an applicant lawfully is required to provide; and 
(g)  An elected official of SWOCC or the city shall not hold a controlling interest in an applicant or an affiliate of an applicant. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, SWOCC shall provide an opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by an applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of an applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of its cable systems. 
(14)  Identification of the area of the city to be served by the proposed cable system, including a description of the proposed franchise area's boundaries; 
(15)  If an applicant proposes to provide cable service to an area already served by an existing franchisee, the identification of the area where the overbuild would occur and the ability of the public rights-of-way and other property that would be used by an applicant to accommodate an additional cable system; and 
(16)  An affidavit or declaration of an authorized officer of an applicant certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, acknowledging the enforceability of application commitments, and certifying that the application meets all federal and state law requirements. 
(e)  Request for proposals, public comment periods, evaluating applications, public hearing. Upon filing, any franchise application and related documents are public records open to inspection by the public during reasonable hours, including specifically the regular business hours of SWOCC and the city clerk. 
    Before issuance of a request for proposals, SWOCC shall maintain the proposed request for proposals on the agenda of at least two (2) SWOCC meetings for the purpose of determining any special local needs or interest. Any citizen shall have the right to comment in writing, filed in advance, or orally at any meeting at which the proposed request for proposals is to be considered. 
    Following reasonable notice to the public, any franchise application shall be available for inspection for a period of at least twenty (20) days prior to the city council taking action on the same. Any citizen shall have the right to comment in writing, filed in advance, or orally at any meeting at which the franchise applications are to be considered. 
    Before authorizing the issuance of any such franchise, the city council shall review an applicant's legal, financial and technical qualifications and the adequacy and feasibility of an applicant's qualifications to operate a cable television system within the city based upon information provided to the city council by an applicant and by other sources in writing or at any public hearing or meeting of the city council and shall conduct a public hearing thereon with at least seven days advertised notice prior to said public hearing. 
(f)  Awarding a franchise. After examining all applications submitted pursuant to procedures to be established by the city council designed to assure the legal, financial and technical qualifications of an applicant to provide cable service, the council is authorized, after a full hearing affording due process, to grant a nonexclusive franchise conveying the right to construct and operate a cable system within the public ways of the city. A franchise may be awarded to an applicant which in the council's judgment will best serve the public interest and whose construction and financial plans and arrangements are both feasible and adequate to fulfill the conditions set forth in this article and incorporated into any franchise granted. 
    No provision in this article shall be deemed or construed to require the council to grant a franchise following receipt of any franchise application. 
(g)  Franchise term. The term of a franchise shall be for the number of years negotiated in the franchise agreement with the city unless terminated earlier in accordance with this article. 
(h)  Franchise fees. A grantee shall pay city five (5) percent of gross revenue as a franchise fee. 
    The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly to the city. A grantee shall file a complete, accurate, and verified statement listing each and every type of revenue included in the gross revenue collected as a result of providing cable service within the city during the period for which said quarterly payment is made. Such statement and payment shall be made to the city treasurer not later than sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar quarter. 
    SWOCC may examine all applicable records of a grantee to determine accuracy of amounts payable to city. 
    SWOCC shall have the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this article; provided, however, that such audit shall take place within thirty-six (36) months following the close of each of a grantee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to a grantee by SWOCC, said notice shall include a copy of the audit report. In the event the additional amount due to the city as a result of the audit exceeds five (5) percent of the annual gross revenue, a grantee shall pay the expense of the audit as well. 
    In the event that any franchise fee payment or recomputed amounts or audit expense is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, and following notice by the city to a grantee, interest shall be charged daily from such date at the annual rate equivalent to the then existing prime rate of the largest bank in the city plus two (2) percent. 
(i)  Grantee to be bound by terms and conditions of cable ordinance and franchise agreement; procedure if conflict. No franchise shall be valid until a grantee enters into a franchise agreement having terms and conditions acceptable to the city. 
    In the event of a conflict between the franchise agreement and the provisions of this article the provisions of this article shall prevail. Failure to provide services as agreed in a grantee's franchise shall be deemed a breach of this article.

(1)  Exclusions. For the purpose of this section, "transfer" and "transferred" shall not include: (a) a transfer solely for security purposes (such as the grant of a mortgage or security interest) but shall include any realization on the security by the recipient, such as a foreclosure on a mortgage or security interest; or (b) the replacement of components of the cable system in the course of ordinary maintenance and day-to-day operation. 
(2)  Exception. A grantee may, without additional approval by city, transfer or assign the franchise to an entity controlled and at least fifty (50) percent owned by a grantee, where the new entity: assumes all of a grantee's cable services operations and obligations in the Southeast Michigan area (Wayne, Oakland, Macomb and Washtenaw counties); assumes all of franchisee's obligations and liabilities under this franchise, agrees to comply with all provisions of this franchise and cable ordinance and becomes a signatory to the franchise; has the legal, managerial, technical and financial ability to properly perform and discharge such obligations and liabilities, and such abilities are each at least as great as those of a grantee. The city shall be advised in writing of such transfer and of the new entity's qualifications at least sixty (60) days before such transfer occurs. 
(b)  Transfer of ownership or control. There shall be no transfer of or acquisition of control of a grantee or of any entity, at any tier or level, which directly or indirectly controls franchisee without the prior written consent of municipality. 
    For the purposes of this article, "...transfer of or acquisition of control of a grantee..." shall mean any change in the identity of the entities, individuals or group which directs, or has the power to direct, the management and policies of a grantee, whether through the ownership of voting securities or other equity interest, by contract or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the purposes hereof, such a change shall be deemed to have occurred at any point in time when there is (a) a change in working or effective voting control, in whatever manner effectuated, of a grantee; (b) an agreement of the holders of voting stock or rights of a grantee which effectively vests or assigns policy decision-making in any person or entity other than a grantee; or (c) a sale, assignment or transfer of any shares or interest in a grantee which results in a change in the control of a grantee. 
(c)  Applications for consent/procedure. If a grantee seeks to obtain the consent of city to any transactions or matters described in this section, a grantee shall submit an application for such consent to city and shall submit or cause to be submitted to city such additional documents and information as city may reasonably request. 
(1)  City shall have one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of submission of an application (such as a FCC Form 394) to act upon any such application for consent. If city fails to act upon such application for consent within one hundred twenty (120) days, such application shall be deemed to have received consent unless the city and a grantee otherwise agree to an extension of time. 
(2)  City shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to any proposed transfer, and may grant its consent outright, may grant such consent with reasonable conditions that it finds are in the public interest, or may deny consent but may not use the transfer to renegotiate the franchise. 
(3)  Nothing in any approval by city of an authorization of any transfer shall be construed to waive or release any rights of city in and to the streets, public rights-of-way, and public places of city, or as a release of any of city's police powers, or as an exercise of eminent domain. 
(4)  City's granting of consent in any one instance shall not require it to grant consent in other instances. 
(Ord. No. C-17-00, § 1, 12-18-00)

A grantee shall save SWOCC and the city and its agents and employees harmless from and against all claims, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable actual attorney's fees sustained by SWOCC and/or the city on account of any suit, judgment, execution, claim or demand whatsoever arising out of, but not limited to, copyright infringements and all other damages arising out of the installation, operation, maintenance, or reconstruction of the cable television system authorized herein; provided, however this indemnification shall not extend to public, educational or governmental programming over which a grantee has no editorial control, including utilization of any I-net or EAS. 
(b)  Reimbursement of costs. A grantee shall pay all expenses incurred by SWOCC and/or the city defending itself with regard to all damages and penalties mentioned in paragraph (a) above. 
(c)  Conditions. In order for the city to assert its rights to be indemnified, defended and held harmless, the city shall: 
(i)  Promptly notify a grantee of any claim or legal proceeding which gives rise to such right; 
(ii)  Afford a grantee opportunity to fully control the defense to any such claim or proceeding including, but not limited to, the right to employ counsel and to settle or otherwise compromise any claim or proceeding; 
(iii)  Fully cooperate with the reasonable requests of a grantee in its any settlement or compromise; and 
(iv)  Act reasonably under all circumstances so as to protect a grantee against any liability and refrain from compromising any of a grantee's rights. 
(d)  Public liability insurance. A grantee shall maintain throughout the term of the franchise or any renewal or extension thereof, a general comprehensive liability insurance policy in a company authorized to do business in the State of Michigan naming as the additional insured SWOCC and the city, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees, protecting SWOCC and the city and all persons against liability for loss or damage for personal injury, death or property damage, occasioned by the operations of a grantee under any franchise granted hereinafter, in the amounts of (i) five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) for bodily injury or death to any one person, within the limit, however, of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death resulting from any one accident, (ii) two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) for property damage resulting from any one accident, and (iii) workers compensation insurance in compliance with all workers compensation insurance and safety laws of the State of Michigan, and amendments thereto.

(f)  Evidence of insurance filed with SWOCC and the city. All certificates of insurance evidencing the required coverage and written evidence of payment of required premiums, shall be filed and maintained with SWOCC and the city during the term of this franchise or any renewal thereof. 
(g)  No waiver of insurance, construction bond or letter of credit. Recovery by SWOCC or the city of any amounts under insurance, the construction bond or letter of credit, or otherwise does not limit a grantee's duty to indemnify SWOCC and the city in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a grantee of its obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts owed to SWOCC and/or the city, or in any respect prevent SWOCC and/or the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have. 
(h)  Construction bond. Prior to any significant cable system construction, reconstruction, upgrade, or other significant work in the public rights-of-way, not to include line extensions, a grantee shall establish in the city's favor a performance bond in an amount specified in a franchise agreement or other authorization as necessary to ensure a grantee's faithful performance of the construction, upgrade, or other work. 
    In the event a grantee subject to such a performance bond fails to complete the cable system construction, upgrade, or other work in the public rights-of-way in a safe, timely, and competent manner in accord with the provisions of a franchise agreement, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of a grantee, or the cost of completing or repairing the cable system construction, upgrade, or other work in the public rights-of-way, plus a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees, up to the full amount of the bond. The city may also recover against the bond any amount recoverable against the letter of credit where such amount exceeds that available under the letter of credit. 
    Upon completion of the cable system construction, upgrade, or other work in the public rights-of-way and payment of all construction obligations of the cable system to the good faith satisfaction of the city, the city shall eliminate the bond or reduce its amount after a time appropriate to determine whether the work performed was satisfactory, which time shall be established considering the nature of the work performed. The city may subsequently require a new bond or an increase in the bond amount for any subsequent construction, upgrade, or other work in the public rights-of-way. 
    The performance bond shall be issued by a surety with an A-1 or better rating of insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition and shall be subject the approval of the city. 
    The construction bond shall contain the following endorsement: 
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until sixty (60) days after receipt by the city, by registered mail, of written notice of such intent to cancel or not to renew."

(a)  Map and plan to be provided. A grantee shall submit an initial construction or reconstruction plan not less than ninety (90) days prior to the date a grantee intends to commence initial construction or reconstruction of the cable system (not line extensions), and that plan shall be incorporated by reference and made a part of a grantee's franchise agreement. The plan shall include cable system design details, equipment specifications and design performance criteria. The plan shall also include a map of the entire franchise area and shall clearly delineate the following: 
(1)  Areas within the franchise area where the cable system will be available to subscribers, including a time schedule of construction or reconstruction for each year that construction or reconstruction is proposed; and 
(2)  Areas within the franchise area where the cable system cannot reasonably be extended due to lack of present or planned development or other similar reasons, with the areas and the reasons for not serving them clearly identified on the map. 
(b)  Delay in system construction or reconstruction requires consent by city council. Any delay in the cable system initial construction or reconstruction beyond the times specified in the plan shall require application to SWOCC and consent of the city council after receiving recommendation from SWOCC. Any delay beyond the initial construction or reconstruction timetable set forth in the plan, unless approved by the city council, will be considered a violation of the franchise. However, nothing in this section shall prevent a grantee from constructing or reconstructing the cable system earlier than planned. 
(c)  System construction and operation to be consistent with city requirements; SWOCC to observe annual proof of performance tests; SWOCC may conduct independent tests at cost of a grantee. A grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system in a manner such that it operates at all times consistent with all laws, ordinances, and construction standards of the city; the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission. In addition, a grantee shall, upon request, provide SWOCC with the opportunity to observe the conduct of, and receive a written report of the results of, its annual proof of performance tests. SWOCC may at any time conduct independent tests and/or measurements of the system.

    A grantee shall maintain equipment capable of providing standby power to be engaged automatically in the event of a power failure for twenty-four (24) hours at all headend, and tower systems and for a minimum of two (2) hours at all trunk and distribution amplifiers, or fiber optic nodes. 
(e)  Access to grantee's trenches by other utilities. A grantee shall cooperate in the planning, locating and construction of its cable system in utility joint trenches or common duct banks with other franchisees and/or utilities and/or telecommunication providers.

A grantee and the city will offer to make space available to the other, and to other persons who participate in joint trenching, on reasonable terms and conditions. 
(f)  If city determines any part of facilities are harmful to health and safety of any person, grantee shall promptly correct. If, at any time, it is determined by SWOCC or the city or any other agency or authority of competent jurisdiction, in their good faith judgment, that any part of the cable system is endangering the public, including without limitation missing vault or pedestal covers, temporary drop cables that cross walkways, driveways or other areas, and low cables, riser problems and other violations of state or local laws that are harmful to the health or safety of any person, then a grantee shall correct all such conditions, at its own costs and expense, within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of notice from SWOCC or the city or any other agency or authority of competent jurisdiction absent a force majeure condition. Until such conditions are corrected, a grantee shall post suitable warnings to ensure that the health and safety of persons possibly affected is safeguarded. 
(g)  Grantee to take all necessary steps to prevent accidents.

(b)  All grantee's facilities to be installed only at locations approved by city. Any poles, wires, cable lines, conduits or other properties of a grantee to be constructed or installed in streets shall be so constructed or installed only at such locations and in such manner as shall be approved by the city in the exercise of its reasonable discretion.

Permits will be issued to a grantee or its contractors only on approved plans, which plans must be submitted concurrently with or prior to the request for the construction permit. All work will be done in accordance with the city's specifications and must comply with all applicable law. Provided, however, in the event of emergency conditions where a grantee may not reasonably secure permits prior to conducting such work, permits shall be applied for as soon as possible after commencement of the work. Permits will be reviewed in a timely manner and will not be unreasonably withheld. Permitting fees shall be, consistent with state law, no greater than necessary to recoup the city's reasonable expenses of review and issuance of the permit. 
(e)  Grantee to file maps of entire system prior to issuance of permit for construction or reconstruction; maps also to be filed with affected utility companies; maps to be updated. A grantee shall cause maps of the entire cable system showing materials of construction, and locations to be filed in the office of the city prior to the issuance of a permit for construction or rebuild of the system.

(f)  Upon undergrounding of utility lines grantee to concurrently place lines underground in conduits at depth approved by public works director. Trunk, feeder and drop cable may be constructed overhead where poles now exist and electrical or telephone lines or both are now overhead, but where electrical and telephone lines are now underground, all trunk, feeder and drop cable shall be constructed underground at such depths and locations as shall be approved by the city consistent with national standards. Whenever and wherever electrical lines and telephone lines are moved from overhead to underground placement in an area, all cable system facilities and plants in that area shall be similarly and concurrently moved underground by a grantee at its sole cost and expense at such depths and locations as shall be approved by the city. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event any utility is compensated by the city for moving or relocating its facilities in a specific case, then, in such case only, a grantee shall be similarly compensated. 
(g)  Grantee may be required to move its facilities to accommodate changes in public improvements. A grantee shall from time to time protect, support, temporarily dislocate, or temporarily or permanently, as may be required, remove or relocate, without expense to the city or any other governmental entity, any facilities installed, used, or maintained under a franchise, if and when made necessary by any lawful change of grade, alignment, or width of any public street by the city or any other governmental entity, or made necessary by any other public improvement or alteration in, under, on, upon or about any public street or other public property, whether such public improvement or alteration is at the instance of the city or another governmental entity, and whether such improvement or alteration is for a governmental or proprietary function, or made necessary by traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation or any other public project or purpose of the city or any other governmental entity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event any utility is compensated by the city for moving or relocating its facilities in a specific case, then, in such case only, a grantee shall be similarly compensated. 
(h)  Grantee shall obtain prior approval before altering any municipal facility; alterations to be at cost of grantee.

A grantee shall be given not less then seven days notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
(j)  Grantee shall repair and restore damage to city facilities and shall maintain restoration.

(k)  Failure by grantee to complete required work in any street can result in city causing work to be done at expense of grantee. Upon failure of a grantee to complete any work required by law, or by the provisions of a franchise, to be done in any street or other public place, within ten (10) days following due notice, the city may, at its option, cause such work to be done and a grantee shall pay to the city the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the city to a grantee within ten (10) days after receipt of such itemized report. Or at city's option, city may demand of a grantee the estimated cost of such work as estimated by the city, and such shall be paid by a grantee to city within ten (10) days of such demand; upon award of any contract or contracts for such work, a grantee shall pay to city within ten (10) days of demand any additional amount necessary to provide for cost of such work.

City shall not be obligated to restore cable service or to pay the costs of expenses of restoring cable service. 
(m)  Tree trimming. A grantee shall notify the city regarding the need to substantially trim trees upon and overhanging streets of the city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of a grantee. Such trimming shall be limited to the area required for clear cable passage and shall not include major structural branches which materially alter the appearance and natural growth habits of the tree. A grantee shall be responsible for any and all damages to any tree as a result of trimming, or to the land surrounding any tree, whether such tree is trimmed or removed, or for damage to property or person caused by such trimming and removal of any tree. 
(n)  Grantee shall remove system from any public street following termination or expiration of franchise. In the event that the use of a part of the cable system is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, or in the event such cable system or property has been installed in any street or public place without complying with the requirements of the franchise, or the franchise has been terminated, canceled or has been denied renewal, a grantee shall promptly, at its own expense, and upon being given ten (10) days' notice from the public works director, remove from the streets or public places all such property and poles of such cable system other than any which the public works director may permit to be abandoned in place. In the event of such removal, a grantee shall promptly restore the street or other area from which such property has been removed to a condition the same as it existed before such works commenced. 
(o)  Grantee's property may be considered abandoned 180 days after termination or expiration of franchise. Any property of a grantee remaining in place one hundred eighty (180) days after the termination or denial of renewal of a franchise shall be, at the option of the city council, considered permanently abandoned. The public works director may extend such time not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days. 
(p)  Abandonment in place shall be done at direction of department of public works: ownership of property shall be transferred to city. Any property of a grantee permitted to be abandoned in place shall be abandoned in such a manner as the department of public works shall prescribe. Upon permanent abandonment of the property of a grantee in place, it shall submit to the city an instrument in writing, to be approved by the city attorney, transferring to the city the ownership of such property. If such an instrument is not received within thirty (30) days of the abandonment, the property shall automatically become that of the city.

  The "appointment window" alternatives for installations, service calls, and other installation activities will be either a specific time or, at maximum, a four-hour time block during normal business hours. (A grantee may schedule service calls and other installation activities outside of normal business hours for the express convenience of the customer.)

    Billing Procedures shall be as follows: 
1.1  Except as permitted by applicable law, a grantee shall bill all subscribers in a uniform, nondiscriminatory manner, regardless of subscriber's level of service. A grantee may, however, conduct promotional campaigns in which rates are discounted or waived, and may offer bulk rate discounts for multiple unit dwellings, hotels, motels, and similar institutions or may reduce such charges for competitive purposes. In no case shall any subscriber be required to pay for services in excess of thirty (30) days prior to receipt of such service. No administrative fee (fee for processing of delinquent accounts) shall be imposed for the first twenty (20) days from date of billing. 
1.2  Except as permitted by applicable law, a grantee shall not make a monthly charge for multiple cable outlets (in the same living unit) over and above the one initial outlet provided a subscriber upon receipt of cable service. The initial installation cost of multiple cable outlets shall be paid as part of the cost of initial installation charges. 
1.3  A grantee shall provide all subscribers with an itemized monthly bill that contains, at a minimum, the following information: 
a.  A list of each service or package received for that billing period showing individual charges for the "basic service" tier, satellite tier, each pay per view usage, each pay TV channel, and each remote control or other devices, etc.

c.  The total charges due for the monthly period, separate from any previous balance due; 
d.  A specific date by which payment is required; and

1.4  A subscriber's first billing statement after a new installation or service change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security deposit. 
(c)  Disconnection and termination of cable services: 
(1)  Subscriber termination of cable service. A subscriber may terminate cable service at any time without penalty, unless the subscriber has voluntarily committed to a promotional contract guaranteeing a minimum subscription period. 
(2)  Grantee disconnection of subscriber cable service. A grantee shall only disconnect or terminate a subscriber's cable for good and just cause. In no event shall a grantee disconnect said cable service for nonpayment without the prior written notification to the affected subscriber at least ten (10) business days prior to such disconnection or termination. In no event shall such disconnection or termination for nonpayment occur in less than thirty (30) days after a subscriber's failure to pay a bill due. Such notice shall state the date by which disconnection may occur. Where a grantee has improperly discontinued cable system service to any such subscriber, it shall provide free reconnection to the cable system to such subscriber, within twenty-four (24) hours of being notified by subscriber. 
(Ord. No. C-17-00, § 1, 12-18-00)

    The statement shall be certified as being correct by a responsible officer of a grantee and there shall be submitted along with it such other reasonable information as SWOCC shall request. 
(b)  Quarterly reports on system performance required. A grantee shall submit to SWOCC, on a quarterly basis, within thirty (30) days following March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year, throughout the term of an agreement, a reasonable, statistical summary of the operations of the system. Such information shall include, but not be limited to: the number of dwelling units passed; the number of basic service subscribers; penetration rates for basic and expanded basic service; the number of cable plant miles in construction or completed; a summary of subscriber complaints by type of complaint, showing compliance data, a summary of system outages and "down time", number of telephone calls from subscriber, telephone call response time, and delayed and abandoned calls; and a summary of service calls made during the previous quarter.

(Ord. No. C-17-00, § 1, 12-18-00) 
Sec. 29.5-32. - Rate regulation. 
(a)  City reserves right to regulate rates. The city reserves the right to regulate a grantee's rates for cable service to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 
(b)  Current rate schedule to be filed with city; thirty days' notice required prior to rate change. A grantee, for information purposes, and for the city to ensure nondiscrimination, shall provide SWOCC and the city with a complete schedule of all current basic service and enhanced service rates and charges, including pay TV and pay per view rates and charges, and shall give thirty (30) days prior notice from the date of mailing to SWOCC and to all affected subscribers of any pricing changes or additional charges, excluding temporary marketing and sales discounts or offers. 
(c)  Grantee to furnish service to each person in franchise area making request for service. A grantee shall furnish and maintain cable service to each person within the franchise area who makes a bona fide request to receive such service that is based upon the requirements of this article subject to line extension policy set forth in its franchise agreement. Nothing in a franchise agreement shall limit the right of a grantee to deny service to any person which has a negative credit or service history with a grantee, which may include nonpayment of bills or theft or damage to a grantee's equipment, or who has threatened or assaulted employees of a grantee in the course of their employment. Provided that in the event service is denied, a grantee will give written notice to the person requesting service of his or her right to appeal to the city a grantee's decision to deny service, and of the city's authority to reverse a grantee's decision in instances where a grantee has acted unreasonably. 
(d)  City adopts rate regulation procedures consistent with FCC rules.

    SWOCC and the city adopt by reference procedures set forth in 47 CFR section 0.459 regarding confidential business information submitted by a grantee in a rate regulation proceeding. 
    The city delegates to the Southwestern Oakland Cable Commission all of its authority to administer the regulation of cable television rates under this article subject to all provisions of the Multi-Jurisdictional Cable Television Franchise Administration Agreement. 
(Ord. No. C-17-00, § 1, 12-18-00) 
Sec. 29.5-33. - Letter of credit. 
(a)  Grantee required to file an irrevocable letter of credit. Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of a franchise, a grantee shall deposit with SWOCC an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount set forth in the franchise agreement and issued by a federally insured commercial lending institution. The form and substance of said letter of credit shall be subject to the approval by SWOCC's attorney. The letter of credit shall be used to assure: the faithful performance by a grantee of all provisions of the franchise agreement and the cable ordinance; compliance with all orders, permits and directions of SWOCC or any agency, commission, board, department, division or office of the city having jurisdiction over any aspect of a grantee's performance under a franchise and this article; and the payment by a grantee of any penalties, liquidated damages, claims, liens, franchise fees, taxes or other fees due to the city which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system, including cost of removal of any property of a grantee. 
(b)  Letter of credit may be drawn upon by SWOCC after following specified procedure that assures due process to grantee. The letter of credit may be drawn upon by SWOCC by presentation of a draft at sight on the lending institution, accompanied by a written certificate signed by the executive director of SWOCC certifying that a grantee has failed to comply with the franchise agreement and/or this article, stating the nature of the noncompliance, and stating the amount being drawn. Examples of the nature of the noncompliance for drawing upon the letter of credit include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Failure of a grantee to pay to the city and/or SWOCC any franchise fees, taxes, liens or other fees; 
(2)  Failure of a grantee to pay to the city and/or SWOCC any amounts due and owing by reason of the indemnity provisions of this article; 
(3)  Failure of a grantee to pay to the city and/or SWOCC any liquidated damages due and owing pursuant to a franchise agreement; 
(4)  Failure to make any payment required by an agreement within the time fixed therein; 
(5)  Failure to pay to the city and/or SWOCC any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the city and/or SWOCC has been compelled to pay or incur by the reason of any material act or default by a grantee; 
(6)  Failure to comply with any material provisions of an agreement or cable ordinance which SWOCC reasonably determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount from the letter or other instrument. 
In the event of such noncompliance, SWOCC may order the withdrawal of the appropriate amount of liquidated damages, penalties, fees or otherwise from the letter or other instrument for payment to SWOCC, provided that, prior to each such withdrawal; (i) a grantee shall be afforded an opportunity to cure any of said failures within thirty (30) days after written notice from SWOCC that the withdrawal is to be made; or (ii) if such cure cannot be reasonably accomplished within such thirty (30) days, then a grantee shall have a reasonable time to cure, provided that a grantee commences such cure within such thirty (30) days and diligently pursues such cure to completion. 
(c)  Letter of credit shall be replenished to original amount following any draw down. A grantee shall structure the letter of credit in such a manner so that if SWOCC at any time draws upon the letter of credit, the amount of available credit shall automatically increase to the extent necessary to replenish that portion of the available credit exhausted by the honoring of the SWOCC draft. The intent of this subsection is to make available to SWOCC at all times a letter of credit in the amount specified in the franchise agreement. 
(d)  SWOCC's and the city's rights with respect to letter of credit are in addition to other rights. The rights reserved to SWOCC and the city with respect to the letter of credit are in addition to all other rights of SWOCC and the city, whether reserved by a franchise agreement or authorized by law, and no action or proceeding against a letter of credit shall affect any other right SWOCC and the city may have. 
(Ord. No. C-17-00, § 1, 12-18-00) 
Sec. 29.5-34. - Liquidated damages. 
(a)  Parties shall agree to specific liquidated damages to be paid by grantee for certain delays or nonperformance. A grantee's failure to comply with any timing or performance requirements set forth in a franchise agreement will result in damage to the city, the amount of which will be impracticable to ascertain. Therefore, the city and a grantee will negotiate the amount of liquidated damages to be set forth in a franchise agreement. Every franchise agreement shall provide that the city's recovery of such damages shall be without prejudice to any other remedy the city may have. 
(b)  Procedures established to assure grantee of due process and opportunity to cure problem before damages assessed. If SWOCC's executive director, following prior reasonable notice to a grantee to cure any problem that might result in liquidated damages, concludes that a grantee is liable for liquidated damages pursuant to the franchise agreement, he/she shall issue to a grantee by certified mail a notice of intention to assess liquidated damages. The notice shall set forth the basis of the assessment, and shall inform a grantee that liquidated damages will be assessed from the date of the notice unless the assessment notice is appealed for hearing before the SWOCC commissioners and the commission rules (a) that the violation has been corrected, or (b) that an extension of the time or other relief should be granted. If a grantee desires a hearing before the commission, it shall send a written notice of appeal by certified mail to the executive director within ten (10) days of the date on which SWOCC sent the notice of intention to assess liquidated damages. After the hearing, if the commission sustains in whole or in part the executive director's assessment of liquidated damages, the executive director may at any time thereafter draw upon the letter of credit required by section 29.5-33. Unless the commission indicates to the contrary, said liquidated damages shall be assessed beginning with the date on which the executive director sent the notice of intention to assess liquidated damages and continuing thereafter until such time as the violation ceases, as determined by the executive director. 
(Ord. No. C-17-00, § 1, 12-18-00) 
Sec. 29.5-35. - Forfeiture and termination. 
(a)  Franchise may be terminated for material breach of terms and conditions examples given. In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the city, the city reserves the right to terminate a franchise and all rights and privileges of a grantee in the event of a material breach of this article or a franchise agreement. A material breach by a grantee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Violation of any material provision of the cable ordinance or franchise agreement or any material rule, order, regulation or determination of SWOCC and/or the city made pursuant to a franchise; 
(2)  Attempt to evade any material provision of the cable ordinance or a franchise or practice any fraud or deceit upon SWOCC and/or the city or the subscribers of the cable system; 
(3)  Failure to begin or complete cable system construction, reconstruction or cable system extension as provided under a franchise agreement; 
(4)  Failure to maintain insurance, bonds and letters of credit required by SWOCC and/or the city; 
(5)  Failure to restore cable service after forty-eight (48) consecutive hours of interrupted cable service, except when there is just cause or when approval of such interruption is obtained from SWOCC.

(10)  Repeated imposition of any fee, charge, deposit, or associated term or condition, for any service which is not consistent with the provisions of an agreement, or of which there has repeatedly and unjustifiably been no notification to the SWOCC; 
(11)  Substantial and repeated failure to comply with the consumer service standards and requirements set forth in the cable ordinance and agreement; 
(12)  The taking of any material action which requires the approval or consent of SWOCC and/or the city without having first obtained said approval or consent; 
(13)  Any material misrepresentation, made by or on behalf of a grantee in its proposal to obtain a franchise, or in connection with the negotiation or renegotiation of, or any amendment or other modification to a franchise agreement, to the extent that any such misrepresentation was relied upon by SWOCC and/or the city; 
(14)  There is made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or an appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of a grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless the conditions set forth in subsections 29.5-35(f)(1) and (2) are fulfilled. 
(b)  Procedures outlined leading to possible termination of franchise. SWOCC may make a written demand that a grantee comply with any provision, rule, order or determination under or pursuant to the cable ordinance or a franchise agreement. If the violation breach, failure, refusal or neglect by a grantee continues for a period of thirty (30) days following such written demand without written proof that the corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the SWOCC executive director may place the issue of termination of a franchise before the commission and, upon recommendation of the commission, to the city council. The SWOCC executive director shall cause to be served upon a grantee, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of such commission meeting, a written notice of intent to request such termination and the time and place of the meeting. Public notice shall be given of the meeting and the issue which the commission is to consider. If the commission determines that it will recommend termination of the franchise to the city council, an additional notice shall be served upon a grantee at least twenty (20) days prior to the scheduled city council meeting. Public notice shall also be given for the council meeting along with a description of the issues which the city council will be considering. 
(c)  City council shall hear and consider issues and determine if a violation has occurred. The city council shall hear and consider the issue and shall hear any person interested therein, and shall determine, whether or not any violation by a grantee has occurred. 
(d)  City council may declare franchise terminated if compliance does not occur within specified period. If the city council shall determine the violation by a grantee was the fault of a grantee and within its control, the city council, may, by resolution, declare that the franchise of a grantee be terminated, unless there is compliance within such period as the city council may determine this period shall be sufficient to give a grantee a reasonable opportunity to comply. 
(e)  Franchise may cease and terminate 120 days after appointment of receivers. Any franchise granted shall, at the option of city, cease and terminate one hundred twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take over and conduct the business of a grantee whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other action or proceeding unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred twenty (120) days, or unless: 
(1)  Such receivers or trustees shall have within one hundred twenty (120) days, after their election or appointment fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this article and a franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivers or trustees within said one hundred twenty (120) days shall have remedied all defaults under the franchise; and 
(2)  Such receivers or trustees shall have within one hundred twenty (120) days executed an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision, and limitation of the franchise agreement. 
(f)  Procedure if a foreclosure occurs. In the case of a foreclosure or other involuntary sale of the plant, property, and equipment of a grantee, or any part thereof, city may serve notice of termination upon a grantee and to the purchaser at such sale, in which event the franchise and rights and privileges of a grantee shall cease and terminate thirty (30) days after service of such notice unless: 
(1)  City has approved the transfer of the franchise, as and in the manner in this article provided; and 
(2)  Such successful purchaser shall have covenanted and agreed with city to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement.

Sec. 29.5-36. - Waivers. 
(1)  A grantee may submit a written request for a variance to the city council at any time during the franchise term. Such request for a variance, at the sole discretion of the city council, may be set for a public hearing, and a decision shall be made within one hundred twenty (120) days following the submission. Procedures for the modification of franchise obligations shall be in compliance with section 625 [47 U.S.C. 545] Title VI, Communication Act of 1934. 
(2)  The city council may authorize the economic, technical, or legal evaluation of such variance request, and a grantee shall be required to reimburse the city for any expenditure incurred by the city in connection with such evaluation. 
(3)  This section is enacted solely for the convenience and benefit of the city and shall not be construed in such a manner as to create any right or entitlement for a grantee.

Sec. 29.5-37. - Sundry provisions. 
(1)  Every direction, notice or order by SWOCC or the city to be served upon a grantee shall be hand delivered or sent by registered mail to the office responsible for the local cable system.

(2)  All provisions of this article shall apply to a grantee, its successors and assignees, as may be approved by city council in accordance with this article. 
(3)  The rights granted by this article are subject to all franchises and permits heretofore or hereafter granted by the city to use the streets of the city by other public utility or public service corporations. It is not intended by the grant of a franchise to abridge the exercise of the police power heretofore or hereafter granted to the city by the state. 
(4)  Without limitation on the rights which the city might otherwise have, the city does hereby expressly reserve the right, powers, and authority to exercise its governmental power now, or hereafter to the full extent that such powers may be vested in or granted to the city; to determine through its city council any question of fact relating to the meaning, terms, obligations or other factors of this franchise. 
(5)  Specific mention of the materiality of any of the provisions herein is not intended to be exclusive of any others for the purpose of determining whether any failure of compliance hereunder is material and substantial. 
(6)  If any particular section of this article, or the particular application thereof, shall be held invalid, the remaining provisions and their application shall not be affected thereby. 
(7)  A grantee shall assume the cost of any publications required by law and such is payable upon a grantee's filing of acceptance of a franchise. 
(8)  The rights and remedies reserved to the city by this article are cumulative and shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other rights or remedies which the city may have with respect to the subject matter of this article. A waiver of any right or remedy by a party at one time shall not affect the exercise of said right or remedy or any other right or other remedy by such party at any other time. The failure of the city to take any action in the event of a material breach by a grantee shall not be construed or otherwise be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right of the city to take such action at any other time in the event that said material breach has not been cured, or with respect to any other material breach by a grantee. 
(9)  The headings contained in this article and any agreement are to facilitate reference only, do not form a part of this article or an agreement, and shall not in any way affect the construction or interpretation hereof. 
(10)  If by reason of a force majeure either party is unable in whole or in part to carry out its obligations hereunder, said party shall not be deemed in violation or default during the continuance of such inability.

Any judge or magistrate imposing a civil fine and costs under this article which are not paid in full immediately, or for which a bond is not immediately posted in double the amount of the civil fine and costs, shall order the driver or owner to move the vehicle at the driver's own risk to a place of safekeeping within the jurisdiction of the judge or magistrate, inform the judge or magistrate in writing of the place of safekeeping, and there keep the vehicle until the fine and costs are paid or sufficient bond furnished, or until the judge or magistrate is satisfied that the fine and costs will be paid. The police officer or weighmaster who has determined, after weighing a vehicle and load, that the weight is unlawful, may require the driver to proceed to a judge or magistrate within the city. If the judge or magistrate is satisfied that the probable civil fine and costs will be paid by the owner or lessee, the judge or magistrate may allow the driver to proceed after the load is made legal. If the judge or magistrate is not satisfied that the owner or lessee, after a notice and a right to be heard on the merits is given, will pay the amount of the probable civil fine and costs, the judge or magistrate may order the vehicle to be impounded until trial on the merits is completed under conditions set forth in this article for the impounding of such vehicles after the civil fine and costs have been imposed. Removal of the vehicle and forwarding, care or preservation of the load shall be under the control of and at the risk of the owner or driver. Vehicles impounded shall be subject to a lien, subject to a prior valid bona fide lien of prior record, in the amount of the civil fine and costs, and if the civil fine and costs are not paid within ninety (90) days after the seizure, the judge or magistrate shall certify the unpaid judgment to the city attorney who shall proceed to enforce the lien by foreclosure sale in accordance with procedure authorized in the case of chattel mortgage foreclosures. 
(c)  When a weighmaster is performing his or her duties under this article, he or she shall have all the powers conferred upon police officers by the general laws of this state.

(2)  The term "structure in which sanitary sewage originates" or "structure" shall mean a building in which toilet, kitchen, laundry, bathing or other facilities which generate water-carried sanitary sewage are used for household, commercial, industrial or other purposes. 
(b)  Public sanitary sewer systems are essential to the health, safety and welfare of the people of the state and the city. Septic tank disposal systems are subject to failure due to soil conditions or other reasons. Failure or potential failure of septic tank disposal systems poses a threat to the public health, safety and welfare; presents a potential for ill health, transmission of disease, mortality and potential economic blight; and constitutes a threat to the quality of surface and subsurface waters of the state and the city. The connection to available public sanitary sewer systems at the earliest reasonable date is a matter for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare and necessary in the public interest which is declared as a matter of legislative determination. 
(c)  Structures in which sanitary sewage originates located in the city in the area served by the system for which there is an available public sanitary lateral sewer of the system, which was financed by special assessment upon the properties especially benefitted shall not be used or occupied, after the effective date hereof, unless such structures are connected to the sewage disposal system. Structures within the city in which sanitary sewage is originating on the effective date hereof or in which sanitary sewage originates before availability of the system or any part thereof to serve such structures shall be connected to such system within twelve (12) months after publication of a notice by the council in a newspaper of general circulation in the city of the availability of the system.

The notice may be made by first-class or certified mail or by posting it on the property. The notice shall give the approximate location of the public sanitary sewer of the system which is available for connection of the structure involved and shall advise the owner of the requirements and of the enforcement provisions of this Code. 
(e)  Where any structure in which sanitary sewage originates is not connected to an available public sanitary sewer system within ninety (90) days after the date of mailing or posting of the written notice, the provisions of this article shall be enforceable through the bringing of appropriate action for injunction, mandamus or otherwise, in any court having jurisdiction. 
(f)  Where any structure in which sanitary sewage originates has not been connected to an available public sanitary sewer system and where the septic tank or other disposal system has failed or poses an immediate hazard to the public health, the connection shall be made within thirty (30) days after mailing to the owner or posting on the property a written notice of the health hazard. 
(g)  Public sanitary sewer systems are essential to the health, safety and welfare of the people of the city. Septic tank disposal systems are subject to failure due to soil conditions or other reasons. Failure of septic tank disposal systems poses a threat to the public health, safety and welfare; presents a potential for ill-health, transmission of disease, mortality and economic blight; and constitutes a threat to the quality of surface and subsurface waters of the city. The connection to available public sanitary sewer systems at the earliest reasonable date is a matter for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and necessary in the public interests which is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

The board of appeals shall not allow a variance or exception in any sewer system or part thereof with existing flooding problems or lack of capacity. All variances and exceptions shall be for limited times only. 
(b)  Roof waters from buildings permitted and connected in accordance with section 33-99 shall not discharge into any flower or shrub bed adjacent to the building wall nor upon the ground within five (5) feet of the building wall. Where setback, side yard or rear yard requirements result in the building being located less than five (5) feet from the property line, then the downspouts shall be discharged in the manner approved by the city building inspector. Downspout piping shall be permanently affixed to the building wall and shall be anchored at the discharge end by a block, eight (8) inches by eight (8) inches in size, which shall encase the piping and shall extend to a minimum depth of two (2) feet below grade or to undisturbed earth. Other methods may be used, however, if such methods receive the prior approval of the county department of public works. 
(c)  The surface of the ground around buildings permitted and connected in accordance with section 33-99 shall be sloped in such a manner as to provide positive drainage of all roof and surface waters away from the building. Such slope shall be uniform and shall be such that the elevation of the surface of the ground at a point ten (10) feet from the face of the building wall is a minimum of six (6) inches lower than the ground elevation at the face of the building wall. Where setback, side yard or rear yard requirements result in the building being located less than ten (10) feet from the property line, the surface of the ground shall slope away from the building wall at a uniform minimum slope of five-eighths inch per foot and in a manner approved by the building inspector.

(13)  Any solid materials having a specific gravity greater than one and two-tenths (1.2) or a cross section dimension of one-half (1/2) inch or greater which are sufficient to cause interference with the POTW. 
(b)  Specific pollutant prohibitions. No user shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following limitations: 
(1)  Compatible pollutants. See Appendix C of this division. 
(2)  Noncompatible pollutants. No user shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of: 
mg/l Arsenic (As) 1.0 Cadmium (Cd) See Appendix C Chromium (Cr) 25.0 Copper (Cu) 2.5 Cyanide (CN) (Available) 1.0 Iron (Fe) 1000.0 Lead (Pb) 1.0 Nickel (Ni) 5.0 Silver (Ag) 1.0 Zinc (Zn) 7.3 Total phenolic compounds or see Appendix B 1.0  
All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with 40 C.F.R. part 136. 
a.  The limitation for total PCB is non-detect. Total PCB shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 608, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one (1) or more samples indicate detectable levels of total PCB, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the total PCB concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with section 33-60.15(d). 
b.  The limitation of mercury (Hg) is non-detect. Mercury (Hg) shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 245.1, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one (1) or more samples indicate detectable levels of mercury, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For the purposes of this section, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the mercury concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with subsection 33-60.15(d). 
All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance 40 C.F.R. part 136. 
(3)  Compliance period. Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this section, the department shall notify all industrial users operating under an effective wastewater discharge permit of the requirement to submit a compliance report within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of this section. The compliance report shall demonstrate the user's compliance or noncompliance with these limitations, and, in the event of noncompliance, include the submission of a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with the stated limitation. In no event shall a compliance schedule exceed eighteen (18) months from the effective date of this section. An industrial user who does not demonstrate compliance may petition the department for a second extension as part of an administrative consent order. The department shall include appropriate monitoring, reporting, and penalties into an administrative consent order that relates to a second extension, and shall enter into such an agreement only upon a good-faith showing by the industrial user of the actions taken to achieve compliance with this provision. 
(c)  National categorical pretreatment standards. All users shall comply with the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards and requirements promulgated pursuant to the Act as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Subchapter N, Effluent Guidelines and Standards, which are hereby incorporated by reference and with all other applicable standards and requirements, provided, however, that where a more stringent standard or requirement is applicable pursuant to state law or regulation, or to this division, then the more stringent standard or requirement shall be controlling. Affected dischargers shall comply with applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. part 403 and as established by the department. The national categorical pretreatment standards which have been promulgated as of the effective date of this section are delineated in Appendix A of this division. 
(1)  Intake water adjustment. Industrial users seeking adjustment of national categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in their intake water must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.15. Upon notification of approval by the department, the adjustment shall be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are not effective until incorporated into an industrial user's permit. 
(2)  Modification of national categorical pretreatment standards. The department may apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, whichever is appropriate, for authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and procedures in 40 C.F.R. 403.7. Such authorization may be granted only when the POTW treatment plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for which a removal credit is being sought, provided, that any limitation of such pollutant(s) in the NPDES permit neither are being exceeded nor pose the prospect of being exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted. Where such authorization is given to the department, any industrial user desiring to obtain such credit shall make an application to the department, consistent with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. 403.7 and of this division. Any credits which may be granted under this section may be subject to modification or revocation as specified in 40 C.F.R. 403.7, or as determined by the department. A requisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the industrial user pay a surcharge based upon the amounts of such pollutants removed by the POTW, such surcharge being based upon fees or rates which the board may establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits shall reflect, or be modified to reflect, any credit granted pursuant to this section. 
(3)  New sources. Industrial users who meet the new sources criteria shall install, maintain in operating condition, and "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not to exceed ninety (90) days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
(4)  Concentration and mass limits. When limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the department may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in accordance with Sections 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(4) and shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. 1317(d) and of this division. Industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(5)  Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pretreatment standards-baseline report. Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under Section 40 C.F.R. 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit to the department a report containing the information listed in 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b))(1)-(7). Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to the director or regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40 C.F.R. 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to resubmit this information. At least ninety (90) days before commencement of any discharge, each new source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the department a report which contains the information listed in 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(1)-(5). In such report, new sources shall include information concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the information requested in 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(4) and (5). 
(d)  Dilution prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use of process water, or in any way dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation or requirement imposed by the city, the City of Detroit or by the State of Michigan. 
(e)  Hauled in wastewater. Any waste material or wastewater which is hauled into or within the service region for discharge to the POTW is subject to the requirements of this division including, but not limited to, permits, inspection, monitoring and enforcement. Unloading liquid or solid waste from hauling vehicles, directly or indirectly, into the POTW, with or without the benefit of pretreatment, is prohibited unless the person proposing to unload such waste has applied for and received a permit from the department for unloading such waste in accordance with the board's rules pertaining thereto. The discharger shall be subject to applicable terms and conditions, surcharges, fees or rates as established by the board. Hauled in wastewater shall only be discharged at points designated by the POTW after authorization or approval issued pursuant to the general permit requirements specified in section 33-60.10 of this Code. The department may establish specific limitations for sludge from municipally owned or operated POTW treatment plants which are different than the specific limitations in this division. 
(f)  Centralized waste treatment. It is unlawful for a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility to discharge any industrial waste or wastewater into the POTW without a wastewater discharge permit from the department. Any authorization granted, or permit issued, by the department to a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall specify the type of wastewater for which treatment is provided, and discharge approval is sought, from the POTW. Unless such industrial waste or wastewater is determined by the department to require further authorization, a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility that has submitted an application to, and received previous approval from, the department to discharge wastewater is not required to obtain further authorization from the department before discharging such wastewater. 
    An industrial user, that provides centralized waste treatment services and files an application for the treatment and discharge of such types of wastewater to the POTW, shall provide the following minimum information in support thereof: 
(1)  The general nature, source and process(es) generating the type of wastewater. Any wastewater, which is generated from those processes and is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards as delineated in Appendix A of this division, shall be so designated; 
(2)  The identity of the toxic pollutants known or suspected to be present in the wastewater; 
(3)  At least one (1) sample report showing the results of an analysis for the EPA priority pollutants for each type of wastewater for which application is made in subsection (f)(1) of this section; 
(4)  A statement, that is certified by a professional engineer, which addresses the treatability and compatibility of the wastewater, received or collected by the facility's treatment process(es); 
(5)  The identity of the materials and/or pollutants whose transport or treatment are regulated by the EPA, by the state, or by any other governmental agency. Upon request, the centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall provide a copy of its permit and/or license to the department; and 
(6)  Other information requested by the department including, but not limited to, information required by section 33-60.10(c)(1) through (18) of this Code, or by rules adopted by the board. The discharge from a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility will be deemed approved for those specific types of wastewater delineated in a permit and, upon issuance of such permit in accordance with the procedures contained in section 33-60.10 of this Code, will be deemed approved for discharge into the POTW. The centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall comply with all applicable provisions contained in section 33-60.10 of this Code regarding permits. In furtherance of its obligations as control authority, the department may include in the permit a requirement to report at selected intervals the information mandated in subsections (1) through (6) of this section. 
All users granted a permit under this section shall maintain records which, at a minimum, identify the source, volume, character, and constituents of the wastewater accepted for treatment and disposal. These records may be reviewed at any time by the department. 
(g)  Groundwater discharges. Unless authorization has been granted by the department, the discharge of any groundwater into the POTW is prohibited. 
    The department may authorize the discharge of groundwater resulting from maintenance and related activities of gas, steam or electrical utilities through the use of general permits. Subject to appropriate reporting requirements, the general permit shall authorize discharge in accordance with the terms of the permit. Utilities shall comply with this provision within one hundred eighty (180) days after its enactment. 
    If a person, who proposes to discharge groundwater resulting from purge, response activity or UST projects, has applied for and received a permit from the department, the department may authorize the discharge of such wastewater. Permits shall be issued in accordance with the procedures contained in section 33-60.10.1 of this Code, or in accordance with any rules adopted by the board. 
(h)  City right of revision. The City of Detroit and the city reserves the right to establish rules or regulations adopted by the board, additional or more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW. Ninety (90) days after adoption by the board, industrial users shall comply with such rules and regulations. 
(i)  Accidental discharges. 
(1)  Each industrial user, which does not currently have an approved spill prevention plan or slug control plan, shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division, and all significant industrial users shall submit to the department detailed plans which show facilities and operating procedures to be implemented to provide protection against such accidental discharges. Facilities and measures to prevent and abate accidental discharges shall be implemented, provided and maintained at the owner's or industrial user's cost or expense. Unless the significant industrial user has an approved spill prevention or slug control plan, all existing significant industrial users shall complete and submit such a plan within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this division. New significant industrial users shall submit such a plan prior to the time they commence discharging. 
For purposes of this section, the information provided shall include the approximate average and maximum quantities of such prohibited materials or substances kept on the premises in the form of raw materials, chemicals and/or waste therefrom and the containment capacity for each. Only substances that are in a form which could readily be carried into the POTW and constitute a concentration of five (5) percent or greater in the raw material, chemical solution or waste material, are required to be reported. Volumes of less than fifty-five (55) gallons, or the equivalent thereof, need not be reported unless lesser quantities could cause pass through or cause interference with the POTW. 
The industrial user shall promptly notify the department of any significant changes or modifications to the plan including, but not limited to, a change in the contact person, or substance inventory. 
(2)  At least once every two (2) years, the department shall evaluate whether a significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges, as defined by 40 C.F.R. 403.8(f)(2)(v). Unless otherwise provided, all significant users shall complete, implement and submit such a plan within thirty (30) days of notification by the department. 
(j)  Notification requirements. Unless a different notice is provided by this division or applicable law, within one (1) hour of becoming aware of a discharge into the POTW which exceeds or does not conform with federal, state or city laws, rules, regulations or permit requirements, or which could cause problems to the potw, or which has the potential to cause the industrial user to implement its plan prepared in accordance with subsection (i) of this section, the industrial user shall telephone the department at its control center and notify the department of the discharge. The notification shall include the name of the caller, the location and time of discharge, the type of wastewater, the estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited pollutants and estimated volume, and the measures taken, or being taken, to abate the discharge into the POTW. Within five (5) calendar days after the discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences and when required by the department, the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit may be modified to include additional measures to prevent such future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, cost of treatment, loss, damages or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other environmental impairment or any other damage to person or property. 
(k)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board, or other prominent place, advising employees whom to contact in the department in the event of an actual or excessive or prohibited discharge. 
(l)  Recovery of costs. Any user discharging in violation of any of the provisions of this division, which produces a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the department's POTW, or causes the department to violate its NPDES permit, shall be liable to the department for any expense, loss, damage, penalty or fine incurred by the department because of said violation or discharge. Prior to assessing such costs, the department shall notify the user of its determination that the user's discharge was the proximate cause of such damage, obstruction, impairment, or violation of the city's NPDES permit and the department's intent to assess such costs to the user. Any such notice shall include written documentation which substantiates the determination of proximate cause and a breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this division. Such charge shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any penalties or remedies provided under this division, or this Code, or other statutes and regulations, or at law or in equity. 
(m)  Hazardous waste notification. All industrial users, who discharge into the city collection system, shall notify the department in writing of any discharge of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.12(p). 
(n)  Authorized representative. The authorized representative of industrial user, as defined in section 33-60.3 of this Code, may designate a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in subsections (1) and (2) of the definition of "authorized representative of industrial user" in section 33-60.3, where: 
(1)  The authorization is made in writing by the individual defined in subsections (1) and (2) of the definition of authorized representative of industrial user in section 33-60.3; 
(2)  The authorization specifies either an individual or a position having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility where the industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager, operator of a well or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and 
(3)  The written authorization is submitted to the department. 
(o)  Pollution prevention . The department shall encourage and support industrial users to develop and implement pollution prevention programs designed to eliminate or reduce pollutant contributions beyond the levels required by this division. The department may require an industrial user to implement pollution prevention initiatives or BMP as part of an enforcement response, or as necessary to comply with its NPDES permit.

(Ord. No. C-11-2001, § 2, 11-19-01) 
Sec. 33-60.10. - Wastewater discharge permits. 
(a)  Required. It shall be unlawful for users to discharge into the POTW any wastewater which will cause interference or pass through, or otherwise not comply with the discharge prohibitions of section 33-60.8 of this Code. It shall be unlawful for a significant industrial user to discharge into the POTW without a wastewater discharge permit from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the department through permit, order, rule or regulation, any discharge must be in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
(1)  All significant industrial users, which are in existence on the effective date of this division, shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this division. Significant industrial users who are currently operating with a valid wastewater discharge permit are not subject to this provision. These applications are to include all information specified in section 33-60.10(c) of this Code and, where applicable, any additional information which may be needed to satisfy the federal baseline monitoring report requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b). 
(2)  All new significant users shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit at least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of discharge. The application must include all information specified in section 33-60.10(c) of this Code and, where applicable, any additional information that may be needed to satisfy the federal BMR requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b). Until a permit is issued and finalized by the department, no discharge shall be made into the POTW. 
(3)  Any user, who proposes to discharge any wastewater other than sanitary or noncontact cooling water into the POTW, shall request approval from the department for the discharge(s) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of the discharge. 
(b)  Permit application or reapplication. The department may require any user to complete a questionnaire and/or a permit application and to submit the same to the department for determining whether the industrial user is a significant user, or to determine changes in the wastewater discharges from a user's facility.

a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user properly notified the department as described in subsection (c)(2) of this section. 
(4)  Bypass approval. Where it meets all conditions in subsection (c)(3) of this section, the department may approve an anticipated bypass. 
(d)  [Pollution prevention initiatives.] Where one (1) or more of the measurements taken for any pollutant defined in section 33-60.8(b) of this Code during a six-month period exceed by any magnitude the daily maximum non-detect limit for the same parameter, the industrial user may develop and implement pollution prevention initiatives, or a BMP, as part of its response. The department may, as part of an administrative order, also require development of a BMP as a part of the department's enforcement response. Upon approval of the department, these pollution prevention initiatives, or BMPs shall be made an enforceable part of the wastewater discharge permit. Industrial users shall provide, at six-month intervals, analytical results and certifications in support of its implementation of an approved pollution prevention initiative or BMPs. Upon demonstration of compliance, the industrial user may request to be relieved of this implementation requirement. 
(e)  Emergency suspensions and orders. The department may order suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit where, in the opinion of the department, such suspension is necessary to stop any actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, interferes or may interfere with the POTW, or causes or may cause the City of Detroit to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Any person notified of a suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event the department provides informal notification under this section, written confirmation and an order shall be provided within twenty-four (24) hours. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with any suspension or revocation order, the department shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection or services, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or danger to any individual or the environment. In the event such steps are taken, the director shall notify the industrial user within twenty-four (24) hours in writing of such action and order, and the specific recourse available. In any event, the department shall provide the industrial user with an opportunity for a hearing before the director, or his designated representative, within ten (10) days of such action. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement to the department within fifteen (15) days of the occurrence describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. Upon proof of elimination of the noncomplying discharge, the department shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the sewer or wastewater treatment service. 
(f)  Notice of violation . Except in the case of an actual or threatened discharge as specified in subsection (e) of this section, whenever the department has reason to believe that any industrial user has violated or is violating this division, the department shall serve a written notice stating the nature of the violation upon such industrial user. Where applicable, the department shall pursue appropriate escalating enforcement action as defined within its approved enforcement response plan. The failure of the department to issue a notice of violation shall not preclude the Department from escalating its enforcement response. 
(g)  Administrative actions. Whenever the department has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, or a pretreatment standard or requirement or any prohibition of this division, the department, except in the case of emergency or flagrant violation, may initiate appropriate administrative enforcement action in order to compel the industrial user to eliminate or to remedy such violation as soon as possible. 
(1)  a.  Conferences. The department may order any person, who violates this division, to attend a conference wherein the department may endeavor to cause the user to eliminate or remedy the violation by establishing an enforceable compliance schedule. The notice of violation shall be served at least ten (10) days before the scheduled conference and shall set forth the date, time, and place thereof. The conference shall be conducted by a representative of the department. The industrial user shall present a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with this division. Nothing contained herein shall require the department to accept or agree to any proposed plan or schedule, or to prevent the department from proceeding with a show cause hearing as set forth in subsection (g)(2) of this section. If the attendees agree upon a compliance schedule, the user and the department's duly authorized representative may enter, by consent, into a compliance agreement or an administrative order setting forth the terms of such agreement. An industrial user must exhibit good faith and expeditious efforts to comply with this division and any procedures, requirements, and agreements hereunder. 
b.  Compliance schedules. The user and the department may agree upon a schedule which sets forth the terms and conditions, and time periods or schedules for completion of actions to remedy or to eliminate the causes of violation. These schedules may be developed as part of a compliance agreement, or an administrative consent order. Schedules developed under this subsection shall adhere to the following conditions: 
1.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of upgraded or additional pretreatment facilities, or to the implementation of additional operation and maintenance procedures required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment requirements and standards including, but not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, and completing construction; 
2.  No single increment referred to in subsection (g)(1)a. of this section, shall exceed nine (9) months; 
3.  Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the department including, at a minimum, whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason(s) for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule; and 
4.  Any deviations from the compliance schedule may result in the industrial user being found in violation of this division. 
c.  Administrative orders. The department may order any industrial user, who violates or continues to violate this division or a duly issued permit, to install and to properly operate devices, treatment facilities or other related appurtenances. In addition, orders may contain such other requirements as might reasonably be necessary and appropriate to address the violation including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices, implementation of a waste minimization assessment to identify and implement feasible source reduction, and recycling practices to reduce the generation or release of pollutants at the facility. An order may be either an administrative consent order, which is the result of an agreement, or a unilateral administrative order. 
(2)  Show cause hearing. The department may order any industrial user, who violates this division or allows such violation to occur, to show cause before the department why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served upon the industrial user specifying the time and place of a hearing before the department regarding the violation, the reason(s) why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the industrial user to show cause before the department why any proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally, or by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made upon any agent or officer of a corporation, or its authorized representative. 
a.  Hearing proceeding. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures adopted by the board. A hearings officer shall conduct the show cause hearing and take the evidence, and may: 
1.  In the name of the board, issue notices of hearing requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearing; 
2.  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the director for action thereon. 
b.  Transcript. At any show cause hearing held pursuant to this division, testimony shall be recorded by a court reporter.

h.  A finding the user has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation either of this division or of a duly issued permit did not occur. 
(4)  Public notification of significant noncompliance. The department shall publish in the largest daily newspaper published in the City of Detroit and the city a list of all industrial users which were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements at any time during the previous twelve (12) months. All industrial users identified in a proposed publication shall be provided with a copy of the proposed notice at least thirty (30) days before publication and allowed an opportunity to comment as to its accuracy. 
(h)  Legal actions. 
(1)  Criminal action. Any user, who violates any provision of this division including the failure to pay any fees, fines, charges or surcharges imposed hereby, or any condition or limitation of a permit issued pursuant thereto, or who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division or wastewater discharge permit, or who tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device required under this division, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each violation per day, or by imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days, or by both. The department, consistent with the terms and conditions of the delegation agreement entered into with city, is hereby authorized, through its counsel, to seek prosecution of criminal charges against any person violating any provision of this division. 
(2)  Civil action. Whenever the department has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, a pretreatment standard or requirement or any requirement of this division, the director may commence a civil action to compel compliance in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the user from discharging, and/or to obtain appropriate relief to remedy the violations. The department or board may also seek additional legal and/or equitable relief. The commencement of suit does not constitute an exclusive election of remedies and does not prohibit the department, director, board, City of Detroit or the city from commencing action in federal court for discharges believed to be in violation of this division, state and federal requirements contained in the Clean Water Act, the City of Detroit's NPDES permit, or other applicable laws or requirements. In addition, the City of Detroit and/or the city may recover the reasonable attorney fees, court costs, court reporters' fees, and other unusual expenses related to enforcement activities or litigation against the person found to have violated this division, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder. 
(3)  All fines, costs, and penalties which are imposed by any court of competent jurisdiction shall be payable to the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and the city where applicable.

(a)  It shall be unlawful to build, change, alter or enlarge or permit the building, changing, alteration or enlargement of any existing, proposed or future structure or land or part thereof of any building or land, or change the drainage pattern of any land or part thereof until a building permit in accordance with the provisions of this article and all other applicable codes and ordinances of the city, properly endorsed as to occupancy in a manner herein provided, shall have been issued by the director of public services or by the director's duly appointed assistants. 
(b)  An application for a building permit shall be made to the community development division prior to the time when a new or enlarged or changed or altered use of a structure or land or part thereof is intended to begin. No building or structure shall be erected, altered or changed and no building or structure shall be moved into any parcel of land and no drainage pattern of any land shall be changed by filling, cutting or grading in this city prior to the issuance of a permit therefor. Any application for a permit shall be accompanied by a plot plan in triplicate, drawn to a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals one hundred (100) feet showing the exact dimension of the land and structures to which the permit is to apply. 
(c)  When a building permit has been approved and the structure has been constructed, the lot shall be filled, graded and maintained in conformity with the grading pattern established on the recorded plat, in conformity with the grades established and recorded on the recorded plat. 
(d)  The plot plan for any building or structure which is presented in connection with a building permit application, for a lot or parcel of land, not part of a subdivision in which grading patterns have been established shall have superimposed thereon one-foot or less contours of the area including not less than one hundred (100) feet outside the boundary of the plot on which the permit is being sought and shall include the proposed grade of building, the lot or parcel and the corners thereof and the point, area, ditch or enclosure to which stormwater is to drain. Such contour map and stormwater disposal system shall be reviewed by the city engineering division to determine that the site drainage is proper and that the drainage from abutting properties is not obstructed and the downstream properties will not be damaged or inconvenienced. The plot plan shall be prepared and signed or sealed by a registered civil engineer or registered land surveyor. 
(e)  It shall be unlawful for any person to interfere with or obstruct the flow of surface water over easements for public utilities or to impede the flow of surface water across private property in a manner different from the approved grading plan and drainage pattern. 
(f)  Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, it will be necessary that a grading survey, prepared and signed by a registered civil engineer or land surveyor be submitted to the engineering division attesting to the fact that the site is graded in accordance with the drainage pattern approved at the time of issuance of the building or land use permit. 
(g)  In lieu of this land survey, a surety bond, letter of credit or cash deposit in an amount set by the engineering division may be required to insure grading and submission of such survey at a later date when a building, land or structure is otherwise suitable for occupancy during that season of the year when weather conditions make finish grading unfeasible. In such case, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued and the date for completion of grading shall be indicated on the temporary certificate of occupancy or its related documents. 
(h)  It shall be unlawful for any person to permit the entry of any roof water, groundwater or surface water into the sanitary sewer system or to direct any roof water, groundwater or surface water in such a manner that it enters the sanitary sewer system. Any person who was heretofore permitted to have a stormwater, roof water or groundwater connection to a sanitary sewer shall install splash blocks and conductors to carry roof water not less than five (5) feet from the building wall and grade in accordance with this article. Such work shall be completed to the satisfaction of the engineering division within sixty (60) days of notice to comply herewith.

Sec. 33-201. - Payment of proportionate share. 
(a)  An owner of a benefited property shall not be permitted to connect to any sewer or water main improvement constructed at the expense of any one (1) or more benefited property owners or the city in accordance with this article, until as a condition precedent thereto the owner of such benefited property seeking to connect shall have paid to the city its proportionate share of the cost of such improvement as established by the city council, in addition to all other costs, charges, fees and other payments required by any ordinance or resolution of the city. 
(b)  If a benefited property is divided at any time after adoption of the city council resolution establishing a payback district under this article, all of the new parcels or lots created from the benefited property shall constitute benefited properties under this article, and an owner of any such divided part of the original benefited property shall not be permitted to connect to any sewer or water main improvement constructed at the expense of any one (1) or more benefited property owners or the city in accordance with this article, until as a condition precedent thereto the owner of such divided part of the original benefited property seeking to connect shall have paid to the city the full proportionate share of the cost of such improvement as established by the city council for the entire original benefited property, in addition to all other costs, charges, fees and other payments required by any ordinance or resolution of the city. 
(c)  In the event the sewer or water main improvement was installed by or at the expense of one (1) of the benefited owners, all such sums collected within fifteen (15) years of the date of the city council resolution establishing the payback district, less such reasonable charge as shall be imposed by the city for the cost of collection and handling, shall be paid to the owner at whose cost the improvement was constructed. Any such amount paid to that owner shall serve as reimbursement to that owner for the approved cost of construction in excess of the proportionate share of the cost of construction attributable to that owner's benefited property. Nothing contained in this article or in any action of the city council pursuant to this article, however, shall be construed as requiring the city to make any reimbursement to any property owner except out of the charges provided for in and collected under this section, and the city shall not be responsible to the owner or any other person for any non-payment of or failure to collect such charges regardless of the reasons therefore. 
(d)  An owner to whom the city is required to make payments of collected amounts under this section may designate, in writing to the city, a third party assignee to whom the payments are to be made and sent, and the city shall make such payments to the designated assignee. It shall be the responsibility of an owner or any assignee, to whom the city is required to make payments of collected amounts under this section, to notify the city of any change of address to which collected payment amounts, if any, are to be sent. The death or dissolution of the owner, or a failure to notify the city of any assignments or changes of address in the above manner, shall eliminate any requirement of the city under this section, or under any claim of equity or law, to pay collected amounts to the owner or any assignee of the owner, and the city shall have no obligation or duty to expend any effort to locate the proper recipient of the payments and may cease collecting amounts and/or retain any amounts collected as consideration for administrative costs incurred by the city. 
( Ord. No. C-2-2012, § 3, 4-23-12 ) 
Sec. 33-202. - Advance connection and payment. 
    In the event one (1) or more owners of benefited properties desire to connect following completion of the sewer or water main improvement but prior to final approval and adoption of a resolution by city council under section 33-199a., section 33-199b. or section 33-200 of this Code, the director may accept a deposit of funds from the owners of such properties in an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the director's estimated proportionate share of the cost of construction of the improvement attributable to the benefited properties, together with an agreement signed by the owners of such properties approved by the city attorney in which the owners agree that such amount shall be held by the city and credited against any amount determined by city council under section 33-199, section 33-199b. or section 33-200 as the amount to be paid by benefited properties for the improvement, and if the amount deposited proves to be less than the amount determined by city council under section 33-199, section 33-199b. or section 33-200 to be paid by benefited properties, the benefited property owner shall agree to pay the difference to the city within no more than thirty (30) days of the date of the city council's resolution regarding same. If not paid within said thirty-day period, the amount shall be placed on and added to a billing statement for water and sewer service (a.k.a. the water bill) applicable to the benefited property, shall constitute a lien against said property, and shall be subject to and collected in the same manner as provided for the collection water and sewer rates and charges under sections 33-236 and 33-237 of this Code. Any amount deposited in excess of the amount determined by city council under section 33-199, section 33-199b. or section 33-200 to be paid by the benefited properties for the improvement shall be returned to the owner.

Sec. 33-203. - Installment payment option. 
    The resolution adopted by city council under section 33-199, section 33-199b. or section 33-200 may indicate that an owner of benefited property who connects within a period of time established by council in its resolution shall have the option to pay its proportionate share of the cost of such improvement in annual or semi annual installments, with interest, over a period of time after connection. The rate of interest, period of time, and schedule of installments shall be established in city council's discretion through its resolution. If city council provides the foregoing option and a benefited property owner desires to accept the option, such option shall be contingent on the benefited property owner executing an installment pay back agreement prepared by the city attorney and recorded with the Oakland County Register of Deeds against the benefited property. The finance director shall assist the city attorney with the preparation of a schedule of installment payments for purposes of such agreement, and, among any other provisions deemed appropriate by the city attorney, the agreement shall include terms generally comporting with the following: The amount of unpaid principal and all accrued interest, shall be a lien on the benefited property, and in the event one (1) or more installment payments are not paid on or before the due dates set forth in the agreement, the full balance of principal, and all accrued interest, shall be accelerated and shall there upon be payable in full. Such amount shall be placed on and added to a billing statement for water and sewer service applicable to the benefited property, shall constitute a lien against said property, and shall be subject to and collected in the same manner as provided for the collection water and sewer rates and charges under sections 33-236 and 33-237 of this Code.

A. INTENT
B. PRINCIPAL PERMITTED USES
i. Reserved
The MH mobile home districts are designed to provide for the appropriate location of and requirements for
mobile home parks. Mobile home parks possess characteristics of site development, use and density which
are unique. Such characteristics are more intensive than those of one-family residential districts and,
therefore, mobile home parks are treated as a distinct zoning district.
The following uses are subject to the review and
approval of the site plan by the planning
commission and the required conditions in
Sections 34-3.21.2.
i. Mobile home parks??, which may include the
following:
a. Mobile homes??
b. One management building exclusively
provided for the conducting of business
operations of the mobile home park in
which located
c. Utility building for laundry facilities
d. Auxiliary storage space for tenants or
management of the mobile home park;
e. Community building for the accessory use
of tenants of the mobile home park in

The SP special purpose districts are designed to accommodate specific uses which are generally compatible
with one-family residential areas, but which because of particular characteristics of size or use should not be
permitted in a one-family district without review and rezoning by the council. Such uses are also permissible
in multiple-family districts or business districts, but are less objectionable to single-family residential areas
than are other uses permitted in these districts. Thus, the purpose of this district is to permit, upon request,
the use of land or buildings for specific purposes in order that a high degree of control can be maintained
over the use.
The following uses are subject to review and
approval of the site plan by the planning

A. INTENT
B. PRINCIPAL PERMITTED USES
i. Reserved
The SP special purpose districts are designed to accommodate specific uses which are generally compatible
with one-family residential areas, but which because of particular characteristics of size or use should not be
permitted in a one-family district without review and rezoning by the council. Such uses are also permissible
in multiple-family districts or business districts, but are less objectionable to single-family residential areas
than are other uses permitted in these districts. Thus, the purpose of this district is to permit, upon request,
the use of land or buildings for specific purposes in order that a high degree of control can be maintained
over the use.
The following uses are subject to review and
approval of the site plan by the planning
commission and the conditions in Section 34-3.8
i. Indoor tennis or racquet court facilities § 34-4.19

§ 34-3.9.3.C
ii. Banks, credit unions, savings and loan
associations or similar uses which include
drive-in facilities as accessory use only
The OS-2 planned office service districts are designed to provide for various types of office uses performing
administrative, professional and personal services and for businesses whose main operating hours do not
generally coincide with the office uses and which do not require constant, short-term parking and traffic and
which provide a service as opposed to selling a product.
These districts are located and planned so as to provide convenient customer parking and pedestrian
movement within the district and a minimum of conflict with traffic on abutting thoroughfares. To assure
optimum site planning relationships and minimum internal and external traffic conflict, each use will be
reviewed as it relates to its site and abutting sites and as it relates to the entire OS-2 district and abutting
districts.
The following uses are permitted subject to the
required conditions in Section 34-3.9
i. Office buildings for any of the following
occupations: executive, administrative,
professional, accounting, writing, clerical,
stenographic, drafting, sales

34-3.1.21 OS-3 Special Office District
A. INTENT
B. PRINCIPAL PERMITTED USES
The following uses are permitted subject to the
required conditions in Section 34-3.9
i. Secondary use which is accessory to and
located in the same building as a principal
permitted use § 34-4.23
The OS-3 special office districts are designed to be used in areas which have unique natural features of
topography, vegetation and drainage. The purpose of the district is to provide for the protection of the
natural features as much as practical and to retain such natural features as much as practical and to retain
such natural features for physical separation of the offices and parking lots from adjacent residential uses.
Therefore, in such districts, construction should be carried out in such a manner as to preserve natural
hillside and tree cover as much as possible. It is also, however, the intent of this district that off-street
parking lots be obscured from view of adjacent residential area and, therefore, building into the sides of hills
is encouraged. It is also the intent to screen the view of parking lots as seen from the public streets. In order
to carry out this intent, the site plan for each zoning lot will be reviewed individually in relationship to the
natural characteristics of the zoning lot and its relationship to adjoining single-family lots.
Vegetative materials which are natural to the area should be used as landscape plant materials and the
construction of the landscaped areas will be in accordance with landscape design principles adopted by the
planning commission.
The following uses are permitted subject to the
required conditions in Section 34-3.9
i. Office buildings for any of the following
occupations: executive, administrative,
professional, accounting, writing, clerical,
stenographic, drafting, sales
ii. Medical offices including clinics
iii. Banks, credit unions, savings and loan
associations, and similar uses with drive-in
facilities as an accessory use only when
located within the main building
iv. Churches
v. Other uses similar to the above uses
vi. Cellular antenna?? § 34-4.24
vi. Accessory structures and uses?? customarily
incident to any principal use permitted

industrial establishments, or in connection with one or more office buildings or institutions, or with a
multiple-family residential development.
ii. Parking areas shall be used solely for parking of private passenger vehicles, for periods of less than one
day.
iii. No commercial repair work or service of any kind, or sale or display thereof, shall be conducted in such
parking area.
iv. No signs of any kind, other than signs designating entrances, exists and conditions of use, as recognized
in the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, shall be maintained on such parking area.
v. No building, other than those for shelter of attendants, shall be erected upon premises and they shall not

vi. Such parking lots shall be situated on premises which have an area of not less than five thousand
(5,000) square feet and shall be contiguous to an RC or nonresidential district or use, and in all cases
shall be adjacent successive lots from the above-mentioned districts or use, or adjacent successive lots
from either end of a block where lots front a street parallel to and at the rear of a business or industrial
block. There may be a private driveway or public street or public alley between such P-1 district and the
contiguous district.
vii. A site plan shall be submitted to the planning commission for its review and approval prior to the
issuance of any building permit.
D. SETBACKS AND WALLS

FWR-1 FREEWAY REDEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT 1
A. INTENT
The FWR-1 freeway redevelopment overlay district is designed to encourage redevelopment and
reinvestment within the district by allowing increased building height and greater flexibility in the location of
buildings, while requiring incorporation of recognized sustainable design practices and/or building materials
to promote energy conservation and improve environmental quality (e.g., silver level or higher LEED 2
certification) as well as utilization of Best Management Practices for storm water quality and control.
B. USES PERMITTED
FWR-1 freeway redevelopment overlay district. No building or land shall be used and no buildings shall be
erected except for one or more of the principal permitted uses, special approval uses, or accessory
structures and uses permitted in the underlying zoning district, in accordance with the height, area, and bulk
regulations provided therein, except as otherwise provided in this Section.
C. HEIGHT
The maximum height of structures permitted shall be fifty (50) feet, and all structures shall adhere to the
applicable requirements of the underlying zoning district; provided, however, that a structure may be
permitted to exceed fifty (50) feet in height if such structure is part of a Planned Unit Development (PUD)
approved under Section 34-3.20 of this chapter. Buildings in excess of fifty (50) feet shall be subject to the
following:
1. The maximum height of structure shall be one-hundred (100) feet.
2. In order for consideration of a building height greater than fifty (50) feet, a finding shall be made by the
approving body that the standards in Section 34-3.1.31.D are met.
D. APPEARANCE, USE, AND CONTEXTUAL STANDARDS FOR BUILDINGS IN EXCESS OF FIFTY (50)
FEET WHEN APPROVED AS PART OF A PUD
1. General
A. The site plan and building design (the plans) shall relate to its immediate and neighborhood
surroundings.
B. The plans shall avoid box-like, monolithic, and chunky buildings and those that do not have an
appropriate scale at the pedestrian level (see Figure 34-3.1.31.D.1.B.(1)). Buildings should be
subdivided into smaller elements to express an integrated sum of parts rather than a solid mass
(see Figure 34-3.1.31.D.1.B.(2)).
C. The plans shall avoid freestanding towers without bases.
D. For buildings containing six (6) stories or more, the topmost floor(s) and penthouses shall be
designed to express the upper termination of the building and the bottom shall contain a Building
Base. All buildings fronting on an Urban Street shall have a Building Base.
E. Building massing shall be oriented to adjacent public streets, using multiple orientations for sites
with more than one adjacent street frontage (see Figure 34-3.1.31.D.1.E).
F. The plans shall incorporate energy efficient design and function to enhance sustainability. The plans
shall reflect excellence in design and reasonable contextual relationships to the nearby pedestrian
and vehicular circulation system (internal and off-site) and to existing nearby structures. Compliance
with the standards below shall be deemed to substantially fulfill the requirements of this general
standard.

2. Setback and Building Siting Standards
A. Buildings and structures shall conform
with the setback requirements of the
underlying zoning district; provided,
however, that the maximum street-side
setback shall be one hundred (100 feet)
and the minimum setback shall be twenty
five (25 feet). The minimum setback of a
building from a freeway right-of- way shall
be twenty five (25 feet). For buildings
containing six (6) stories or more, see
additional setback requirements that
apply to the Building Base, Building
Middle and Building Top.
B. Whenever a Building Base is required, it
shall be a minimum of two (2) stories and
a maximum of three (3) stories.
C. The minimum horizontal spacing between
the Building Middle of two tall buildings
(those having six (6) stories or more) shall
be equal to the widest tower width (L),
where L = the total length of a line which,
when viewed directly from above, is
parallel to the front lot line and intersects
the widest part of the building, but shall
be no less than forty (40) feet (see Figure
34-3.1.31.D.2.C). The minimum setback
from the Building Middle to any property
line shall be thirty-five (35) feet. This
subsection shall not apply to façade of
buildings fronting an Urban Street and
developed as part of a Zero Front Setback
Pattern.
3. Scale
A. In order to conform to the general
standard of avoiding monolithic, box-like
structures and in order to open the
adjacent ground level to sunlight,
additional building setback requirements
are established that apply to the Building
Middle and Building Top.
B. For buildings containing five (5) stories,
the fifth floor shall be setback from the
fourth floor exterior walls by a minimum of
ten (10) feet in order to increase sunlight
at the ground level, reduce the visual
impact of the structure, and provide
opportunities for roof top uses, terraces,
and the like.
C. For buildings containing six (6) or more
stories, a Building Base shall be
established including two or three stories
above grade facing adjacent properties

and any public or private street frontage
(not required adjacent to freeways). All
floors above the Building Base shall be
setback from the edge of the Building Base
by a minimum of ten (10) feet (Figure 34-
3.1.31.D.3.C.(1)). A setback ratio of 1:5 (1
foot building setback for each 5 feet in
increased height) shall be applied above a
point thirty (30) feet in height or the top of
the Building Base, whichever is higher. This
setback ratio shall not apply to buildings
with a courtyard or alley separating the
towers (Figure 34-3.1.31.D.3.C.(2)).
4. Building Entrances and Storefronts. Pedestrian
building entrances shall be defined with
distinct architectural features, with clear and
safe sight lines, individual illumination, and
appropriate overhead protection from
inclement weather.
5. Zero Front Setback Pattern Development
Option
At the option of the Applicant, the plans may
incorporate a Zero Front Setback Pattern, at least
one Urban Street, and Zero Front Setback
Storefront design principles. By incorporating these
features, the Applicant will be eligible to include
upper floor residential uses and additional design
flexibility, as outlined in the following Main Street
standards.
A. If the plans propose a Zero Front Setback
Pattern (see Figure 34-3.1.31.D.5.A), there
shall be no required minimum setback
requirement from local public and private
Urban Streets. Rather, buildings shall be
constructed to the Build-to-line on Urban
Streets and shall, at buildout, occupy 70
percent or more of the full width of the
parcel or, where the development is under
unified ownership, the full width of the
designated Urban Street frontage. To allow
variation and design flexibility, portions of
the building façade may include jogs up to
two feet from the Build-to-line. Additional
variations in setback for architectural
features that meet the intent and spirit of a
Zero Front Setback Pattern may be
permitted at the discretion of the City
Council.
B. The horizontal Building Middle separation
standard in subsection 34-3.1.31.D.2.C
above shall not apply to façade of buildings
fronting an Urban Street and developed as
part of a Zero Front Setback Pattern.

C. ACCESSORY USES
Any accessory use listed in the underlying zoning
district or otherwise customary to a permitted use.
A. INTENT
B. PRINCIPAL PERMITTED USES
This overlay district is created to implement 1) the City of Farmington Hills Master Plan, including the
Southeast Business and Industrial Redevelopment Areas and Botsford Special Planning Area, and 2) the
Grand River Corridor Vision Plan 2013. The City seeks to provide flexibility in zoning regulations to foster
redevelopment either through renovation and/or expansion of existing buildings or construction of new
buildings in the district. Protection of natural areas, including the Rouge River floodplain, shall be
incorporated into new and redevelopment projects. The use of this overlay district shall require Planned Unit
Development (PUD) approval, however, all property zoned with the GR-1 overlay is pre-qualified for PUD
approval, which saves time in the development review process. Development solely in accordance with the
underlying zoning district does not require PUD approval unless otherwise required in the Zoning Ordinance.
The following uses are permitted in the GR-1
district in addition to those principal permitted
uses, special land uses, and accessory land uses
permitted in the underlying zoning district:
i. Retail businesses § 34-4.29
ii. Personal service establishments that perform
services on the premises
iii. Sit-down and fast food restaurants?
iv. Outdoor space for seating accessory to a
restaurant § 34-4.32

requirements, except as modified in this district
xi. Hotels?
? User Note: For uses listed in bold blue, refer to Article 4, or click on use, for use-specific standards
D. PUD QUALIFICATIONS
All properties located within the Grand River
Corridor Overlay 1 district shall be deemed to be
preliminarily qualified for the PUD option.
Development can proceed under the customary
approval process for the use in the underlying
district. The optional PUD approval process
provides for greater flexibility in development
including in many cases additional permitted
uses, reduced building setbacks, and additional
building height. All properties with the GR-1
Overlay are preliminarily qualified for PUD
approval. Procedures for requesting final
determination on the PUD shall be as follows:
1. The applicant shall apply for and participate in
a Pre-Application Conference with the
Planning and Community Development
Department prior to submitting an application
for final determination. At least 10 days prior
to a Pre-Application Conference, the applicant
shall submit a Schematic Land Use Plan for
review by staff. The Schematic Land Use Plan
shall contain enough detail to explain the
function of the site including the location of
land use areas, streets and drives providing
access to the site, pedestrian and vehicular
circulation within the site; buildings, floor
areas, land uses, number of floors and open
spaces contemplated. The applicant shall also
indicate how the requirements of this Section
34-3.1.34 are to be met and shall also
indicate any deviations that are requested
from the Citys Zoning Ordinance standards.

F. BUILDING PLACEMENT
The intent of this section is to provide flexibility in
building placement. In most cases, the GR-1 Overlay
relaxes building and parking setback requirements.
It also provides specific requirements to foster a
pedestrian-friendly environment and provide a quality
environment for this unique district.
Buildings shall be constructed to the front yard buildto
zone (between the minimum and maximum
setback lines) and occupy at least 40 percent of the
full width of the parcel, subject to the following:
1. Build-to zone: The build-to zone is the area
between the minimum and maximum building
setback line. The building façade may set back
up to five feet from the maximum building
setback for up to 50 percent of the building
frontage in order to encourage variation and
design flexibility. Additional variations in setback
for architectural features that meet the intent
and spirit of this ordinance, may be permitted at
the discretion of the approving body.
2. Building Entrances: Recessed areas from three
(3) to five (5) feet from the building line are
encouraged for primary building entrances.
3. Forecourts: The approving body may grant an
exception for a building façade to retreat up to
thirty (30) feet from the building line, into the
building mass, to provide an open space plaza,
courtyard or outdoor dining area provided that at
least thirty-five (35) percent of the total building
frontage falls within the build-to zone.
4. More than one building: In the case where more
than one building is placed on a zoning lot, as
long as one or more buildings meet the above
setback and placement requirements (frontage
buildings), other buildings may be placed behind
frontage buildings, subject to the requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance.
5. Frontage zones: All areas located between the
frontage building(s) and the public right-of-way
shall be either landscaped or paved for
pedestrians. The intent of this district is to
provide a landscaped amenity in front of each
building, located near and parallel to the front or
exterior lot line. These frontage zones shall have
pedestrian-scale lighting. These areas shall be
accented by plaza and landscape features.
Examples of features and materials include, but
are not limited to, brick pavers, colored and
textured concrete, benches, flowers, ornamental
grasses, shrubs, shade trees, decorative rain
gardens, outdoor dining areas (when permitted
by the approving body) and similar features.
G. BUILDING ELEMENTS
The requirements listed in this subsection shall
apply to façades that directly face a street, park,
plaza or river. Walls shall not be blank. The
following additional requirements shall apply:
1. Building Composition. Building façades shall be
comprised of at least two distinct components,
a base or ground floor and a top, and they shall
be vertically varied to avoid large expanses of
monotonous wall space.
A. Base: The base of a building shall be
designed to clearly define where the
building begins. It shall enhance the
pedestrian experience by providing quality
durable materials as well as ample
windows that encourage views into a
ground floor space.
B. Floors: Building floors above the ground
floor shall be visually distinguished from
the exterior by horizontal banding of
building materials and/or colors / textures
or similar treatments to separate one floor
from another.
C. Top: The top of the building shall be
distinguished with a cornice or noticeable
roof edge. Flat roofs shall be enclosed with
parapets. Roofs may be accessible and
may be used as balconies or terraces.
Vegetated roofs are encouraged to cool
buildings and limit stormwater runoff. The
City will not count vegetated roofs as
impervious surfaces for the purpose of
determining stormwater detention
requirements.
D. Vertical variation of façades: Street facing
façades shall be divided vertically into
segments no greater than sixty (60) feet
wide.
2. Windows and Doors. The following shall
regulate the placement and visual appearance
of windows and doors:
A. Materials. Structural elements to support
canopies or signage, along with mullion
and frame systems for windows and doors,
shall be painted, powder-coated or stained
(or the equivalent).
B. Shutters. When shutters are used, whether
operating or decorative, they shall be equal
to the width of one half of the adjacent
window opening
C. Glass. All ground floor glass facing a street
shall be clear or lightly tinted. Reflective

shall be either windows that allow views
into retail space, dining areas, office work
areas, lobbies, pedestrian entrances,
merchandise display areas or other
windows consistent with encouraging an
active pedestrian environment along the
building front. If no merchandise display
area is in place, there shall be at 5-foot
wide minimum interior aisle provided
adjacent to required windows.
E. Ground Floor Entry: At least one functioning
doorway shall be provided for every streetfacing
storefront.

shall regulate the appearance of exterior
building facades:
A. For facades facing a street, park, river or
plaza: At least 90% of all exterior building
façades facing a street, park, river or plaza
shall be finished with a combination of two
or more of the following: Glass, brick, cut
or cast stone, integrally colored concrete
units with brick proportions (e.g., half-high
C brick), split-faced, scored, or fluted
block, textured stucco or other material
deemed equivalent in quality and/or
appearance by the approving body.

J. LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING.
All landscaping and screening shall comply with the
requirements of Sections 34-5.14 and 34-5.15 of
the Zoning Ordinance with the following exceptions,
additions, and modifications:
1. Parking. Parking lots fronting on Grand River
Avenue shall be setback 20 feet from the
Grand River right-of-way. A 2.5 foot decorative
masonry wall constructed of red-brown brick
and/or stone  with a stone cap - shall be
placed 15 feet from and parallel to the right-ofway
to provide screening from an adjacent
roadway. The Planning Commission may, as an
alternate, approve a decorative black metal
fence with vertical red-brown brick columns,
supplemented by a continuous evergreen
hedge (e.g., boxwood) if it provides the same
effective screening up to at least 2.5 feet in
height. For all other street-facing parking lots
the same screening requirements apply, except
that the parking setback from the right-of-way
shall be not less than 10 feet from the street
right-of-way and screen wall or fence shall be
not less than 5 feet from the street right-of-way.
Interior parking lot trees required in Section 34-
5.14.4. shall be provided.
2. Screening Adjacent to Residential. The
requirements of Section 34-5.14, Landscape
Development, shall be met. When adjacent to
residential, required deciduous trees may be
placed on the residential side of a required
screenwall. When a screenwall is required on
the residential side of an alley, the approving
body may permit the screenwall to be placed
on the non-residential side of the adjacent
alley. In the case where the screenwall
adjacent to an alley is intended to screen only
off-street parking and no outdoor storage,
outdoor sales or loading/unloading areas are
visible from an adjacent residential district, the
wall may be reduced to 2.5 feet in height
provided a 10-foot wide landscape buffer strip
is provided between the alley and the wall or
between the wall and off-street parking or other
development on the non-residential
development side. Vegetation in the landscape
buffer strip shall be designed to provide for at
least 40 percent winter and 60 percent
summer screening opacity between 2.5 feet
and 6 feet in height after three years of growth
(see illustration). All screenwalls intended to
screen residential districts and uses shall be
constructed of red-brown brick (clay brick,
integrally colored concrete half-high block or
the equivalent) to provide a uniform
appearance.
3. Pedestrian Pathways. Pedestrian pathways
shall include deciduous, salt-tolerant, lowmaintenance
street trees to help shade
pedestrian walkways and beautify the corridor.
For frontages along public streets, a minimum
of one large deciduous street tree shall be
planted within 10-feet of the public sidewalk for
every 40 lineal feet of lot frontage. Tree wells in
sidewalks, when provided, must be 5 ft. by 5
feet and meet city tree planting requirements.
A decorative metal tree grate shall be provided
to allow infiltration of stormwater and irrigation.
City tree planting details shall be followed.
Perimeter fencing shall not be permitted for
tree wells.

K. PEDESTRIAN ACCESS
The Grand River Corridor is intended to be a
pedestrian-friendly environment. Towards this end,
the following elements are required:
1. Pedestrian pathways shall be provided and
interconnected as follows:
A. There shall be provided along Grand River
Avenue, within the Grand River Avenue
right-of-way, a minimum 8-foot wide
pedestrian path constructed of concrete
and built according to City specifications.
This requirement shall be waived by the
approving body if 1) there is an existing
sidewalk in place that is at least 5 feet
wide and 2) the City or road agency has a
minimum 8-foot wide sidewalk planned
along the site frontage and it is included in
an adopted Capital Improvements
Program, with a construction date planned
within 5 years of the date of final site plan
approval.
B. Internal pedestrian pathways shall connect
parking areas and building entrances to
each other and to public pathways to
provide an interconnected system. At a
minimum, one connection shall be made
for every zoning lot. For zoning lots wider
than 100 feet, one connection shall be
made for each 100 feet of public street
frontage.
2. If the development site abuts the existing or
planned Rouge River pathway system, a nonmotorized
path or walkway connection shall be
made to enable access to the principal
buildings on the site. Two or more properties
may share a private connection to the Rouge
River pathway system provided all have an
internal connection to the shared private
connector. If the Rouge River pathway is not yet
constructed or under construction, the
applicant shall post cash or an automatically
renewing letter of credit equal to 1.5 times the
estimate cost of construction to connect from
the subject site to the Rouge River pathway
system.
L. SUSTAINABLE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
AND OPTIONS
The Applicant shall incorporate the following into
development plans submitted within the GR-1
district:
1. Best management practices for stormwater
management, with special emphasis on
protecting the Rouge River watershed.
2. Bicycle parking. At least two bicycle parking
spaces shall be provided for each principal
building. If sheltered bicycle parking spaces
are provided indoors or using contained bicycle
lockers, the Applicant may reduce the number
of required off-street vehicle parking spaces on
a 1:1 ratio up to 5 spaces provided that at least
80 percent of required off-street vehicle
parking spaces are provided on site.
LEED certifiable standards are encouraged.

34-3.2 BOUNDARIES
1. The boundaries of the zoning districts are
hereby established as shown on the official
zoning district maps maintained by the city
clerk, which shall be open to examination at
any time during regular office hours. Such
maps with all notations, references and other
information shown thereon shall be as much a
part of this chapter as if fully described herein.
2. Unless shown otherwise, the boundaries of the
districts are lot lines, the centerlines of streets,
alleys, roads, streams or such lines extended
and the limits of the city.
3. Where due to the scale, lack of detail or
illegibility of the zoning map accompanying this
chapter, or the quarter section maps
maintained by the city clerk, there is any
uncertainty, contradiction or conflict as to the
intended location of any district boundaries
shown thereon, interpretation concerning the
exact location of district boundary lines shall be
determined upon written application to, or upon
its own motion by, the board of appeals.
34-3.3 ZONING OF VACATED AREAS
Whenever any street, alley or other public way
within the city is vacated by official governmental
action and when the lands within the boundaries
thereof attach to and become a part of lands
adjoining such street, alley or public way, such
lands formerly within such vacated street, alley or
public way shall automatically and without further
governmental action acquire and be subject to the
same zoning regulations as are applicable to the
lands to which the same shall attach, and the same
shall be used for the same use as is permitted
under this chapter for such adjoining lands.
34-3.4 ZONING OF ANNEXED AREAS
Whenever any area is annexed to the city one of the
following conditions shall apply:
1. Land that is zoned previous to annexation shall
be classified as being in whichever district of
this chapter most closely conforms with the
zoning that existed prior to annexation, such
classification to be recommended by the
planning commission to the council and the
council shall approve same by resolution.
2. Land not zoned prior to annexation shall be
automatically classified as an RA-1 district until
a zoning map for such area has been adopted
by the council. The planning commission shall
recommend the appropriate zoning district for
such area within three (3) months after the
matter is referred to by the council.
34-3.5 NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF REGULATIONS
1. Applicability. The notes contained in Section
3.5.2 are additions, exceptions, and
clarifications to the district standards contained
in Section 3.1. The applicability of individual
notes to each district is provided in the tables
on the following pages.
2. Notes to District Standards.
A. For all uses except one-family detached
residential units, landscaping of all yards
abutting a street shall be provided. A
landscape plan shall be submitted in

landscaping is not to totally obscure, but to
soften the overall appearance of the use.
Planning commission approval of the
landscape plan shall be required when the
site plan is reviewed by the planning
commission and whenever a water
retention area is proposed to be located in
any yard abutting a street. Landscaping of
water retention areas shall be guided by
the water retention area design principles
adopted by the planning commission.
B. Utility transformers or pedestals not
exceeding four (4) feet in height may be
placed within the minimum yard setbacks
after a determination of the director of
public services that such placement is
necessary to preserve and protect a
valuable physical feature of the land and
its vegetation.
C. Yards abutting a public right-of-way shall be
treated as front yards and shall be
provided a minimum setback of fifty (50)
feet.

ii. Along those property lines which abut
a one-family residential district, or
which abut one-family detached units
or lots of an approved P.R.D. plan, and
which are not separated from such
units, lots or one-family district by a
major or secondary thoroughfare, or
where the abutting one-family
residential district is not already
developed for a permitted use other
than one-family residential, the
minimum required yard shall be
determined by the following formula:
iii. In all other instances, or where the
planning commission determines that
the adjoining property is indicated on
the future land use plan as an area of
other than one-family residential use,
the minimum required yard shall be
determined by the following formula:
H. The minimum distance between any two
(2) buildings shall be regulated according
to the length and height of such buildings,
but in no instance shall this distance be
less than thirty (30) feet unless there is a
corner-to-corner relationship between
buildings in which case the minimum
distance shall be fifteen (15) feet.
i. The formula regulating the minimum
distance between two (2) buildings is
as follows : ?
Where:
S = Required minimum horizontal
distance between any wall of building
A and any wall of building B or the
vertical prolongation of either.
LA = Total length of building A. The total
length of building A is the length of that
portion or portions of a wall or walls of
building A from which, when viewed
directly from above, lines drawn
perpendicular to building A will
intersect any wall of building B.
LB = Total length of building B. The
total length of building B is the length
of that portion or properties of a wall or
walls of building B from which, when
viewed directly from above, the lines
drawn perpendicular to building B will
intersect any wall of building A.
HA = Height of building A. The height of
building A at any given level is the
height above natural grade level of any
portion or portions of a wall or walls
along the length of building A.
HB = Height of building B. The height of
building B at any given level is the
height above natural grade level of any
portion or portions of a wall or walls
along the length of building B. Natural
grade level shall be the mean level of
the ground immediately adjoining the
portion or portions of the wall or walls
along the total length of the building.

iii. Setbacks, yards adjacent to
residential district:
a. Building setbacks shall be at least
one hundred two (102) feet, but
need not exceed forty (40) percent
of the depth of the lot as
measured from the adjoining
residential district. A forty (40) foot
setback shall be applied to all
other structures and off-street
parking spaces. The forty (40) foot
setback area shall be maintained
by one of or a combination of the
following, depending upon the
characteristics of the area:
(1) The forty (40) foot setback
area may be left in its natural
state if, in the judgment of the
planning commission, it would
provide the best protection for
the residential district and
preservation of the natural
setting. The commission may
require supplementa l
plantings in accordance with
the landscape design
principles if it is necessary to
provide adequate year-round
screening.
(2) Wherever a parking lot is
located adjacent to a
residential district, the parking
lot shall be screened by a
minimum five (5) foot high
wall located adjacent to the
parking lot and between the
parking lot and the residential
area. The plannin g
commission may waive the
requirement for a wall
provided the surface of the
parking lot is located at least
five (5) feet below the
elevation of the ground at the
forty (40) foot setback line.
The construction of the wall
shall be in accordance with
the requirements of Section
34-5.15.9.
(3) If sufficient natural vegetation
does not exist in the forty (40)
foot setback area or if, in the

foot high landscaped earth
berm shall be constructed in
the forty (40) foot setback
area. Landscaping shall be
carried out in accordance with
the landscape design
principles.
(4) In determining the proper
buffering technique, the
planning commission shall
consider the effectiveness of
the buffer in protecting the
residential area and shall also
consider the overall natural
and manmade characteristics
of the OS-3 district.
b. The planning commission may
recommend to the zoning board of
appeals reductions in the setback
requirements for buildings or offstreet
parking if the commission
determines that all of the following
conditions are met:
(1) Undue hardship applies to the
property because of its
unusual size, shape or
dimensions.
(2) A signi f icant l y bet ter
preservation of the natural
topography or natural
vegetation will occur if the
m i n i m u m s e t b a c k
requirements were not
applied.
(3) Effective screening of
adjoining residential areas is
achieved.
iv. Building length:
a. Buildings shall not exceed three
hundred seventy-five (375) feet in
length.
b. The planning commission may
approve alternatives to the
following requirements when, in its
opinion, the objectives of
openness, design variety and
preservation of existing grades or
vegetation are met:
(1) Any portion of a building face
which exceeds one hundred
twenty-five (125) feet in length
shall contain a setback or
offset of at least twenty (20)
feet in the building face.?
(2) A vertical offset, or change in
elevation, is encouraged in
conjunction with any
horizontal offset in order to
interrupt the roofline.
Whenever the change in the
existing ground elevation
exceeds eight (8) feet along
any building face over one
hundred twenty-five (125) feet
long, a one-story vertical offset
in the roofline shall be
required .?
iv. Distance between buildings: The
minimum distance between main
buildings on the same zoning lot shall
be not less than sixty (60) feet or the
distance required by the application of
Section 34-3.5.2.H, whichever is the
greater, unless there is a corner-tocorner
relationship between buildings
in which case the minimum distance
shall be twenty (20) feet.
C. In the OS-3 district, all exterior building
facades and any accessory buildings shall
be of the same finish material as the front
facade of the main building and all
materials used shall be recognized as
finished materials.
5. In the OS-4 district the following conditions
apply:
A. Manufacturing shall not be an assemblyline
type and shall be limited to prototype
equipment, products or materials for
experimental purposes which are not

34-3.15 SUBDIVISION OPEN SPACE PLAN
1. The purpose of a subdivision open space plan
is to promote the preservation of open space
while allowing a reduction in lot sizes in
instances where the reduction would be
compatible with lot sizes existing in the
surrounding area. In reviewing a subdivision
open space plan, the council shall consider the
following objectives:
A. To encourage appropriate relationships in
orientation and size of yards and open
spaces with other developed parcels in the
area.
B. To provide a more desirable living
environment by preserving the natural
character of wetlands, stands of trees,
brooks, hills, and similar natural assets;
C. To encourage developers to use a more
creative approach in the development of
residential areas;
D. To encourage the provision of open space
within reasonable distance of all lot
development of the subdivision and to
further encourage the development of
recreational facilities or preservation of
natural environmental assets;
E. To encourage a more efficient, aesthetic,
and desirable use of open area while
recognizing a reduction in development
costs and by allowing the developer to
bypass natural obstacles on the site.
2. Modifications of the standards as outlined in
Section 34-3.1 may be made in the RA-1B, RA-
2B, RA-1 and RA-2 districts when the following
conditions are met:
A. Lot dimensions may be reduced in
accordance with the following schedule,
provided that the number of residential lots
shall be no greater than if the land area to
be subdivided was developed in the
minimum square foot lot areas as required
for each one-family district under there
Section 34-3.1, Development Standards.
All calculations of density for residential
development shall be predicated upon the
one-family districts having the following
gross densities (including roads):
B. Lot widths shall not be less than the
following:
C. Lot depths shall not be less than the
following:
D. Minimum front and side yard setbacks may
be reduced as follows:
i. RA-1B districts, 45-foot front yard, side
yard shall remain at fifteen (15) feet.
ii. RA-2B, RA-1 and RA-2 districts,
setbacks of the RA-2 district as
indicated in Section 34-3.1 shall apply.

3. For each square foot of land gained under the
provisions of subsection 34-3.15.2 within a
residential subdivision, through the reduction
of lot sizes below the minimum requirements
as outlined in the schedule of regulations,
equal amounts of land shall be dedicated to
the common use of the lot owners in the
subdivision in a manner approved by the city.
4. Access shall be provided to areas dedicated for
the common use of the subdivision for those
lots not bordering on such dedicated areas by
means of streets or pedestrian access ways.
5. Under this subdivision open space approach,
the proprietor shall dedicate sufficient park
area so that each final plan is within maximum
density requirements; provided, however, that
the entire park area within a single block shall
be dedicated as a whole.
6. Application for approval of the subdivision open
space plan shall be submitted at the time of
submission of the preliminary plan for approval
as required by the State Subdivision Control Act
and the subdivision of land ordinance of the
city.
34-3.16 NUISANCE FACTORS
No activity or use shall be permitted in any singlefamily
residential district which becomes or
constitutes a nuisance factor as defined in Section
34-2.2.
34-3.17 ONE-FAMILY CLUSTER OPTION
1. Intent:
A. The intent of this section is to permit the
development of one-family residential
patterns which, through design innovation,
will provide for an alternative means for
development of single-family areas where a
parcel of land has characteristics which
hinder practical development under the
normal subdivision approach or where the
alternative will permit better preservation
of natural features. Also, this option may
permit increased densities under certain
circumstances. To accomplish this,
modifications to the one-family residential
standards, as outlined Section 34-3.1 of
this Chapter, may be permitted in the RA-
1B, RA-2B, RA-1, RA-2, RA-3 and RA-4
districts.
B. In RA-1B, RA-2B, RA-1, RA-2, RA-3 and RA-4
districts, the requirements of Section 34-
3.1 of this chapter may be waived and the
attaching of one-family dwelling units may
be permitted subject to the standards of
this section.
2. Conditions for qualification:
A. Qualification for the cluster option shall be
based on two (2) findings by the planning
commission with final density dependent
upon whether or not the site qualifies
under both findings:
i. First, the planning commission shall
find that the parcel will qualify for the
cluster development option as defined
in Section 34-3.17.2.B.i-viii.
Development would be at the singlefamily
densities permitted in
subsection 34-3.17.3.A. This finding
must be made in all cases.
ii. Second, the planning commission may
additionally find that the parcel is
located in a transition area or is
impacted by nonresidential uses or
traffic on major or secondary
thoroughfares or other similar
conditions. If the planning commission
makes such a finding, it may permit an
increase in density up to the maximum
densities established in subsection 34-
3.17.3.B.
B. The planning commission may approve the
clustering or attaching of buildings on
parcels of land under single ownership and
control which, in the opinion of the
planning commission, have characteristics
that would make sound physical
development under the normal subdivision
approach impractical because of parcel
size, shape or dimension or because the
site is located in a transitional use area or
the site has natural characteristics which
are worth preserving or which make
platting difficult. In approving a parcel for
cluster development, the planning
commission shall find at least one of the
following conditions to exist:
i. The parcel to be developed has
frontage on a major or secondary
thoroughfare and is generally parallel
to such thoroughfare and is of shallow
depth as measured from the
thoroughfare.
ii. The parcel has frontage on a major or
secondary thoroughfare and is of a
narrow width, as measured along the

clearzoning® i
thoroughfare, which makes platting
difficult.
iii. The parcel is shaped in such a way
that the angles formed by its
boundaries make a subdivision
difficult to achieve and the parcel has
frontage on a major or secondary
thoroughfare.
iv. A substantial portion of the parcel's
perimeter is bordered by a major
thoroughfare which would result in a
substantial proportion of the lots of the
development abutting the major
thoroughfare.
v. A substantial portion of the parcel's
perimeter is bordered by land that is
located in other than an RA district or
is developed for a use other than
single-family homes.
vi. The parcel contains a floodplain or
poor soil conditions which result in a
substantial portion of the total area of
the parcel being unbuildable.
vii. The parcel contains natural land forms
which are so arranged that the change
of elevation within the site includes
slopes in excess of ten (10) percent
between these elevations. These
elevation changes and slopes shall
appear as the typical feature of the
site rather than the exceptional or
infrequent features of the site. The
topography is such that achieving road
grades of less than that permitted by
the city would be impossible unless the
site were mass graded. The providing
of one-family clusters will, in the
opinion of the planning commission,
allow a greater preservation of the
natural setting.
viii. The parcel contains natural assets
which would be preserved through the
use of cluster development. Such
assets may include natural stands of
large trees, land which serves as a
natural habitat for wildlife, unusual
topographic features or other natural
assets which should be preserved.
C. In order to qualify for development under
subsection 34-3.17.2.B.vi, vii, or viii.
above, the planning commission shall
determine that the parcel has those
characteristics and the request shall be
supported by written and/or graphic
documentation, prepared by a landscape
architect, engineer, professional
community planner, registered architect or
environmental design professional. Such
documentation shall include the following
as appropriate: soil test borings, floodplain
map, topographic map of maximum twofoot
contour interval, inventory of natural
assets.
D. This option shall not apply to those parcels
of land which have been split for the
specific purpose of coming within the
requirements of this cluster option section.
3. Permitted densities. In a cluster development,
the maximum densities permitted shall be as
follows (including streets):
A. For those parcels qualifying under
subsection 34-3.17.2.A.i.:
B. For those parcels under both subsections
34-3.17.2.A.i.. and 34-3.17.2.A.ii.:
C. Water areas within the parcel may be
included in the computation of density
provided that land adjacent to the water is
substantially developed as open space.
D. In those instances where increased
densities may be permitted under Section
34-3.17.3.B. above, the planning
commission must find that such increased
density does not preclude the application

of Section 34-3.17.4.E and does not result
in the destruction or total removal of such
natural features as enumerated under
Section 34-3.17. 2.B.vi, vii, or viii.
4. Development standards and requirements. On
parcels meeting the criteria of Section 34-
3.17.2.A above, the minimum yard setbacks,
heights and minimum lot sizes per unit as
required by Section 34-3.1 of this chapter, may
be waived and the attaching of dwelling units
may be accomplished subject to the following:
A. The attaching of one-family dwelling units,
one to another, may be permitted when
such homes are attached by means of one
of the following:
i. Through a common party wall forming
interior room space which does not
have over fifty (50) percent of its
length in common with an abutting
dwelling wall, including garage. This
may be increased to seventy-five (75)
percent if, in the opinion of the
planning commission, greater open
space or preservation of natural assets
would result;
ii. By means of an architectural wall
detail which does not form interior
room space;
iii. Through common garage party walls of
adjacent structures;
iv. No other common party wall
relationship is permitted and the
number of units attached in this
manner shall not exceed three (3). This
number may be increased to four (4) if,
in the opinion of the planning
commission greater preservation of
natural assets would result.
B. Yard requirements shall be provided as
follows:
i. Spacing between groups of attached
buildings or between groups of four (4)
unattached buildings shall be equal to
at least thirty (30) feet in an RA-1B
district, twenty-five (25) feet in an RA-1
district, twenty (20) feet in RA-2 and
RA-3 districts, and fifteen (15) feet in
an RA-4 district, measured between
the nearest points of adjacent
buildings. The minimum distance
between detached units within groups
of four (4) shall be fifteen (15) feet,
unless there is a corner to corner
relationship in which case the
minimum may be reduced to ten (10)
feet.
ii. Building setbacks from minor
residential streets shall be determined
after consideration of potential
vehicular traffic volume, site design
and pedestrian safety. It is intended
that setbacks for each dwelling shall
be such that one car length space will
be available between the garage or
required off-street parking spaces and
the street pavement. In determining
the setbacks from minor residential
streets, the planning commission may
use the following guidelines:
a. Garages or required off-street
parking spaces shall not be
located less than twenty (20) feet
from the right-of-way of a public
street unless such street or
portion thereof is serving as
access to not more than sixteen
(16) residential units.
b. Where streets are private or the
planning commission does not
require the twenty-foot setback
from a public right-of-way, garages
or required off-street parking
spaces shall not be located less
than twenty (20) feet from the
pavement edge of the street or the
shoulder of a street.
iii. That side of a cluster adjacent to a
major or secondary thoroughfare shall
not be nearer to such street than
twenty-five (25) feet, except that in
those areas where topography meets
the topographic conditions set forth in
34-3.17.2.B.vii. above lands
immediately adjacent to such streets
having slopes in excess of ten (10)
percent, the front yard may be reduced
by five (5) feet, but in no instance shall
a structure be closer to the road rightof-
way line than one-half the front yard
setback for the district in which it is
located.
iv. Any side of a cluster adjacent to a
private road shall not be nearer to
such road than ten (10) feet.

v. Buildings shall not be fewer than
twenty-five (25) feet from any property
line.
C. In computing the height of any individual
dwelling unit in a cluster on a slope in
excess of ten (10) percent and when the
unit is constructed on posts, the first ten
(10) feet of height in the posts shall not be
computed. Application of the definition of
building height shall apply over and above
this ten (10) feet of post height.
D. The area in open space (including
subdivision recreation areas and water)
accomplished through the use of onefamily
cluster shall represent at least
fifteen (15) percent of the horizontal
development area of a one-family cluster
development.
E. In order to provide an orderly transition of
density, where the parcel proposed for use
as a cluster development abuts a onefamily
residential district, the planning
commission shall determine that the
abutting one-family district is effectively
buffered by means of one of the following
within the cluster development:
i. Single-family lots subject to the
standards of Section 34-3.1 of this
chapter;
ii. Detached buildings with setbacks as
required by Section 34-3.1 of this
chapter for the applicable residential
district;
iii. Open or recreation space;
iv. Changes in topography which provide
an effective buffer;
v. A major or secondary thoroughfare;
vi. Some other similar means of providing
a transition;
vii. In those instances where the parcel
has been qualified for the cluster
option under subparagraph 34-
3.17.2.B.i. or where the adjoining land
may be used for purposes other than
detached one-family dwellings, the
planning commission may approve a
plan in which the units are attached if
the parcel is too small to provide the
transition and the greatest setback
possible is provided.
5. Procedures:
A. In making application for approval under
this section, the applicant shall file a sworn
statement that the parcel has not been
split for the purpose of coming within the
requirements of this option, and shall
further file a sworn statement indicating
the date of acquisition of the parcel by the
present owner.
B. Qualification for cluster development:
i. Application to the planning
commission for qualification of a
parcel for cluster development shall
include documentation substantiating
one or more of the characteristics
outlined in Section 34-3.17.2 above.
The planning commission shall hold a
public hearing on the application for
qualification, with notice given in
accordance with Section 34-6.2.
ii. The planning commission shall make a
preliminary determination as to
whether or not a parcel qualified for
the cluster option under one or both of
the provisions of 34-3.17.2.A above,
based upon the documentation
submitted.
iii. Preliminary determination by the
planning commission that a parcel
qualifies for cluster development does
not assure approval of the site plan
and, therefore, does not approve the
cluster option. It does, however, give
an initial indication as to whether or
not a petitioner should proceed to
prepare a site plan.
C. Site plan and cluster approval:
i. The planning commission shall hold a
public hearing on the site plan after an
initial review of a preliminary plan
which shall not require a public
hearing.
ii. In submitting a proposed layout under
this section, the sponsor of the
development shall include, along with
the site plan, the following:
a. Typical building elevations and
floor plans, topography drawn at
two-foot contour intervals, all
computations relative to acreage
and density, a preliminary grading
plan and any other details which
will assist in reviewing the
proposed plan.
b. An accurate tree survey indicating
the location of all trees on the site
of six-inch DBH or greater. Such

survey shall be at the same scale
as the site plan.
iii. For those parcels which qualified
under the provisions of Section 34-
3.17.2.B.vi, vii, or viii., one copy of the
site plan superimposed on a recent
aerial photograph of a scale of at least
one inch equals two hundred (200)
feet shall be submitted for review to
show the relationship of the site plan
to existing natural features and to
adjacent developments.
iv. Site plans submitted under this option
shall be accompanied by information
as required in Section 27-60(2), (6)
and (7); provided, however, that:
a. Submission of an open space plan
and cost estimates with the
preliminary site plan shall be at
the option of the sponsor;
b. The open space plan and cost
estimate shall be submitted prior
to final review or the public
hearing.
v. The planning commission shall give
notice of the public hearing in
accordance with Section 34-6.2.
vi. If the planning commission is satisfied
that the proposal meets the letter and
spirit of this chapter and should be
approved, it shall give tentative
approval with the conditions upon
which such approval should be based.
If the planning commission is not
satisfied that the proposal meets the
letter and spirit of this chapter, or finds
that approval of the proposal would be
detrimental to existing development in
the general area and should not be
approved, it shall record the reasons
therefore in the minutes of the
planning commission meeting. Notice
of approval or disapproval of the
proposal together with copies of the
proposal together with copies of all
layouts and other relevant information
shall be forwarded to the city clerk. If
the proposal has been approved by the
planning commission, the clerk shall
place the matter upon the agenda of
the council. If disapproved, the
applicant shall be entitled to a hearing
before the council, if requested in
writing within thirty (30) days after
action by the planning commission.
vii. The council shall conduct a public
hearing on the proposed open space
plan and site plan for the cluster
option and shall give notice in
accordance with Section 34-6.2. If the
council approves the plans, it shall
instruct the city attorney to prepare a
contract, setting forth the condition
upon which approval is based, which
contract, after approval by the council,
shall be entered into between the city
and the applicant prior to the issuance
of a building permit for any
construction in accordance with site
plans.
viii. As a condition for the approval of the
site plan and open space plan by the
council, the applicant shall deposit
cash, irrevocable letters of credit or
other equivalent forms of security as
approved by the city attorney in the
amount of the estimated cost of the
proposed improvements to the open
land guaranteeing the completion of
such improvement within a time to be
set by the council. Actual development
of the open space shall be carried out
concurrently with the construction of
dwelling units.
34-3.18 MAJOR ROAD FRONTAGE OPTION
1. Intent. The intent of this option is to permit
alternative means of residential development
for small lots that front on major thoroughfares.
2. Qualifications for option. Zoning lots in the RA-3
and RA-4 districts may qualify for use under
this option provided that the zoning lot has one
lot line abutting a major thoroughfare. The
options shall not apply to more than one
building on a zoning lot, it being the intent to
limit their application to small zoning lots which
border major thoroughfares.
3. Options permitted:
A. Notwithstanding the requirements of
Section 34-3.1 of this chapter, one- or twofamily
dwelling units may be permitted,
subject to the requirements and standards
of this section.
B. One-family dwellings may be permitted on
a zoning lot with frontage on a major
thoroughfare, subject to the following
conditions:

i. Notwithstanding limitations imposed
by other provisions of this chapter, a
single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on
any single lot of record at the effective
date of adoption [February 18, 1985]
or amendment of this chapter. This
provision shall apply even though such
lot fails to meet the requirements for
area of width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district;
provided, that yard dimensions and
other requirements not involving area
or width, or both, of the lot shall

ii. Setbacks shall be as provided under
Section 34-3.18.4.
C. Two-family dwellings may be permitted on
lots which conform to the lot area and
width requirements of the district, after
public hearing and review and approval of
a preliminary site plan by the planning
commission and under such conditions as
the planning commission imposes after
finding that the use is not injurious to the
district and environs; is not contrary to the
spirit and purpose of this chapter; is not
incompatible with already existing uses in
the area; would not interfere with orderly
development of the area; and would not be
detrimental to the safety or convenience of
vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
i. The objective of site plan review shall
be to discourage rows of two-family
dwellings along the major
thoroughfares. To accomplish this end,
the planning commission may require
variety in dwelling unit orientation or
access as they relate to existing and
potential future uses of adjoining
property and to the major
thoroughfare. Site plans which require
backing vehicles onto the major
thoroughfare shall be permitted only if
there is no alternative. Combining of
driveways and easements to permit
such combination may be required.
ii. On a corner lot, no more than one
dwelling entrance and/or garage shall
face an existing one-family detached
dwelling unit located across a
separating minor residential street.
iii. Notice of a public hearing shall be
given in accordance with Section 34-
6.2
4. Setback, area and density requirements:
A. The front and rear yard requirements of
Section 34-3.1 of this chapter shall apply,
except that such yards need not exceed
twenty (20) percent of the depth of the lot;
but in no instance shall the yard be less
than twenty-five (25) feet.
B. The side yard requirements of Section 34-
3.1 shall apply except that exterior side
yards abutting a street may be reduced to
twenty-five (25) feet if a greater setback is
required by Section 34-3.1.
C. All dwelling units shall meet the minimum
height and floor area requirements of
Section 34-3.1.
34-3.19 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL
DEVELOPMENT
1. Height, bulk, density and area standards:
A. For the purpose of computing and
controlling population density in RP-1 and
RP-2 districts, the following standards shall
apply:
i. The entire gross area of the PRD,
including street rights-of-way, parks,
schools and other public or private
open space, shall be included in the
computation of area; provided,
however, that school sites may be
included only to a maximum of fifteen
(15) acres or twenty-five (25) percent
of the total open space, whichever is
the lesser amount. Subaqueous or
submerged bottom land or lakes or
streams shall be excluded in
computing the area of a parcel except
that when land abutting such lakes or
streams is substantially developed in
park or open space for the use of
residents of the PRD, the surface area
of such lakes or streams may be used
to compute density.
ii. Maximum density permitted shall be
eight (8) bedrooms per acre in RP-1
and ten (10) bedrooms per acre in RP-
2, subject to the following:
a. A minimum of fifty (50) detached
one-family dwelling units must be
included within the PRD.

b. Not less than thirty-three and onethird
(33 1/3) percent of the total
number of bedrooms shall be in
detached single-family dwellings.
c. One-family detached dwellings
shall be assumed to have four (4)
bedrooms for each dwelling, no
more and no less.
d. No more than ten (10) percent of
the total bedrooms shall be
included in efficiency apartments
or one-bedroom multiple-family
dwelling units.
e. For the purposes of computing
density, a den, library or other
extra room shall not count as a
bedroom unless a closet opens
directly to such room.
f. Notwithstanding Section34-
3.19.1.A.ii.c. above, subject to the
approval of the planning
commission, one-family detached
dwellings may be assumed to have
three (3) bedrooms, no more and
no less, for each dwelling,
provided that not less than fifty
(50) percent of the total number of
bedrooms shall be in detached
single-family dwellings.
iii. Not less than twenty-five (25) percent
of the gross area of the site shall be
provided as park or open space for the
use of the residents of the PRD, or as a
private golf course whose membership
need not include residents of the PRD.
The planning commission may modify
the requirements of this subsection
when the character of the
d e v e l o p ment makes such
requirements burdensome or
impractical.
iv. Open space may include parks and
recreation area, wooded lots, schools,
golf courses, water areas and any use
of a similar nature approved by the
council; provided, however, that at
least one acre for each two hundred
(200) bedrooms shall be preserved as
park, recreation or open space rather
than as a golf course, water area,
school or similar limited use area.
B. In order to provide an orderly transition of
density, where the project being proposed
for use as a PRD immediately abuts an RA
district (not including districts separated by
a major or secondary thoroughfare), the
city may require that the area immediately
abutting and within three hundred (300)
feet of such RA district shall be developed
as single-family lots, as open or recreation
space, or as detached one-family dwelling
units with setbacks as required in the
abutting residential district.
C. One-family dwellings shall be subject to the
requirements of Section 34-3.1 of this
chapter as modified by Section 34-3.15 or
34-3.17 applicable to the RA-1 and RA-2
districts, except as otherwise modified in
the approved plan or the preliminary plat.
Modified setbacks shall be indicated
specifically on the approved preliminary
plat.
D. Multiple dwellings shall be subject to the
requirements of Section 34-3.1 of this
chapter, except as otherwise modified in
the approved plan. See also Section 34-

aesthetic and desirable use of the
open areas and the plan is in keeping
with the physical character of the city
and the area surrounding the
development.
v. The applicant has made provision to
assure that those areas shown on the
plan for use by the public or occupants
of the development will be or have
been committed for that purpose. The
council may require that conveyances
or other documents be placed in
escrow to accomplish this.
vi. Provisions have been made to provide

iii. An approved plan may be terminated
by the applicant or the applicant's
successors or assigns, prior to any
development within the area involved,
by filing with the city and recording in
the county records an affidavit so
stating. The approval of the plan shall
terminate upon such recording.
iv. No approved plan shall be terminated
after development commences except
with the approval of the council and of
all parties in interest in the land.
v. Within a period of two (2) years
following approval by the council, final
plats or site plans for an area
embraced within the PRD must be
submitted as hereinafter provided. If
such plats or plans have not been
submitted and approved within the two
(2) year period, the right to develop
under the approved plan may be

density thereof, parking areas, utilities,
churches, schools and areas to be set
aside for the use of the public or by
residents within the development
(scale: one inch equals fifty (50) feet).
ii. An estimate of the costs of
improvements to the open space
areas, such as plant materials, ground
cover, recreation equipment, etc., shall
be submitted for review. The estimate
will be used to establish an escrow
amount to cover the cost of the
improvements.
iii. The proposed topography (contour
interval of not more than two (2) feet)

amendments or changes to an approved PRD
plan shall be submitted to the director of public
services. The director shall determine whether
the proposed modification is of such minor
nature as not to affect the overall character of
the plan, and in such event may approve or
deny the proposed amendment. If the director
determines the proposed amendment is
substantial in nature, the amendment shall be

34-3.20 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT?
1. Purpose; applicable regulations:
A. The Planned Unit Development (PUD)
option is intended to permit, with city
approval, private or public development
which is substantially in accord with the
goals and objectives of the Master Plan for
Land Use.
B. The development permitted under this
section shall be considered as an optional
means of development only upon terms
agreeable to the city. The provision of this
option imposes no obligation of the city to
encourage or foster its use. The decision to
approve its use shall be at the sole
discretion of the city.
C. Utilization of the PUD option will permit
flexibility in the regulation of land
development by encouraging innovation
through an overall development plan to
provide variety in design and layout; to
achieve economy and efficiency in the use
of land, natural resources, energy and in
the provision of public services and
utilities; to encourage the creation of
useful open spaces particularly suited to
the needs of the parcel in question; and
provide appropriate housing, employment,
service and shopping opportunities suited
to the needs of the residents of the city.
D. It is further intended that the Planned Unit
Development may be used to permit
nonresidential uses of residentially zoned
areas; to permit residential uses of nonresidentially
zoned areas; to permit
densities or lot sizes which are different
from the applicable district and to permit
the mixing of land uses that would
otherwise not be permitted; provided that
other objectives are met and the resulting
development would promote the public
health, safety and welfare.
E. It is further intended that the development
will be laid out so that the various land
uses and building bulk will relate to each
other and to adjoining existing and planned
uses in such a way that they will be
compatible, with no material adverse
impact of one use on another.
2. Criteria for qualifications. In order for a zoning
lot to qualify for the Planned Unit Development
option, the zoning lot shall either be located
within an overlay district or other area
3-108 1
Purpose and
2 Definitions Introduction Zoning
3 Districts Use
4 Standards Site
5 Standards Development
6 Procedures Admin and
Enforcement 7 Farmington Hills Zoning Ordinance
clearzoning® i
designated in this chapter as qualifying for the
PUD option, or it must be demonstrated that all
of the following criteria will be met as to the
zoning lot:
A. The PUD option may be effectuated in any
zoning district.
B. The use of this option shall not be for the
sole purpose of avoiding the applicable
zoning requirements. Any permission given
for any activity or building or use not
normally permitted shall result in an
improvement to the public health, safety
and welfare in the area affected.
C. The PUD shall not be utilized in situations
where the same land use objectives can be
accomplished by the application of
conventional zoning provisions or
standards. Problems or constraints
presented by applicable zoning provisions
shall be identified in the PUD application.
Asserted financial problems shall be
substantiated with appraisals of the
property as currently regulated and as
proposed to be regulated.
D. The Planned Unit Development option may
be effectuated only when the proposed
land use will not materially add service and
facility loads beyond those contemplated in
the Future Land Use Plan unless the
proponent can demonstrate to the sole
satisfaction of the city that such added
loads will be accommodated or mitigated
by the proponent as part of the Planned
Unit Development.
E. The Planned Unit Development must meet,
as a minimum, one of the following
objectives of the city:
i. To permanently preserve open space
or natural features because of their
exceptional characteristics or because
they can provide a permanent
transition or buffer between land uses.
ii. To permanently establish land use
patterns which are compatible or
which will protect existing or planned
uses.
iii. To accept dedication or set aside open
space areas in perpetuity.
iv. To provide alternative uses for parcels
which can provide transition buffers to
residential areas.
v. To guarantee the provision of a public
improvement which could not
otherwise be required that would
further the public health, safety, or
welfare, protect existing or future uses
from the impact of a proposed use, or
alleviate an existing or potential
problem relating to public facilities.
vi. To promote the goals and objectives of
the Master Plan for Land Use.
vii. To foster the aesthetic appearance of
the city through quality building design
and site development, the provision of
trees and landscaping beyond
minimum requirements; the
preservation of unique and/or historic
sites or structures; and the provision of
open space or other desirable features
of a site beyond minimum
requirements.
viii. To bring about redevelopment of sites
where an orderly change of use is
determined to be desirable.
F. The PUD shall not be allowed solely as a
means of increasing density or as a
substitute for a variance request; such
objectives should be pursued through the
normal zoning process by requesting a
zoning change or variance.
3. Uses permitted:
A. A land use plan shall be proposed for the
area to be included within the PUD. The
land use plan shall be defined by the
districts of the zoning ordinance which are
to be applicable to the parts of the PUD
area.
B. Principal permitted uses in Sections 34-
3.1.1 through 34-3.1.30 of this chapter
shall be allowed within the districts
identified on the PUD plan, except that
some uses may be specifically prohibited
from districts designated on the PUD plan.
Alternatively, the city may permit uses not
permitted in the district if specifically noted
on the PUD plan. Conditions applicable to
uses permitted subject to special
conditions shall be used as guidelines for
design and layout but may be varied by the
planning commission provided that such
conditions are indicated on the PUD plan.
4. Height, bulk, density and area standards. The
standards as to height, bulk, density, setbacks
of each district shall be applicable within each
district area designated on the plan except as

specifically modified and noted on the PUD
plan.
5. Submittal procedures and conditions:
A. Request for qualification:
i. Any person owning or controlling land
in the city may make application for
consideration of a Planned Unit
Development. Unless otherwise
provided, such application shall be
made by submitting a request for a
preliminary determination as to
whether or not a parcel qualifies for
the PUD option.
ii. A request shall be submitted to the
city. The submission shall include the
information required by subparagraph
iii. below.
iii. Based on the documentation
submitted, the planning commission
shall make a preliminary determination
as to whether or not a parcel qualifies
for the PUD option under the
provisions of Section 34-3.20.2 above.
A preliminary determination that the
parcel qualifies will not assure a
favorable recommendation or approval
of the PUD option, but is intended only
to provide an initial indication as to
whether the applicant should proceed
to prepare a PUD plan upon which a
final determination would be based.
The submittal must include the
following:

areas, streets providing access to
the site, pedestrian and vehicular
circulation within the site; dwelling
unit density and types; and
buildings or floor areas
contemplated.
c. A plan for the protection of natural
features. In those instances where
such protection is not an objective
of the PUD option, the plan need
not be submitted.
iv. The planning commission shall
approve or deny the applicant's
request for qualification. Whether
approved or denied, the applicant may
then proceed to prepare a PUD plan
upon which a final determination will
be based.

not directly abut such thoroughfare,
vehicular access shall be by means of a
public right-of-way of not less than sixty
(60) feet in width. Access shall not be
permitted through one-family residential
districts unless property bordering such
access is publicly owned or is already
developed for a permitted use other than
one-family residential.
C. Storm drainage facilities shall be provided
so as to protect residents of the mobile
home park as well as adjacent property
owners. Facilities shall be of a capacity
which will ensure rapid drainage and
prevent the accumulation of stagnant
pools of water in or adjacent to the park.
Storm drainage facilities shall meet the
requirements of the state department of
public health and the applicable site plan
design standards of the city.
D. All utility lines shall be underground.

(25) feet in height. Mobile homes shall not
exceed fourteen (14) feet in height.
D. A mobile home park shall provide an open
area of at least twenty-five thousand
(25,000) square feet. For mobile home
parks containing more than fifty (50) sites,
the minimum area shall be increased by
two hundred (200) square feet for each
site over fifty (50). Open space resulting
from site reductions permitted in
subsection 34-3.21.3.A above may be
applied to this open space requirement.
Land designated for recreational use shall
be so located and designed to facilitate
access and usability and shall be shaped
so that its length is no greater than three
(3) times its width.
34-3.22 MARGINAL ACCESS DRIVES
Uses in the OS-2 and B-4 districts may be subject
to the following conditions:
1. In those instances where the planning
commission finds that an excessive number of
ingress or egress points may occur with relation
to major or secondary thoroughfares, thereby
diminishing the carrying capacity of the
thoroughfare, the commission may require
marginal access roads and, to assure adequate
traffic circulation on the site, may require the
development of parking so that contiguous lots
on abutting properties will allow traffic
circulation from one property to another
without reentering the public thoroughfare.
2. The marginal access road shall be adjacent to
the front property line and shall be at least
twenty-two (22) feet wide. The marginal access
road shall be either dedicated as public right-ofway
or shall be an easement which will permit
the use of the marginal access road for traffic
circulation from one property to another. Such
easement shall be in a form acceptable to the
council, and approved by the code enforcement
officer prior to the issuance of a building
permit. No permanent structures such as curbs
shall be permitted within the easement or rightof-
way although temporary features such as
wheel stops may be permitted. Each property
owner shall be responsible for maintenance of
the easement so that it remains usable as a
means of getting from one property to another.
The easement shall be recorded with the
county register of deeds prior to the issuance of
an occupancy permit.
3. In reviewing the site plan, the planning
commission may permit parking in the
easement area, provided that the layout is such
that the parking can be removed at a later date
when the marginal access road is needed for
access to adjacent properties, without
disrupting the layout of the parking area.
Temporary parking spaces permitted within the
marginal access drive shall not be included in
computing the minimum off-street parking
requirements under Section 34-5.2.
4. Where marginal access roads are required, the
planning commission shall recommend that the
entire twenty-two-foot area be paved up to the
abutting properties. Backing from parking
spaces onto the marginal access road shall not
be permitted except on a temporary basis. The
site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation
of the marginal access road at the property line
and the code enforcement officer shall
maintain a record of all marginal access road
elevations so that their grades can be
coordinated. Marginal access road elevations
shall conform to elevations established by the
council or, if not so established, be not more
than one foot above or below the elevation of
the adjoining property. Paving of the marginal
access road shall meet construction
specifications set by the council.
5. The site shall be laid out so that a portion of
the front yard open space required shall serve
as a separation between the marginal access
drive and the off-street parking lot.
6. Temporary entrances and exits may be
approved for individual sites provided money is
placed in escrow to assure elimination of
temporary entrances and exits. Occupancy
permits shall not be issued until monies have
been deposited with the city.
7. In determining which entrances and exits will
be permanent and which will be temporary, the
planning commission shall generally be guided
by a minimum distance of six hundred (600)
feet between entrances and exits and by the
location of existing or approved drives on the
opposite side of the street.
34-3.23 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN.
The use of Best Management Practices with regard
to stormwater management is strongly encouraged.
In addition, buildings are strongly encouraged to
achieve silver or higher LEED certification or meet
the equivalent standards of a similar rating agency
or organization as determined by the City.

Farmington Hills Zoning Ordinance
clearzoning® i
Alternatively, the building can meet the intent of
such standards by complying with the equivalent or
similar guidelines adopted by the City.
For plans meeting the intent of the above
paragraph, the approving body will permit an
expedited plan review process including concurrent
review of site plan and landscape plan, thereby
combining Steps 1 and 2 in the approval process.
In addition, for those underlying zoning districts
requiring fifty (50%) percent of the required front
yard to be open space, this requirement may be
reduced to thirty (30%) percent in order to provide
more flexibility to place rain gardens, landscaped
areas, and similar open space features where they
can have the greatest stormwater management or
LEED certification (or equivalent) benefits.
34-3.24 PEDESTRIAN ACCESS
1. Pedestrian access-ways of sufficient width and
design to allow convenient use shall be
provided between public sidewalks and
principal building entrances, between principal
building entrances and off-street parking lots,
and between uses on abutting parcels. Such
access-ways may not be included in the
calculations of open space as required under
Section 34-3.1 and Section 34-3.5.2.J unless,
in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the
access-way is an integral part of a larger open
space.
2. Public access to bike paths shall be
encouraged. Bike paths providing such access
may be included in the calculation of open
space required under Section 34-3.1 and
Section 34-3.5.2.J.
34-3.25 NOISE AND GLARE.
Noise and glare on the site shall not exceed the
standards set forth in Chapter 17, Article VII
34-3.26 GENERAL EXCEPTIONS
The regulations in this chapter shall be subject to
the interpretations and exceptions in this article.

unique characteristics that make it
impractical to include them within a
specific use district classification. Such
uses may be permitted subject to Section
34-6.3.
B. These uses require special consideration
since they service an area larger than the
city or draw from a market beyond the city
or require sizeable land areas, creating

clearzoning® i
D. The following uses may be permitted under
this section:
i. Outdoor theaters:
a. Outdoor theaters may be
permitted by the planning
commission.
b. Because outdoor theaters possess
the unique characteristic of being
used only after dark, and since
they develop a concentration of
vehicular traffic in terms of ingress
and egress from their parking
area, they may be permitted in B-3
districts only when the site in
question abuts an LI-1 district.
Outdoor theaters shall further be
subject to the following conditions:
(1) The proposed internal design
shall receive approval from
the building inspector and the
city engineer as to adequacy
of drainage, lighting and other
technical aspects.
(2) Points of ingress and egress
shall not be located within two
hundred (200) feet of the
right-of-way of any street
which intersects the street
providing ingress or egress.

to enter the facility shall be
provided off-street waiting
space. No vehicle shall be
required to wait or stand
within a dedicated right-ofway.

by a six (6) foot high obscuring
fence, wall or berm on those
sides abutting a residential,
special purpose, office district
or pub l ic street or
thoroughfare. On those sides
abutting a residential district,
a fifteen (15) foot wide
greenbelt shall be planted in
accordance with Section 34-
5.14.
ii. Commercial television and radio
towers. Radio and television towers
and their attendant facilities may be
permitted by the planning commission

be located centrally on a continuous
parcel of not less than ten (10) acres
and shall have a dimension of not less
than one and one-half (1 1/2) times
the height of the tower measured from
the base of the tower to each property
line.
iii. Cemeteries. Because of the effects of
the large land area devoted to this use,
on the continuity of local streets, and
because this use does not require the
normal services (sewers, water, etc.),
the planning commission may permit
this use in an R residential district only
when the following conditions are met:
a. The location of a cemetery may be
permitted in any quarter section of
any R district when the quarter
section does not have more than
fifty-one (51) percent of its land
area in recorded plats.
b. All access to the site shall be in
accordance with Section 34-5.13.

contingent on a satisfactory
drainage plan approved by the city
engineer.

operate, maintain or allow to exist
upon property owned, leased,
subleased or used by such person, any
gravel pit, sand pit or other excavation,

unless such use is permitted by the
council and licensed in accordance
with chapter 24.
v. Public riding or boarding stables:

nursery or greenhouse may be
conducted within the
residence building of the
owner or operator if located
upon the property on which
the nursery or greenhouse
operations are being carried
on.
2. Historic buildings:
A. Intent. There are within the city certain
historic buildings which are recognized as
such by Ordinance No. C-1-81, Farmington

negative impact on adjacent properties or
the surrounding neighborhood and will not
interfere with the implementation of the
city master plan for future land use.
B. Uses permitted:
i. If located in any RA district, the uses
permitted shall be restricted to those
permitted in an RC or OS-3 district.

landscaped in accordance
with an approved plan. The
landscape plan shall be
submitted for review in
accordance with Section 34-
5.14.3.
c. Public facilities:
(1) Approval of this option may be
conditioned upon a
determination that the use is
to be adequately served by
public facilities including
sanitary sewer, storm sewers
or drainage and water supply.
If public facilities are
determined to be inadequate,
approval may be conditioned
upon improvements which will
mitigate current problems.
(2) Approval of this option may
also be conditioned upon
improvements to vehicular
access which will mitigate
current or anticipated
problems. Such improvements
may include the widening or
narrowing of existing access
drives; the provision of
acceleration/deceleration or
passing lanes or tapers for
existing drives; the closing of
or addition of access drives or
improvement of vehicular
circulation patterns on the site

plan within this two (2) years shall
extend the approval of the
functional land use plan in
accordance with the site plan
approval; provided, however, that
any site plan presented more than
two (2) years after approval of the
functional land use plan shall
comply with the zoning ordinance
provisions then applicable.
c. Site plans shall be submitted in
accordance with Section 34-6.1.
Such plans may be for phases of
development, provided that each
phase submitted shall not exceed
the density or floor area
requirements on a cumulative
basis. The plan shall portray the
location of the buildings, parking,
buffer yards, drives and aisles and
any other major features to be
proposed. The plan shall also
indicate land area, floor area,
number of dwelling units, dwelling
unit types and uses proposed
within each functional use area. If
the site plan is for a phase, a
generalized site plan at a scale of
not less than one inch equals one
hundred (100) feet shall be
submitted for the entire SP-5
district.
vi. Amendments to functional land use
plan:
a. Minor changes to the boundaries
of use areas shown on the
functional use plan may be made
with approval of the director of
public services, provided that in
the director's opinion the change
has no impact beyond the
boundaries of the zoning lot.
b. Changes that are in the opinion of
the director of public services
substantial or material shall be
considered as amendments and
shall require a public hearing and
planning commission approval as
above; provided however, that the
impact assessment may be limited
to impacts generated by the
changes proposed.
4. Special land uses not otherwise permitted:
A. Intent. There are certain land uses which
are temporary and which do not require
permanent improvements of a structural
nature. Such uses may exist for short or
long periods of time. They are uses which
are not permitted within the zoning district
where proposed, but may be considered
acceptable because nearby areas are
vacant or because the characteristics of
the use are not incompatible with existing
uses in the area. The intent of this section
is also to permit temporary construction
uses which are necessary for
improvements being constructed on other
properties in the city. Such uses may be
permitted after review and approval by the
planning commission.
B. Special land uses not otherwise permitted.
Special land uses not otherwise permitted
may be permitted by the planning
commission subject to the following:
i. The planning commission shall find
that the character of existing uses or
lack of existing uses in an area is such
that permitting the special land use
would not, as of the time the
permission is granted, be injurious to
the district and environs of the area.
Such permission shall be given for a
specific time period set by the planning
commission.
ii. In classifying uses as not requiring
capital improvements, the planning
commission shall determine that they
are either demountable structures
related to the permitted use of the
land like recreation development such
as, but not limited to, golf driving
ranges or outdoor archery courts, or
are structures which do not require
foundations, heating systems or
sanitary sewer connections.
iii. All setbacks, land coverage, off-street
parking, lighting and other
requirements for protecting the public
health, safety, peace, morals, comfort,
convenience and general welfare of
the inhabitants of the city shall be
determined by the planning
commission as being appropriate to
the site and surrounding area.
iv. The act of granting approval of a use
not otherwise permitted in a district
shall in no way be construed as a
change in the basic uses permitted in
the district nor on the property wherein
the use is permitted.

use after reviewing the area for any
changes that may have occurred which
would be negatively impacted by
continuation of the temporary use and
after determining that there have been
no negative impacts from the use.
vii. This section shall not be used to
permit seasonal outdoor sales uses
regulated in Chapter 22, Article III of
the City Code and Section 34-4.56 of
this Ordinance.
C. Temporary construction uses not accessory
to existing uses. Temporary construction
uses and structures not directly accessory
to any existing use of the zoning lot, but
necessary for the use or improvement of
some other property or properties within
the City for a permitted purpose.
i. The planning commission shall
examine the proposed use and
determine that the petitioner has
adequately explored alternative
locations and that the location
proposed is the most reasonable.
ii. The planning commission shall
examine the location of structures on
the site and determine that they are
the most appropriate, may require
reasonable temporary screening of the
activity proposed, may suggest the
location of vehicular access to the site
and make other recommendations
which will assist in the protection of
nearby uses during the time the
construction use is in operation.
iii. All setbacks, land coverage, off-street
parking, lighting and other
requirements for protecting the public
health, safety, peace, morals, comfort,
convenience and general welfare of
the inhabitants of the city shall be

shall be made in writing stipulating all
conditions as to length of time, nature
of developed permitted and
arrangements for removing the use at

commission shall hold a public hearing and
shall give notice thereof in accordance with
Section 34-6.2.
34-4.21 ADULT BUSINESS USES?
1. Intent and purpose:
A. In the development and execution of this
section, it is recognized that there are
some uses which, because of their adultoriented
nature, have serious objectionable
operational characteristics, particularly
when several of them are concentrated
under certain circumstances or when one
(1) or more of them are located in near
proximity to a residential zone or other
sensitive land uses, thereby having a
deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas.
Special regulation of these uses is
necessary to ensure that these adverse
effects shall not contribute to the blighting
or downgrading of the surrounding
neighborhood or other sensitive land uses.
These special regulations are itemized in
this section. These controls are for the
purpose of preventing a concentration of
these uses within any one (1) area, or to
prevent deterioration or blighting of a
nearby residential neighborhoods and
other sensitive land uses. These controls
do not legitimize activities, which are
prohibited in other sections of the City
Code.
B. The provisions of this section are not
intended to offend the guarantees of the
First Amendment to the United States
Constitution, or to deny adults access to
these types of businesses and their
products, or to deny such businesses
access to their intended market. Neither is
it the intent of this section to legitimize

activities that are prohibited by city
ordinance or state or federal law. If any
portion of this section relating to the
regulation of adult businesses is found to
be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the city intends
said portion to be disregarded, reduced,
and/or revised so as to be recognized to
the fullest extent possible by law. The city
further states that it would have passed
and adopted what remains of any portion
of this section relating to regulation of
adult businesses following the removal,
reduction, or revision of any portion so
found to be invalid or unconstitutional.

Sex Businesses" (1996); "Sexually Oriented
Businesses An Insider's View" (2002); and
"Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing
Workplace Sexual Violence" (1998), the city
council finds:
A. Sexually oriented businesses and other
adult business uses, as a category of
commercial uses, are associated with a
wide variety of adverse secondary effects
including, but not limited to, personal and
property crimes, prostitution, potential
spread of disease, lewdness, public
indecency, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on property
values, urban blight, litter, and sexual
assault and exploitation.
B. Sexually oriented businesses and other
adult business uses should be separated
from sensitive land uses to minimize the
impact of their secondary effects upon
such uses, and should be separated from
other such uses, to minimize the secondary
effects associated with such uses and to
prevent an unnecessary concentration of
such uses in one (1) area.
C. Each of the foregoing negative secondary
effects constitutes a harm which the city
has a substantial government interest in
preventing and/or abating. This substantial
government interest in preventing
secondary effects, which is the city's
rationale for this ordinance, exists
independent of any comparative analysis
between sexually oriented and non-sexually
oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's
interest in regulating sexually oriented
businesses and other adult business uses
extends to preventing future secondary
effects of either current or future adult
business uses that may locate in the city.
The city finds that the cases and
documentation relied on in this section are
reasonably believed to be relevant to said
secondary effects.
D. This section has neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction
on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented
materials. It is not the purpose or intent of
this section to restrict or deny lawful
access by adults to sexually-oriented
materials, nor to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of sexuallyoriented
materials to their intended
markets. It is not the purpose or intent of
this section to impose judgment on the
content or merits of any constitutionallyprotected
form of speech or expression.
3. Locational requirements. In addition to
compliance with the other provisions of this
section, the following separation and distancing
requirements apply to adult business uses:
A. No adult business use may be located
within one thousand (1,000) feet from the
property line of another adult business use.
For purposes of this subsection, the
distance between any two (2) adult
business uses shall be measured in a
straight line, without regard to intervening
structures or objects, from the closest
exterior wall of the structure in which the
business is located.

D. The facade of the proposed dwellings as
viewed from the street is not identical to
the facade of the dwellings constructed on
the lot or lots adjacent to the proposed
dwelling, exclusive of dwellings adjacent to
the rear lot line. The proposed dwelling
shall be determined to be identical if the
reviewing official, or the official's designee,
finds four (4) or more of the following
criteria to be identical:
i. Height of the main roof ridge or, in the
case of a building with a flat roof, the
highest point of the roof beams above
the elevation of the first floor;

AND STRUCTURES
1. Accessory buildings or structures located in any
use district shall be subject to the following
regulations, unless otherwise provided in this
chapter:
A. Where an accessory building or structure is
physically attached to a main building, it
shall be subject to and must conform to, all
regulations of this chapter applicable to
main buildings.
B. Accessory buildings or structures shall not
be erected in any front yard nor in any
exterior side yard setback unless otherwise
provided in this chapter.
C. A detached accessory building shall not be
located within ten (10) feet of any main
building, nor shall it be located within one
(1) foot of an alley right-of-way. In no
instance shall an accessory building or
deck be located within an easement for
public utilities or a public or private right-ofway.
D. See Section 34-5.2 and Section 34-5.3
regarding accessory off-street parking.
E. See Section 34-5.4 regarding accessory off
-street loading and unloading.
F. See Section 34-5.5 regarding accessory
signs.
G. Satellite reception antennas may be
permitted as an accessory use subject to
the following conditions:
i. Roof-mounted antennas shall be
subject to the requirements of Section
34-3.26.3.B
ii. Ground-mounted antennas shall be
subject to the following conditions:
a. The maximum height permitted
shall be fourteen (14) feet.
b. Such antenna shall be located
only in the rear yard.
c. Where existing structures or
vegetation will not screen the
antenna from the view of abutting
properties, the antenna shall be
screened by installation of a wall
or fence, berm, evergreen
plantings or a combination
thereof.
d. The nature, size and extent of the
screening shall be reviewed and
approved by the director of
planning and communi t y
development, or his designee, who
shall take into consideration
screening design principles
established and adopted by the
planning commission. Review and
approval shall take into
consideration: (i) that the
proposed screening shall not
operate to impose unreasonable
limitations on or to prevent the
reception of satellite-delivered
signals; and (ii) that the cost of the
required screening shall not
exceed fifty (50) percent of the
purchase and installation cost of
such equipment.
iii. Conventional VHF and UHF television
antennas are excluded from operation
of this section on the basis of the
following findings: there is a relatively
small concern for wind and snow load
issues; there has been a longdemonstrated
safety record; there has
been an historical acceptance of such
facilities from architectural and
aesthetic standpoints; and the cost of
complying with the procedure for
application and review would be great
in relation to the cost of purchasing
and installing such conventional
facilities.

any rear lot line and shall not be located
closer to any side lot line than the
minimum side yard setback required in the
district.
C. Detached accessory buildings shall not
exceed fourteen (14) feet in height and
shall occupy not more than twenty-five (25)
percent of a rear yard setback nor more

than forty (40) percent of any rear yard in
excess of the rear yard setback.
D. In no instance shall the combined floor
area of all accessory uses and buildings
exceed fifty (50) percent of the floor area
of the residential dwelling unit or seven
hundred fifty (750) square feet, whichever
is greater, but not to exceed a total of
twelve hundred fifty (1,250) square feet.

the amounts stated below if the purpose is
to add solar energy collectors:
i. Thirty (30) percent of a rear yard
setback.
ii. Fifty (50) percent of any rear yard in
excess of a rear yard setback.
iii. Lot coverage of solar devices shall be
excluded from computation of
accessory floor area to the total
ground floor area of the main building.

34-5.2 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS
There shall be provided in all districts, at the time of
erection or enlargement of any main building or
structure, automobile off-street parking space with
adequate access to all spaces. The number of offstreet
parking spaces in conjunction with all land or
building uses shall be provided, prior to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, as
hereinafter prescribed:
1. Off-street parking spaces may be located within
a side or rear yard unless otherwise provided in
this chapter. Off-street parking shall not be
permitted within a minimum front yard setback
unless otherwise provided in this chapter.
2. Off-street parking for other than residential use
shall be either on the same lot or within three
hundred (300) feet of the building it is intended
to serve, measured from the nearest point of
the building to the nearest point of the offstreet
parking lot. Ownership shall be shown of
all lots or parcels intended for use as parking
by the applicant.
The City recognizes that different types of uses
may have different peak usage times.
Therefore, two (2) or more non-residential
buildings or non-residential uses may
collectively provide the required off-street
parking, in which case the required number of
parking spaces for the uses calculated
individually may be reduced for the following:
A. If the property is on a single zoning lot and
the applicant provides documentation of a
reciprocal arrangement between
businesses showing that peak operating
hours of the businesses do not overlap; or
B. If the property is on two or more zoning lots
a signed agreement is provided by the
property owners and duly recorded with the
Register of Deeds, and the Planning
Commission determines that the peak
usage will occur at different periods of the
day. A parking study prepared by a
qualified professional following
methodologies established by the Urban
Land Institutes publication, Shared
Parking, shall be required for any reduction
that exceeds twenty (20) percent of the
required number of spaces and may be
required to justify lesser reductions at the
discretion of the Planning Commission. The
study that supports the proposed shared
parking arrangement shall be submitted
along with the site plan and is subject to
concurrence by the approving body. The
approving body may, as an alternative,
grant a lesser reduction in overall parking
than that requested by the applicant.
C. For any shared parking arrangement, the
Planning Commission may require the
construction of pedestrian sidewalks and/
or marked crossing areas to facilitate
pedestrian traffic between two sites or two
use areas.
3. Residential off-street parking spaces shall
consist of a parking strip, driveway, garage or
combination thereof and shall be located on
the premises they are intended to serve and
subject to the provisions of Section 34-5.1.
4. In the case of a change of use within a
previously approved site plan or a modification
to a previously approved parking area, planning
department staff may review and
administratively approve the following:
A. Changes to a previously-approved parking
area may be reviewed and approved
administratively provided the resulting
changes meet ordinance requirements.
Any area once designated as required offstreet
parking shall never be changed to
any other use unless equal parking
facilities are provided elsewhere.
B. Changes in tenants or land uses within
may be reviewed and approved
administratively by planning department
staff if the resulting parking changes
satisfy all the requirements of the zoning
ordinance and do not otherwise warrant
additional public hearings or other
significant changes in the approved site
plan.
5. Off-street parking used in connection with the
operation of an existing building or use existing
at the effective date of this chapter (February
18, 1985) shall not be reduced to an amount
less than hereinafter required for a similar new
building or new use.
6. The storage of merchandise, motor vehicles for
sale, trucks or the repair of vehicles is
prohibited.
7. For those uses not specifically mentioned, the
requirements for off-street parking facilities
shall be in accord with a use which is similar in
type.
8. When units or measurements determining the
number of required parking spaces result in the
requirement of a fractional space, any fraction
up to and including one-half (1/2) shall be
disregarded and fractions over one-half (1/2)
shall require one (1) parking space.

9. For the purpose of computing the number of
parking spaces required, the definition of
"usable floor area" in Section 34-2.2 shall
govern.
10. For all uses except one- and two-family
residential units and mobile home sites, the
number of off-street parking spaces required,
may be reduced provided that the following
conditions are met:
A. The number of off-street parking spaces
required for the use or uses must be more
than ten (10).
B. The applicant shall submit an acceptable
site plan showing that an adequate reserve
of land is set aside for additional parking
spaces, so that the total depicted on the
plan is adequate to meet the requirements
under paragraph 13. of this subsection.
The plan shall indicate the reserve area
laid out so that all dimensional
requirements as to spaces, aisles, and
other applicable requirements of this
chapter can be met. The reserve area shall
not be used for water retention, for
required open spaces, or as the location
for replacement trees or other deciduous
or evergreen trees required by this chapter.
The landscape plan submitted for the site
shall include a plan for the reserve area.
C. The planning commission has determined
that the applicant has submitted
substantial evidence showing that the
parking needs of the specific occupant will
be less than would be required by this
chapter.
D. The property owner shall execute an
agreement prepared by the city attorney
requiring the construction of the additional
spaces within one hundred and eighty
(180) days of notification that the planning
commission, at its sole discretion has
determined a need exists for such spaces.
The agreement shall run with the land, be
binding upon successors and assigns and
shall be recorded with the register of
deeds.
E. A permit for change of occupancy shall not
be issued until the planning department
has reevaluated the need for parking by
the new occupant relative to the number of
spaces required by this chapter.
11. The minimum number of off-street parking
spaces by type of use shall be determined in
accordance with the following schedule;
provided, however, that when a use is required
by state statute to provide handicapped
parking spaces, the total number of off-street
parking spaces required by this chapter shall
be increased by one (1) for uses requiring
twenty-five (25) parking spaces or less:

manner as to allow trucks to enter and
leave the space without having to back
from or onto a public street, and so as not
to interfere with the proper functioning of
vehicular and pedestrian circulation on the
site.
D. Aisles or drives providing access to trash
receptacles may be included in the
calculation of the area required for loading
and unloading space.
34-5.5 SIGNS
1. Purpose and Intent. These regulations establish
rules and standards for the construction,
location, maintenance and removal of all signs
except those exempted from regulation by this
ordinance. Directional, emergency, or trafficrelated
signs owned by city, county, state or
federal government agencies are not regulated
by this section. The execution of these
regulations recognizes that the purpose of this
chapter is to protect the interest of public
health, safety and welfare and to ensure the
maintenance of an attractive physical
environment while satisfying the needs of sign
users for adequate identification and
communication. In order that such purposes
can be achieved, the following objectives shall
be applied for this chapter and any future
additions, deletions and amendments:
A. General. Ensure that signs are located,
designed, constructed, installed and
maintained in a way that protects life,
health, morals, property and the public
welfare.
B. Public Safety. Protect public safety by
prohibiting signs that 1) are structurally
unsafe or poorly maintained; 2) cause
unsafe traffic conditions because they
unreasonably distract motorists, have
similarities to official traffic signs or hinder
vision; and 3) impede safe movement of
pedestrians or safe ingress and egress
from buildings or sites.
C. Protect Aesthetic Quality of Districts and
Neighborhoods. Prevent blight and protect
aesthetic qualities by preventing visual
clutter and protecting views. Prevent
proliferation of signs in residential areas
and eliminate abandoned signs and sign
structures on unused properties. Also,
avoid glare, light trespass, and skyglow
through selection of proper fixture type(s)
and location, lighting technology, and
control of light levels. Additionally, reflect
the character of unique districts as may be
established by the Citys Master Plan, other
adopted plans or the zoning ordinance.
D. Free Speech. Ensure that the
constitutionally guaranteed right of free
speech is protected and allow signs as a
means of communication.
E. Reduce Conflict. Reduce conflict among
signs and light and between public and
private information systems.
F. Business Identification. Allow for adequate
signage for business identification and
other commercial speech, non-commercial
speech, and dissemination of public
information, including but not limited to,
public safety information and notification
as may be required by law.

to the adoption of this chapter or any
applicable amendment thereto that do not
meet the standards of this chapter. It is the
intent of this chapter that the continued
use of nonconforming signs shall not be
encouraged.
i. A nonconforming sign shall
immediately lose its nonconforming
designation if:
a. The structure of the sign is
altered in any way which tends to
or makes the sign less in
c o m p l i a n c e w i t h t h e

it was before the alteration.
b. The sign is relocated to a position
making it less in compliance with
the requirements of this chapter.
c. The sign is replaced.
d. On the occurrence of any one (1)
of subsection a., b., or c., the sign
shall be immediately brought into
compliance with this chapter with
a new permit secured therefore,
or shall be removed.
ii. Nothing in this section shall relieve the
owner or user of a nonconforming sign
or owner of the property on which the
nonconforming sign is located from the
provisions of this chapter regarding
safety, maintenance and repair of
signs, contained in this chapter;
provided, however, that any repainting,
cleaning and other normal
maintenance or repair of the sign or
sign structure shall not modify the sign
structure or copy in any way which
does not conform with the provisions
of this chapter.
iii. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, any sign that is located on
property which becomes vacant or on
which a building is unoccupied for a
period of ninety (90) days or more

remains vacant for a period of one
hundred eighty (180) days or more. An
abandoned sign is prohibited and shall
be removed by the owner of the sign or
owner of the premises.
B. Maintenance of Signs
i. Signs, including the face, framing and
all supports thereof, shall be kept and
maintained in a safe condition, shall
be adequately protected against
corrosion and shall conform to all the
provisions of this chapter.
ii. Signs which are broken, torn, bent or

damaged, and signs that are not
reasonably level and plumb shall be
repaired and re-installed in a manner
prescribed by the Building Official or
his/her designee.
iii. All signs shall be maintained in good
structural condition, in compliance
with all building and electrical codes,
and in conformance with this Code.
Failure to comply with this section may
result in action by the Building Official
or his/her designee to rescind the
permit with subsequent removal of the
entire structure.
iv. A sign shall have no more than 20
percent of its surface area covered
with disfigured, cracked, rippled or
peeling paint, poster paper or other
material for a period of more than 30
successive days.
v. A sign shall not stand with bent or
broken sign facing, with broken
supports, with loose appendages or
struts, or more than 15 degrees from
vertical for a period of more than 30
successive days, unless determined by
the Building Official or his/her
designee to pose a safety hazard, in
which case immediate action may be
required.
vi. A sign shall not have weeds, trees,
vines, or other vegetation growing
upon it, or obscuring the view of the
sign from the public right-of-way from
which it is to be viewed, for a period of
more than 30 successive days.
vii. An internally illuminated sign shall not
be allowed to stand with only partial
illumination for a period of more than
30 successive days.
viii. Any sign erected or displayed without a

comply with the provisions of this
chapter shall be deemed a hazard to
the safety of the public and is declared
to be a public nuisance and may be
abated by removal without notice.
C. Special exception. Special exception to
this section may be permitted by the
zoning board of appeals upon the following
affirmative findings:
i. That the request is based upon
circumstances or features that are
exceptional and unique to the property
and that are not self-created;
ii. That the failure to grant relief will
result in substantially more than mere
inconvenience or financial
expenditures;
iii. That application of the regulations in
this section without a special exception
will unreasonably prevent or limit the
use of the property or will
unreasonably preclude the visibility or
identification of a nonresidential
building on the property;
iv. That the special exception will not
result in a sign or condition that is
incompatible with or unreasonably
interferes with adjacent or surrounding
properties, will result in substantial
justice being done to both the
applicant and adjacent or surrounding
properties, and is not inconsistent with
the spirit and intent of this chapter;
and
v. When taken on its own, or in
combination with other existing
conditions on the property or in the
area, that the special exception will not
result in a sign or condition that has an
adverse effect on the essential
character or aesthetics of the
establishment or surrounding area, is
detrimental to or negatively affects the
character of surrounding residential
development, or compromises the
public health, safety or welfare.

deciduous trees shall be planted in the
ground adjacent to the wall on the
nonresidential side with size and spacing in
accordance with Section 34-5.14. If a berm
is used, the trees may be planted on the
berm.
D. The planning commission may, in unusual
circumstances, permit a wall to be less
than six (6) feet in height if no good
purpose would be served. In making such
determination, the commission may
consider the following:
i. The height of existing nearby walls;
ii. The effectiveness of the wall in
screening adjacent property;
iii. Variation in height would result in a
significantly better-appearing wall
when the length, in the opinion of the
commission, is excessive;
iv. The characteristics of the area being
screened;
Where site plan approval by the planning
commission is not required, the planning
department may provide such review.
E. In those instances where a required wall is
located generally parallel to a public street
right-of-way and within fifty (50) feet of the
right-of-way, the planning commission may
require that the wall be designed so that it
provides a varying setback or distance
from the right-of-way. This may take the
form of a serpentine wall, a wall with
offsets in its alignment or some other
means of providing variety. The use of
plant materials in conjunction with the wall
is encouraged and may be required. Where
site plan approval by the planning
commission is not required, the planning
department may provide such review.
2. Required walls shall be located along the lot
line except where underground utilities
interfere and except in instances where this
chapter requires conformance with front yard
setback lines in abutting residential districts.

3. Upon review of the site plan, the planning
commission may approve an alternate location
for the wall or may waive the wall or deciduous
trees requirement if in specific cases it would
not serve the purposes of screening the area
effectively or where it is determined that the
adjoining property is indicated on the future
land use plan as a nonresidential area. Where
site plan approval by the planning commission
is not required, the planning department may
provide such review.
4. Required walls may, upon approval of the
planning commission, be located on the
opposite side of an alley right-of-way from a
nonresidential zone that abuts a residential
zone when mutually agreeable to affected
property owners. The continuity of the required
wall on a given block will be major
consideration.
5. Berms shall be landscaped earth mounds, the
same height as required for walls with a
maximum slope of 3:1 (three (3) feet horizontal
to one foot vertical). All berms shall have a
nearly flat, horizontal area at their highest
point, at least two (2) feet in width.
6. Berm slopes shall be protected from erosion by
sodding or seeding. If slopes are seeded, they
shall be protected until the seed germinates
and a permanent lawn is established, by a
straw mulch, hydromulching or netting
specifically designed to control erosion. The
berm area shall be kept free from refuse and
debris and shall be planted with shrubs, trees
or lawn and shall be maintained in a healthy
growing condition.
7. A planting plan and grading plan shall be
prepared for the berm and shall be reviewed by
the planning commission. Plant materials
within the berm area shall be installed in
accordance with the requirements for
greenbelts and plant material as set forth in
Section 34-5.14.
8. Such walls or berms shall have no openings for
vehicular traffic or other purposes, except as
otherwise provided in this chapter and except
such openings as are required to address
public health, safety and welfare as approved
by the planning department.
9. All walls required in this section shall be
constructed to specifications approved by the
building inspector. Walls shall be constructed
of brick or have brick veneer on the side facing
the residential district, or be constructed of
poured concrete which simulates standard
brick facings on both sides of the wall. The top
of the wall shall be finished to provide positive
drainage.
34-5.16 EXTERIOR LIGHTING
1. Intent. The purpose of this Ordinance is to
provide regulations for outdoor lighting that will:
A. Permit the use of outdoor lighting that
meets the minimum levels specified in this
Ordinance for night-time safety, utility,
security, productivity, enjoyment, and
commerce.
B. Minimize adverse offsite impacts of lighting
such as light trespass and obtrusive light.
C. Curtail light pollution, reduce skyglow and
improve the nighttime environment for

2. Applicability of regulations / Approved lighting
plan. Whenever the installation or modification
of outdoor lighting is part of a development that
requires site plan approval, the approving body
shall review and approve all proposed lighting
as part of its site plan approval process and all
lighting shall be subject to the provisions of this
Ordinance.
The planning commission may modify the
requirement for existing developed sites
seeking modest expansions to bring all lighting
into compliance with these lighting standards
based on consideration of the following: the
position and height of buildings, other
structures, and trees on the site; the potential
off-site impact of the lighting; the character of
surrounding land use; and the extent of the
proposed change in floor area and/or land use.

the boundaries of the area to be
illuminated or onto adjacent properties
or streets;
iii. Whether the lighting will cause
negative impacts on residential
districts and uses;
iv. Whether the plan will achieve
appropriate levels of illumination for
the use proposed; and
v. Whether the lighting is in harmony with
the character of the surrounding area
and the illumination levels of
neighboring properties; and
vi. Whether the lighting is in keeping with
the city's goal of prohibiting
unnecessary illumination of the night
sky.

C. On occupied one-family residential lots
which are one acre or more in area, the
removal of eight (8) trees per calendar year
or not more than ten (10) percent of the
total number of trees on the lot, whichever
is less. This provision shall not apply to
landmark trees.
D. Trees for which it is determined by the
department to have a health condition
factor less than sixteen (16) per subsection
34-5.18.11.
6. Tree protection during land development:
A. Prior to the land clearing stage of
development and before a tree permit will
be issued, the owner, developer, or agent
shall do the following:
i. All trees for which application is being
made for removal shall be so identified
on site by fluorescent orange spray
paint (chalk base) or by red flagging
tape prior to field inspection by the
department.
ii. Erect barriers of four-foot-high wooden
fencing or similar sturdy stock material
staked with metal stakes ten (10) feet
on center which will shield and protect
trees, no closer than six (6) feet from
the trunk or at the drip line, whichever
is greater, of all such trees or groups of
trees.
iii. Keep clear all debris or fill, equipment,
and material from within the required
protective barrier.
B. During construction, the owner, developer,
or agent shall not cause or permit any
activity within the drip line of any protected
tree or group of trees including, but not
limited to, the storage of equipment,
dumpsters, boulders, dirt, and excavated
material, building or waste material, or any
other material harmful to the life of a tree.
C. No damaging attachment, wires (other
than cable wires for trees), signs, or
permits may be fastened to any tree
protected by this section.
D. The department shall conduct periodic
inspections of the site during land clearing
and construction in order to ensure
compliance with this section.
7. Tree replacement or relocation during land
development:
A. As a condition of granting a tree permit, the
applicant will be required to replace trees
being removed having six (6) inches or
more DBH.
i. The permit grantee shall either
relocate trees or replace trees on a
one-to-one basis. All replacement trees
shall measure three-inch caliper for
deciduous trees, ten-foot height for
evergreen trees, or greater. When
replacement or relocation of trees on
site or on a one-to-one basis is not
feasible and/or desirable, the planning
commission may substitute greater
size for replacement trees or require
replacement trees at another location
on public property in the city.
ii. Replacement trees shall have shade
potential and other characteristics
comparable to the tree proposed for
removal and shall be State
Department of Agriculture Nursery
Grade No. 1 stock or better.
Replacement trees shall be planted
per City of Farmington Hills
specifications and details and be
guaranteed for one year.
iii. As an alternative or partial alternative
to the above, the planning commission
may approve trees which are smaller in
caliper size in situations where the
intent is to recreate or create a densely
-wooded area or wood lot. Such
groupings of trees shall consist of
tightly-grouped trees and shall be a
minimum one-inch caliper and shall be
used only in situations and locations
where it is appropriate to create a
densely-wooded effect. Spacing
between trees shall be approved by
the planning commission. When this
alternative is used, the sum of the
caliper of the replacement trees shall
be equal to the sum of the caliper of
the replacement trees as required
under subsections 34-5.18.7.A.i and
34-5.18.7.A.iv of this paragraph.
(Landscape Design Principles for
Densely Wooded Areas adopted by the
planning commission shall be used as
guidelines for this alternative.)

be removed, replacement trees shall
be provided to a minimum of twentyfive
(25) percent of DBH of the tree to
be removed. Replacement trees,
measured in DBH or calipers, shall be
provided either individually or on a
cumulative basis to meet the twentyfive
(25) percent DBH requirement.
v. The applicant shall be required to
replace trees originally indicated and
intended to be saved when such trees
are excessively damaged or removed
in violation of an approved site plan
during construction to the extent that it
puts the tree at risk of death as
determined by the department. The
replacements shall have at least equal
shade potential and other
characteristics comparable to those of
the damaged trees and be a minimum
five-inch caliper, excluding landmark
trees. Landmark trees shall be
replaced at one hundred (100) percent
DBH on an individual or cumulative
basis using minimum five-inch caliper
stock.
vi. Trees required to be planted in
accordance with subsection 34-5.18.7
shall be in place and properly

34-6.1 SITE PLAN REVIEW
1. Whenever the provisions of this chapter require
submission of a site plan to the planning
commission, it shall be submitted in
accordance with the provisions of this Section
and article III of chapter 21. A site plan shall
meet all applicable requirements of this
chapter and shall be approved if in compliance
with such requirements. In instances of conflict
between article III of chapter 21 and this
chapter, the requirements of this chapter shall
prevail.
2. In the process of reviewing a site plan, the
planning commission shall consider the
following:
A. The location and design of driveways
providing vehicular ingress to and egress
from the site, in relation to streets giving
access to the site, to nearby driveways of
other property and in relation to pedestrian
traffic.
B. The traffic circulation features within the
site and the location of automobile parking
areas.
C. The planning commission may make such
requirements with respect to any matters
as will assure:
i. Safety and convenience of both
vehicular and pedestrian traffic both
within the site and in relation to access
streets.
ii. Satisfactory and harmonious
r e l a t i o n s h ips between the
development on the site and the
existing and prospective development
of contiguous land and of adjacent
neighborhoods.
D. The planning commission may further
require landscaping, fences and walls in
pursuance of these objectives and same
shall be provided and maintained as a
condition of the establishment and the
continued maintenance of any use to
which they are appurtenant.
3. Whenever a landscape or greenbelt plan is
required by provision of this chapter, plans
shall be submitted concurrently with the site
plan for review by the planning commission.
The applicant may apply to the planning
department to delay submission of the
landscape or greenbelt plan and proceed with
the site plan when they can demonstrate the

clearzoning® i
1. Taking into consideration the size, location and
character of the proposed land use, viewed
within the context of surrounding land uses and
land use planning for such area, the proposed
use shall not be incompatible nor
inharmonious, as determined by the application
of generally accepted planning standards and/
or principles, with:
A. The surrounding uses; and/or
B. The orderly development of the
surrounding neighborhood and/or vicinity.
2. The proposed use shall be of a nature that will
make vehicular and pedestrian traffic no more
hazardous than is normal for the district
involved, taking into consideration vehicular
turning movements in relation to routes of
traffic flow, proximity and relationship to
intersections, adequacy of sight distances,
location and access of off-street parking and
provisions for pedestrian traffic, with particular
attention to minimizing pedestrian-vehicle
interfacing.
3. The proposed use shall not unreasonably
impact upon surrounding property in terms of
noise, dust, fumes, smoke, air, water, odor,
light and/or vibration, and shall not
unreasonably impact upon a person perceiving
the operation in terms of aesthetics. Where
such concerns can be remedied by way of
design, construction and/or use, the proposed
use shall be designed, constructed and used so
as to eliminate the effects of the use which
would otherwise substantiate denial thereof,
taking into consideration the location, size,
intensity, layout and periods of operation of
such use.
4. The proposed use shall be such that the
proposed location and height of buildings or
structures and the proposed location, nature
and height of walls, fences and landscaping will
not interfere with or discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and
buildings or unreasonably affect their value.
5. The proposed use shall relate harmoniously
with the physical and economic aspects of
adjacent land uses as regards prevailing
shopping habits, convenience of access by
prospective patrons, continuity of development,
and need for particular services and facilities in
specific areas of the City.
6. The proposed use is so designed, located,
planned and to be operated so that the public
health, safety and welfare will be protected.
34-6.2 NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING
For uses making reference to this section, and in all
applications for special approval, notice of the
public hearing before the planning commission or
the council shall be given as follows:
1. One notice of the public hearing shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation
in the city fifteen (15) days before the hearing.
2. One notice of the public hearing shall be sent
by first-class mail, postage prepaid or by
personal delivery, to the owners of the property
for which the hearing is conducted, to all
persons to whom real property is assessed
within three hundred (300) feet of the
boundary of the property in question, and to the
occupants of all structures within three
hundred (300) feet of the boundary of such
property. Notice shall be given not less than
five (5) and not more than fifteen (15) days
before the hearing. If the name of the occupant
is not known, the term "occupant" may be used
in making notification. Notification need not be
given to more than one occupant of the
structure, except that if a structure contains
more than one dwelling unit or spatial area
owned or leased by different individuals,
partnerships, businesses or organizations, one
occupant of each unit or spatial area shall
receive notice. In the case of a single structure
containing more than four (4) dwelling units or
other distinct spatial areas owned or leased by
different individuals, partnerships, businesses
or organizations, notice may be given to the
manager or owner of the structure, who shall
be requested to post a notice at the primary
entrance to the structure.
34-6.3 SPECIAL LAND USE AND SPECIAL
APPROVAL USE STANDARDS

34-7.1 NONCONFORMITIES
It is recognized that there exists within the districts
established by this chapter and subsequent
amendments, lots, structures and uses of land and
structures which were lawful before this chapter
was passed or amended which would be prohibited,
regulated or restricted under the terms of this
chapter or future amendments. Such structures or
uses shall be regulated as follows:
1. Intent:
A. It is the intent of this chapter to permit
legal nonconforming structures or uses to
continue until they are removed but not to
encourage their survival. Such uses are
declared by this chapter to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts
involved. It is further the intent of this
chapter, that nonconformities shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor
be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in
the same district.
B. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this
chapter shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction or
designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun
prior to the effective date of adoption
(November 13, 1951) or amendment of
this chapter, and upon which actual
building construction has been diligently
carried on. Actual construction is hereby
defined to include the placing of
construction materials in permanent
position and fastened in a permanent
manner; except that where demolition or
removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun preparatory to
rebuilding such demolition or removal shall
be deemed to be actual construction,
provided that work shall be diligently
carried on until completion of the building
involved.
2. Nonconforming uses of land without buildings.
Where, at the effective date of adoption
(November 13, 1951) or amendment of this
chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made
no longer permissible under the terms of this
chapter as enacted or amended such use may
be continued, so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No such nonconforming use shall be
enlarged or increased, or extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied at the effective date of adoption
(November 13, 1951) or amendment of
this chapter.
B. No such nonconforming use shall be
moved in whole or in part to any other
portion of the lot or parcel occupied by
such use at the effective date of adoption
(November 13, 1951) or amendment of
this chapter.
C. A nonconforming use of land shall not be
extended or enlarged after passage of this
chapter by placement on the premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from
off the premises, or by the addition of any
other uses until the nonconforming use is
discontinued.
D. If such nonconforming use of land is
abandoned for any reason for a period of
more than ninety (90) days, any
subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this chapter
for the district in which such land is
located. Land occupied by seasonal uses
shall be excepted from this provision.
3. Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful
structure exists at the effective date of
adoption (January 10, 2011) or amendment of
this chapter that could not be built under the
terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions
on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other
characteristics of the structure or its location
on the lot, such structure may be continued so

4. Nonconforming uses of structures and land. If a
lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and
land in combination, exists at the effective date
of adoption (November 13, 1951) or
amendment of this chapter, the lawful use may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No existing structure devoted to a use not
permitted by this chapter in the district in
which it is located shall be enlarged,
extended, constructed, reconstructed,
moved or structurally altered except in
changing the use of the structure to a use
permitted in the district in which it is
located.
B. Any nonconforming use may be extended
throughout any parts of a building which
were manifestly arranged or designed for
such use, and which existed at the time of
adoption (November 13, 1951) or
amendment of this chapter, but no such
use shall be extended to occupy any land
outside such building.
C. If no structural alterations are made, any
nonconforming use of a structure, or
structure and land in combination, may be
changed to another nonconforming use of
the same or a more restricted classification
provided that the board of appeals, either
by general rule or by making findings in the
specific case, shall find that the proposed
use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use. In permitting such
change, the board of appeals may require
conditions and safeguards in accord with
the purpose and intent of this chapter.
Where a nonconforming use of a structure,
land, or structure and land in combination
is hereafter changed to a more conforming
use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a
less conforming use.
D. Any structure, or structure and land in
combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a
permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which
such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be
resumed.
E. When a nonconforming use of a structure,
or structures and land in combination, is
abandoned for one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days or for eighteen (18)
months during any three-year period, the
structure, or structure and land in
combination, shall not thereafter be used
except in conformance with the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
Structures occupied by seasonal uses shall
be excepted from this provision.
F. When a nonconforming use status applies
to a structure and land in combination,
removal or destruction of the structure
shall eliminate the nonconforming status of
the land.
G. A nonconforming use of a structure or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land
shall not be extended or enlarged after
passage of this chapter by attachment on a
building or premises of additional signs
intended to be seen from off the premises,
or by the addition of any other uses until
the nonconforming use is discontinued.
5. Repairs and maintenance:
A. On any building devoted in whole or in part
to any nonconforming use, work may be
done in any period of twelve (12)
consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or
on repair or replacement of nonbearing
walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an
extent not exceeding twenty-five (25)
percent of the market value of the building,
as determined from the city assessor's
records, provided that the cubic content of
the building as it existed at the time of
passage or amendment of this chapter
shall not be increased.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
prevent the strengthening or restoring to a
safe condition of any building or part
thereof declared to be unsafe by any
official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.
6. Change of tenancy or ownership. There may be
a change of tenancy, ownership or

provisions of Section 34-3.15.2.A.
9. Uses under exception provisions not
nonconforming uses. Any use for which a
special approval or exception is granted as

action, be deemed a conforming use.
10. Nonconforming lots:
A. In any district in which one-family dwellings
are permitted, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this
subsection, a one-family dwelling and
customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any lot of record at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this
subsection. This provision shall apply even

that are generally applicable in the district;
provided, however, that setbacks and other
requirements not involving area or width,
or both, conform to the regulations for the
district in which such lot is located.
B. If two (2) or more lots, or a combination of
lots and portions of lots, with a continuous
frontage and single ownership are of
record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this subsection, or at any
time thereafter; and if all or part of the lots
do not meet the requirements for lot area
or width as established by this chapter, the
lands involved shall be considered an
undivided parcel or zoning lot for the
purpose of this chapter, and no portion of
such undivided parcel or zoning lot shall be
used or occupied which does not meet lot
area or width requirements established by
this chapter, nor shall any division of the

order, requirement, decision or determination
of the code enforcement officer; or to decide in
favor of an applicant a matter upon which the
board is required to pass under this chapter; or

decision of such appeal shall be in the
form of a resolution either reversing,
modifying or affirming wholly or partly the

4. Stay. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from unless
the code enforcement officer certified to the
board of appeals after notice of appeal has
been filed that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in his or her opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property, in
which case the proceedings shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order which
may be granted by the board of appeals or by
the circuit court, on application, on notice of
the code enforcement officer and on due cause
shown.
5. Fees for appeals. A fee in the amount to be set

6. Jurisdiction:
A. The zoning board of appeals shall not have
the power to alter or change the zoning
district classification of any property, nor to
make any change in the terms of this
chapter, nor to permit any use in a district
in which it is not permitted, but does have
the power to act on those matters where
this chapter provides for an administrative
review, interpretation, exception or special
approval permit and to authorize a
variance as defined in this section and
laws of the state.
B. Administrative review: To hear and decide
appeals where it is alleged by the appellant
that there is an error in any order,
requirement, permit, decision, or refusal
made by the code enforcement officer,
planning commission or any other
administrative official in carrying out or
enforcing any provisions of this chapter,
except as regards to special land uses and
special approval uses.
C. Variance: Where owing to special
conditions a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter would involve
practical difficulties or cause unnecessary
hardships within the meaning of this
chapter, the board of appeals shall have
power upon appeal in specific cases to
authorize such variation or modifications of
the provisions of this chapter with such
conditions and safeguards as it may
determine, as may be in harmony with the
spirit of this chapter and so that public
safety and welfare is secured and
substantial justice done. No such variance
or modification of the provisions of this
chapter shall be granted unless it appears
beyond a reasonable doubt that all the
following facts and conditions exist:
i. That there are exceptional or
extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applicable to the property
involved or to the intended use of the
property that do not apply generally to
other properties or class of uses in the
same district or zone.
ii. That such variance is necessary for the
preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right possessed by
other property in the same zone and
vicinity.
iii. That the granting of such variance or
modification will not be materially
detrimental to public welfare or be
materially injurious to the property or
improvements in such zone or district

i. Interpret the provisions of this chapter
in such a way as to carry out the intent
and purpose of the plan, as shown
upon the zoning map fixing the use
districts, accompanying and made part
of this chapter where street layout
actually on the ground varies from the
street layout as shown on the map
aforesaid.
ii. Permit the erection and use of building
or use of premises for public utility
purposes and make exceptions
therefor to the height and bulk district

the board considers necessary for the
public convenience or welfare.

automobile parking space or loading
space requirements where, in the
particular instance, such modification
will not be inconsistent with the
purpose and intent of such
requirements.
iv. Permit such modification of the height
and area regulations as may be
necessary to secure an appropriate
improvement of a lot which is of such
shape, or so located with relation to
surrounding development or physical
characteristics, that it cannot
otherwise be appropriately improved
without such modification.
v. Permit a limited increase in the
number of employees permitted in
processing activities in a business
district, but only when such increase
will not adversely affect the character
of the establishment, will not be
detrimental to or affect the character
of surrounding res i d e n t i a l

increase traffic or parking congestion.
E. Temporary uses:
i. The board of appeals may permit the
following temporary uses not otherwise
specified in a zoning district, provided
such uses do not require the erection
of any capital improvements of a
permanent structural nature and meet
the requirements of subsection (F)
below:
a. Carnivals, amusement rides and
special events, as specified in
Section 5-101 et seq. of this Code,
but subject to Section 34-3.26.14
of this chapter.
b. Temporary commercial uses when
accessory to existing uses
conducted by the applicant, such

temporary commercial use for
the purpose of this subsection and
is regulated elsewhere in this
code.
c. Temporary buildings, structures or
uses related to the principal use of
the lot may be permitted during
construction, reconstruction or
repair of a building or structure
while a valid permit for such
construction, reconstruction or
repair exists; provided, however,
that any buildings, structures or
uses directly accessory to such
construction, reconstruction or
repair, such as tool trailers and
contractor's offices, shall not be
subject to this section; and
provided further that temporary
trailers and uses permitted under
Section 34-3.26.16 of this chapter
shall not be subject to this section.
d. Temporary buildings, structures or
uses where the duration of the
activity of the use will not exceed
five (5) days (does not apply to
seasonal outdoor sales as
regulated in Chapter 22, Article III
of the City Code and Section 34-
4.56 of the Zoning Ordinance).
ii. The board of appeals, in granting
permits for such temporary uses, shall
do so under the following conditions:
a. The granting of the temporary use
shall be made in writing stipulating
all conditions as to time, nature of
development permitted and
arrangements for removing the
use at the termination of such
temporary permit.
b. All setbacks, land coverage, offstreet
parking, lighting and other
requirements to be considered in
protecting the public health,
safety, peace, morals, comfort,
convenience and general welfare
of the inhabitants of the city shall
be made at the discretion of the
board of appeals.

F. In consideration of all appeals and all
proposed variations to this chapter, the
board of appeals shall, before making any
variations from the chapter in a specific
case, first determine that the proposed
variation will not impair an adequate
supply of light and air to adjacent property,
or unreasonably increase the congestion in
public streets, or increase the danger of
fire or endanger the public safety, or
unreasonably diminish or impair
established property values within the
surrounding area, or in any other respect
impair the public health, safety, comfort,
morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the
city.
G. Nothing herein contained shall be
construed to give or grant to the board the

this article, the board of appeals may reverse
or affirm wholly or partly or may modify the
order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from and may make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as
ought to be made, and to that end shall have
all the powers of the code enforcement officer
from whom the appeal is taken.
8. Notice of hearing. The board of appeals shall
make no determination except in a specific
case and after a hearing conducted by the
board. The board shall fix a reasonable time for
the hearing of the appeal and give ten (10)
days' notice of the appeal to the person to
whom real property within three hundred (300)
feet of the premises in question is assessed,
and to the occupants of one-family and twofamily
dwellings within three hundred (300)
feet, the notice to be delivered by mail
addressed to the respective owners and
tenants at the address given in the last
assessment roll. If the tenant's name is not
known, the term "occupant" may be used. A
proof of service of such mailing shall be filed
prior to the commencement of such hearing.
The council shall also make the necessary
provisions requiring the applicant to pay the
costs required relative to such notices.
9. Valid term of approval:
A. No order of the board of appeals permitting
the erection or alteration of a building shall
be valid for a period longer than one (1)
year, unless a building permit for such
erection or alteration is obtained within
such period and such erection or alteration
is started and proceeds to completion in
accordance with the terms of such permit.
B. No order of the board of appeals permitting
a use of a building or premises shall be
valid for a period longer than one (1) year,
unless such use is established within such
period; provided, however, that where such
use permitted is dependent upon the
erection or alteration of a building, such
order shall continue in force and effect if a
building permit for such erection or
alteration is obtained within such period
and such erection or alteration is started
and proceeds to completion in accordance
with the terms of such permit.
