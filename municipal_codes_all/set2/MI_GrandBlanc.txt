conforming signs, existence of desirable natural features, conflicts with utility poles and structures and
possible detrimental impacts of signs located adjacent to residentially zoned districts.

to the provisions of Chapter 1480 of the Building and Housing Code relating to the location, maintenance,
design, illumination, size, height, number and type of signs. The Committee shall use the standards
provided in Section 1480.163 of the Building and Housing Code. In no case shall the Committee have

from the provisions of Chapter 1480 of the Building and Housing Code, the Sign Review Committee shall

such property subsequent to the construction of its cable system. Restoration of Municipal
property, including, but not limited to, the public ways shall be in accordance with the directions
and specifications of Municipality, and all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations, at
Company's sole expense. If such removal and restoration is not completed within six months after

in the affected public ways shall, at the option of Municipality, be deemed abandoned and shall,
at the option of Municipality, become its property or Municipality may obtain a court order
compelling Company to remove same. In the event Company fails or refuses to remove its cable
system or to satisfactorily restore all areas to the condition in which they existed prior to the
original construction of the cable system, Municipality, at its option, may perform such work and
collect the costs thereof from Company. No surety on any performance bond nor any letter of
credit shall be discharged until Municipality has certified to Company in writing that the cable
system has been dismantled, removed, and all other property restored, to the satisfaction of
Municipality.

traveled or paved portion of the streets or public ways, unless otherwise approved
in advance by Municipality, Company shall do so by boring (directional or
otherwise) and not by excavation of a trench in which to place cable conduit.
Boring (directional or otherwise) shall be done wherever possible so that the
excavations necessary for it are not in the paved portion of the right-of-way.
(2) If Company does a bore (directional or otherwise) underneath a street or public
way, then Company will notify Municipality at least two weeks in advance of same.
If Municipality so desires, Company will then increase the size of the bore
(directional or otherwise) with Municipality to pay only the incremental cost of
making the bore (directional or otherwise) larger. Municipality (but not third
parties unless approved by Company) may then use any additional space or
capacity created by increasing the size of the bore (directional or otherwise)
without additional charge or expense.
(n) Tree Trimming. Company may trim trees upon and overhanging the public ways so as to
prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with the cable system. Company shall
minimize the trimming of trees to trimming only those trees which are
2002 Replacement
806.04 BUSINESS REGULATION AND TAXATION CODE 16B
essential to maintain the integrity of the system. No trimming shall be performed in the public
ways without previously informing Municipality at least two weeks in advance. All trimming of

days after construction (or reconstruction) and activation of any portion of the
cable system). Upon request by Municipality in an emergency, Company as soon as
possible (but no more than one business day from the request) shall inform
Municipality of any changes from such maps and records previously supplied and
shall mark up any maps provided by Municipality so as to show the location of the
cable system.
(2) The "as-built" maps shall include at a minimum all system and facility routings
and shall be drawn to a scale and upon such media as required by the Manager.
(3) Within two years of the effective date, Company shall develop a geographical
information system (GIS) compatible layer, using a program and format which
accurately displays its "as-built" cable system. This layer shall be kept current
continuously, updated at least quarterly. The GIS layer, including but not limited
to, all databases, plots and computer discs shall be provided to Municipality, upon
request, in a standardized, non-proprietary format at no cost to Municipality. In
addition, Company shall provide information and assistance on the GIS program it
is using and its implementation so as to aid Municipality in converting the layer
into a form easily used by Municipality and in using the layer.

the due date for payment of the subscriber's bill and Company has provided at
least ten days written notice (such as in a bill) to the subscriber prior to

disconnect a subscriber at any time if Company in good faith and on reasonable
grounds determines that the subscriber has tampered with or abused Company's
equipment; or is or may be engaged in the theft of cable services; or that the
subscriber's premises wiring violates applicable FCC standards. Company may not
disconnect a subscriber for failure to pay amounts due to a bona fide dispute as to
the correct amount of the subscriber's bill.
(2) Company shall promptly disconnect any subscriber who so requests disconnection.
No period of notice prior to requested termination of service may be required to
subscribers by Company. No charge may be imposed upon the subscriber for any

(u) Backup Power.
(1) Company shall install an electric generator which starts automatically in the event
of loss of conventional power to provide electric service to the cable system

this franchise, a performance bond from a security company meeting the standards
of Section 806.10 in the amount of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in form

permits and directions of any agency of Municipality having jurisdiction over its
acts or defaults under this franchise, and the payment of Company of any claims,
liquidated damages, liens or taxes due Municipality which arise by reason of the
construction, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable system or provision of
cable services.
2002 Replacement

(2) The condition of such bond should be that if Company fails to make timely
payment to Municipality or its designee of any amount or sum due under this
franchise; or fails to make timely payment to Municipality of any taxes due; or fails
to repay to Municipality within ten days of written notification that such

compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of Company in connection with
this franchise; or fails, after 30 days notice of such failure from Municipality, to
comply with any provisions of this franchise which Municipality reasonably
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of the money (including, without
limitation, the assessment of liquidated damages), then Municipality may demand
and receive payment under such bond.
(3) In lieu of providing a bond, Company may provide a guarantee from an entity
acceptable to Municipality substantially in the form set forth in Appendix B.

(z) Liquidated Damages. Company acknowledges that noncompliance with the customer
service rules of the FCC (such rules as currently in effect set forth in Appendix A) will harm
subscribers and Municipality and the amounts of actual damages will be difficult or impossible to
ascertain. Municipality may therefore assess the following liquidated damages against Company
for noncompliance with such customer service rules. Each day on which a violation of such FCC
Rules occurs constitutes a separate offense, except that a violation by Company of a quarterly
standard shall constitute a single offense for such quarter.
(1) First noncompliance with a given standard - two thousand dollars ($2,000).
(2) Second noncompliance with a given standard within four consecutive calendar
quarters - four thousand dollars ($4,000).

public, educational and government channels, collectively known as "PEG channels." Company
shall not exercise any editorial control over the content provided on such PEG channels.
(1) One public access channel for use by members of the general public, to be
administered and operated by Company until Municipality:
A. Designates an institution or institutions to administer such channel; and
B. Notifies Company either that each such institution has in full force and effect

several municipalities and school districts as set forth in Appendix D.
(2) Municipality, on six months written notice to Company may allocate or reallocate
the administration and operation of the PEG channels among and between
different uses and PEG channel operators. This expressly includes Municipality
requiring several different persons to share or jointly use a given PEG channel or
conversely allowing one or more persons currently sharing such a channel to have
a channel on which they are the sole user.
(c) Company Use. Municipality may from time to time adopt and revise rules and
procedures as to when and how Company may use the PEG channels for the provision of video
programming when the PEG channels are not being used for their respective purposes. Company
will use the PEG channels solely in accordance with such rules and procedures and otherwise
shall have no responsibility or control with respect to the operation of such channels except as
provided by law.
(1) With Municipality's agreement Company may provide programming on any PEG
channel which is underutilized, however the content of such programming shall be
generally consistent with the nature of the PEG channel in question (for example,
C-Span, C-Span 2, educational programming or the like to be provided on the
shared PEG channel).
(d) Lines and Facilities.
(1) Company shall provide and maintain at its expense the lines and facilities
necessary for it to receive PEG channel programming for simultaneous distribution
on the cable system. This shall include Company providing the lines, modulators
and facilities (such as two-way activated drops) necessary to provide live program
origination capability from the studios (or other similar fixed signal origination
point) for the PEG Channels set forth in Section I.C, II.C or III.C (whichever is
applicable) of Appendix D (but not video production or playback equipment).

or III.D (whichever is applicable) of Appendix D.
2002 Replacement
806.06 BUSINESS REGULATION AND TAXATION CODE 16L

Municipality (or third party, not Company) shall bear the additional cost (if any) to
Company due to such change.
(e) Studio, Van. Company shall continue to make available to Municipality and the PEG
channel operators on a non-exclusive shared basis the existing studio and existing mobile
production van for the production and presentation of programming on the PEG channels.
(1) The studio may be either:
A. Company's current studio which is used both by Company for its local
origination programming and by the PEG channels (or persons creating
programming for the PEG channels) throughout the Flint Metropolitan Area;
or
B. A separate, stand-alone studio administered by a non-profit organization or
local unit of government serving all or a portion of the Flint Metropolitan
Area (including such a studio which is combined or associated with related
non-profit or governmental activities and organizations, such as a theater,
radio station or computer/internet training/hosting/production site).
(2) The studio shall be the former of the two options until otherwise elected by
Municipality and other municipalities in the Flint Metropolitan Area served by
Company who collectively have at least 50% of the cable subscribers in the Flint
Metropolitan Area then being served by Company.
(f) PEG Access Assistance. Company shall provide to Municipality grants for capital
facilities for the PEG channels on the dates and in the amounts set forth below where "capital
facilities" means those facilities that qualify as same under Federal Cable Act Section 622(g)(2)(c);
47 U.S.C. Section 542(g)(2)(c). Company will not directly or indirectly challenge any classification
by Municipality or a PEG channel operator of an item as a "capital facility" if such classification is
arguably correct. However, Company reserves its rights regarding any third party challenge to a
"capital facilities" classification by Municipality or a PEG channel operator. Municipality shall
allocate such grants among the PEG channel operators as it determines is in the public interest,
may place such grants in an interest bearing account for such allocation in a subsequent year, or
may direct Company to pay the grant directly to the PEG channel operators as Municipality
determines is in the public interest. The grants and their timing are as follows:
(1) Within 30 days of the effective, date, twenty-two thousand five hundred fifty
dollars ($22,500). This grant is for a suitcase studio and related equipment.
(2) Annual grants on September 1, 2001, and on September 1 of each successive year
(until replaced by Municipality's electing grants pursuant to Section 806.07(f)(3)).

Municipality served by Company on July 1 preceding the
2002 Replacement
16M Cable Communications Systems 806.06
September 1 in question times $1.75 with the $1.75 figure to be adjusted annually
starting with the September 1, 2002, grant for inflation computed according to the
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Detroit 1982-1984 =100, with
January, 2000, as the base point.
(3) If and when the separate stand alone studio described in Section 806.06(e)(2) is
elected by Municipality pursuant to Section 806.06(e)(1) or if Municipality
otherwise takes action with some or all municipalities in the Flint Metropolitan
Area such that Company no longer has to maintain a studio, van, personnel and
their associated and related costs (for providing a public access channel) as
generally described in Section 806.06, then (instead of the sums set forth in
Section 806.06(f)(2)), Company will pay Municipality one-half of one percent of
Company's cable gross revenues computed and paid quarterly in the same manner
as which Company pays franchise fees under Section 806.08 of this chapter.
Because such payment in parts offset operational costs (salaries and the like)
which Company would otherwise incur, any payments under this Section
806.06(f)(3) may be used by Municipality or PEG channel operators for operational
costs associated with PEG Channels as well as for "capital facilities."
(4) For the purpose of computing the preceding grants, for multiple dwelling units or
bulk service, the number of cable subscribers shall be the number of dwelling units
(or other ultimate, individual customers) actually served.
(g) Separate Checks. To assist Municipality in separating checks for capital facilities or
PEG support from franchise fees all payments to Company pursuant to Section 806.06(f) shall be
by separate checks and shall not be combined with checks representing payments of franchise
fees under Section 806.08 of this chapter.
(h) Encouragement of Public Access Channel. Company shall use reasonable efforts to
publicize and promote the public access channel and to encourage members of the public to
provide programming on the public access channel.

own expense:
(1) Company shall make available at no charge to Municipality or to PEG channel
operators designated by Municipality unsold advertising avails into which
Company inserts advertising, up to a maximum of three, 30-second spots per
channel, per day, for spots promoting public, educational, and government access
programming.
(2) Company shall list all public, educational, and governmental access channels on
all print and cablecast electronic program guides, with individual, unique
descriptions on each channel, such as "Municipal Channel," "Schools Channel,"
"Schools/Municipal Channel," "Public Access Channel" and so on.

806.07 BUSINESS REGULATION AND TAXATION CODE 16N
(3) Company shall include written information about public, educational and
governmental access programming and activities in its customer handbook, and in
materials given to new subscribers.

own expense:
(1) Describing the public access channel, shared schools/municipal channel (and such
other PEG channels as may from time to time exist) at least yearly in any
newsletter which Municipality provides its residents;
(2) At least yearly similarly describing the contact person and procedures for persons
to put programming on the public access channel, and the procedures for becoming
qualified to use the studio, suitcase studios and mobile van;
(3) Where appropriate, setting minimum programming (as opposed to bulletin board)
and original programming requirements for PEG channel operators.

(e) Notice, Cooperation and Expenses. Municipality shall give Company prompt notice of
the making of any claim or the commencement of any action, suit or other proceeding covered by

806.08 FEES AND PAYMENTS.
(a) Franchise Fee. Company shall pay Municipality throughout the term of this franchise
an amount equal to five percent of Company's cable gross revenues. Once per calendar year
Municipality by resolution may elect to reduce such percentage to a smaller percentage, and by
resolution in a subsequent calendar year may change or revoke such election. Such payments
shall be made quarterly, and are due within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter.
(1) Each payment shall be accompanied by a written report to Municipality, verified
by an appropriate representative of Company containing an accurate statement in
summarized form of Company's cable gross revenues and the computation of the
payment amount.
(2) Municipality may audit Company to verify the accuracy of franchise fees paid
Municipality. Any additional amount due Municipality shall be paid within 30
days of Municipality's submitting an invoice for such sum, and if such sum shall
exceed four percent of the total franchise fee which the audit determines should
have been paid for any calendar year, Company shall pay Municipality's cost of
auditing that calendar year as well.
(3) If Company collects from subscribers that portion of the franchise fee attributable
to non-subscriber revenues (examples being revenues from tower rentals,
advertising or home shopping network commissions) then Company shall annually
monitor the amount of collections from subscribers during the prior year and
promptly correct any material over collection or under collection. Company shall
provide documentation of the preceding to Municipality, upon request.
(b) Discounted Rates. Company intends to market services on a "bundled" basis and to
fairly reflect an appropriate and reasonable division of revenue among the various services
offered. Whether or not Company separates services on a customer's bill, it will provide to
Municipality the amounts upon which it will pay a telecommunications services, and the amount
upon which it will pay the franchise fee. Should Company engage in a billing practice that, in the
determination of the Municipality, does not fairly reflect an appropriate split of revenue between
cable service and telecommunications services, Municipality will notify grantee in writing of its
determination. If the parties do not resort to methods of dispute resolution, including litigation,
the parties will meet and discuss in good faith whether the billing practices result in an unfair
payment of fees to Municipality. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Federal or State law
establishes the method by which the division of revenues should occur or that jurisdiction to
establish such guidelines appropriately rests with another body, such law shall supersede the
requirements of this division and be deemed by the parties to control.

franchise shall be in addition to and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies provided
by law or in equity. Municipality and Company understand and intend that such remedies shall

(c) Conferences. The parties hereby agree to meet at reasonable times on reasonable notice
to discuss any aspect of this franchise agreement, the provision of cable services or the cable
system during the term of this franchise agreement.
(d) Governing Law. This franchise agreement shall be construed pursuant to the laws of

(e) Waiver of Compliance. No failure by either party to insist upon the strict performance
of any covenant, agreement, term or condition of this franchise agreement, or to exercise any
right, term or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of any such
breach or such covenant, agreement, term or condition. No waiver of any breach shall affect or
alter this franchise agreement, but each and every covenant, agreement, term or condition of this
franchise agreement shall continue in full force and effect with respect to any other then existing
or subsequent breach thereof.
(1) Municipality may waive any obligation of Company under this franchise

allow Company to increase its rates under the FCC rules.

(2) Municipality grants this franchise solely for a cable system and for transaction of a
cable television business. Company may assert claims to the effect that once its
facilities have been placed in the streets and public ways it will be entitled under
Federal law to use them for other purposes without the consent or authorization of
Municipality and without necessarily paying compensation therefore. Municipality
disputes any such claim. Municipality further asserts that if any such claims by
Company were to be sustained there would be, among other things, an
unconstitutional taking of Municipality's property in violation of the Fifth
Amendment of the United States Constitution. Company disputes this claim.
Neither the issuance nor the acceptance of this franchise constitutes or will be
claimed to constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either
Municipality or Company in connection with these disputed issues. Municipality
and Company acknowledge that this section is not intended to be a comprehensive
statement of their respective claims and positions and that they intend to defer all
disputes that may arise out of or relate to use by Company of its facilities in the
streets and public ways for purposes other than a cable system.
(3) Company asserts that Municipality's franchise fees are limited by Federal statute
to 5% of revenues from "cable services," all as defined in Section 622 of the
Telecommunications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. Section 542. Municipality asserts that
any such limit is unconstitutional, among other things an unconstitutional taking
of Municipality's property in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States
Constitution. Company disputes this claim. Neither the issuance nor the
acceptance of this franchise constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a waiver or
relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either Municipality or Company in
connection with these disputed issues. Municipality and Company acknowledge
that this section is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of their
respective claims and positions and that they intend to defer all disputes that may
arise out of or relate to statutory limits on franchise fees.
(f) Independent Contractor Relationship. The relationship of Company to Municipality is
and shall continue to be an independent contractual relationship, and no liability or benefits, such
as worker's compensation, pension rights or liabilities, insurance rights or liabilities or other
provisions or liabilities, arising out of or related to a contract for hire or employer/employee
relationship, shall arise or accrue to either party or either party's agents or employees as a result
of the performance of this franchise agreement, unless expressly stated in this franchise
agreement.
(g) Severability. If any section, paragraph, or provision of this franchise agreement shall be
held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity or unenforceability of such
section, paragraph, or provision shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of this franchise
agreement.

(k) Conflicts. In the event of a conflict between this franchise agreement and the provisions
of any prior franchise or any franchise, permit, consent agreement or other agreement with
Company, the provisions of this franchise agreement shall control.
(l) Force Majeure. In the event Company's performance of any of the terms, conditions or
obligations required by this franchise agreement is prevented by a cause or event, not within
Company's reasonable control, it shall be deemed excused for the period of such inability and no
penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof. Causes or events not within the
control of Company shall include acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, failure
or loss of utilities, explosions, acts of public enemies and natural disasters.
(m) Franchise Agreement Accepted. Company further acknowledges by acceptance of this
franchise agreement that it has carefully read the terms and conditions of this franchise
agreement and accepts the lawful obligations imposed thereby. As of the effective date, and
without waiving any rights Company may have to challenge the lawfulness or enforceability of
the franchise agreement in the future, Company does not contend that any provision of the
franchise agreement is unlawful or unenforceable.
(n) Waiver of Compliance. No failure by either party to insist upon the strict performance of
any covenant, agreement, term or condition of this franchise agreement, or to exercise any right,
term or remedy upon a breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of any such breach or such
covenant, agreement, term or condition. No waiver of any breach shall affect or alter this

FCC DEFINITION OF CONTROL -- 47 C.F.R. ' 76.501
47 C.F.R. ' 76.501 Cross-ownership.
(a) No cable television system (including all parties under common control) shall carry the
signal of any television broadcast station if such system directly or indirectly owns, operates,
controls, or has an interest in a TV broadcast station whose predicted Grade B contour, computed
in accordance with ' 73.684 of part 73 of this chapter, overlaps in whole or in part the service
area of such system (i.e., the area within which the system is serving subscribers).
(b) [Reserved]
(c) Effective date. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section are not effective until
November 8, 1987, as to ownership interests proscribed herein if such interests were in existence
on or before July 1, 1970 (e.g., if franchise were in existence on or before July 1970), and will be
applied to cause divestiture as to ownership interests proscribed herein only where the cable
system is directly or indirectly, owned, operated, controlled by, or has an interest in a
non-satellite television broadcast station which places a principal community contour
encompassing the entire community and there is no other commercial non-satellite television
broadcast station placing a principal community contour encompassing the entire community.
(d) No cable operator shall offer satellite master antenna television service ("SMATV"), as
that service is defined in ' 76.5(a)(2), separate and apart from any franchised cable service in any
portion of the franchise area served by that cable operator's cable system, either directly or
indirectly through an affiliate owned, operated, controlled, or under common control with the
cable operator.
(e) (1) A cable operator may directly or indirectly, through an affiliate owned, operated,
controlled by, or under common control with the cable operator, offer SMATV
service within its franchise area if the cable operator's SMATV system was owned,
operated, controlled by or under common control with the cable operator as of
October 5, 1992.
(2) A cable operator may directly or indirectly, through an affiliate owned, operated,
controlled by, or under common control with the cable operator, offer service within
its franchise area through SMATV facilities, provided such service is offered in
accordance with the terms and conditions of a cable franchise agreement.
(f) The restrictions in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall not apply to any cable
operator in any franchise area in which a cable operator is subject to effective competition as
determined under section 623(1) of the Communications Act.

BUSINESS REGULATION AND TAXATION CODE 16Z-10
Note 1: The word "control" as used herein is not limited to majority stock ownership, but
includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised.
Note 2: In applying the provisions of this section, ownership and other interests in broadcast
licensees and cable television systems will be attributed to their holders and deemed cognizable
pursuant to the following criteria:
(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, partnership and direct ownership interest and any
voting stock interest amounting to 5% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a
corporate broadcast licensee or cable television system will be cognizable;
(b) No minority voting stock interest will be cognizable if there is a single holder of more
than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of the corporate broadcast licensee or cable
television system in which the minority interest is held;
(c) Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance companies and banks
holding stock through their trust departments in trust accounts will be considered to
have a cognizable interest only if they hold 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock
of a corporate broadcast licensee or cable television system, or if any of the officers or
directors of the broadcast licensee or cable television system are representatives of the
investment company, insurance company or bank concerned. Holdings by a bank or
insurance company will be aggregated if the bank or insurance company has any right
to determine how the stock will be voted. Holdings by investment companies will be
aggregated if under common management.
(d) Attribution of ownership interests in a broadcast licensee or cable television system
that are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening corporations will
be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link
in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution benchmark
to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership percentage for any link in
the chain exceeds 50%, it shall not be included for purposes of this multiplication. (For
example, if A owns 10% of company X, which owns 60% of company Y, which owns 25%
of "Licensee", then X's interest in "Licensee" would be 25% (the same as Y's interest
since X's interest in Y exceeds 50%), and A's interest in "Licensee" would be 2.5%
(0.1x0.25). Under the 5% attribution benchmark, X's interest in "Licensee" would be
cognizable, while A's interest would not be cognizable.)
(e) Voting stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any person who holds or share
the power to vote such stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell such stock,
and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee
at will. If the trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the
grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed
with the stock interests held in trust. An otherwise qualified trust will be ineffective to
insulate the grantor or beneficiary from attribution with the trust's assets unless all
voting stock interests held by the grantor or beneficiary in the relevant broadcast
licensee or cable television system are subject to said trust.
2002 Replacement
16Z-11 Cable Communications System
(g) (1) A limited partnership interest shall be attributed to a limited partner unless that
partner is not materially involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or
operation of the media-related activities of the partnership and the licensee or
system so certifies.
(2) In order for a licensee or system to make the certification set forth in paragraph
(g)(1) of this note, it must verify that the partnership agreement or certificate of
limited partnership, with respect to the particular limited partner exempt from
attribution, establishes that the exempt limited partner has not material
involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the media
activities of the partnership. The criteria which would assure adequate insulation
for purposes of this certification are described in the Memorandum Opinion and
Order in MM Docket No. 83-46, FCC 85-252 (released June 24, 1985) as modified
on reconsideration in the Memorandum Opinion and Order in MM Docket No.
83-46, FCC 86-410 (released November 28, 1986). Irrespective of the terms of the
certificate of limited partnership or partnership agreement, however, no such
certification shall be made if the individual or entity making the certification has
actual knowledge of any material involvement of the limited partners in the
management or operation of the media-related businesses of the partnership.
(h) Officers and directors of a broadcast licensee or cable television system are considered to
have a cognizable interest in the entity with which they are so associated. If any such entity
engages in businesses in addition to its primary business of broadcasting or cable television
service, it may request the Commission to waive attribution for any officer or director whose
duties and responsibilities are wholly unrelated to its primary business. The officers and directors
of a parent company of a broadcast licensee or cable television system, with an attributable
interest in any such subsidiary entity, shall be deemed to have a cognizable interest in the
subsidiary unless the duties and responsibilities of the officer or director involved are wholly
unrelated to the broadcast licensee or cable television system subsidiary, and a statement
properly documenting this fact is submitted to the Commission. (This statement may be included
on appropriate Ownership Report.) The officers and directors of a sister corporation of a broadcast
licensee or cable television system shall not be attributed with ownership of these entities by
virtue of such status.
(i) Discrete ownership interests will be aggregated in determining whether or not an
interest is cognizable under this section. An individual or entity will be deemed to have a
cognizable investment if:
(1) The sum of the interests held by or through "passive investors" is equal to or
exceeds 10 percent; or
(2) The sum of the interests other than those held by or through "passive investors" is
equal to or exceeds 5 percent; or
2002 Replacement
BUSINESS REGULATION AND TAXATION CODE 16Z-12
(3) The sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(1) of this note plus the sum
of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(2) of this note is equal to or exceeds
10 percent.
Note 3: In cases where record and beneficial ownership of voting stock is not identical (e.g.,
bank nominees holding stock as record owners for the benefit of mutual funds, brokerage houses
holding stock in street names for benefit of customers, investment advisors holding stock in their
own names for the benefit of clients, and insurance companies holding stock), the party having
the right to determine how the stock will be voted will be considered to own it for purposes of this
subpart.
Note 4: Paragraph (a) of this section will not be applied so as to require the divestiture of
ownership interests proscribed herein solely because of the transfer of such interests to heirs or
legatees by will or intestacy, provided that the degree or extent of the proscribed cross-ownership
is not increased by such transfer.
Note 5: In applying the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, control and an
attributable ownership interest shall be defined by reference to the definitions contained in Notes
1 through 4, provided however, that:
(a) The single majority shareholder provisions of Note 2(b) and the limited partner
insulation provisions of Note 2(g) shall not apply; and
(b) The provisions of Note 2(a) regarding five (5) percent interests shall include all voting
or nonvoting stock or limited partnership equity interests of five (5) percent or more.

has been assessed to the City at large.
(h) Certificate of Assessor. When the City Assessor has completed such assessment roll, he or
she shall attach thereto, or endorse thereon, his or her certificate to the effect that such roll has been

of frontage to be assessed for any such improvement, object, in writing, to the proposed improvement,
the improvement shall not be made by proceedings authorized by this chapter without a four-fifths vote
of the members of Council, provided that this section shall not apply to sidewalk construction.

special assessment roll, and upon confirmation such roll shall be final and conclusive.
(p) Contractual Provision. If all persons or property owners to be affected by any proposed
improvement agree that such proposed improvement be made and that a special assessment be levied
in connection therewith, the City may, in lieu of the procedure set forth in this section, enter into a written
contract with all of the persons or property owners affected thereby, which contract, when properly
approved and executed, shall operate as a complete special assessment procedure, and the assessment
shall be made in accordance with such contract. (Ord. 24. Passed 12-8-54.)
1020.04 HAZARD REMOVAL OR NUISANCE ABATEMENT.
(a) Resolution and Notice. When any lot, building or structure in the City, because of an
accumulation of refuse or debris, the uncontrolled growing of noxious weeds, age, dilapidation or any other
condition or happening, becomes, in the opinion of Council, a public hazard or nuisance which is
dangerous to the health, safety or welfare of the inhabitants of the City or to those residing or habitually
going near such lot, building or structure, Council may, by resolution, after investigation, determine that
a hazard or nuisance exists, prescribe a form of notice and direct the City Clerk to give such notice by

Mayor, Council shall, if it so desires, determine, by resolution, that the work be done, setting forth the
details concerning it, prescribing a form of notice and directing the City Clerk to give such notice by
publication or by registered mail addressed to the last known address of the owner of the land to be
assessed.
(f) Contents of Notice. The notice shall specify the extent of the work to be done, describe the
property affected by the work, require the owner to perform the work promptly, in accordance with the
plans and specifications of the Engineer, and designate a time within which the same shall be done.
(g) Work Done by City. If, at the expiration of the time limit specified in the notice, within which

1020.06 SINGLE LOT PROCEDURE.
(a) Report of Mayor. When any expense has been incurred by the City upon or with respect to
any single lot or parcel of land, which expense is chargeable against such lot or parcel of land and the
owner thereof under authority of the City Charter, any City ordinance or State law, and which expense
is not of that class required to be prorated among several lots or parcels of land in a special assessment

roll, including all lots and parcels of land within the special assessment district designated by Council,
and shall assess to each such lot or parcel of land such sums as may have been directed by Council.

she shall attach thereto and endorse thereon his or her certificate to the effect that such roll has been
made by him or her pursuant to a resolution of Council (giving the date of adoption of the same) and
that in making the assessments therein, he or she has, as near as may be, according to his or her best
judgment, conformed in all respects to the directions contained in such resolution, the City Charter and
this chapter. Thereupon, he or she shall file the special assessment roll with the City Clerk who shall
forthwith give notice as required by Council.

1020.07 LIENS ON PROPERTY.
(a) Establishment. Special assessments and all interest and charges thereon, from the date of
confirmation of a special assessment roll, shall be and remain a lien upon the property assessed of the
same character and effect as the lien created by general law for State and County taxes or by the City
Charter for City taxes, until paid.
(b) Character and Effect. All such liens shall be of the same character and effect as liens created
by the City Charter for taxes and shall include accrued interest and penalties.
(c) Destruction or Impairment. No judgment or decree, nor any action of Council vacating a
special assessment, shall destroy or impair the lien of the City upon the premises assessed for such
amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the same, or as by regular mode of
proceeding might have been lawfully assessed thereon.
(d) Failure to Receive Notice. Failure of any owner to receive any notice required to be sent under
the provisions of the City Charter and this chapter shall not invalidate any special assessment or special
assessment roll.
(e) Personal Liability of Owner. In addition to the property tax lien created herein, any special
assessment levied by the City shall constitute a debt owed to the City from the owner of the lot or parcel
of land assessed and may be collected in the same manner as any contracted debt
or in the same manner as provided by law for the collection of personal property taxes.
(Ord. 24. Passed 12-8-54.)
1020.08 INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.
(a) Number; Minimum Amount. Annual installments shall not exceed ten in number, as Council
may determine at the time of confirmation of a special assessment roll, and if a division of the assessment
operates to make any installment less than ten dollars ($10.00), the City Assessor shall reduce the
number of installments so that each installment shall be above and as near to ten dollars ($10.00) as
possible.
(b) Due Date. All special assessments levied under this chapter shall become due upon
confirmation of the special assessment roll, and if they are to be paid in annual installments, Council shall
determine the first installment to be due upon confirmation of the roll. Deferred installments shall be due
annually thereafter, or, at the discretion of Council, they may be spread upon and made a part of each
annual City tax roll thereafter until all are paid.
(c) First Installment Spread. The first installment of any special assessment shall be spread upon
a special City tax roll in a column headed "Special Assessment," or upon the next annual City tax roll,
at the direction of Council. If such first installment is spread on a special tax roll, it may be paid at any
time within three months from the date of confirmation without penalties, and if unpaid on or before such
three month period, it shall be added to and made a part of the following July tax roll, together with interest
as provided thereon.
(d) Annual Installment Spread. Annual installments shall be spread thereafter either on a special
assessment roll or on the annual City tax roll, as directed by Council, in the same manner and subject
to the same provisions as provided for first installments.
(e) Publication of Notice to Pay. The assessment roll shall be transmitted by the Clerk to the City
Treasurer for collection immediately after confirmation. If it is not a part of the annual tax roll, the City
Treasurer shall give notice by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation that such
special assessment roll (describing it) has been filed in the City Treasurer's office and specifying when
and where payments may be made thereon.
(f) Notice by Mail. The City Treasurer may mail statements of the several assessments to the
respective owners, as indicated by the records of the City Assessor, of the several lots or parcels of land
assessed, stating the amount of the assessment and the manner in which it may be paid. However, failure
to mail any such statement shall not invalidate the assessment or entitle the owner to an extension of
time within which to pay the assessment.
(g) Collection Fees and Penalties. After the confirmation of any special assessment roll, the same
collection fees shall be collected on delinquent special assessments and upon delinquent installments of
such special assessments beginning on the first day of the fourth month following the due date, as provided
by the City Charter for the collection of delinquent City taxes.
(h) Contested Assessments. Except and unless written notice is given to Council of an intention
to contest or enjoin the collection of any special assessment for the construction of any pavement, sewer,
other public improvement or sidewalk, or for the removal or abatement of any public hazard or nuisance,
within thirty days after the date of the meeting of Council at which it is finally determined to proceed with
the making of the improvement in question, which notice shall state the grounds on which the proceedings
are to be contested, no suit or action of any kind shall be instituted or maintained for the purpose of
contesting or enjoining the collection of such special assessment. Regardless of whether or not any public
improvement is completed in any special assessment district, no owner of real property located in such
district shall be entitled to commence any suit or action for the purpose of contesting or enjoining the
collection of any such special assessment after he or she has received the benefits from the substantial
completion of that portion of such public improvement for which he or she is assessed.
(Ord. 24. Passed 12-8-54.)
1020.09 REBATES, REASSESSMENTS AND ADDITIONAL
ASSESSMENTS.
(a) Certification. The Mayor shall, within sixty days after the completion of each local or special
public improvement, compile the actual cost thereof and certify the same to the City Assessor who shall
adjust the special assessment roll to correspond therewith.
(b) Additional Assessments. When any special assessment roll proves insufficient to pay the cost
of the improvement for which it was made, Council may make an additional pro rata assessment, but the
total amount assessed against any one lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits
received by such lot or parcel of land.
(c) Assessment Refunds. If the assessment proves larger than necessary by five percent or less,
such information shall be reported to Council which may place the excess in the City Treasury or make
a refund thereof pro rata according to the assessment. If the assessment exceeds the amount necessary
by more than five percent, the entire excess shall be refunded to the owners of the property upon which
payments have been made in full, pro rata according to the assessment.
(d) Refund Procedure on Installments. Any excess refund, where payment in full has not been
received, shall be made a credit against future unpaid installments in the inverse order in which they are
payable to the extent that such installments exist, and the balance of such refund shall be made in cash.
(e) Restriction Against Refund. No refunds of special assessments may be made which impair
or contravene the provisions of any outstanding obligation or bond secured in whole or in part by such
special assessment.
(f) Illegal or Invalid Assessments. Whenever Council determines that a special assessment is
invalid or defective for any reason whatsoever, or if any court of competent jurisdiction has adjudged such
an assessment to be illegal for any reason whatsoever, in whole or in part, Council may cause a new
assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made, whether the
improvement or any part thereof has been completed or not, and whether any part of the assessment
has been collected or not.
(g) Proceedings on Reassessment. All proceedings on reassessments and for the collection
thereof shall be made in the same manner as provided for an original assessment. If any portion of the
original assessment has been collected and not refunded, if shall be applied upon the reassessment, and
the reassessment shall, to that extent, be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount reassessed has
been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the person making such payments.
(Ord. 24. Passed 12-8-54.)
1020.10 RESTRICTIONS.
(a) Assessment Limited to Value of Benefits. The total amount assessed against any lot or parcel
of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement.
(b) Special Fund. Except as otherwise provided in the City Charter and this chapter, moneys
raised by special assessment to pay the cost of any local improvement shall be held in a special fund
to pay such cost or to repay any moneys borrowed therefor.
(c) Restricted Use of Funds. Each special assessment account shall be used only for the
improvement project for which the assessment was levied, except as otherwise provided in the City
Charter.
(Ord. 24. Passed 12-8-54.)

1022.01 DUTIES OF OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS.
It shall be the duty of every owner, agent or occupant of any lot or parcel of land situated within
the City to keep and maintain good and sufficient sidewalks along all the streets and avenues in front
of or adjacent to such lots or parcels of land.
(Ord. 20. Passed 5-25-49.)
1022.02 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
All sidewalks, crosswalks and approaches hereafter constructed or repaired in streets within the City
shall be constructed or repaired according to the following specifications:
(a) Location, Grades, Widths. Sidewalks to be constructed shall be located one foot from the
property line, unless special permission is granted by Council to locate sidewalks at any other location.
All sidewalks shall be upon such grade as Council may direct and shall not be less than four feet in width.
(b) Filling, Depth and Grade. All necessary filling shall be made with earth free from vegetable
material or refuse of any kind. It shall be deposited in layers not exceeding six inches thick and each
layer shall be tamped by a hand tamper or packed by other means which will produce the same results
to the established grade, allowing for the thickness of the walk to be built upon it. The fill on the top
shall extend one foot in width on each side beyond the walk to be built upon it. Its sides shall be
constructed with a slope of not less than one and one-half feet horizontal to one foot vertical. No walk
shall be constructed upon the fill until the earth is sufficiently compact to prevent settlement.
(c) Unsuitable Filling. Any soft material subject to shrinkage or decay, trees under six inches in
diameter, or other unsuitable material designated by the Director of Public Works, shall be removed and
the space backfilled with well-tamped earth.
(d) Tree Removal. All trees which are on the line of the sidewalk work, or which interfere with
the proper placing of the sidewalk, and which require moving, will be removed by the City at the expense
of the person adjacent to whose property the sidewalk is to be constructed.
(e) Cuts. When cuts are necessary, the earth or other material shall be excavated to such width
that the bottom of the excavation shall be at least one foot wider on each side than the width of the walk
to be built upon it, and the sides shall, where possible, slope two feet horizontal to one foot vertical.
Excavated material shall be removed from the site of the work, and any excess of excavation over fill
shall be disposed of by the builder. The bottom of the cut shall be tamped, provided it is not sufficiently
firm.
(f) Material Required. Walks shall be constructed of cement concrete.
(g) Forms. The forms for the concrete shall be smooth, free from warp, of sufficient strength to
resist springing out of shape and of a depth to conform to the thickness of the proposed walk. The divider
plates shall be removed from forms that have been previously used.
The forms shall preferably be of steel and must be well staked and set to the
established lines, their upper edges conforming to the grade of the finished walk, which walk shall have
a fall towards the gutter of one-quarter of an inch to one foot.
The base shall be blocked out in sections which will not measure more than
four feet in any dimension, and in any given walk such sections are to be uniformly spaced.
The divider plates shall be made of steel not less than one-eighth of an inch
in thickness of a depth to correspond to the thickness of the proposed walk, shall extend the full width
of the walk and shall be set at right angles to the side forms. They shall be left in place until the surface
coat is floated.
(h) Expansion Joints. On concrete walks, three-quarter inch expansion joints composed of some
asphaltic composition satisfactory to Council shall be placed between curbs and walks at all points where
they meet and in intermediate joints at distances not to exceed eighty feet. These joints are to be flush
with the wearing surface and are to extend for the full depth of the walk.
(i) Mixing and Placing Concrete. All concrete shall be mixed with a batch mixer of an approved
type except where the Director of Public Works may deem it necessary or expedient to mix by hand
methods. In the event hand mixing is resorted to, it shall be done only as directed by the Director, in
writing.
Water shall be used in sufficient quantities to obtain concrete which will hold its shape
when struck off with a template. In no case shall such concrete be wet enough to cause a separation
of materials.
Concrete shall be placed in such manner as to produce a dense homogeneous mass.
It shall be puddled, sliced or tamped with proper tools for such purpose while being deposited.
Special care must be exercised in reinforced concrete work not to distort or displace
any reinforcing steel during concreting.
No used concrete or retempering of concrete which has partially set will be allowed
either by the addition of water or by mixing it with other materials.
Concrete shall not be mixed or deposited when the temperature is below forty
degrees Fahrenheit, unless special precautions, subject to the approval of the Director, are taken to avoid
the use of materials containing frost and to keep the work protected until thoroughly hardened.
In warm weather, walks shall be protected from the sun by a covering and shall be
kept moist by sprinkling for at least four days. At least once on small areas, and at least every fifty feet
on long stretches, suitable nameplates or dies shall be used to mark the name of the builder employed
on the work and the date the work was done.
(j) Quantities of Cement Required. For a one course walk, the minimum amount of cement
required for the concrete is one barrel of cement for each sixty square feet of four-inch sidewalk.
For two course walks, the minimum amount of cement required for the concrete is
one barrel for each 100 square feet of base course, and one barrel for each 100 square feet of top. In
no case shall the builders use less than these amounts of cement in sidewalk construction. In the event
that less cement than the above requirement is used in any walk constructed, the builder may be required
to tear out the walk and replace it with a walk containing the proper amount of cement as required herein.
Due allowance will be made for any waste in mixing and placing concrete in forms.
(k) Gravel. Clean, hard, washed gravel, free from soft, porous particles, clay, silt or vegetable
matter, may be used which may be finished to leave a reasonably smooth and nonporous surface.
(l) Base Course. A two course concrete sidewalk shall consist of a bottom course three inches
thick under a wearing or top course of cement mortar one inch thick.
The base shall be mixed in a batch mixer in the proportion of one part by volume
of cement to six parts by volume of well graded bank-run gravel, free from clay, loam or vegetable matter
as herein specified. In preparing concrete for the base, cement and gravel shall be measured separately
and then mixed thoroughly while dry.
After being mixed dry, sufficient water shall be added to obtain the desired
consistency and the mixing shall be continued until the materials are uniformly distributed and each particle
of the same is thoroughly coated with cement. All concrete shall be mixed for not less than fifty seconds
after the addition of water.
The consistency of the mixture shall be such that the mortar, composed of cement
and the fine material, adheres to the pebbles, and such that under heavy tamping, a small amount of
water will flush to the surface.
The concrete shall be deposited in such quantities that after being thoroughly
rammed into place, it will be three inches in thickness and the upper surface shall be true, uniform, parallel
to and one inch below the surface of the finished work.
Concrete must be conveyed from the place of mixing and placed in such manner
and so handled after depositing it that the concrete will be of uniform composition throughout, showing
no lack or excess of mortar in any place.
(m) Wearing Surface. The wearing surface shall be composed of one part by volume of cement
to two parts by volume of clean sand screened through a one-quarter inch screen, not more than five
percent of which shall pass a number 100 sieve. The sand and cement shall be mixed thoroughly while
dry and then sufficient water added while the mixing is continued to produce a mortar of a consistency
which can be easily spread into position with a straight edge. The mortar shall be spread on the base
immediately after mixing and before the base has obtained its initial set.
After the wearing surface has been worked to an approximately true plane, the slab
marking shall be made directly over the joints in the base. Such marking shall be made with a tool which
will cut entirely through and completely separate the surface of adjacent slabs.
The slabs shall be rounded on all surface edges to a radius of about one-half of an
inch.
The surface shall be troweled smooth and shall then be lightly brushed with a stiff
brush or broom. The application of neat cement in the surface in order to hasten hardening is prohibited.
(n) Faulty Materials. No materials of any sort not approved by Council are to be used in any part
of the work.
All cement used shall be some recognized brand of cement that has proven
satisfactory and shall comply with the latest specifications of the American Society for Testing Materials.
The right is hereby reserved to inspect and test cement at any time that Council
deems it advisable to make such tests. If, in the short period tests, it appears that a certain shipment
of cement is not up to the desired standard, no cement from this lot shall be used until the time necessary
to complete the tests requiring more time has elapsed. If, after these tests have been made, it still
appears that the cement is not satisfactory, then any part of this cement on the job shall be hauled away
and disposed of in some manner which will insure its not being used in any part of the work. Lumps
of cement are to be thrown out in all cases. They shall not be used either as lumps or by attempting
to pulverize them.
(o) Walks Across Driveways. All sidewalks constructed, reconstructed or repaired which cross
existing or proposed driveways shall be built six inches in thickness and the concrete used shall be of
the same mixture as specified for other walks.
(p) Grades; Permits Required. All sidewalks, crosswalks and approaches hereafter constructed
or repaired in streets within the City shall be upon such grade and line as shall be established by Council.
All joints and edges shall be finished with tools for that purpose. In the case of walks
on slopes greater than one-half inch per foot, grooving or brooming or checking the top surface shall be
done as directed by the Director of Public Works.
No such construction, reconstruction or repair work shall be commenced until after
a permit has been obtained from Council.
(q) Approaches. For the purpose of this chapter, "approaches" shall be taken to mean either
driveways or sidewalks built on the street property between the gutter line and the sidewalk line, or other
miscellaneous construction of a similar nature within the limits of the public streets and highways.
(r) Crosswalks. All crosswalks shall be built and kept in repair by the City under the direction of
Council and shall be not less than four feet wide and of such material as heretofore specified. The
expense of building and repairing crosswalks shall be paid out of the General Highway or Street Fund.
(s) Permitted Contractors. All sidewalks shall be built:
(1) By the City by the direct employment of labor and the purchase of materials;
(2) By private contract under the supervision of, and with an inspection by, the City; or
(3) By bonded sidewalk contractors as hereinafter noted, under the direction of Council.
The construction of walks through the City may be undertaken by the
employment of labor and purchase of materials by the owner, provided that a full-time City inspector is
employed on the job to check, supervise and inspect the work and provided that all expense of employing
such inspector is paid by the owner.
(Ord. 20. Passed 5-25-49.)
1022.03 DANGEROUS SIDEWALKS AND CROSSWALKS.
Whenever any sidewalk, crosswalk or approach, or any portion of the same, by reason of defects
or for want of repair, becomes dangerous to persons passing along and upon the same, it shall be the
duty of the City to tear up and remove the dangerous portions, or cause such removal to be done, and
replace the sidewalk, crosswalk or approach with earth or gravel, if required, so as to make it safe for
persons passing along and upon the space from which the sidewalk, crosswalk or approach has been
removed.

Sewers
EDITOR'S NOTE: Ordinance No. 08-06, passed March 12, 2008, repealed
in its entirety Ordinance No. 40, passed January 13, 1968, codified as Chapter 1040,
Sewers, and adopts a new Genesee County Sewer Use Ordinance for the City of
Grand Blanc (hereinafter referred to as the "Ordinance").
The Ordinance establishes uniform requirements for discharges by users
located within the City to Genesee County POTW, and to enable the City and the
County Agency to comply with applicable State and Federal laws as required by the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also knows as the "Clean Water Act"), as
amended, 33 U.S.C. '' 1251, et seq.; the General Pretreatment Regulations (40
CFR part 403); Part 31 of Act 451 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1994, MCL

Michigan Administrative Code, R 323.2301 et seq., as amended, promulgated
pursuant to Sections 3103, 3106, and 3109 of Part 31 of Act 451 of Public Acts of
Michigan of 1994, as amended.
The Ordinance prohibits the discharge of pollutants from within the City into the
Genesee County POTW that do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements; that would interfere with the operation of the POTW; that would pass
through the POTW into receiving waters or the atmosphere, the environment, or
otherwise be incompatible with the POTW; that would inhibit or disrupt the POTW's
processing, use or disposal of sludge; that would cause health or safety problems
for POTW workers; or that would result in a violation of the POTW's NPDES Permit
or of other applicable laws and regulations.
The Ordinance is intended to improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim
wastewaters and sludge from the Genesee County POTW, as required by law.
The Ordinance regulates the discharge of wastewater and/or pollutants to the
POTW and provides the authority to enforce the requirements of the Ordinance
through the issuance of permits and through other means as provided by the
Ordinance.
The Ordinance authorizes and requires all inspection, monitoring, reporting and
enforcement activities as necessary to insure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements and other applicable laws and regulations.

STREETS, UTILITIES AND PUBLIC SERVICES CODE 28
The Ordinance provides for the equitable distribution and recovery of costs from
users of the Genesee County POTW sufficient to administer regulatory activities and
to meet the costs of the operation, maintenance, improvement, and replacement of
the POTW.
The Ordinance applies to any person that discharges to the Genesee County
POTW from within the City. The Ordinance also applies to any person owning, using,
constructing or maintaining any private system or facility intended or used for the
disposal of sewage or wastewater within the City.
The Ordinance designates, empowers and authorizes the Genesee County
POTW to act as the agent and representative of the City for the purposes of
administering and enforcing the Ordinance within the City. This includes, but is not
limited to, the power and authority of the POTW, as deemed necessary by the POTW,
to immediately and independently investigate, enforce, and prosecute

or of any notice, order, permit, decision or determination promulgated, issued or
made by the POTW under the Ordinance, and to otherwise implement the
requirements of the Ordinance.
The Ordinance makes it unlawful for any person to discharge any wastewater
or pollutant to the POTW or to any storm sewer or natural outlet within the City or
in any area under the jurisdiction of the City, except in accordance with the provisions
of the Ordinance and other applicable laws and regulations. If any user discharges
or proposes to discharge wastewaters or pollutants that are prohibited or limited by
the Ordinance, the POTW may take any action as provided by the Ordinance or other
applicable laws or regulations to assure and require compliance with the provisions
of the Ordinance.

pipe, plus the cost of the corporation cock and stop and waste cocks, which charges will be based on
current material and labor costs.
(h) When a permit is requested for service to a building under construction, the owner shall pay

three-fourths inch meter will be furnished. Where application is made for a meter larger than five-eighths
inch or five-eighths inch by three-fourths inch, the Director of Public Works shall determine whether a
meter of such size is required. The Water Department will furnish meters in sizes up to and including
two inches. Where a meter larger than two inches is required, special arrangements shall be made
between the Department and the customer. All such special arrangements shall be approved by Council
before becoming effective.
(d) Meters shall be set in an accessible location and in a manner satisfactory to the Director.
Where the premises contain no basement or cellar, the meter shall be installed in a location which shall
be approved by the Director. Where it is necessary to set the meter in a pit, such pit shall be built at
the expense of the owner as directed by the Director and to his or her entire satisfaction.
(e) Meters will be sealed by the Department. No person, except an authorized employee of the
Department, shall break or injure such seals. No person, other than an authorized employee of the
Department, shall change the location of, alter or interfere in any way with the meter.
(f) The expense of installing, replacing and maintaining meters, after the purchase of the initial
meter at the owner=s expense, will be borne by the Department with the exception of irrigation meters,
which costs shall be borne by the owner. However, where replacements, repairs or adjustments of a meter
installed by the Department are made necessary by the act, negligence or carelessness of the owner or
occupant of the premises, the expense to the Department caused thereby shall be charged and collected
from the owner of the premises.
(g) The owner or occupant of the premises where a meter is installed will be held responsible for
its care and protection from freezing and from injury or interference by any person. In case of injury to
the meter or in case of its stoppage or imperfect operation, the owner or occupant of the premises shall
give immediate notice to the Water Department. All water furnished by the City and used on any premises
must pass through the meter. No by-pass or connection around the meter will be permitted. If any meter
becomes defective or fails to register, the consumer will be charged at the average bimonthly consumption
rate as shown by the meter over the period of the preceding four bimonthly periods when the meter was
accurately registering.
(h) The accuracy of the meter on any premises will be tested by the Department upon written
request of the owner, who shall pay, in advance, a fee determined from time to time by Council, to cover
the cost of the test. If, on such test, the meter is found to register over five percent more water than
actually passes through it, another meter will be substituted therefor,

request of the owner or his or her agent. However, a plumber may open and close a service cock to
test his or her work, as provided in Section 1042.03(e).
(b) If a permit is issued as provided in Section 1042.03(h) and a water meter has been installed
for the temporary use of water, the owner shall notify the Department upon the completion of his or her
work so that the water meter may be read and the connection shut off.
(c) Where a building originally built as a single dwelling and fitted with one service pipe is thereafter

a separate meter within thirty days after such division, or special arrangements shall be made to cover
such subdivision.
(d) No person shall take or use City water from premises other than his or her own, and no person

off from such premises after giving twenty-four hours notice to the owner or occupant thereof.
(h) Where pipes are provided for fire protection on any premises, or where hose connections for
fire apparatus are provided, each such connection or opening of the service pipes shall have not less
than twenty-five feet of fire hose constantly attached thereto, and no water shall be taken through such

specifically designed to:
(a) Provide for orderly growth and harmonious development of the community, consistent with
orderly growth policies.
(b) Secure adequate traffic circulation through coordinated street systems with proper relation to
major thoroughfares, adjoining developments, and public facilities.

control.
(Ord. 215. Passed 9-5-90.)

1224.11 REQUIREMENTS FOR UNDERGROUND WIRING.
The proprietor shall make arrangements for all lines for telephone, electric, television and other
similar services distributed by wire or cable to be placed underground entirely throughout a subdivided
area. Such conduits or cables shall be placed within private easements provided to such service
companies by the proprietor or within dedicated public ways. All such facilities placed in dedicated public
ways shall be planned so as not to conflict with other underground utilities.
(Ord. 215. Passed 9-5-90.)
1224.12 WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM.
All land divisions, condominiums and subdivisions shall be serviced by a public water supply system,
fire hydrants and other required water system appurtenances. This system shall be provided by the
subdivider in accordance with the requirements of the City of Grand Blanc. (Ord. 215. Passed 9-5-90.)
1224.13 SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.
All land divisions, condominiums and subdivisions shall be serviced by a public sanitary
sewerage system. Sanitary sewers and other required appurtenances thereto shall be provided by the

1224.14 GREENBELTS AND DECORATIVE ENTRANCEWAYS.
Where the proprietor/subdivider elects to provide greenbelts and/or constructs decorative or
other improved entranceways, financial or other guarantees shall be made to the City Council to insure
continued upkeep and maintenance of all improvements. Such guarantees may consist of a deed
restriction or covenant which requires all future purchasers of lots in the subdivision or condominium to
belong to a homeowners association and to pay an annual fee adequate to maintain and upkeep the
improvements to their original condition. Failure to provide adequate funds to accomplish this to the
satisfaction of the City Council shall empower the City to carry out the improvements and upkeep and
to make such assessments as are required to pay the costs incurred to the City against the owner of the
lots contained within the subdivision or condominium.
Each entranceway to any newly developed condominium or subdivision development shall have
no less than two street lights installed, which meet the theme, standards and style of those installed along
the South Saginaw Street (downtown) Streetscape Project. All costs for the initial installation shall be the
responsibility of the developer. After the installation, all maintenance costs shall be the responsibility of
the City. (Ord. 215. Passed 9-5-90.)
1224.15 STORM SEWERS OR DRAINS; SPECIAL SEWER OR WATER
FACILITIES.
No subdivision will be accepted for final plat or condominium approval unless water mains,
storm water sewers or drains have been dedicated to the public for that purpose and will be available
to the use of other lands in the City within the drainage district. Further, in the event the City
6-I Subdivision Regulations 1224.17
shall determine that the public health, safety and welfare require such drains to be tiled and covered, the
subdivider will agree to do so. Further, in the event the general plan of development of the City requires
that pipelines and facilities for storm water, public sanitary sewer or public water supply need to be larger
or deeper than the sizes and depth required to serve this subdivision alone, for future development of
other lands in the City, the subdivider will place such larger or deeper pipelines available for connection
to other lands of the City, provided that the City allows for payback to the developer in cash, or in a manner
to be agreed upon, for the additional cost of larger or deeper pipelines or facilities deemed necessary.
(Ord. 215. Passed 9-5-90.)
1224.16 BUILDING FINISH GRADE.
Any building requiring yard space shall be located at such an elevation that a sloping grade shall
be maintained to cause the flow of surface water to run away from the walls of the building. A sloping
grade, beginning at the sidewalk level, shall be maintained and established from the center of the front
lot line to the finished grade line at the front of the building, and also from the rear lot line to the front,
both grades sloping to the front property line. Where rear lot drainageways are required, an enclosed drain
and/or surface swale drain along the rear lot lines shall be provided with easements provided in
accordance with the City approval. However, this shall not prevent the grading of a yard space to provide
sunken or terraced areas, provided proper means are constructed and maintained to prevent the run-off
of surface water from flowing onto the adjacent properties. Grade elevations shall be determined by using
the elevation at the centerline of the road in front of the lot as the established grade or such grade
determined by the City Engineer or the Building and Zoning Administrator.
When a new building is constructed on a vacant lot between two existing buildings or adjacent to
an existing building, the existing established grade shall be used in determining the grade around the new
building and the yard around the new building and the yard shall be graded in such a manner as to meet
existing grades and not to permit run-off of surface water to flow onto the adjacent property.
(Ord. 215. Passed 9-5-90.)
1224.17 SITE IMPROVEMENTS.

circumstances, it is pertinent to the area being platted. Provision shall be made, either as a part of the
plat dedication or by other means satisfactory to the City, to assure that outlots intended for the future
expansion of the street system are reserved and restricted for that purpose, in satisfaction of Plat Act
requirements. Also, the arrangement of streets should provide for the continuation of existing streets from
adjoining areas into the new subdivision where desirable and required by the City. The minimum
1226.03 PLANNING AND ZONING CODE 10
outlot width for future streets shall be sixty feet.

right of way on the tangents.
(7) Reverse frontage lots shall be required in all plat development adjacent to the
following types of highways:
Statewide arterials
Local arterials
Major collectors
The concept of fronting on an internal road is encouraged for reasons of safety
and public convenience. Therefore, the best interest of the public welfare on the aforementioned
highways, plat and condominium design shall include the limited access principle so that private driveways
from platted lots or condominiums shall be served by marginal access streets, reverse frontages or similar
means as a condition of approval of the project. The streets requiring use of the back lot principle are:

1226.03 SUBMISSION OF STREET AND DRAINAGE PLAN.
(a) Generally. After approval of the preliminary plat layout, three sets of street and drainage plans,
covering all streets within the plat or condominium, shall be submitted to the City for approval. These
plans must show plan and profile, typical cross-sections and special details and shall be accompanied
by a plat layout on the title or first sheet. This implies a workmanlike execution of the street plans in
every respect. The plans and special details must be complete to the extent that they can be used as
construction plans and must bear the seal of a Registered Engineer licensed in the State. Suggested
cross-sections can be found in Section 1226.11.
Separate enlarged details showing unusual installations and situations must be included. These
details should include, but are not limited to, pipe arches, acceleration/deceleration lanes and widened
intersections or
Road and Utility Requirements and Specification for
11 Proposed Plats and Condominiums and Land Divisions 1226.04
other areas of construction which cannot be clearly shown and understood from the conventional plan
and profile.

the improvements.
(c) Drainage Plans; Information Required. The plans must show plainly at least all of the following
information:
(1) The location, size and depth of all underground structures used for street drainage
within the plat or condominium. The drainage plans may be incorporated as a part of the street plans
if this can be done without sacrificing clarity. A composite layout of the sewers and other drainage
structures must be shown on the overall street system submitted as a part of the plans. A schematic
drawing of this layout will suffice. Drainage plans should be approved by both the County Drain
Commissioner (if he or she shares jurisdiction in these facilities with the City) and the City. Road plans
should be approved by the County Road Commission (if it shares jurisdiction in the facilities with the City)
and the City. In case of differences in standards between these two organizations, the higher standard
shall prevail.
(2) Sizes, lengths and locations of all cross culverts and/or storm sewers existing or
proposed within the development limits and adjacent to the developed area which are to be used to drain
the area and adjoining lands;
(3) The location and type of inlets and clean-out points for underground drainage
systems; and

prohibited within zones numbered A1-30 on the FIRM, except where it is demonstrated to the Zoning
Administrator that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not harmfully increase the water surface elevation of a base
flood. In determining whether a harmful increase will occur, compliance with Act 245 of the Public Acts
of 1929, as amended by Act 167 of the Public Acts of 1968, as amended, shall be required, provided
that the allowable increase shall not exceed one foot. The provisions of this section shall not apply within
the regulatory floodway. The provisions of subsection (b) hereof shall be applied to land situated within
the regulatory floodway.
(b) All development occurring within the regulatory floodway shall comply with the following
standards:
1440.13 BUILDING AND HOUSING CODE 8H
(1) Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and
other development, shall be prohibited.
(2) The placement of premanufactured units shall be prohibited, except in mobile
home parks and subdivisions which exist at the time this chapter is adopted.
(3) Development or new construction, in the regulatory floodway, which may be
permitted under the variance provisions of this chapter, shall also meet the applicable requirements of
Sections 1440.05 through 1440.10.
(c) The uses of land permitted in an underlying zoning district shall not be construed as being
permitted within the regulatory floodway, except upon compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 220. Passed 2-13-91.)
1440.13 MAPPING DISPUTES.
(a) Where disputes arise as to the location of the flood hazard area boundary or the limits of the
floodway, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall resolve the dispute and establish the boundary. In all cases,
the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be based upon the most current flood plain studies issued
by the Federal Insurance Administration. Where Federal Insurance Administration information is not
available, the best available flood plain information shall be utilized.
(b) Where a dispute involves an allegation that the boundary is incorrect as mapped and Federal
Insurance Administration flood plain studies are being questioned, the Board of Appeals shall modify the
boundary of the flood hazard area or the floodway only upon receipt of an official letter of map amendment
issued by the Federal Insurance Administration.
(c) All parties to a map dispute may submit technical evidence to the Board of Appeals.
(Ord. 220. Passed 2-13-91.)
1440.14 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based upon engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on
rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris. Approval of the use of land under this chapter shall not be
considered a guarantee or warranty of safety from flood damage. This chapter does not imply that areas
outside the flood hazard area will be free from flood damage. This chapter does not create liability on
the part of the City of Grand Blanc or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

calculated by using the sum of the smallest rectangles which would enclose each individual
letter.
Where a sign has two or more faces, the area of all faces shall be included in determining
the total area of the sign, i.e., a two-faced sign with four by eight feet displayed on each face
would calculate to a total area of sixty-four square feet.

the width of the sign (low-profile signs convey their message at or below eye level and,
because of their proximity to the passerby, have a direct relationship to pedestrians and
vehicular traffic. Because of this, care must be taken in the placement of low-profile signs
to ensure that adequate sight distance will be provided to approaching motorists).

The Sign Review Committee shall review requests for variances for compliance with the following:
(a) Variances may be granted for any one of the following conditions:
(1) The applicant has demonstrated that a variance is needed due to a practical
difficulty on the site, such as varied topography, horizontal or vertical road curvature, or the presence of
structures or desired trees that limit visibility of a sign on the premises compared to similar sites with
conforming signs in the same zoning district;
(2) A variance is warranted due to the relatively large size of the site, frontage or
building in comparison to other establishments in the same zoning district; or
(3) A variance would significantly improve the conformity of an existing sign.
(b) To grant a variance for one of the conditions specified under subsection (a) hereof, all of the
following standards must be met:
(1) The inability to conform to the provisions of this chapter is due to a hardship
or practical difficulty that includes more than mere inconvenience or mere inability to attain a supposed
higher financial return;

the same rights as other establishments in the same zoning district, have a reasonable outlet for free
speech and meet the intent of this chapter; and

public.

allowable sign area by using the average parcel width which is parallel to the street upon which the
business faces.

business, the Building Department representative, upon request, may allow the applicant one additional
sign which shall be on the nearest major street, conditioned upon the applicant obtaining written permission

Chapter 1480 - SIGNS
1480.01. - Purpose and intent.
The intent of this article is to regulate signs, to minimize outdoor advertising, and to protect public
safety, health and welfare; minimize abundance and size of signs to reduce visual clutter, motorist
distraction, and loss of visibility; promote public convenience; preserve property values; and enhance the
aesthetic appearance and quality of life within the city. The requirements contained herein are intended to
be content neutral. The following objectives are accomplished by establishing the minimum amount of
regulations necessary concerning the size, placement, construction, illumination, and other aspects of signs
in the city in order to:
a. Protect the public right to receive messages and other types of information protected by the First
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
b. Maintain and improve the image of the city by encouraging signs of consistent size and rigid
materials which are compatible with and complementary to related buildings and uses, and
harmonious with their surroundings.
c. Recognize that the proliferation of signs is unduly distracting to motorists and non-motorized
travelers, reduces the effectiveness of signs directing and warning the public, causes confusion
reduces desired uniform traffic flow, and creates potential for accidents.
d. Recognize that the principal intent of commercial signs, to meet the purpose of these requirements
and serve the public interest, should be for identification of an establishment on the premises, and
not for advertising special events, brand names or off-premise activities, as these can be advertised
more appropriately by other methods.
e. Eliminate potential conflicts between business signs and traffic control signs, which could create
confusion and hazardous consequences.
f. Enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities without excessive difficulty and
confusion by restricting the number and placement of signs.
g. Prevent placement of signs which will conceal or obscure signs of adjacent uses.
h. Prevent off-premise signs from conflicting with other land uses.
i. Prevent signs that are potentially dangerous to the public due to structural deficiencies or
disrepair.
j. Limit portable commercial signs in recognition of their significant negative impact on traffic
safety and aesthetics.

1480.07 LEGAL NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
Page 10
a. Legal nonconforming signs shall comply with this chapter when a change in ownership, tenancy,

on the sign changes to denote a change in ownership, tenancy, business or organization.
b. Legal nonconforming signs which are removed, blown down, destroyed, relocated, damaged or
altered, or which are subject to a change of ownership, shall be required to conform with this
chapter.
c. Prohibited signs (Section 1480.04) shall be removed within six (6) months of the effective date of
this chapter (Ordinance 213, passed April 11, 1990) by the owner or lessee, or the Building
Department representative shall cause the removal of such signs and assess the owners and/or
lessees of such signs and/or the owners of the property on which such signs are located, the costs
of removal.
d. A tenant or land owner cannot apply for a new sign permit on a parcel with an existing
nonconforming sign without first correcting the existing nonconforming sign.
1480.08 PERMITS.
a. Required. No sign shall be erected, structurally altered or relocated, nor shall any sign which is
blown down, destroyed, damaged or removed be re-erected, without a permit issued by the
Building Department representative, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. Where
electrical permits are required, they shall be obtained at the same time as the sign permit.
b. Applications. The permit application shall contain the proposed location of the sign structure, the
name and address of the sign owner and of the sign erector, the name and address of the owner of
the business and of the property if different from that of the sign owner, drawings and/or sketches
showing the design and location of the sign, the estimated cost of construction and such other
pertinent information as the Building Department representative may require to ensure
compliance with this chapter and with other ordinances of the City.

meeting. Such resolution may, from time to time, be amended pursuant to the governing rules of
Council.
d. Nullification. A sign permit shall become null and void if the work for which the permit was
issued has not been completed within six months after the date of the permit.
e. Exceptions. The following operations shall not be considered as creating a sign and, therefore,
shall not require a sign permit:
1. Changeable message signs. The changing of the message on an approved changeable
sign, on a theater marquee and on similar approved signs which are specifically designed
for the use of replaceable copy; and
2. Maintenance. Painting, repainting, cleaning or other normal maintenance or repair of a

1480.09 COMPLIANCE WITH BUILDING CODE.
All signs shall comply with the pertinent requirements of the City's legally adopted Building Code, as
amended from time to time, except as modified in this chapter.
1480.10 INSPECTIONS; MAINTENANCE AND REMOVAL.
a. Inspections. Signs for which a permit is required may be inspected periodically by the Building
Department representative for compliance with this chapter and with other ordinances of the City.
Page 11
b. Maintenance. All signs and components thereof shall be kept in good repair and in safe, neat,
clean and attractive condition.
c. Removal. The Building Department representative may order the removal of any permanent sign
and its supporting structure erected or maintained in violation of this chapter. He or she shall give
thirty days' notice, in writing, to the owner of such sign, or of the building, structure or premises
on which such sign is located, to remove the sign and its supporting structure or bring it into
compliance. Any sign erected of a temporary nature shall require written notice of only three
days. Upon failure to comply with this notice, the Building Department representative may
remove the sign and its supporting structure. The Building Department representative may
remove a sign and its supporting structure immediately and without notice if, in his or her
opinion, the condition of the sign and its supporting structure is such as to present an immediate
threat to the safety of the public. The cost of such removal by the City shall be assessed against
the owner of such sign or the owner of the building, structure or premises.
d. Abandoned Signs. An abandoned sign and its supporting structure shall be removed by the
property owner or lessee of the premises upon which the sign is located. If the property owner or
lessee fails to remove it within sixty days of the date the business becomes inactive, the Building
Department representative may give the property owner thirty days' written notice to remove it.
Upon failure to comply with this notice, the Building Department representative may remove the
sign and its supporting structure at cost to the property owner. Where a successor to an inactive
business agrees, within thirty days of the date of written notice by the Building Department
representative to maintain the sign as provided in this Code, this removal requirement shall not
apply, provided that the existing sign and structure meets all current sign codes.
1480.11 EXCEPTIONS.
Businesses Without Street Frontage. If an applicant has no street frontage for his or her lot or parcel, the
Building Department representative, upon request, may allow the applicant one additional sign which
shall be on the nearest major street, conditioned upon the applicant obtaining written permission of the
owner of the property upon which the sign is to be erected prior to the presentation of the application. The
size of this sign may not exceed twelve square feet if projecting or forty square feet if ground/monument
or wall.
1480.12 ENFORCEMENT BY THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT.
The Building Department is hereby authorized and directed to enforce this chapter. Upon presentation of
proper credentials, the Building Department representative may enter, at reasonable times, any building,
structure or premises in the City to perform any duty imposed upon him or her by this chapter.
1480.13 INTERPRETATION.
Where there is any ambiguity or dispute concerning the interpretation of this chapter, the decision of the
Building Department representative shall prevail, subject to an appeal as provided in this chapter.
1480.14 APPEALS; DUTIES OF COUNCIL.
a. Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Building Department representative may
appeal to the Sign Review Committee by serving written notice, and by paying the fee for
appeals. The fee for appeals shall be as established from time to time by Council. A public
hearing shall then be conducted at the next available meeting of the Committee. The Building
Department representative shall take no further action on the matter pending the Committee's
decision, except in the case of an unsafe sign which presents an immediate and serious danger to
the public, as provided elsewhere in this chapter.
Page 12
b. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Committee may appeal to Council by serving written
notice to the Building Department and by paying the appeal fee established by resolution of
Council from time to time. The Building Department shall, in turn, immediately transmit the
notice to Council which shall meet to hear the appeal within thirty days thereafter. The Building
Department shall take no further action on the matter pending Council's decision, except in the
case of an unsafe sign which presents an immediate and serious danger to the public, as provided
elsewhere in this chapter.
c. Council shall hold public hearings on all appeals and shall permit all interested persons to offer
oral or written testimony. After the close of the hearing, Council, by a majority vote, is hereby
authorized to affirm, annul or modify the order or action of the Sign Review Committee.
d. The following criteria shall be used to evaluate such requests:
1. Variances may be granted for any one of the following conditions:
i. The applicant has demonstrated that a variance is needed due to a practical difficulty on the site,
such as varied topography, horizontal or vertical road curvature, or the presence of structures or
desired trees that limit visibility of a sign on the premises compared to similar sites with
conforming signs in the same zoning district;
ii. A variance is warranted due to the relatively large size of the site, frontage or building in
comparison to other establishments in the same district; or
iii. A variance would significantly improve the conformity of an existing sign.
2. Provided one of the conditions above is met, all of the following criteria must be met to grant a
variance:
i. The inability to conform to the provisions of this chapter is due to a practical difficulty that
includes more than mere inconvenience or mere inability to attain a supposed higher financial
return;
ii. The variance granted is the minimum necessary to allow the applicant to enjoy the same rights
as other establishments in the same zoning district, have a reasonable outlet for free speech and
meet the intent of this chapter; and
iii. The variance will not adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of the public.
1480.15 COSTS OF ENFORCEMENT.
Any costs or expenses incurred by the City in enforcing this chapter shall be paid by the owner of the sign
found to be in violation of this chapter, or, upon default thereof, by the owner of the property upon which
the sign is located, if different from the owner of the sign. Upon failure of the owner of the sign or the
owner of the property to reimburse the City for costs and expenses incurred in such enforcement, the
owner of the property shall be billed for such cost and expenses in the same manner as other taxes.
1480.99 PENALTY.
See Section 202.99 for general Code penalty.

O When you receive this Zoning Ordinance, write the date of receipt on the cover of first page.
Thereafter, refer to this date when asking the Building and Zoning Administrator about any Zoning
Ordinance amendments since that date (particularly to the zoning map).
HOW DO I DETERMINE THE CURRENT ZONING AND PLANNED USE OF MY
PROPERTY ?
Check the Zoning DistrictMap: Refer to the Adopted Zoning District Map. This map is available from
theBuilding and ZoningDepartment, for a nominal fee. The published zoningmap is periodically updated.
The Building and Zoning Department maintains the official current copy. You may want to verify the
zoning shown on the map with the Building and Zoning Administrator.
Check the City's Master Plan: The City of Grand Blanc has undertaken several studies to provide a
foundation for this Zoning Ordinance and to help guide zoning decisions. The Master Plan adopted in
1992, and last updated in 2007, also includes Grand Blanc Charter Township. The Master Plan is
periodically updated. The Master Plan presents information on environmental features, utilities,
transportation, community goals and a recommended future land use map. Recommendations from these
studies may affect your property. Generally, the City requires rezonings to be consistent with the future
land use map. Proposed developments should help to achieve the goals of the Master Plan, particularly
by designing developments sensitive to the area's natural resources.

WHAT USES ARE PERMITTED IN EACH ZONING DISTRICT ?
Belowis a list of each zoning district as illustrated on the Zoning DistrictMap. Refer to the corresponding
article for information on a specific district. Youmay also refer toArticle IV,which provides an overview
of the uses permitted by right and those requiring a Special Land Use permit in each district.
# Single Family Residential Districts (R-1 through R-3)
# Two-Family Residential District (R-T)
# Low Density Multiple Family Residential District (up to 6 units per acre)
# High Density Multiple Family Residential District (up to 12 units per acre)
# Manufactured Housing Park District
# Office Service District
# Neighborhood Business District (smaller commercial uses)
# Downtown Business District (overlay zone)
# Community Business District
# General Business District (higher intensity commercial uses)
# Light Industrial District
# General Industrial District
# Research Park District
# Vehicular Parking District (for parking lot expansions)
# Planned Unit Development District (mixture of uses, flexible design standards)
# Public Recreation District
Permitted uses are allowed if you meet the standards described in the district. These standards may
includeminimumlot size, setbacks, parking and landscaping. Inmost cases youwill be required to submit
a site plan for approval by the Planning Commission.
Special LandUses require special review by the Planning Commission and the City Council. Even if your
intended use is listed as a Special Land Use in the zoning district, the proposed use will only be approved
if it meets the general standards listed in Article XXI to ensure compatibility with the surrounding area
and ability to be served by existingmunicipal facilities, plus any special site or operational standards listed
in Section 2110. All Special Land Uses require a public hearing before the Planning Commission, and
preparation of a site plan and final approval by the City Council.
Reference Guide to Using this Zoning Ordinance iii
WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS IF MY INTENDED USE IS NOT LISTED AS A PRINCIPAL
USE PERMITTED OR SPECIAL LAND USE?
If your proposed use is not listed as either a permitted use or a Special Land Use on your property, you
have several options, including:
# Find an alternative use for your property which is permitted or find a site in the City or
surrounding township which is properly zoned for your intended use.
# Request the City rezone the property, which requires appearances before both the Planning
Commission and the City Council, with at least one public hearing. The Zoning Ordinance
provides criteria which the Planning Commission references in reviewing your rezoning
request (Article XXVIII). One criteria is that the rezoning be consistent with the future land
use map in the Grand Blanc Community Master Plan. Even if the long range future land use
map indicates your intended use, the City must also determine the appropriateness of the
timing for the zoning change.
# If your use is not listed anywhere in the ZoningOrdinance, you could request that the Planning
Commission consider your intended use based on the "determination of similar uses" as
explained in Section 309. Under this process, the Planning Commission determines the
appropriate district(s) for the intended use based on similarity to other uses listed. The Board
of Zoning Appeals has final authority if you disagree with the Planning Commission's
interpretation.
# Request the City add your proposed use, either as a Permitted Use or a Special Land Use to
the zoning district. Note:As a policy, the City of Grand Blanc does not consider use variances.
# The City of Grand Blanc has little vacant buildable land. In some instances, the Planning
Commission may determine there is no appropriate location in the City for your intended use.

WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP WHEN THE PROPER ZONING IS IN PLACE ?
Once proper zoning is in place there are several factors to consider during the early stages of project
planning. The list below highlights some of the more important features.
O Natural Features: The City strives to maximize preservation of existing mature woodlands with
quality species, particularly oak, hickory, beech, ash andmaples; or to preserve areas in their natural
state.
O Wetlands: The City does not have a local wetlands ordinance. However, the City tries to promote
compliance with theMichiganWetlands Protection Act and to encourage developers to protect all
wetlands, regardless of size. If your site contains possibleMDNRregulatedwetlands (usually those
over 5 acres), select a recognized wetland consultant to help determine the location. Issuance of a
Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy may be contingent on submittal of a MDNR wetland
permit.
O Topography: The City generally requires site development which complements existing
topography. The Ordinance requires a plan illustrating topography before and after development
at two foot contour intervals, with spot elevations in pavement areas.
O Driveways: The City's policy is to minimize the number of driveways. The location of driveways
in relation to other driveways and spacing from intersections is considered during site plan review.
Your survey should illustrate existing driveways and roads through and within 100 feet of the edge
of your property. Sharing of driveways or connecting sites through frontage roads or service drives
is encouraged.High traffic generating sites and larger scale projects should consider the relationship
of the site to existing and potential traffic signals.
O Traffic or Environmental Impact Studies: If your project is expected to generate a significant
amount of traffic or is located on a congested or accident prone street section, you may be required
to submit a traffic impact study prepared by a qualified engineer or planner. Certain types of
projects require an Impact Assessment as part of the site plan review package. The site plan review
section includes a point system used by the City to determine the need to prepare an environmental
assessment.
O Utilities: Information on water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer and franchised utilities is required.
O Residential and PUD Options: If there are significant natural features on your site or you want to
mix land uses, the Zoning Ordinance has several options. Residential projects can use the lot
averaging or open space subdivision option. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) option gives
you flexibility in designing your site, such asmixing certain uses or clustering buildings on themost
buildable part of a site. These standards can help preserve valuable natural features which lower
development costs, avoid MDNR permits and increase marketability.
Reference Guide to Using this Zoning Ordinance v
CHECKLIST FOR PREPARING A SITE PLAN
Meet with City Staff: Early, informalmeetings to discuss conceptual plans and submittal dates
may help to alert you to the need for additional information. You may also request an informal
meeting with the Planning Commission to present your preliminary concepts.
? Check the Site Plan Review Standards (Article XXIV):Most projects in the City, except
single family homes, require development of a site plan. The site plan review section
outlines the process, requirements and items to be illustrated on the site plan.
? Definitions (Article II): This chapter is a listing of all definitions used throughout the
Zoning Ordinance. This may be helpful in clarifying the use of a term.
? General Provisions (Article III): often overlooked standards on items such as:
? Standards for exterior lighting (height of fixtures, wattage, etc.)
? Requirements for dumpster location and screening
? Standards on accessory buildings
? Standards for fences and walls
? Standards for corner clearance and driveways
? Schedule of Regulations (Article XX): information on minimum lot size; frontage and
width;maximumbuilding coverage;minimumsetbacks for buildings and parking lots.All
of these requirements must be met and indicated on the site plan. Check the specific
zoning district to determine if a floor plan and building elevation is required.
? Parking Standards (Article XXII): standards for parking and loading/unloading - how
many spaces, dimensions (9'x18' w/ 24' wide aisles), curbing requirements, drainage,
location of loading docks, required area for truck turning radii, etc.
? Landscaping Standards (Article XXIII):
? Frontage landscaping using either a landscaped berm, a 10 foot wide buffer with
evergreen or a 10 foot wide greenbelt with 1 tree and 4 shrubs per 30 feet (the third
option is recommended in most cases).
? Standards for size, spacing and species. Deciduous trees must be 2.5 inch caliper,
ornamental trees of 2 inch caliper, evergreens of 5 feet high,most shrubsmust be 18-
24 inches high. Use of native Michigan species is encouraged.
? Buffering (wall, berm, trees)may be required between certain uses such as residential
and commercial.
? Interior landscaping must cover at least 5% of the site, with 1 tree per 400 square
feet and one shrub per each 250 square feet of required interior landscaping.
? Parking lot landscaping must cover at least 3% of the parking area. A mixture of
trees and shrubs is encouraged. Some parking lot islands should be provided in larger
parking lots to direct traffic near entrances and break up the expanse of pavement.
? Preservation of existing trees is encouraged - credit is given for trees that are saved.
? Irrigation may be required in some cases.
? Driveways: One of the criteria for site plan approval is that the number of driveways be
minimal and spacing from intersections and other driveways (on both sides of the street)
be as far apart as practical. The City may require a traffic impact study to justify more
than one driveway. Shared access is encouraged.
? Sidewalks: Locations, dimensions and profile grades of sidewalks and paths should be
illustrated.
Reference Guide to Using this Zoning Ordinance vi
? Signs: The location of signs should be indicated on the site plan. The number, type,
locations and size of signs must meet the standards of the Sign Ordinance (a separate
Ordinance from the Zoning Ordinance).
? Other codes and ordinances: In addition to the ZoningOrdinance, your projectmay need
to meet the standards of other codes and ordinances such as the Building Code, the Fire
Prevention Code, the Floodplain Ordinance (Ordinance 220) and others - check with the
Building and Zoning Administrator.
? Non-conforming Uses and Structures: If your use, structure or site is non-conforming
refer to Article XXVI for the limits on what you can do.
If you cannot meet a requirement, you may request a variance from the Board of Zoning
Appeals. You must be able to prove your situation is unique and not self-created.
WHAT IS THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR MY PROJECT ?
Determinewhich approvals areneeded: Thismay include land division/combination, rezoning, site plan,
Special Land Use, variance, subdivision, etc.
Application forms: Obtain copies of the application forms at City Hall.
Key submission dates: Check with City staff to determine key cut-off dates for being placed on an
upcoming meeting agenda.
Submittal: Submit all requiredmaterial, application formand fee to theBuilding and ZoningDepartment.
Most submittals are required to be submitted several days before the meeting at which they will be
discussed. This time period is used by the Planning Commission, City Council, Zoning Board of Appeals
and staff to review your proposal. In some cases, such as Special Land Uses and rezonings, a longer time
is needed to set a public hearing and meet notification requirements.
Approval process:
! Site plans for permitted uses - Planning Commission
! Site plans for Special Land Uses - Planning Commission provides a recommendation to City
Council.
! Site plans for certain minor expansions, etc. - may be approved by the Building and Zoning
Administrator
! Rezonings and Ordinance Amendments - Planning Commission provides a recommendation to the
City Council. You should plan on attending the meeting where your proposal will be discussed, or
have someone represent you to respond to questions.

ARTICLE III
GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 300 INTRODUCTION
The standards and regulations listed in this Article shall apply to all uses, buildings and structures within
all zoning districts unless otherwise specifically addressed.
SECTION 301 WITHHOLDING OF APPROVAL
The Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals or City Council may withhold granting of approval
of any use, Special Land Use, site plan, Planned Unit Development Plan, variance or other approval
required by this Ordinance pending approvals which may be required by State, County or Federal
agencies or departments.
SECTION 302 VOTING PLACE
The provisions of this Chapter shall not be construed as to interfere with the temporary use of any
property as a voting place in connection with a City, school or other public election.
SECTION 303 LOT AREA
Any lot existing and of record on the effective date of this Ordinance may be used for any principal use
permitted other than Special Land Uses for which special lot area requirements are specified in this
Ordinance, permitted in the district in which such lot is located whether or not such lot complies with the
lot area and width requirements of this Ordinance. Such use may be made provided that all requirements
other than lot area and width prescribed in this Ordinance are complied with, and provided that not more
than one (1) dwelling unit shall occupy any lot except in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance
for required lot area for each dwelling unit.
SECTION 304 PRINCIPAL BUILDING, STRUCTURE OR USE
No lot may contain more than one (1) principal building, structure or use except: groups of multiple family
dwellings under the same ownership, condominium developments, manufactured housing parks, unified

SECTION 305 SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING DESIGN STANDARDS (amended 7/9/03)
a. Intent: This section is intended to establish regulations for the construction of new single family
dwellings, whether mobile homes, manufactured homes, modular homes or site (stick) built
homes, located outside a mobile home park in addition to HUD standards or the City Building Code,
as appropriate. The standards herein are intended to prevent grossly dissimilar dwellings which
would adversely affect the value of dwellings in the surrounding area, adversely affect the
desirability of an area to existing or prospective homeowners, impair the stability of the
environment, prevent the most appropriate use of real estate and lessen the opportunity to realize
the development pattern envisioned in the Grand Blanc Community Master Plan.
These regulations are based on the finding that the cohesiveness and character of the Citys
neighborhoods are significant factors in the Citys quality of life, contribute to the distinct character
in the various neighborhoods and help retain property values. These regulations further ensure new
housing units are harmonious with the general character of the adjacent houses and the City
overall and ensure a stable housing stock. While some level of diversity is acceptable, these
regulations are intended to ensure the design variation of new homes is similar to the level of
variation in existing homes in the immediate area, or surrounding neighborhoods with similar
densities for new residential projects. The standards shall not be construed to prohibit innovative
design concepts involving such matters as solar energy, view, unique land contour, or relief from
the common or standard designed home.

to required building codes, to ensure the resulting home continues to maintain the character of the
neighborhood. The standards shall not apply to minor home expansions, interior remodeling, or to
residences outside of the single family zoning districts.

In recognition that every potential use cannot be addressed in this Zoning Ordinance, each
district includes the phrase "Uses of the same nature or class as uses listed in this district as
either a Principal Use Permitted or a Special Land Use, but not listed elsewhere in this Zoning
Ordinance, as determined by the Planning Commission based on the standards of Section 309"
at the end of the list of Special Land Uses. The Planning Commission shall make a
determination of "Uses of the same nature and class..." according to the following:
a. A finding the proposed use is not listed as a Principal Use permitted or Special Land
Use in any zoning district.
b. If the use is not addressed in the Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Commission shall
select the use listed in the Zoning Ordinance which most closely resembles the
proposed use using criteria such as potential impact on property values, traffic
generated, aesthetics, noise, vibration, dust, smoke, odor, glare and other objectionable
impacts terms of health, safety and welfare in the City. The Planning Commission may
determine that there is no similar use and that the use should be prohibited (see
Section 310).
c. Once a similar use is determined, the proposed use shall comply with any special
conditions or Special Land Use Standard that apply to the similar use.
d. The Planning Commission or applicant shall have the option to request that the City
Council consider an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance to specifically address the
use in question, rather than treating the proposed use as a similar use.

Principal use permitted or Special Land Uses within a district should be considered as
an expansion of the use regulations, not a variance applying to a particular situation.
Any use determined by the Planning Commission to be a "use of the same nature or
class as uses listed" shall thereafter be included in the enumeration of the uses.
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article III: General Provisions 3 - 6
The Planning Commission determination of a "Similar Use" may be appealed to the Board
of Zoning Appeals.
SECTION 310 PROHIBITED USES
Basis: Certain uses may not be appropriate within the City of Grand Blanc given the existing
development pattern, environmental condition and overall character of the community. In
accordance with the City or Village Zoning Act, a Zoning Ordinance or zoning decision can
totally prohibit the establishment of a requested land use within a City if there is not an
appropriate location within the community or the use is unlawful, even if there is a
demonstrated need for that land use either in the City or surrounding area. In determining
there is no appropriate location for the requested use within the City, the Planning
Commission shall consider the following:
a. The land area required by the proposed use.
b. Existing environmental conditions and potential environmental hazards.
c. The potential impact on surrounding properties in terms of traffic, noise, lighting,
property valuation and views.
d. Demand and capacity of utilities and municipal services to support the proposed use.
(amended 2/14/96)

such conflict, the Zoning Ordinance shall prevail. Appeal from the application of this
Ordinance in regard to any essential service may be made to the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
b. Public and On-Site Utilities: Prior to issuance of a building permit under the terms of this
Ordinance, the applicant shall obtain engineering approval from the City.

waive the caliper standard for select clearing of lower quality species including box
elders, elms, poplars, willows and cottonwoods.
SECTION 319 NATURAL FEATURES PRESERVATION: WETLANDS
The City of Grand Blanc intends to promote compliance with the Goemaere-Anderson Wetland
Protection Act 203 of 1979, as amended. The City encourages placement of buildings to protect
Michigan Department of Natural Resources regulated wetlands and non-regulated wetlands
between two acres and five acres in size. The City intends to ensure important wetlands are
preserved, to prevent the mistaken elimination of regulated wetlands and to promote the goals of
the Grand Blanc Community Master Plan.
a. Any disturbance of soils, removal of landmark trees or stumps, grading, alteration of
water flowing into or from an MDNR regulated wetland, or any prohibited activity as listed
in Section 5 of Public Act 203 of 1979, without a permit from the MDNR, may result in a
stop work order issued by the City and/or require restoration of the wetland in
accordance with MDNR standards.
b. Judicious effort shall be made through site plan design to preserve non-MDNR regulated
wetlands which exceed two (2) acres in size, particularly those with standing water or
considered to be important wildlife habitat.
c. Where stormwater is planned to drain into a wetland, a filtration strip or other
material shall be used to control runoff of sediment and the wetland.
Maintenance of these material shall be addressed in a deed or as a condition of
site plan approval.
d. Land shall not be subdivided in a manner creating parcels or lots which cannot be used
in conformance with the requirements of this Section or the MDNR regulations.
SECTION 320 NATURAL FEATURES PRESERVATION: GRADING, REMOVAL AND FILLING
OF LAND
Any grading which changes site elevation by more than three (3) feet, or the use of land for the
excavation, removal, filling or depositing of any type of earth material, topsoil, gravel, rock,
garbage, rubbish or other wastes or by-products, is not permitted in any zoning district except
under a certificate from, and under the supervision of the Building and Zoning Administrator in
accordance with a topographic plan, approved by the Building and Zoning Administrator,
submitted at a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals fifty (50) feet and shall show existing
and proposed grades and topographic features and such other data as may from time to time be
required by the Building and Zoning Administrator. Such certificate may be issued in appropriate
cases upon the filing with the application of a Performance or Surety Bond in an amount as
established by the Building and Zoning Administrator sufficient to rehabilitate the property upon
default of the operator or such other reasonable expenses. The form of the bond shall be
approved by the City Attorney. This regulation does not apply to normal soil removal for
basement or foundation work when a building permit has previously been duly issued by the
Building Department.
SECTION 321 MINIMUM FRONTAGE ON PUBLIC STREET
No lot shall be used for any purpose permitted by this Ordinance unless said lot has at least sixty
(60) feet abutting a public street or otherwise provided in this Ordinance. This shall not preclude
use of existing lots of record which have a frontage of less than sixty (60) feet unless
nonconforming lots are contiguous and under the same ownership in which case the lots shall be
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article III: General Provisions 3 - 15
combined. The intent of this Section is to ensure no new lots with less than sixty (60) feet of
frontage are created and that conformance be required where reasonable.
SECTION 322 CALCULATION OF (BUILDABLE) LOT AREA
In the calculation of areas required to maintain specific densities, open space requirements and
similar needs, no lot or parcel or portion of same shall be used more than once in such
calculation, nor shall adjacent outlots or other open space be used in lieu of space contained
within the stated boundaries of the subject lot or parcel. In calculating density for residential
developments, fifty percent (50%) of state or federally regulated wetlands area shall be included
in computing gross density (e.g. 100 acres of wetland equals fifty (50) acres for computing
maximum density). Lakes, ponds, overhead utility easements, public street right-of-ways and
private road easements are excluded from area calculations for buildable lot area.
SECTION 323 EXTERIOR LIGHTING
a. Shielding: Only non-glare, color corrected lighting shall be permitted. All outdoor lighting
shall be shielded to reduce glare and shall be arranged to reflect light away from all
adjacent residential districts. The lighting source shall not be visible from adjoining
properties.
b. Intensity: In parking lots, lighting shall average one (1) foot candle measured at the
surface. No lighting may extend beyond the property line. A lower intensity may be
required by the Planning Commission where the adjacent zoning district is residential.
The Building and Zoning Administrator may require a photometric plan (lighting grid) to
determine the appropriateness of proposed lighting layout and intensity.
c. Height of fixtures: The maximum height of light fixtures in parking lots shall be thirty (30)
feet, measured from the parking lot surface to the centerline of the lighting source. The
Planning Commission may modify that height standard in commercial and industrial
districts based on consideration of the type of fixture, the height of surrounding buildings,
existence of landscaping, the potential off-site impacts and the general character of the
surrounding uses. In no case shall the height of the lighting fixture exceed the maximum
height permitted for principal buildings in the zoning district.
d. Fixtures: Cut-off shoe box type fixtures shall be required in any parking lot adjacent to a
residential district. Lighting fixtures shall be mounted on milled steel or planed wooden
poles. Lighting fixtures shall not be attached to utility poles.
e. Building illumination: All lighting in non-residential districts or for non-residential uses
used for the external illumination shall be placed and shielded to prevent interference
with the vision of motorists or nearby residents.
f. Plan requirements: Parking lot and building lighting illumination shall be
illustrated and described on the site plan, including details showing the type of
fixture, height of poles and any proposed illumination of buildings, signs or
landscaping. Illumination of signs or buildings shall be directed to prevent
interference with motorists.
g. Wiring: No wiring shall be exposed.
h. Restrictions: All illumination of signs and any outdoor feature shall not be of a
flashing, moving or intermittent type. Illumination of any outdoor feature shall be
directed or shaded to not interfere with vision of motorists or to adjacent
property. Artificial light shall be maintained stationery and constant in intensity
and color.
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article III: General Provisions 3 - 16
SECTION 324 ENTRANCE FEATURES
In all districts, so called entranceway structures including but not limited to: walls, columns, and
gates marking entrances to single-family subdivisions or multiple housing projects, office
complexes, shopping centers and industrial parks may be permitted and may be located in a
required yard, but not within a public street right-of-way, provided such entranceway structures
do not conflict with required sight distance (see Section 330).
SECTION 325 BUILDING GRADES
a. Any building requiring yard space shall be located at such an elevation that a sloping
grade shall be maintained to cause the flow of water to run away from the walls of the
structures thereon. The balance of yard spaces shall be graded and adequate drainage
provided where necessary to deflect proper drainage of surface waters from the said
premises.
b. When a new building is constructed on a vacant lot between two existing buildings or
adjacent to an existing building, the existing established grade shall be used in
determining the grade around the new building and the yard around the new building
shall be graded in such a manner as to meet existing grades.
c. The final grade shall be approved by the Building and Zoning Administrator.
SECTION 326 EXCAVATION OR HOLES
The construction, maintenance or existence within the City of any unprotected, unbarricaded,
open or dangerous excavations, holes, pits or wells, or any excavations, holes or pits which
constitute or are reasonably likely to constitute a danger or menace to public health, safety or
welfare, is hereby prohibited; provided; however, this section shall not prevent any excavation
under a permit issued pursuant to this Ordinance or the City Building Code. Where such
excavations are properly protected and warning signs posted in such a manner as may be
required by the Building and Zoning Administrator.
SECTION 327 BUILDINGS TO BE MOVED
Any building or structure which has been wholly or partially erected on any premises within or
outside the City of Grand Blanc shall not be moved to and/or placed upon any premises in the
City unless a building permit for such a building or structure shall have been secured. Any such
building or structure shall fully conform to all the provisions of this Ordinance in the same manner
as a new building or structure.
SECTION 328 REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPACT ASSESSMENT (see Section 2407)
For certain land uses that are considered to have a significant potential impact on traffic,
infrastructure, demands for public services and/or significant impacts on surrounding properties
due to scale, the applicant shall be required to provide an impact assessment during the initial
submittal for either a rezoning or site plan approval. The cost of the impact assessment and
review by the City shall be borne by the applicant. The applicant may request a meeting with City
staff, consultants and key agency staff prior to developing the Impact Assessment.
The minimum contents of this impact assessment shall be:
a. Name(s) and address(es) of person(s) or firm(s) responsible for preparation of the
impact assessment and a brief statement of their qualifications.

submitted, as appropriate.
l. Traffic impacts: A traffic study in accordance with Section 329 below shall be included in
the Impact Assessment unless determined to not be necessary by the Building and
Zoning Administrator, because the use will generate less than five hundred (500) oneway
vehicle trips daily or less than fifty (50) peak hour directional trips.
SECTION 329 MINIMUM CONTENTS OF TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article III: General Provisions 3 - 18
Where a traffic impact study is required or requested by the Planning Commission or City
Council, including when a component in an overall Impact Study, the applicant shall bear the
cost for preparation and evaluation of a study prepared by a traffic engineer with experience
preparing traffic impact studies in Michigan during the preceding three (3) years to address the
following:
a. Existing conditions including existing daily and peak hour traffic on adjacent street(s), a
description of any sight distance limitations along the site's right-of-way frontage and
accident histories within five hundred (500) feet of the site and for any intersection which
will experience a traffic volume increase of at least five percent (5%) during the day or
during a peak hour due to the proposed project.
Where existing traffic counts are more than two (2) years old, new counts should be
taken. Traffic counts shall be taken on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday of nonholiday
weeks. Additional counts (i.e. on a Saturday for a proposed commercial
development) may also be required in some cases. The following times/situations
should also be avoided where possible so that the traffic count data would represent a
typical day: construction detours in the area, summer days for a site near a school, etc.
The firm performing the impact study must make every effort to complete traffic counts
during average or higher than average volume conditions (i.e. regarding weather or
seasonal variations) for the area under study.
b. Forecasted trip generation of the proposed use for the a.m. and p.m. peak hour and
average daily traffic generated. The forecasts shall be based on the data and procedures
outlined in the most recent edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers Trip Generation
Manual. The applicant may use other commonly accepted sources of data or
supplement the standard data with data from similar projects in Michigan.
c. For requests for a zoning change when such request represents a departure from the
land use proposed in the City Master Plan, the study should contrast the traffic impacts
of typical uses permitted in the requested zoning district with uses permitted in the
current zoning district. The Planning Commission shall determine typical uses to be
considered.
d. Projected traffic generated shall be distributed (inbound v. outbound, left turn v. right
turn) onto the existing street network to project turning movements at major site access
points and nearby intersections or expressway interchange ramps. Rationale for the
distribution shall be provided. If any streets are proposed for realignment or vacation, the
study shall forecast the changes in traffic conditions along affected streets.
e. Capacity analysis at the proposed access points along public streets using the
procedures outlined in the most recent edition of the Highway Capacity Manual published
by the Transportation Research Board. Pre- and post- construction capacity analyses
shall also be performed at all street intersections or expressway ramps where the
expected traffic will comprise at least five percent (5%) of the existing intersection
capacity and/or for roadway sections and intersections experiencing congestion or a
relatively high accident rate, as determined by the City. (amended 2/14/96)
f. The City may require a "gap study" to analyze the frequency and duration of gaps in the
flow of through traffic to accommodate turning movements.
g. Analysis of any mitigation measures warranted by the anticipated traffic impacts. Where
appropriate, documentation shall be provided from the appropriate road agency
regarding time schedule for improvements and method of funding.
h. A map and description of the location and design of proposed access (driveway or new
street intersection), including any sight distance limitations, dimensions from adjacent
driveways and intersections within two hundred fifty (250) feet, other data to demonstrate
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article III: General Provisions 3 - 19
that the design and number of driveways proposed is the fewest necessary, and the
driveway(s) will provide safe and efficient traffic operation and be in accordance with the
standards of this ordinance.
i. An analysis of the potential need for bypass lanes or deceleration tapers/lanes, including
attachment of any correspondence by the Genesee County Road Commission or the
Michigan Department of Transportation, as appropriate.
j. Resume and qualification of the preparer.
SECTION 330 CLEAR VISION ZONE
There shall be a clear vision zone at all corners of intersecting streets and/or private roads,
consisting of a triangular area defined by the point of intersection of the right-of-way lines and
the two points extended along such lines a distance of twenty-five (25) feet from the point of
intersection, and within which area no obstruction to vision, excluding existing topography, shall
be permitted from a height of two (2) feet to eight (8) feet above centerline elevation of abutting
streets, except not more than two (2) trees with trunks of not more than thirty (30) inches in
diameter each, and clear of any branches for such heights may be located within such area. A
greater clear vision area may be reviewed where necessary in view of anticipated traffic
volumes, traffic speeds, geographic or topographic conditions or based on a traffic engineering
analysis using the standards of the American Association of State and Highway Transportation
Officials (AASHTO).
SECTION 331 ACCESS THROUGH YARDS
For the purpose of this Ordinance, access drives may be placed in the required front or side
yards so as to provide access to rear yards or accessory or attached structures. These drives
shall not be considered as structural violations in front and side yards. Further, any walk, terrace
or other pavement servicing a like function, and not in excess of nine (9) inches above the grade
upon which placed, shall for the purpose of this Ordinance not be considered to be a structure,
and shall be permitted in any required yard.
SECTION 332 TEMPORARY USES AND SEASONAL OR SPECIAL EVENTS SALES (amended
2/14/96)
Temporary uses, temporary sales and seasonal or special events may be allowed in any
nonresidential district upon issuance of a permit, when providing the following submittal
information and meeting the standards of this Section.

proposed sales/activity areas, any proposed lighting, calculation of required
parking based on the standards of Article XXII, layout and materials for parking
areas, proposed traffic circulation, location of fire hydrants, location and size of
any proposed signs, and any other information deemed to be necessary by the
Building and Zoning Administrator.
6. The proprietor of the temporary use or seasonal event shall deposit a
performance guarantee or escrow, in an amount and form acceptable to the
Building and Zoning Administrator, prior to the issuance of a permit. The
performance guarantee shall be used by the City to pay the cost of returning the
property to its state prior to commencement of the event or refunded to the
proprietor upon compliance with the requirements of this and any other
applicable ordinances.
b. Standards and Procedures for Review: The review of proposed temporary uses,
temporary sales and seasonal events shall be by the Building and Zoning Administrator.
The proposed use or event shall not be approved unless all of the following standards
are met:
1. All required information has been submitted.
2. The proposed temporary use or event will be on a lot with a permitted principal
building or, if on a vacant lot, meets the minimum required setback for buildings

SECTION 333 MAINTENANCE OF COMMONLY OWNED PRIVATE FACILITIES
The Planning Commission or City Council, as appropriate, may require documents suitable to
the City Attorney to insure the quality, construction, maintenance and replacement of commonly
owned private facilities and land whether improved or unimproved. These facilities may include,
but are not limited to detention ponds, retention basins, lighting, open space, wetlands, signs,
landscaping, fences, screen walls, drains, trails and sidewalks to which more than two owners of
lots or condominiums have rights of use or access or enjoyment; or which are owned in common
by an association of owners. Prior to approving such commonly owned private facilities, the
Planning Commission or City Council shall approve legal documents which assure the continuing
maintenance, and periodic replacement of any commonly-owned private facilities.
SECTION 334 REVIEW, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF WIRELESS
COMMUNICATION FACILITIES (amended June 10, 1998)
The regulations of this Section are intended to conform with federal laws and administrative rules
that authorize and govern facilities needed to operate wireless communication systems, but to
reasonably regulate the location and design of such facilities to retain the integrity of neighborhoods
and the character, property values and aesthetic quality of the city. Given the dramatic increase in
the number of wireless communication facilities requested as a result of the new technology and the
Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the policy of the city that all users should co-locate on
Attached Wireless Communication Facilities and Wireless Communication Support Structures in the
interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section. In addition, in recognition of the citys
concern that technological advances may render such visually obtrusive towers unnecessary in the
future, there are requirements to remove unused or unnecessary facilities in a timely manner.
a. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation of this Section:
1. Wireless Communication Facilities. All structures and accessory facilities relating
to the use of the radio frequency spectrum for the purpose of transmitting or receiving
radio signals. This may include, but shall not be limited to, radio towers, television
towers, telephone devices and exchanges, microwave relay towers, telephone
transmission equipment building and commercial mobile radio service facilities. This
definition does not include reception antenna for an individual lot as otherwise
defined and regulated in this zoning ordinance, or governmental facilities subject to
state or federal law or regulations which preempt municipal regulatory authority.
2. Attached Wireless Communication Facilities. Wireless communication facilities
affixed to existing structures, such as existing buildings, towers, water tanks, or utility
poles.
3. Wireless Communication Support Structures. Structures erected or modified to
support wireless communication antennas. Support structures within this definition
include, but shall not be limited to, monopoles, lattice towers, light poles, wood poles
and guyed towers, or other structures which appear to be something other than a
mere support structure.
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article III: General Provisions 3 - 22
4. Colocation. Location by two (2) or more wireless communication providers of
wireless communication facilities on a common structure, tower, or building, to reduce
the overall number of structures required to support wireless communication
antennas within the city.

communication by the applicant, including additional height to accommodate future colocation
where appropriate.
10. Minimum required setbacks for new facility or support structure.
(a) From any residential district - the height of the structure, provided the
engineering information required in c, 1 is provided. The person or body with
authority to approve the facility may decrease this setback to that provided in (c)
below upon a finding that no residential use exists or is expected on the adjacent
site.
(b) From any existing or proposed rights-of-way or other publicly traveled roads or
non-motorized improved pathways - half the height of the structure, plus ten (10)
feet, provided the engineering information required in c, 1 is provided; otherwise
the setback shall be the height of the facility.
(c) From non-residential district - one half the height of the structure, provided the
engineering information required in c, 3 above demonstrates such setback is
adequate.
11. Accessory buildings shall be a maximum of fourteen (14) feet high and shall be setback in
accordance with the requirements for principal buildings in that zoning district.
12. There shall be unobstructed access to the support structure, for operation, maintenance,
repair and inspection purposes, which may be provided through or over an easement. This
access shall have a width and location determined by such factors as: the location of
adjacent thoroughfares and traffic and circulation within the site; utilities needed to service
the tower and any attendant facilities; the location of buildings and parking facilities;
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article III: General Provisions 3 - 25
proximity to residential districts and minimizing disturbance to the natural landscape; and
the type of equipment which will need to access the site.
13. Where an attached wireless communication facility is proposed on the roof of a building if
the equipment enclosure is proposed as a roof appliance or penthouse on the building, it
shall be designed, constructed and maintained to be architecturally compatible with the
principal building. The equipment enclosure may be located within the principal building or
may be an accessory building. If proposed as an accessory building, it shall conform with
all district requirements for principal buildings, including yard setbacks.
14. The support system shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable building codes
and shall include the submission of a soils report from a geotechnical engineer, licensed in
the State of Michigan. This soils report shall include soil borings and statements
confirming the suitability of soil conditions for the proposed use. The requirements of the
Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Communication Commission, and Michigan
Aeronautics Commission shall be noted.
15. A maintenance plan, and any applicable maintenance agreement, shall be presented and
approved as part of the site plan for the proposed facility. Such plan shall be designed to
ensure the long term, continuous maintenance to a reasonably prudent standard.
e. Removal. As a condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility, adequate
provision shall be made for removal of all or part of the facility by users and owners upon the
occurrence of one or more of the following events:
1. When the facility has not been used for one hundred eighty (180) days or more. For
purposes of this section, the removal of antennas or other equipment from the facility, or
the cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of radio signals) shall be
considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse.
1. Six (6) months after new technology is available at reasonable cost, as determined by the
legislative body of the community, which permits the operation of the communication
system without the requirement of the support structure.
2. The situations in which removal of a facility is required, as set forth in paragraph (1) above,
may be applied and limited to portions of a facility.
3. Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal, specified in
paragraph (1) above, the property owner or persons who had used the facility shall
immediately apply or secure the application for any required demolition or removal
permits, and immediately proceed with and complete the demolition/removal, restoring the
premises to an acceptable condition as reasonably determined by the Building and Zoning
Administrator.
4. If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has not been lawfully completed
within sixty (60) days of the applicable deadline, and after at least thirty (30) days written
notice, the City may remove or secure the removal of the facility or required portions
thereof, with its actual cost and reasonable administrative charge to be drawn or collected
and/or enforced from or under the security posted at the time application was made for
establishing the facility.
f. Nonconforming facilities and penalties for not permitting co-location. If a party who owns
or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to alter a structure to
accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible co-location, such facility shall thereupon and
thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be altered,
expanded or extended in any respect. In addition, if a party refuses to allow co-location in
accordance with the intent of this Section, and this action results in construction of a new tower,
the city may refuse to approve a new wireless communication support structure from that party
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article III: General Provisions 3 - 26
for a period of up to five (5) years. Such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the
Zoning Board of Appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to
variance relief which, in this context, shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five
(5) year prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent
wireless communication services, or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting
the provision of personal wireless communication services.
g. Variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals may consider a variance for the standards of this
Section, based upon a finding that one or more of the following factors exist:
1. The applicant has demonstrated that a location within a district in accordance with the
standards of this Section can not reasonably meet the coverage or capacity needs of the
applicant.
2. The applicant has demonstrated that a feasible co-location is not available for the
coverage area and capacity needs because existing structures can not support the facility,
that co-location would result in unreasonable interference, or that reasonable financial
terms are not available for co-location.
3. The height requested is due to signal interference due to topography, tall buildings,
masses of trees, or other obstructions, or would reduce the number of towers to the
benefit of the city.
4. The applicant has proposed means to mitigate any negative impacts through provision for
future co-location, if found to be appropriate by the city, and special site design elements.
5. The wireless communication and accessory facilities shall be designed to be compatible
with the existing character of the proposed site, neighborhood and general area such as a
steeple, bell tower, or similar form.

ARTICLE VII
MH MOBILE HOME PARK DISTRICTS
SECTION 700 INTENT
The MH Mobile Home Park Districts are intended to provide sites for Mobile Home Parks which are
characterized by a relatively high density, transient structureswhich are replaced periodically and dwelling
units which are permitted by State law to exist without conforming to local codes and ordinances
applicable to all other dwelling units. Because the Mobile Home Park further possesses site
characteristics similar to multiple-family residential development and because they typically develop with
private streets and utility systems, thereby creating an interruption in the continuity of the local streets and
utility systems, they are not compatible when located in an otherwise single-family area. Therefore, in
this Ordinance, Mobile Home Parks are intended to be located so as to provide a transition of use
between extensive nonresidential districts, i.e. I-1 Light Industrial and I-2 General Industrial and Multiple-
Family Residential Districts.
SECTION 701 PRINCIPAL USES PERMITTED USES
In an MH Mobile Home Park District, no building, structure or land shall be used or erected, and no

Residential Districts. (amended 2/14/96)
SECTION 702 MOBILE HOME PARK REQUIRED CONDITIONS STANDARDS
a. Mobile Home Parks shall be subject to the review and approval of the site plan in accordance with
Article XXIV. Such review of the site plan is required in order to minimize the possibility of adverse
effects upon adjacent property; and furthermore, to find proper relationships in the development
features as they relate to traffic safety, service roads, driveways, parking areas, accessory buildings
and uses, and open space.
b. The mobile home park shall be developed with sites averaging 5,500 square feet per mobile home
unit. This 5,500 square feet for any one site may be reduced by twenty (20%) percent provided
that the individual site shall be equal to at least 4,400 square feet. For each square foot of land
gained through the reduction of a site below 5,500 square feet, at least an equal amount of land
shall be dedicated as open space, but in no case shall the open and distance requirements be less
than that required by the Mobile Home Commission.
c. Each mobile home site shall have a front yard setback of twenty (20) feet.
Each mobile home shall be in compliance with the following minimum distances:
1. Twenty (20) feet from any part of attached structure of another mobile home which is used
for living purposes.
2. Ten (10) feet from an on-site parking space of an adjacent mobile home site.
3. Ten (10) feet from an attached or detached structure or accessory of an adjacent mobile
home which is not used for living purposes.

closer than twenty (20) feet from the property boundary line of the mobile home parks or
mobile home condominiums.
2. If mobile homes, permanent buildings and facilities, and other structures abut a public rightof-
way, they shall not be located closer than fifty (50) feet from the boundary line, except that
if the boundary line runs through the center of the public road, the fifty (50) feet shall be
measured from the road right-of-way line.
f. Service drive requirements:
1. The service drives shall be hard surfaced.
2. The service drive shall have access to a public thoroughfare or shall be connected to a public
thoroughfare by a permanent easement which shall be recorded prior to approval by the
State. Sole access by an alley is prohibited.
3. A dead-end road shall terminate with an adequate turning area. A blunt-end road is
prohibited.
4. An adequate safe-sight distance shall be provided at intersections.
5. An offset at an intersection or an intersection of more than two (2) streets is prohibited.
6. All roads shall be clearly marked with appropriate traffic signs, subject to the provisions of

compliance with the standards of the American Association of State Highway and
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article VII: MH Mobile Home Park Districts 7 - 3
Transportation Officials, adopted herein by reference. The park developer may use other
suitable materials of equal quality, if approved by the Mobile Home Commission.

CBD CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (Amended 7/2013)
SECTION 1000 INTENT
The intent of the Central Business District (CBD) is to retain and create a vibrant, attractive and cohesive
center for the Grand Blanc community with a variety of quality places to work, live shop, learn, recreate and be
entertained. This district is intended to recognize and support the Grand Blanc central business district as
both the prime retail center in the city and the centerpiece of the greater Grand Blanc community.
These special regulations are intended to assist with the implementation of goals and objectives contained in
the Grand Blanc Downtown Strategic Vision Plan. Among those goals are to eliminate single use zoning and
promote development of a compact, walkable, mixed-use district, consisting of a variety of retail,
entertainment, office, service, residential, cultural, recreation and municipal uses. To provide for the desired
traditional downtown environment and accommodate the wide variety of permitted uses, this district includes
specific design standards for site layout, setback continuity, building design, pedestrian amenities, parking
arrangement, vehicular circulation and coordination of site features between adjoining sites. One intent of this
district is that buildings be placed close to the street, with parking in the side, or preferably, rear yard.
Permitted uses shall be designed and arranged to minimize any adverse impact on street capacity or public
services, and contribute to the overall image and function of the district. A mixture of uses within a building,
such as retail on the ground floor and office on upper floors is permitted. It is the further intent of this district to
prohibit automotive related services and non-retail uses which tend to disrupt the continuity of the retail
frontage. (Amended 2/14/96)
SECTION 1001 PERMITTED AND SPECIAL LAND USES
Permitted and Special Land Use shall be in accordance with the following:
a. All uses shall meet the standards for the CBD listed below in Section 1002 and as set forth in Article
XX, Schedule of Regulations.
b. All uses permitted by the underlying zoning district (as designated on the zoning map) shall be
permitted for that lot within the CBD. (For example, if the underlying zoning district is B-2, the uses
permitted in B-2 are permitted for that lot).
c. Any building fronting on Saginaw or Grand Blanc Road and having commercial or office use on the first
floor of said street frontage may contain residential uses on upper stories when adequate off-street
parking is provided.
d. Multi-story single family attached or townhouse (row house) buildings may be permitted as Special
Land Uses on lots that do not front along Saginaw or Grand Blanc Road. Each dwelling shall comprise
a single unit from the lowest floor to the highest floor of the building between common walls except that
the Planning Commission may permit stacked units where the front building faade retains a traditional
townhouse (row house) appearance. (Amended July 2013)
e. Any use with a drive through facility shall be regulated as a Special Land Use. Drive through facilities
shall be restricted to the side or rear yard. Due to high traffic generation, restaurants with drive through
service shall be restricted to lots with frontage along Saginaw Road.
f. All uses regulated as Special Land Uses in d or e above or in the underlying zoning district shall require
conformance with the appropriate standards of Article XXI, Special Land Uses.

Article XVII: Planned Unit Development (PUD) District 18 - 1
ARTICLE XVIII
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT (amended 11/10/04)
SECTION 1801 INTENT
The intent of the Planned Unit Development District, PUD, is to permit flexibility in the regulations for
development which either includes a mix of land uses or is proposed for a site containing unique natural
features which the developer and City desire to preserve. The standards of this section are intended to
encourage innovative design and create opportunities which may not be obtainable through the
conventional standards of other articles of this Zoning Ordinance.
The PUD standards are not intended to be used as a technique to circumvent the intent of the Zoning
Ordinance, to avoid imposition of specific Zoning Ordinance standards, or the planning upon which it is
based, unless there is a clear public benefit consistent with the overall intent of the Zoning Ordinance.
Thus, the provisions of this section are designed to promote land use substantially consistent with the
character of the surrounding area and the Citys Master Plan, with modifications and departures from
generally applicable requirements made to provide the developer with flexibility in design on the basis of
the total PUD plan approved by the City.
SECTION 1802 DEFINITIONS
Mixed Use PUD: A Mixed Use PUD is a unified development project, comprised of a variety of
complimentary uses, located on a specific parcel of land or several contiguous parcels of land, for which a
comprehensive development plan meeting the requirements of this Article is approved by the City Council.
Open Space/Residential PUD: An Open Space/Residential PUD is a residential development in which
dwelling units are placed in a more compact arrangement than is typical of a conventional subdivision, to
preserve natural features and provide open space /recreation areas.
SECTION 1803 ELIGIBILITY
Planned unit developments may be allowed upon determination by the City Council, following a
recommendation by the Planning Commission, that the site and proposed project meet the following
eligibility criteria:
a. The subject site shall be a minimum size of five (5) acres of contiguous land; provided, the
minimum site area may be waived by the Planning Commission for previously developed sites
that are proposed to be redeveloped with a mixed-use PUD, or for PUD sites that will be an infill
development utilizing innovative design to achieve compatibility with surrounding land uses.
b. The subject site shall be under the control of one owner or group of owners operating collectively,
and shall be capable of being planned and developed as one integral unit. An approved PUD plan
runs with the land, not with the owner. If the land is sold or otherwise exchanged, the approved
PUD plan shall remain in effect unless the applicant submits a request to amend or terminate the
PUD plan.
c. The site shall have frontage along, and direct access to a street(s) capable of accommodating
anticipated traffic volumes. Any project over five acres shall have direct access to a Major Street
(per the Act 51 Map) or an arterial or collector road as identified in the Citys Master Plan.
d. The site contains significant natural or historic features which will be preserved to a greater extent
through development under the PUD standards than if the site was developed under conventional
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article XVII: Planned Unit Development (PUD) District 18 - 2
zoning, or the PUD will provide a complementary mixture of uses or housing types within a
unique, high quality design as determined by the Planning Commission.
e. The planned unit development offers higher design quality and/or provides amenities that will
result in a recognizable and substantial benefit to the ultimate users of the project and to the City,
where such benefit would otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved through conventional
zoning. These benefits shall be demonstrated in terms of preservation of natural features, unique
architecture, extensive landscaping, special sensitivity to adjacent land uses, particularly well
designed access and circulation systems, integration of various site features into a unified
development and/or contribution to infrastructure and facility improvements to help offset the
impacts of the PUD project.
f. A finding that the proposed type and density of use shall not result in an unreasonable increase in
traffic or the use of public services, facilities and utilities compared to permitted uses under
conventional zoning.
g. The proposed development shall be consistent with the City Master Plan.
SECTION 1804 PUD SUBMITTAL AND APPROVAL PROCESS
A PUD may be designated by the City or may be requested by the applicant. If the City initiated the PUD,
and the site is already designated PUD on the City Zoning Map, the applicant is still responsible for the
submission of a PUD preliminary plan and materials as described below, however the site shall already be
deemed as meeting the eligibility criteria of Section 1802 above.
The PUD submittal and approval process is as follows:
a. Optional Preapplication Conference. Prior to formal submission of an application for planned
unit development approval, the applicant may request a meeting with City staff and consultants to
obtain guidance that will assist the applicant in preparation of the application and plan. The City
shall charge a fee for the conference to cover administrative and consultant costs.

criteria are met.
1. Attached unit buildings shall meet the dimensional standards set forth in Article XX for
either LDMF or HDMF Districts.
2. Attached unit buildings shall be arranged and designed to promote compatibility with
adjacent uses.
3. Attached unit buildings shall provide a variation in building height, setbacks, rooflines,
window, door openings, materials, and colors.
4. The units shall relate well to the streetscape and minimize the visual dominance of garage
doors in the front yard through the provision of front porches, doors, windows,
architectural details that face the street, and a variation in garage door design and
location (e.g. side entry, recessed from front building line, limited projection beyond front
building line).
5. The arrangement of units maximizes the preservation of open space and the protection of
natural features.
6. The overall density is no greater than could be achieved through the underlying zoning.
See d below.
c. Harmony with surrounding uses: The uses and design of the Open Space/Residential PUD will
be harmonious with the character of the surrounding area in terms of density, intensity of use, size
and height of buildings, architecture and other impacts.
If the proposed units are to be developed as part of a golf course, the arrangement of units should
not unduly interfere with the operations of the golf course. The City may require a review by an
independent golf course design professional.
d. Density Standards: The permitted density within an Open Space/Residential PUD shall not
exceed the density allowed by the underlying residential zoning district as described in Article XX
Schedule of Regulations.
1. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted within an Open Space/Residential PUD
project shall be the number of units permitted under a conventional plan. This shall be
demonstrated through the preparation of a comparison plan that illustrates how many
dwelling units could feasibly and practically be constructed on the subject site in
accordance with all dimensional requirements of the zoning district and design standards
for stormwater and public streets. Portions of a MDEQ regulated wetland shall not be
located within an individual lot. The lots on the comparison plan shall not require
exceptional or unusual engineering to accommodate residential construction, as
determined by the City.
2. The area used for density calculations shall not include public street rights-of-way, private
road access easements, lakes, streams, detention ponds, or submerged wetlands
containing surface water or open water ponds during at least one (1) month of the year.
e. Dimensional Standards: The setbacks and other dimensional standards for various uses shall
be consistent with the standards associated with the various uses listed in Article XX - Schedule
of Regulations. Where the proposed design deviates from the typical standards, the deviations
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article XVII: Planned Unit Development (PUD) District 18 - 6
shall meet the intent of this Article and the applicant shall provide a table that clearly compares
each requested modification to the Ordinance standard. Unless variations are specifically requested
and approved by the City, the site plan or subdivision plan shall comply with applicable City
standards. In no case shall the setbacks for buildings adjacent to existing single family homes be
less than fifty (50) feet.
f. Open Space
1. Area included in the open space calculations

greater, shall be dedicated open space and held in common ownership.
b. The total area of dedicated open space shall equal or exceed any reduction in area
for minimum lot sizes in the development based on the parallel plan, except where a
density bonus is approved as permitted herein.
c. The minimum size of an individual open space area shall be 20,000 square feet with
a maximum width to depth ratio of 3:1. This standard is intended to ensure open
space is valuable and usable rather than scattered, isolated, or remnant lands. The
City may waive this standard for clearly identified pathway corridors between a single
row of lots intended to connect open spaces, if such corridors are determined to be
desirable.
d. At least 50% of the open space must be usable to the residents for passive or active
recreation, exclusive of permitted water bodies, stormwater facilities, or other required
site plan elements. At least one active neighborhood park area shall be provided that
includes facilities such as playground equipment, picnic pavilions, soccer fields, ball
fields or similar facilities.
e. All natural land, including fairways, associated with golf courses.
f. No more than twenty-five (25) percent of any required open space shall include

Department of Environmental Quality. Detention ponds that do not provide a natural
appearance and are not incorporated into the overall plan as an amenity, as
determined by the City, shall not be included as required open space.
g. Any building or use accessory to recreation, conservation, or an entryway may be
erected within the dedicated open space, subject to the approved open space plan.
Accessory structures or uses of a significantly different scale or character than the
abutting residential districts shall not be located near the boundary of the
development if it may negatively impact the residential use of adjacent lands, as
determined by the City.
2. To be included in the calculations for the minimum open space area, the following design
standards must be met.
a. The open spaces shall be organized around the sites most important natural features
on the site and link existing and planned greenways, as illustrated on the City
Pathways and Parks and Recreation Plans. A preliminary meeting with City staff,
consultants and/or the Planning Commission to discuss the site analysis, natural
feature priorities and development concepts prior to preparation of plans is
encouraged.
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article XVII: Planned Unit Development (PUD) District 18 - 7
b. The open space shall include pathways to link adjacent open spaces, public parks,
bike paths or non-motorized routes.
c. In addition to preservation of the most important natural features, where possible
additional open space shall be located and designed to achieve the following:
1. preserve or create a buffer from adjacent land uses where appropriate;
2. maintain existing natural viewsheds; and
3. open space shall be located within prominent and highly visible areas of the
development, such at the terminus of key views along roads, at the intersection
of arterial or collector streets, at high points or centrally located within a
residential area.
3. The following land areas shall not be included in calculations for required open space:
a. the area within any existing or future public street right-of-way;

c. the area located below the ordinary high water mark of an inland lake, river or stream
or any pond with standing water year round;
d. the required setback areas around, or minimum spacing between buildings, except
that the setback area around a permitted open space accessory building may be
considered open space;
e. parking and loading areas, except those exclusively associated with a recreation
facility or common open space area; and
f. any other undeveloped areas not specifically addressed in this Article, but determined
by the Planning Commission to inadequately meet the intent and standards for open
space.
4. Protection of Open Space
The dedicated open space shall be set aside by the developer through an irrevocable
conveyance and protected by a Maintenance Agreement, in a form and manner acceptable to
the City. Such conveyance shall assure the open space will be protected from alteration and
all forms of development, except as shown on an approved site plan or subdivision plat. Said
documents shall bind all successors and future owners in fee title to commitments made as
part of the proposal, but shall allow transfer of ownership and control to a subdivision or
condominium association consisting of residents within the development, provided notice of
such transfer is provided to the City. Such conveyance shall indicate the allowable use(s)
within the dedicated open space. Upon transfer to a successor of the developer, the open
space shall be maintained by the property owners association or condominium association.
The City may require the inclusion of open space restrictions to prohibit activities such as the
following:
a. dumping or storing of any material or refuse;
b. activity that may cause risk of soil erosion or threaten plant material;

final site plan or, alternatively, design guidelines or a pattern book or design code shall be
included in the Development Agreement. Identical or similar single family buildings or elevations
may not be repeated more frequently than every sixth house along the same side of any street.
Buildings shall be considered similar if they have similar door and window configuration, direction
of roof pitch, building mass and building form. Attached unit buildings shall provide a variation in
building height, setbacks, rooflines, window, door openings, materials and colors. Buildings shall
relate well to the streetscape through the provision of front porches, doors, windows and
architectural details that face the street and assist in minimizing the dominance of garages. For at
least 50% of all units, garages shall be side entry, rear entry or front entry with the garage
recessed a minimum of five (5) feet behind the front building line.
i. Additional Considerations: The Planning Commission and City Council shall consider the
following design elements as appropriate: perimeter setback and landscaping; drainage and utility
design; underground installation of utilities; facilities for pedestrian circulation; internal roadway
design; and the achievement of an integrated development with respect to signs, lighting,
landscaping and building materials.
SECTION 1807 APPEALS, VIOLATIONS, VARIANCES AND EXPIRATION

2 Minimum lot width is measured at the required front yard setback distance from right-of-way except corner lots and double frontage lots are considered to have two
front yards. Narrow deep lots shall be avoided. The depth of a lot generally shall not exceed three (3) times the width as measured at the building line for platted lots
and four (4) times the width for unplatted lots.
Article XX: Schedule of Regulations 20 - 3
3 See Article XXIII for landscaping, screening and buffering standards which may increase the width of the required setback area.
4 Exceptions to front yard setback: Where fifty (50) percent or more of the aggregate street frontage between two (2) successive intersecting streets is occupied by
buildings of the type and use permitted in the district before the effective date of this Ordinance or any amendments thereto, with a front yard setback less than
required by this Ordinance, the minimum front yard for new buildings shall be the average setback distance of existing buildings located within two hundred (200) feet
on either side of a given lot. However, the depth of the front yard resulting therefrom shall not be less than one-half (1/2) of the dimensions specified in the Schedule
of Regulations.
5 Exceptions to height requirements: The following kinds of structural appurtenances may be permitted to exceed the height limitations for authorized use, upon
approval of the Planning Commission.
a. Schools, churches and other similar institutional buildings may be erected to a height not exceeding sixty (60) feet provided the front, side and rear yards shall not
be less than the height of the building abutting on such yard.
b. Chimneys, church spires, cupolas, domes, towers, flag poles, penthouses, water tanks, radio or television or cellular phone antennae, monuments may be
erected to a height not exceeding sixty (60) feet unless approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Setbacks for television and cellular phone antennae shall be
equal to half the height of the structure, provided that applicant demonstrates the design will protect adjacent uses and structures if the structure collapses.
c. Mechanical equipment such as blowers, ventilating fans and air conditioning units, shall be placed no closer than three (3) feet to any lot line in commercial
districts and no closer than twelve (12) feet to any lot line in residential districts. Mechanical equipment in industrial districts shall comply with all yard setbacks.
d. Any mechanical equipment located on the roof of any building shall not exceed a height of ten (10) feet above the surrounding roof surface, and shall occupy no
more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total roof area. When roof-mounted equipment is located on a building that is adjacent to a residential use or is in view
from the adjacent roadway, appropriate architectural screening shall be required.
e. Structural extensions appropriate to the building design, such as cornices, shall be limited to five feet above the stated height limit.
6 Where maximum height is described in both height and stories, the maximum height shall be whichever is less.
7 Where the building is connected to building on an adjoining lot by an approved fire wall, the required side yard on the common side may be reduced to zero (0) feet if
permitted by the building and fire codes, provided a ten (10) foot setback shall be provided if the wall includes any windows or similar openings.
8 The setback may be reduced to not less than twenty-five (25) feet by the Planning Commission if a wall or landscaped berm is provided to screen loading areas, and
the rear of the building has the same architectural character and materials as the front and side.
9 All outdoor storage and display areas shall be in the rear yard and shall be completely screened with an obscuring wall as required in Section 2310. The Planning
Commission may require the wall be up to eight (8) feet high in consideration of adjacent uses.
10 A greater or lesser distance may be required by the Planning Commission. If a lesser setback is authorized, a corresponding width reduction to the requirements of
Section 2303 Required Landscaping Along Public Streets shall also be permitted. The following criteria shall be employed by the Planning Commission to determine
the minimum and maximum setback for a specific site in the Central Business District:
(1) Consistency with existing setbacks within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the same blockface or area, as appropriate; or
(2) Consistency with site limitations and constraints; or
(3) For sites bound by vacant lots, consistency with existing or historical setbacks within the same or opposite blockface or area (amended 2/14/96); or
(4) Avoidance of impacts upon recorded easements, rights-of-way, or sight distances; or
(5) Other site-specific considerations that may warrant an increase or decrease in setback.
(6) Parking shall be located behind the front building line and no closer than 10 feet to a residential property line. (Amended 7/14/10)
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article XX: Schedule of Regulations SECTION 2000 The intent of this Section is to permit the subdivider or developer to vary lot sizes and lot widths to average
the minimum size of lot per unit as required in Article XX - Schedule of Regulations for each Single-Family
Residential District. If this option is selected, the following conditions shall be met:
a. In meeting the average minimum lot size, the Subdivision shall be designed so that no lot has
area or width reduced more than ten percent (10%) than the minimum area or width required
in the Schedule of Regulations and shall not create an increase in the number of lots.
b. Each final plat submitted as part of a Preliminary Plat shall average the minimum required for
the district in which it is located. The dimensions shall be illustrated on the plan or in tabular
form.
SECTION 2001 SUBDIVISION OPEN SPACE OPTION
a. Intent: The intent of the Subdivision Open Space Plan is to promote the following objectives:
1. Provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the natural features such as
woodlands, steep topography, water bodies and wetlands.
2. Encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the development of residential
areas.
3. Encourage a more efficient, aesthetic and desirable use of open area while recognizing a
reduction in development costs, and allowing the developer to avoid natural obstacles on the
site.
4. Encourage the provision of open space within reasonable distance to lots in the subdivision
and to further encourage the development of recreational facilities, such as pathways which
link up to the City's sidewalk system.
b. Modifications to the standards as outlined in Article XX - Schedule of Regulations may be made in
the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Single-Family Residential Districts when the following conditions are met:
1. Individual lots in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Single-Family Residential Districts may be reduced up
to twenty percent (20%). In the R-2 Districts, this reduction may be accomplished in part by
reducing lot widths up to five (5) feet. In the R-1 Districts, this reduction may be
accomplished in part by reducing lot widths up to ten (10) feet. These lot-area reductions
shall be permitted, provided that the dwelling unit density shall be no greater than if the land
area to be subdivided were developed in the minimum square-foot lot areas as required for
each Single-Family District under Article XX - Schedule of Regulations. The area remaining
through the reduction of lot sizes shall be retained as permanent open space. The City may
require submission of a "parallel" plan to illustrate that the number of lots provided under the
Open Space option would be feasible with a traditional subdivision layout (for example, each
lot in the parallel plan must have buildable envelope meeting setback requirements and not
including ponds or wetlands regulated by the MDNR).
2. The City may allow up to fifty percent (50%) of the area considered not to be buildable under
traditional subdivision practices (such as MDNR regulated wetlands, non-regulated wetlands,
floodplain, steep slopes, etc.) to be used in the "parallel" plan for determining density if the
City finds that the project will result in a recognizable benefit to the City and the residents of
the proposed subdivision.
3. Rear yards may be reduced to no less than thirty (30) feet when such lots border land
dedicated for park, recreation and/or open space purposes, provided the width of the
dedicated land shall not be less than one hundred (100) feet measured at the point at which it
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article XX: Schedule of Regulations abuts the rear yard of the adjacent lot.
4. The area to be dedicated for subdivision open space purposes shall in no instance be less
than four (4) acres, and shall be in a location and shape approved by the City Council.
5. This plan, for reduced lot sizes, shall be permitted only if it is mutually agreeable to the City
and the subdivider or developer.
6. This plan, for reduced lot sizes, shall be started within six (6) months after having received
approval of the final plat, and must be completed in a reasonable time. Failure to start within
this period shall void all previous approval.
Article XXI: Special Land Uses 21 - 1
ARTICLE XXI
SPECIAL LAND USES
SECTION 2100 INTENT
This Article is intended to regulate uses which may be compatible with uses in some, but not all, locations
within a particular zoning district. Among the purposes of the Special Land Use standards of this Article are to
accomplish the following:

! Establish criteria for both new development and infill/redevelopment consistent with the City's land use
goals and objectives as stated in the City Master Plan.
! Ensure uses can be accommodated by the environmental capability of specific sites.
! Provide site design standards to diminish negative impacts of potentially conflicting land uses.
! Provide greater flexibility to integrate land uses within the City.
This Article provides both general standards for all Special Land Uses (Section 2101) and specific location,
site or operational standards for particular Special Land Uses (Section 2102). The process for a Special Land
Use involves a Public Hearing with the Planning Commission with final review on the use and site plan by the
City Council. Approval of any Special Land Use requires a Special Land Use Permit.

Commission shall schedule a Public Hearing to review the request.
2. The Planning Commission shall direct the City Clerk to publish a notice of the public hearing in a newspaper
which circulates in the City and copies of the notice shall be sent by mail to property owners and occupants
of structures within three hundred (300) feet of the property in question. The notice shall be given not less
than five (5) days nor more than fifteen (15) days before the date of the public hearing, and shall:
(a)Describe the nature of the Special Land Use request.
(b)Indicate the property which is the subject of the Special Land Use request.
(c)State the date, time and place of public hearing.
(d)Indicate that written comments may be submitted prior to or at the public hearing.
c. The Planning Commission shall conduct the required public hearing.
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance

Council shall either approve or reject the request within sixty (60) days, unless an extension has been
agreed upon in writing by both the City Council and the Applicant.
SECTION 2102 GENERAL REVIEW STANDARDS FOR ALL SPECIAL LAND USES
Prior to approving a Special Land Use application, the Planning Commission and City Council shall require the
following general standards be satisfied for the use at the proposed location. In addition to specific standards
for individual Special Land Uses listed in Section 2110, the Planning Commission and City Council shall
require stipulation to ensure that the following are met:
a. The Special Land Use will be consistent with the goals, objectives and future land use plan described in
the Grand Blanc Community Master Plan.
b. The Special Land Use will be consistent with the stated Intent of the zoning district.
c. The Special Land Use will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be compatible with,
and not significantly alter, the existing or intended character of the general vicinity in consideration of
environmental impacts, views, aesthetics, noise, vibration, glare, air quality, drainage, traffic, property
values or similar impacts.
d. The Special Land Use will not significantly impact the natural environment.
e. The Special Land Use can be served adequately by public facilities and services such as police and fire

5. provide adequate protection to existing land uses so the proposed land use will not be
detrimental or injuries to the surrounding neighborhood.
b. Approval of a Special Land Use, including conditions made part of the approval, is attached to the
property described in the application and not to the owner of such property. A record of conditions
imposed shall be made a part of the City Council minutes and maintained by the Building and Zoning
Administrator. The conditions shall remain unchanged unless an amendment to the Special Land Use
permit is approved by the City Council.
SECTION 2104 VALIDITY OF PERMIT
a. Building Permit: The Building and Zoning Administrator or Building Inspector may issue a building
permit in conformity with the particular Special Land Use so approved. In all cases where a particular
Special Land Use has been granted as provided herein, application for a building permit must be made
and received by the City no later than one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter, or such approval shall
automatically be revoked unless an extension is granted. The City Council may grant an extension of
the first approval for good causes shown under such terms and conditions for such a period of time not
to exceed six (6) months.
b. Performance Guarantee: The City Council shall require a performance guarantee to ensure
completion of the improvements (excluding the building). The performance guarantee may take the
form of a cash deposit, surety bond, certified check, or an irrevocable bank letter of credit.
c. Where actual physical construction of a substantial nature of structures authorized by a Special Land
Use permit has not commenced within one (1) year of issuance, and a written application for extension
of the approval has not been filed as provided below, the permit shall become null and void and all
rights thereunder shall terminate (note: it is the responsibility of the applicant to request such an
extension).
d. Upon written application filed prior to the termination of the one (1) year period as provided above, the
City Council may authorize a single extension of the time limit for a further period of not more than one
(1) year. Such extension shall be granted only based on evidence from the applicant that the
development has a reasonable likelihood of commencing construction during the one (1) year extension
period.
e. Any approved Special Land Use shall be deemed a use permitted in the district in which it is located
and is not to be considered a non-conforming use.
f. If a use regulated as a Special Land Use which has not previously received a Special Land Use permit
ceases operations for more than one (1) year, the Special Land Use permit shall become null and void,
and a new Special Land Use permit shall be required to reopen the use. The time frame shall be
extended to two (2) years for a use which was approved as a Special Land Use under this Ordinance
amendment (i.e. a Special Land Use Permit is on file).
g. The Building and Zoning Administrator shall make periodic investigations of development authorized by
Special Land Use permit to determine continued compliance with all requirements imposed by the
Planning Commission and this Ordinance. Non-compliance with the requirements and conditions
approved for the Special Land Use shall constitute grounds to terminate said approval following a public
hearing.

5. Adult Regulated Uses
a. Intent: In the development and execution of these zoning regulations, it is recognized
there are some uses that, because of their very nature, are recognized as having
serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are
concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby causing a deleterious effect upon
the adjacent areas. The proximity of adult uses to certain uses considered particularly
susceptible to the negative impacts or the concentration of adult uses tends to erode
the quality of life, adversely affect property values, disrupt business investment,
encourage residents and businesses to move or avoid the community, increase crime
and contribute a blighting affect on the surrounding area. This subsection describes
the uses regulated and the specific standards needed to insure that the adverse
effects of these uses will not contribute to the deterioration of the surrounding
neighborhood, to prevent undesirable concentration of these uses and to require
sufficient spacing from uses considered most susceptible to negative impacts.
b. Uses Regulated: The following uses are regulated by this subsection.
(1) Adult Book or Supply Store
(2) Adult Model Studio
(3) Adult Motion Picture Arcade
(4) Adult Motion Picture Theater or Adult Live Stage Performing Theater

(7) Cabaret
(8) Massage Parlor except those licensed by the State of Michigan and meeting the
criteria outlined in the definitions section (Article II).
c. Required Spacing: The establishment of the types of Adult Regulated Uses listed in
"b" above shall meet all of the following space requirements; with the distance
between uses measured horizontally between the nearest point of each property line:
(1) at least one thousand (1,000) feet from any other adult regulated use;
(2) at least one thousand (1,000) feet from all churches, convents, temples and
similar religious institutions;
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article XXI: Special Land Uses 21 - 9
(3) at least one thousand (1,000) feet from all public, private or parochial nursery,
primary or secondary schools, public parks and hospitals;

and similar uses frequented by children and teenagers.
d. Special Site Design Standards
(1) Maximum size of the building shall be five thousand (5,000) square feet.
(2) The building and site shall be designed, constructed and maintained so material
such as a display, decoration or sign depicting, describing, or relating to
"specific sexual activities" or "specified anatomical areas" (as defined in this
ordinance) cannot be observed by pedestrians, motorists on a public right-ofway
or from an adjacent land use.
(3) Adult regulated uses shall be located within a free standing building. A shared
or common wall structure or shopping center are not considered to be a free
standing building.
(4) The color of the building materials shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission and approved by the elected body.

Upon denial of any application for a regulated use under Section, the applicant may
appeal for a waiver of the location provisions above to the Board of Zoning Appeals
consistent with the standards set forth below. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
waive the location provisions set forth in Section, after all the following findings are
made:
(1) Compliance with Regulations: The proposed use will not be contrary to any
other provision of these zoning regulations, or injurious to nearby properties;
(2) Not Enlarge District: The proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the
development of a "skid row" or "strip";
(3) Consistent with Programs: The establishment of an additional regulated use
will not be contrary to, or interfere with, any program of urban renewal or
neighborhood development;
(4) Consistent with Law: All applicable City, state or federal laws and regulations
will be observed.
(5) Procedure for Waiver: Prior to granting a waiver of the location restrictions set
forth above, and not less than five (5), nor more than fifteen (15) days before
the request for waivers is considered or a public hearing held pursuant to this

Article XXIII: Landscaping Standards 23 - 1
ARTICLE XXIII
LANDSCAPING STANDARDS
SECTION 2300 INTENT
The intent of this Article is to establish minimum standards for the design, installation and maintenance
of landscaping along public streets, as buffer areas between uses,on the interior of a site, within parking
lots and adjacent to buildings. Landscaping is viewed as a critical element contributing to the aesthetics,
development quality, stability of property values and the overall character in the City. The standards of
this Article area also intended to provide incentives to preserve quality mature trees, screen headlights
to reduce glare, integrate various elements of a site, help ensure compatibility between land uses, assist
in directing safe and efficient traffic flow at driveways and within parking lots, and minimize negative
impacts of stormwater runoff and salt spray.
The landscape standards of this section are considered the minimum necessary to achieve the intent. In
several instances, the standards are intentionally flexible to encourage flexibility and creative design.
Applicants are encouraged to provide additional landscaping to improve the function, appearance and
value of their property.
SECTION 2301 REQUIREMENTS AND TIMING OF LANDSCAPING
Landscaping shall be illustrated on any site plan, sketch plan or plot plan reviewed by the City. The
landscape plan shall clearly describe the location, type, size and spacing of all plant materials. Wherever
the Zoning Ordinance requires landscaping or plant materials, it shall be planted within six (6) months
from the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy and shall thereafter be reasonably maintained with
permanent plant materials which may be supplemented with other plantings. The Building and Zoning
Administrator may require a performance guarantee to cover the cost of landscaping prior to issuing a
Certificate of Occupancy,
SECTION 2302 SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR EXISTING SITES
Special provision is made for applying these standards to developed sites which existed prior to the City
adopting landscaping requirements. Therefore, when an existing site is undergoing improvement, a
change in use or expansion, the objective of these standards is to gradually bring the existing site into
compliance with the minimum standards of this Article in relation to the extent of expansion or change on
a site.
When reviewing plans for a change in use or expansion which requires site plan or sketch plan review,
the Building and Zoning Administrator or body reviewing the plan shall require an upgrade in landscaping,
using the following as guidelines:
a. Each building expansion of one percent (1%) of gross floor area should include at least four percent
(4%) of the landscaping required for new developments.
b. The estimated cost of landscaping added should generally be equal to at least 5%of the estimated
value of the new construction.
c. Landscaping along the street and as a buffer between adjacent land uses should take priority over
parking lot and site landscaping, particularly where there is no excess parking over that required
by Article XXII. Where parking lot landscaping can not be provided, additional landscaping along
the street or in the buffer areas should be considered.
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article XXIII: Landscaping Standards 23 - 2

Article XXIV: Site Plan Review 24 - 1
ARTICLE XXIV
ARTICLE XXIV SITE PLAN REVIEW AND APPROVAL
SECTION 2400 INTENT
The intent of this article is to establish the procedures and consistent standards for review and approval of site plans to ensure
full compliance with the regulations in this Ordinance and other applicable ordinances and state and federal regulations of
development proposals. Site plan review standards are intended to encourage consultation and cooperation between the
applicant and the City to balance the property owners right to a reasonable rate of return on investment with the City's overall
land use goals and desire to minimize adverse impacts on the investments of surrounding landowners. Therefore, these site
plan review standards insure a thorough evaluation of a development in relation to the goals of the City of Grand Blanc Master
Plan and the potential impacts on the environment, drainage, utilities, traffic, aesthetics, property values and other public
health, safety and welfare issues.
This section also contains special provisions to evaluate impacts of particular uses and to allow administrative approval in

USES OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES
SECTION 2600 INTENT
It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit legal nonconforming lots, structures, or uses to continue until
they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.
It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this Ordinance and subsequent
amendments, lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this Ordinance
was passed or amended which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this
Ordinance or future amendments.
Such uses are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved.
It is further the intent of this Ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure
and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Ordinance by attachment on a building
or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by addition of other uses of
a nature which would not be permitted generally in the district involved.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing
of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where
demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding such
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided work shall be diligently carried
on until completion of the building involved.

a. Effective Date: Whenever this article refers to the "effective date," the reference shall be deemed
to include the effective date of any amendments to this Ordinance if the amendments created a
nonconforming situation.
b. Nonconforming Building: A building or portion thereof which was lawfully in existence at the
effective date of this Ordinance, or amendments thereto, that does not meet the limitations on
building size, location on a lot, or other regulations for the district in which such building is located.

or amendment thereto, and which does not now conform to the use regulations of this Ordinance
for the zoning district in which it is now located.
e. Structural Nonconformity: A nonconformity that exists when the height, size, or minimum floor
space of a structure, or the relationship between an existing building and other buildings or lot

SECTION 2602 NONCONFORMING LOTS
Any nonconforming lot shall be used only for a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed
by other provisions of this Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings
may be erected on any single lot or record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Ordinance. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area
or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and
other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located. Yard requirement variances may be obtained through

at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, and if all or part of the individual lots do
not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lots involved shall be considered
to be an individual parcel for the purposes of this Ordinance. No portion of said parcel shall be
used, occupied, or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area
requirements established by this Ordinance, nor shall any division of an parcel be made which

by an dwelling unit.
Upon application, the Building and Zoning Administrator may permit the combination, in whole or
in part, of nonconforming lots of record into building sites less than the size requirements
established by this Ordinance, provided that the combination of lots reduces the degree of

or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Ordinance;

thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is removed.
d. Any nonconforming structure or any structure or portion thereof containing a nonconforming
use, may be altered if such alteration serves to decrease the nonconforming nature of the
structure or use. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine if a proposed alteration will
decrease the degree of nonconformity.
SECTION 2605 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND LAND
If a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and land in combination, exists at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, that would not be permitted in the district under the
terms of this Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
a. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Ordinance in the district in which

restricted classification provided that the Board of Appeals, either by general rule or by
making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate
or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such
change, the Board of Appeals may require conditions and safeguards in accord with the
purpose and intent of this Ordinance. Where a nonconforming use of a structure, land, or
structure and land in combination is hereafter changed to amore conforming use, it shall not
thereafter be changed to a less conforming use.

building, provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment
of this Ordinance shall not be increased.
Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition
of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.
SECTION 2608 USES UNDER EXCEPTION PROVISIONS NOT NONCONFORMING USES
Any use for which a special exception is permitted as provided in this Ordinance shall not be deemed a

SECTION 2609 CHANGE OF TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP
There may be a change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any existing nonconforming uses of
land, structures and land in combination.

stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Building and Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board of Zoning Appeals, after notice of appeal has been filed with the Building and Zoning
Administrator, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a staywould, in his opinion, cause imminent peril
to life or property, in which case, the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order

a variance as defined in this Section and laws of the State of Michigan. Said powers include:
Grand Blanc City Zoning Ordinance
Article XXIX: Zoning Board of Appeals 29-2
a. Administrative Review: To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error of law
in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Building and Zoning
Administrator in the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance.
b. Variance: To authorize, upon an appeal, a variance from the strict application of the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance where, by reason of exceptional narrowness,
shallowness, shape, or area of a specific piece of property at the time of enactment of this
Ordinance, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or
exceptional conditions of such property, the strict application of the regulations enactedwould
result in peculiar or exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional undue hardship upon
the owner of such property, provided such reliefmaybe grantedwithout substantial detriment
to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of the Zoning
Ordinance. In granting or denying a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach
thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, site design, operations and other
features of the proposed structure or uses as it deems reasonable in furtherance of the
purpose of this Ordinance. In granting or denying a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall state the grounds upon which it justifies the granting or denying of a variance. (amended
2/14/96), (amended 6/10/98)
SECTION 2904 STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES AND APPEALS
Variances and appeals shall be granted only in accordance with Michigan Public Act 207 of 1921, as
amended, and based on the findings set forth in this section.
a. Criteria Applicable to Dimensional (area or non-use) Variances. A dimensional variance is an
approved deviation fromany dimensional standard or requirement of this Ordinance, such as, but not
limited to, lot area, lot width, building or structure height, building size, setback, parking, lighting or
landscaping. The extent to which the following criteria apply to a specific case shall be determined
by the Board of Zoning Appeals, however, at least one of the applicable criteria must be found by the
Board of Zoning Appeals. (amended 6/10/98)
1. Practical Difficulties: Compliance with the strict letter of the restrictions governing area,
setbacks, frontage, height, bulk, density, or other dimensional provisions would create
practical difficulties, unreasonably prevent the use of the property for a permitted purpose,
or render conformitywith such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome. The showing of mere
inconvenience is insufficient to justify a variance.
2. Substantial Justice: Granting of a requested variance or appeal would do substantial
justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the district; or, as an alternative,
granting of lesser variance than requested would give substantial relief to the owner of the
property involved and be more consistent with justice to other property owners.
3. Public Safety and Welfare: The requested variance or appeal can be granted in such
fashion that the spirit of these regulations will be observed and public safety and welfare
secured.
4. Extraordinary Circumstances: There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property that do
