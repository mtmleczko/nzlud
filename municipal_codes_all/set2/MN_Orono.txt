PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Orono, Minnesota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1984 Code, as supplemented through January 28, 1991, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1984 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged by subject matter, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Code Attorney, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

Such request shall contain a general statement setting forth the administrative decision to be challenged by the appellant.

Sec. 2-71. - Interim emergency succession.

Sec. 2-73. - Computerized criminal history and driver's license history inquiries. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this division is to authorize the City of Orono to conduct computerized criminal history (CCH) and driver's license history inquiries on persons who are finalists for certain employment positions in the city and who are volunteers in city programs providing services to children or vulnerable adults. Access for these purposes shall be limited to Minnesota CCH public data only. Nothing in this division shall be construed to preclude the city from conducting comprehensive background investigations of applicants for city employment positions, including but not limited to accessing public data through other automated and non-automated sources and contacting references. Nothing in this division shall be construed to preclude the city from periodically conducting a driver's license inquiry upon employees or volunteers where possession of a valid driver's license is an essential qualification of the position. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Computerized criminal history inquiries means criminal histories obtained through the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension's computerized criminal history system. 
(2)  Driver's license history inquiries means driver's license violations recorded by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety. 
(c)  Findings of the city council. The city council makes the following findings regarding the need to conduct computerized criminal history and driver's license history inquiries on persons who are finalists for certain city positions and who are applying to volunteer in city programs providing services to children or vulnerable adults, recognizing that the city council has a significant interest in protecting the general public in the performance of government services. 
(1)  Certain city employees and volunteers work independently with and provide public services to some of the most vulnerable members of society: children, senior citizens, developmentally disabled individuals, and mentally ill persons. Protection of these vulnerable persons warrants the investigation of persons who are finalists to fill these certain employment positions with the city and who are applying to volunteer in city programs that provide services to these members of the public. 
(2)  Some city employees and volunteers work closely with public funds and accounts and are in positions that have access to property or assets of the city where losses are difficult to detect or prevent. In order to minimize the risk that the public trust will be violated, computerized criminal history inquiries of those individuals who are finalists to be employed in such positions are necessary. 
(3)  Some city employees and volunteers enter the private homes of city residents in the performance of necessary and worthwhile public services. Computerized criminal history inquiries on persons who are finalists for such positions are deemed necessary to minimize the risk that the personal safety of residents in their homes will be violated. 
(4)  Many city employees and some volunteers operate, on a regular basis, heavy machinery, buses, street maintenance equipment, and/or other city-owned motor vehicles on public rights-of-way. In order to minimize the loss of public property and the loss of life in serious traffic accidents, computerized criminal history inquiries and driver's license history inquiries of finalists for such positions are appropriate. 
(5)  In accordance with the state policy of encouraging the rehabilitation of criminal offenders, the computerized criminal history and driver's license history inquiries prescribed herein shall not be an automatic bar to public employment but rather used in assessing the rehabilitation of the finalist in accordance with Minn. Stat. §§ 364.01 to 364.10. 
(6)  This section cannot guarantee that groups or individuals will be protected from the criminal acts of employees or volunteers; rather, its intent is to minimize certain risks in the performance of government services to the general public. 
(d)  Computerized criminal history and driver's license history inquiries authorized. Data obtained from computerized criminal history and driver's license history inquiries shall be released only to authorized personnel. The city administrator or the city administrator's designee is authorized to conduct computerized criminal history and driver's license history inquiries in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  Only persons who are finalists for the positions of employment specified in section 2-73(e) of this division or who are applying to volunteer in city programs providing services to children or vulnerable adults shall be subject to the computerized criminal history and driver's license history inquiries prescribed herein. 
(2)  The person who is a finalist for a position detailed in section 2-73(e) of this division shall be presented with an informed consent form indicating that the person may consent to the computerized criminal history inquiry and/or driver's license history inquiry or may refuse. If the finalist refuses to sign the consent, the person shall not be allowed to continue in the employment process for the position sought. 
(3)  Persons who are applying to volunteer in programs that provide services to children or vulnerable adults shall be notified that computerized criminal history and/or driver's license history inquiries will be conducted prior to their participation in the program. 
(e)  Applicability. 
(1)  Employees. Computerized criminal history inquiries and driver's license history inquiries shall be conducted in accordance with this division on persons who are finalists for the following city positions or position-types: 
a.  Assessors, property appraisers, and meter readers; 
b.  Public health nurses and aides and similarly situated public health personnel; 
c.  Employees operating street maintenance equipment and heavy machinery; 
d.  Employees operating any motor vehicle owned by or operated for the city;

f.  Employees handling public funds or criminal evidence on a regular basis; 
g.  Employees who have access to non-public information; 
h.  Inspectors, sanitarians, and program specialists; and 
i.  Department heads. 
(2)  Volunteers . Computerized criminal history inquiries and driver's license history inquiries shall be conducted in accordance with this division on persons who are applying to volunteer in city programs that provide services to children or vulnerable adults. 
(f)  Failure of computerized criminal history or driver's license history inquiries. Should the city reject the applicant's request for employment due, partially or solely, to the applicant's prior conviction of a crime, subject to the exception set forth in Minn. Stat. § 364.09, the city administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of the grounds and reasons for the denial. 
(g)  Good faith reliance on record accuracy. The city may in good faith rely on the accuracy of the criminal history information received from federal, state, and county authorities in conducting the computerized criminal history or driver's license history inquiry prescribed herein. 
(h)  Verification of identity. Questioned identity situations may occur which could require fingerprint verification where it is not clear if a record based on a name and date of birth search actually belongs to the subject of the computerized criminal history or driver's license history inquiry.

(1)  Failure to read. The city will provide notification to the property owner of the inability to obtain an accurate water meter reading and the city's need to obtain access to the property to allow for correction of the problem by the city. The property owner shall cooperate with the city to allow for correction of the situation in a prompt manner. If the property owner is nonresponsive or uncooperative in coordinating with the city to allow for repair of the water meter and remote reader, the city reserves the right to add a nonrefundable service charge for a nonfunctioning or inaccessible water meter to the next water bill. 
(2)  Service charge. The amount of this service charge shall be determined by ordinance and listed in the city fee schedule. This service charge will be added to future quarterly water bills and the water bill estimated until the property has a properly functioning and accessible radio-read water meter. The city also reserves the right to shutoff water service to any property that has had a nonfunctioning or inaccessible water meter or remote reader for more than six months after the property owner is notified of the situation.

A penalty of eight percent shall be added to and become part of all delinquent utility bills. If service is suspended due to delinquency, it shall not be restored at that location until a reconnection charge has been paid for each utility reconnected in addition to amounts owed for service and penalties. If delinquent charges are specially assessed under subsection (b) of this section, an additional sum of eight percent computed on the delinquent amount of charges and penalties shall be added to and become part of the amount so assessed to cover administrative costs of making the assessment. 
(b)  Payment for service and charges provided for in this section shall be the primary responsibility of the owner of the premises served and shall be billed to him unless otherwise authorized in writing by the tenant and owner and consented to by the city. The city may collect the payment in a civil action or, in the alternative and at the option of the city, as otherwise provided in this subsection. Each such charge is made a lien upon the premises served. All such charges which are on September 1 of each year more than 45 days past due shall be certified by the city clerk to the county auditor on or before December 1 of each year; and the city clerk in so certifying such charges to the county auditor shall specify the amount, the description of the premises served, and the name of the owner. The amount so certified shall be extended by the auditor on the tax rolls against such premises in the same manner as other taxes, collected by the county treasurer, and paid to the city along with other taxes.

Sec. 14-251. - Statutory authority. 
    Minn. Stat. § 444.075, authorizes cities to impose just and reasonable charges for the use and availability of storm sewer facilities (charges). By this subdivision the city elects to exercise such authority. 
(Ord. No. 213 2nd series, § 1(1), 12-10-2001) 
Sec. 14-252. - Findings and determinations. 
    In providing for such charges, the findings and determinations set out in this section are made. 
(1)  In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the city has constructed, operated and maintained a storm sewer system ("the system"). This subdivision is adopted in the further exercise of such authority and for the same purpose. 
(2)  The system, as constructed, heretofore has been financed and paid for through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. Such financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were used. It is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the future costs of improving, maintaining and operating the system through the imposition of charges as provided in this subdivision. 
(3)  In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into account the status of completion of the system, past methods of recovering system costs, the topography of the city and other relevant factors, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of operating, maintaining and improving the system on the basis of the expected stormwater runoff from the various parcels of land within the city during a standard five-year rainfall event. 
(4)  Assigning costs and making charges based upon expected typical stormwater runoff cannot be done with mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits. The provisions of this subdivision undertake to establish a reasonable and practicable methodology for making such charges. 
(Ord. No. 213 2nd series, § 1(2), 12-10-2001) 
Sec. 14-253. - Excluded lands. 
    No charge for system availability or service shall be made against land which is. 
(1)  Public or private street right-of-way; 
(2)  Vacant and unimproved land with substantially all of its surface having vegetation as ground cover; 
(3)  Land owned by the city; or 
(4)  Park land owned by other governmental agencies. 
(Ord. No. 213 2nd series, § 1(7), 12-10-2001) 
Sec. 14-254. - Establishing basic rate. 
    The basic system rate to be charged against an average single-family residence shall be included in the city fee schedule and shall be changed as necessary by resolution of the council. The charge to be made against all other nonresidential properties shall be made in accordance with section 14-255. 
(Ord. No. 213 2nd series, § 1(4), 12-10-2001) 
Sec. 14-255. - Rates and charges. 
(a)  Residential equivalent factor. Rates and charges for the use and availability of the system shall be determined through the use of a residential equivalent factor (REF). For the purposes of this subdivision, one REF is defined as the average volume of surface water runoff coming from an average single-family residential lot of 2.0 acres of land and 20 percent impervious surface. 
(b)  Standardized acreage. For the purpose of simplifying and equalizing charges against property used for average single-family residential purposes, such properties shall be considered to have an acreage of 2.0 acres. 
(c)  Determination of REF's-Nonresidential properties. REF's for all land uses other than residential uses shall be based on the percentage of impervious surface and size of the property as listed in the following table. The minimum fee for any property shall be based upon one REF.

(a)  Supplying information. The owner, occupant or person in charge of any premises shall supply the city with such information as the city may reasonably request related to the use, development and area of the premises. Willful failure to provide such information or to falsify it is a violation of this subdivision. 
(b)  Estimated charges.

Subdivision IV. - Stormwater Trunk Fee 

Sec. 14-281. - Statutory authority. 
    Minn. Stat. § 444.075 authorizes cities to impose just and reasonable charges for the use and availability of storm sewer facilities (charges). By this subdivision, the city elects to exercise such authority. 
(Ord. No. 214 2nd series, § 1(1), 12-10-2001; Ord. No. 149 3rd series, § 1, 5-26-2015) 
Sec. 14-282. - Findings and determinations. 
    In providing for such charges, the findings and determinations set out in this section are made. 
(1)  In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the city has constructed, operated and maintained a storm sewer system (the system). This subdivision is adopted in the further exercise of such authority and for the same purpose. 
(2)  The system, as constructed, heretofore has been financed and paid for through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. Such financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were used. It is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the future costs of improving, maintaining and operating the system through the imposition of charges as provided in this subdivision. 
(3)  Development of land changes the characteristics of the stormwater runoff from the property and results in the need for improved stormwater facilities, and also increases the demand on the stormwater system, which results in greater maintenance and operational costs of the system. 
(4)  In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into account the status of completion of the system, past methods of recovering system costs, the topography of the city and other relevant factors, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of operating, maintaining and improving the system on the basis of the acreage of land to be developed . 
(5)  Assigning costs and making charges based upon expected typical stormwater runoff cannot be done with mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits. The provisions of this subdivision undertake to establish a reasonable and practicable methodology for making such charges. 
(Ord. No. 214 2nd series, § 1(2), 12-10-2001; Ord. No. 149 3rd series, § 1, 5-26-2015) 
Sec. 14-283. - Rates and charges. 
(a)  Establishing. The stormwater trunk fee charges, for various land uses, shall be included in the city fee schedule and shall be changed as necessary by resolution of the council. 
(b)  Determination. The city has developed a surface water management plan that includes design criteria for stormwater systems and preliminary design information for a comprehensive stormwater system in the city. In general, stormwater trunk fees are calculated by dividing the total cost of system construction, by the number of developable acres the system will serve. The appropriate base trunk fee per acre, to be used on a citywide basis, shall be determined as necessary using this methodology. 
(c)  Acreage equivalency factors. Recognizing that different types of land use generate different amounts of stormwater runoff, an equivalency factor multiplier is assigned to each land use type. The two-acre residential lot is considered as the standard in the city, because a large percentage of the land in the city is zoned for two-acre single-family residential land use. The two-acre single-family residential lot will be assigned an equivalency factor of 1.0. The table below lists the equivalency factors for different land uses. These equivalency factors will be applied to the base trunk fee per acre. 
Land Use Equivalency Factor Single-Family Residential 5-Acre Zone 0.8 Single-Family Residential 2-Acre Zone 1.0 Single-Family Residential 1-Acre Zone 1.3 Single-Family Residential 1/2-Acre Zone 1.5 Multifamily Residential 4 Units/Acre or Less 1.8 Multifamily Residential Greater than 4 Units/Acre 2.1 Commercial or Industrial 2.4  
(d)  Trunk fee calculation, credits and reductions. The following calculation, credits and reductions shall be applicable to new development projects as defined in section 14-284: 
(1)  Trunk fee charged on per lot basis. For the 5-acre, 2-acre, 1-acre and 1/2-acre zoning districts, the trunk fee shall be charged on a per-lot basis. Only acreage platted as building lots shall be charged the trunk fee. Acreage platted as road-rights-of-way or outlots for other purposes shall not be charged the trunk fee. The dollar amount calculated by multiplying (a) the number of new lots by (b) the zoning district base acreage per lot by (c) the base trunk fee per lot established in the city fee schedule, shall be deemed the base development trunk fee. 
(2)  Maximum fee. For the five-acre zoning district, any lot exceeding 5.0 gross acres, including wetland, shall be charged a maximum trunk fee equal to the trunk fee for a 5.0 acre parcel. 
(3)  Maximum fee. For the two-acre zoning districts, any lot exceeding 2.0 gross acres, including wetland, shall be charged a maximum trunk fee equal to the trunk fee for a 2.0 acre parcel. 
(4)  Fee credits. For the two-acre and five-acre zoning districts, a combined reduction of up to 50 percent of the base development trunk fee shall be allowed for the percentage of the total development property acreage in one or more of the following categories: 
- acreage of newly-created wetland. 
- acreage of stormwater ponding or similar improvements that provide additional treatment benefits beyond what is required to treat the stormwater runoff from the development site. 
- acreage of conservation easements resulting from conservation design process. 
(5)  Maximum fee. For the one-acre zoning districts, any lot exceeding 1.0 gross acres, including wetland, shall be charged a maximum trunk fee equal to the trunk fee for a 1.0 acre parcel. 
(6)  Maximum fee. For the 1/2-acre zoning districts, any lot exceeding 0.5 gross acres, including wetland, shall be charged a maximum trunk fee equal to the trunk fee for a 0.5 acre parcel. 
(7)  Multi-family and high-density single family developments. Trunk fee shall be charged on a per-acre basis, except that the following acreages will not be subject to the trunk fee: 
- all wetland acreage up to the delineation line. 
- acreage of stormwater ponding or similar improvements that provide additional treatment benefits beyond what is required to treat the stormwater runoff from the development site. 
- acreage of conservation easements resulting from conservation design process. 
(e)  Payment. All applicable stormwater trunk fee charges set forth in this subdivision shall be paid in full before any building or land alteration permits are issued for the project. 
(Ord. No. 214 2nd series, § 1(3), (4), (9), 12-10-2001; Ord. No. 222 2nd series, § 1, 11-12-2002; Ord. No. 149 3rd series, § 1, 5-26-2015) 
Sec. 14-284. - New development projects. 
    For the purposes of this subdivision, new development projects will be defined as any land subdivision that creates new building lots; or construction of structures on a previously vacant parcel. New development projects shall pay the base trunk fee per acre of land developed adjusted using the appropriate land use equivalency factor as set forth in this subdivision per the provisions of section 14-283. Additionally, the following provisions for new development projects shall apply: 
(1)  When property is subdivided to create new building lots, only the newly created vacant lots will be charged the trunk fee. A lot that has an existing home or principal structure which is intended to remain post-subdivision will not be charged the trunk fee. 
(2)  For a subdivision that results in separation of a property into an existing house lot (house to remain) and a large further-subdividable vacant lot, the trunk fee shall be charged only for the further-subdividable vacant lot, in an amount equal to the per-lot trunk fee for the underlying zoning district based on one lot. 
(3)  For a subdivision that results in separation of a property into a large further subdividable lot with an existing house to stay, and a new small (not further subdividable) lot on which a new home will be constructed, the trunk fee shall be charged only for the new small lot. 
(4)  When outlots are created that are intended via appropriate zoning documentation for future development subject to: a) future further subdivision; or b) no development allowed until converted to a lot; then no trunk fee shall be collected until such further development occurs.

Sec. 14-287. - Adjustment of charges. 
    The intent of the stormwater trunk fee is to provide funding for improvements to the stormwater system as the result of development in the city. Current regulations require property owners to provide stormwater treatment for the stormwater from the development property. The city reserves the right to develop policies to provide stormwater trunk fee credits for stormwater improvements on developing properties that provide additional treatment benefits beyond what is required to treat the stormwater runoff from the development site.

Sec. 14-288. - Credit for past payments. 
    Past trunk fee payments made with respect to a specific property shall be credited as follows: 
(1)  Once the trunk fee is paid for a lot created by a new subdivision, it will not be charged again when a house is built on that lot, nor when that house is later expanded. 
(2)  If a lot for which the trunk fee was paid under a past subdivision is then itself subdivided, no additional trunk fee will be charged if the original trunk fee was based on the entire acreage of the parcel now being divided. However, if the original trunk fee was based on an acreage amount less than the acreage of the parcel now being divided, then a supplementary fee shall be required in an amount to be calculated as follows: 
(Number of new lots being created × 
base per-lot acreage for zone) 
minus (Number of acres originally charged) = Number of acres to be charged

(1)  The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit; 
(2)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens. 
(3)  Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right-of-way permit; 
(4)  The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the permittee's control; or 
(5)  The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to section 18-181. 
(b)  Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach. 
(c)  Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, the permittee shall provide the city with a plan acceptable to the city that will cure the breach. The permittee's failure to so contact the city, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. 
(d)  Revocation. Revocation of a right-of-way permit or small wireless facility permit shall be made in writing within three business days of the decision to revoke the permit and shall document the basis for the revocation. 
(e)  Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

Within 90 days following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the city accurate maps and drawings certifying the "as-built" location of all equipment installed, owned and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall be provided consistent with the city's electronic mapping system. Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit. 
(b)  Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rules 7560.0150 subpart 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the city reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the city evidence satisfactory to the city of the installed service lateral locations. 
    Compliance with this subdivision (b) and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after December 31, 2005 shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for 
(1)  Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project including those under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 429; and 
(2)  City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or site plan approval under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 462. The city shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such information. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.

Sec. 18-186. - Location facilities. 
(a)  Placement, location, relocation. Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other applicable law, and with Minnesota Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000 and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities. 
(b)  Corridors. The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue. 
    Any permittee who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the registrant. 
(c)  Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities found in the right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable condition. 
(d)  Limitation of space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have the power or prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.

Sec. 30-1. - Purpose. 
    The city council finds that hawkers, peddlers, solicitors and transient merchants, by virtue of the temporary nature of their business and the lack of permanent location for their operations, present unique consumer protection problems. In order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community and pursuant to the authority granted by Minn. Stat. § 329.15, the City of Orono herein licenses and regulates all hawkers, peddlers, solicitors, and transient merchants operating within the city. The purpose of this chapter of the city Code is to prevent fraud and criminal activity, such as burglary, theft, and assault and to protect the privacy of residents in their homes by requiring hawkers, peddlers, solicitors and transient merchants to be licensed and to impose restrictions on their operations within the city that are narrowly tailored to address the risks these operations pose to the public health, safety and welfare. It is not the purpose of this ordinance to burden interstate commerce or interfere with constitutionally protected rights under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Art. I, Section 3 of the Minnesota Constitution.

(2)  An offense under subsection (a)(1)b of this section may be prosecuted either in the jurisdiction where consumption occurs or the jurisdiction where evidence of consumption is observed.

Sec. 34-8. - Social host ordinance. 
[(a)  Generally. ] 
(1)  It is unlawful for any person under the age of 21 to consume or possess alcohol. 
a.  Consumption of alcohol by persons under the age of 21 is harmful to those persons and constitutes a potential threat to public health from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. 
b.  Alcohol is also an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
c.  As a result, gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 should be prevented as much as possible. 
d.  Gatherings involving underage possession and consumption often occur outside the presence of parents or other responsible adults. However, there are times when a parent or other adult is present and condones the activity, and in some circumstances provides the alcohol. 
e.  Although furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption. 
f.  A deterrent effect will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting a gathering where underage possession or consumption occurs. 
(2)  The purpose of this section is to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol, even if done within the confines of a private residence, and to hold persons criminally responsible who host gatherings where persons under 21 years of age possess or consume alcohol, regardless of whether the person hosting the gathering supplied the alcohol or was present. 
(3)  The city council intends that this section should not target parents who may have alcoholic beverages on their premises but who have issued a standing order that alcohol is not to be consumed by underage persons on those premises. 
[(b)]  Prohibited acts. 
(1)  It is unlawful for a person to host or allow a gathering on any premises if: 
a.  The person knows that alcohol or alcoholic beverages will be present; and 
b.  The person knows that an underage person will attend, or is likely to attend; and 
c.  The person fails to take reasonable steps to prevent the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by an underage person; and 
d.  An underage person consumes an alcoholic beverage, or possesses an alcoholic beverage with the intent to consume it, at the gathering. 
(2)  Examples of reasonable steps include: 
a.  Directing, on a one-time basis or as a standing order, that no consumption of alcohol and alcoholic beverages is allowed; or 
b.  Controlling access to alcohol and alcoholic beverages; or 
c.  Checking identification of attendees to determine age; or 
d.  Supervising the activities of underage persons at the gathering either in person or through a responsible adult. 
(3)  A person is not criminally responsible under this section if the person does not know that a gathering will occur, or does not know that alcoholic beverages will be present, or does not know that an underage person will be or is likely to be present. However, if a person has the knowledge specified in paragraph (1) above, a person who hosts a gathering does not have to be present at the gathering to be criminally responsible. 
(4)  A person is criminally responsible for violating paragraph (1) above if the person intentionally aids, advises, hires, counsels, or conspires with or otherwise procures another to commit the prohibited act. 
[(c)]  Exceptions. 
(1)  This section does not apply to conduct of an underage person that is permitted by his or her parent and occurs in the parent's household. 
(2)  This section does not apply to a legally protected religious observance. 
(3)  This section does not apply when an underage person is lawfully in possession of alcohol or alcoholic beverages during the course and scope of employment. 
(4)  This section does not apply to the holder of a liquor license issued under Title III of this Code, but it does apply to a person who hosts a gathering at such a liquor establishment.

All applications for a license required by this division shall be referred to the chief of police and to such other city departments as the council shall deem necessary, for verification and investigation of the facts set forth in the application. The chief of police shall cause to be made such investigation of the information as shall be necessary and shall make a written recommendation and report, which shall include a list of all violations of federal or state law or municipal ordinances by the applicant, to the council. 
(b)  Hearing. Upon receipt of the written report and recommendation by the chief of police and within 30 days thereafter, the city clerk shall publish a notice of hearing at least ten days prior to the date set for hearing. The hearing notice shall set forth the day, time and place of hearing; the name of the applicant; the place where the business is to be conducted; and such other information as the council may direct. At such hearing all persons desiring to be heard shall have such opportunity, and the council may thereafter grant or deny the license. If the license is granted, the council may withhold its issuance until the applicant has qualified in all respects for the license. If the premises to be licensed are not complete at the time that the hearing is conducted, the council may grant the license but shall withhold its issuance until the premises have been completed in accordance with the representations made by the applicant. The license fee shall be due as of the date the license is granted. If a license has been granted but its issuance has been withheld pending completion of the premises to be licensed, and if the licensee does not proceed with reasonable dispatch to ready the premises, the council may rescind the action granting the license. Such action shall not be taken, however, without giving the licensee at least ten days' notice of the time and place of a hearing on the proposed rescission. 
(c)  Granting. The council may approve any application for the period of the remainder of the then current license year or for the entire ensuing license year. All applications, including proposed license periods, must be consistent with this chapter. Prior to consideration of any application for a license, the applicant shall pay half the license fee, and the investigation fee. Upon rejection of any application for a license, or upon withdrawal of an application before approval of the issuance by the council, the license fee shall be refunded to the applicant. Failure to pay any portion of a fee when due shall be cause for revocation. The city clerk shall, within ten days after the issuance of any license under this section, submit to the proper department of the state the full name and address of each person granted a license, the trade name, the effective license date, and the date of expiration of the license. He shall also submit to the proper department of the state any change of address, transfer, cancellation or revocation of any license by the council during the license period. 
(d)  Issuing. If an application is approved, the city clerk shall forthwith issue a license in the form prescribed by the city or the proper department of the state, as the case may be, and upon payment of the second half of the license fee. All licenses shall be on a calendar year basis unless otherwise specified in this division. For licenses issued and which are to become effective other than on the first day of the licensed year, the fee to be paid with the application shall be a pro rata share of the annual license fee. Licenses shall be valid only at one location and on the premises described in the license.

(Ord. No. 164 2nd series, § 1400, 12-8-1997) 
Sec. 50-34. - Purpose. 
    Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products and tobacco-related devices, and such sales, possession and use are violations of both state and federal laws; and because studies, which the city accepts, adopts and are on file at city hall, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years without having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking; and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government, this article shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession and use of tobacco, tobacco products and tobacco-related devices for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products and tobacco-related devices, and to further the official public policy of the state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in Minn. Stat. § 144.391.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY. 

Sec. 50-91. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this section is to reduce public exposure to health risks associated with hazardous chemicals or residue from a clandestine drug lab site. Professional testing and investigations show that chemicals used in the production of illicit drugs can condense, penetrate, and contaminate surfaces, furnishings, and equipment of surrounding structures. The city council finds that such sites, and the personal property within such sites, may contain suspected chemicals and residues that place people, particularly children or adults of child bearing age, at risk when exposed through inhabiting or visiting the site or being exposed to contaminated personal property. 
(Ord. No. 3 3rd series, § 1, 11-10-2003) 
Sec. 50-92. - Interpretation and application. 
    The provisions of this section must be construed to protect the public health, safety and welfare. When the conditions imposed by this section conflict with comparable provisions imposed by another law, ordinance, statute, or regulation, the regulations that are more restrictive or that impose higher standards will prevail.

The city administrator or designee is required to consult with, and authorized to retain the services of, public health services or private hazardous material specialists as are recognized by county or state authorities as being competent in HazMAT cleanup with clandestine drug lab experience. 
    Clandestine drug lab operation means the unlawful manufacture or attempt to manufacture a controlled substance. 
    Clandestine drug lab site or site means a place or area where law enforcement personnel have determined that conditions associated with an unlawful clandestine drug lab operation exist. A clandestine drug lab site may include dwellings, accessory buildings, structures or units, a chemical dump site, a vehicle, boat, trailer, or other appliance. 
    Controlled substance means a drug, substance or immediate precursor specified in Minn. Stat. § 52.02, Schedules I through V, as may be amended. The term does not include distilled spirits, wine, malt beverages, intoxicating liquors or tobacco.

(1)  Promptly notify the city health authority, county child protection division, the United States drug enforcement administration, and the site owner about the site and the conditions found; 
(2)  Treat, store, transport or dispose of all waste generated from the clandestine drug lab operation and found at the site in a manner consistent with the Minnesota Department of Health and Minnesota Pollution Control Regulations; 
(3)  Issue a temporary declaration of public health nuisance for the affected site and post a copy of the declaration on all doorway entrances to the site or, in the case of bare land, in several conspicuous places on the property.

All other requirements of this section must be followed as closely as possible given the specific type of property in which the site is discovered. 
(Ord. No. 3 3rd series, § 1, 11-10-2003) 
Sec. 50-203. - Action by city health authority. 
(a)  Inspection and declaration of nuisance. Within 48 hours of notification that law enforcement authorities have determined the existence of a clandestine drug lab site, the city health authority must inspect the site.

Chapter 51 - ORONO TOBACCO-FREE PARKS AND WORKPLACES ACT 

Sec. 51-1. - Intent and findings. 
    It is found and determined that tobacco use is a danger to the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. 
(1)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke or environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of diseases such as lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease and a cause of strokes and heart attacks. 
(2)  The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. According to the United States Surgeon General, there are more than 50 cancer-causing chemicals in secondhand smoke. 
(3)  Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to the elderly and those with cardiovascular disease and impaired respiratory function. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk and severity of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, cancer, and premature death. 
(4)  The United States Surgeon General reports that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke and that even short exposure to secondhand smoke can damage blood vessels, decrease coronary flow velocity reserves, and reduce heart rate variability, potentially increasing the risk of a heart attack. Even in healthy persons, brief exposure can lead to changes in the upper airway. 
(5)  Eliminating smoking indoors and in enclosed spaces fully protects nonsmokers from exposure to secondhand smoke. Simply separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. Although air cleaners can remove large particles from smoke, smaller particles and gases found in secondhand smoke cannot be removed from the air. 
(6)  Scientific studies conducted by Stanford University and others found that outdoor smoke can reach the same level as indoor smoke. Persons near an outdoor smoker can breathe in wisps of smoke that can be tens or 100s times more concentrated that normal background air pollution levels. 
(7)  The Americans with Disabilities Act includes respiratory function as a disability. The ADA requires disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces. 
(8)  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has concluded that smoke is an occupational carcinogen. 
(9)  Nonsmokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke at work have a 25 percent to 30 percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, acute respiratory disease, and measurable decrease in lung function than persons not exposed to secondhand smoke at work. 
(10)  Secondhand smoke exposure leads to higher worker absenteeism from respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to secondhand smoke exposure. 
(11)  Smoking is a potential cause of fires. In parks and outdoor spaces, fire can spread to nearby homes and businesses. 
(12)  Use of tobacco products also produces litter that detracts from the beauty of city parks and increases maintenance costs of city facilities.

Sec. 70-5. - Abatement procedure. 
(a)  Abatement. Except for the abatement of public nuisance vehicles governed by section 58-3, the following abatement procedure applies to all public nuisances. Whenever the city administrator or designee determines that a public nuisance is being maintained or exists on property, the city administrator or designee must give written notification to the property owner and occupant or other responsible party of that fact and order that the nuisance be terminated and abated. Notice must be served in person or by mail. Notice to the owner will be satisfied by notice to the person listed as the taxpayer on the county's tax records. If the property is not occupied, the owner is unknown, or no other responsible party can be reasonably identified, notice may be served by posting it on the property. The notice must specify the steps to be taken to abate the nuisance and the time, not exceeding ten days, within which the nuisance is to be abated. The notice must also provide that if the owner, occupant, or other responsible party does not comply with the notice within the time specified, the city council may provide for abating the nuisance by the city. The notice must state the date, time, and location of the city council consideration and give the person the right to be heard. The notice of the council hearing must be given at least ten days before the council will consider the matter. If notice is given by posting, at least 30 days must elapse between the day of posting and the hearing. 
(b)  Summary abatement. The city administrator or designee may provide for abating a public nuisance without following the procedure required in paragraph (a) above when: 
(1)  There is an immediate threat to the public health or safety; 
(2)  There is an immediate threat of serious property damage; or 
(3)  A public nuisance has been caused by private parties on public property. 
    If the city administrator or designee abates the nuisance under this section, he must reasonably attempt to notify the owner, occupant, or other responsible party of the intended action and the right to appeal the abatement and any cost recovery. 
(c)  Cost recovery. The owner of property on which a nuisance has been abated by the city, or a person who has caused a public nuisance on property not owned by that person, is personally liable to the city for the cost of the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been completed and the cost determined, an appropriate official will prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner or other responsible party. The amount is immediately due and payable to the city treasurer. 
(d)  Assessment. If the cost, or any portion of it, has not been paid under paragraph (c) within 30 days after the date of the bill, the council may certify the unpaid cost against the property to which the cost is attributable. Before certification against the property, reasonable notice of the impending certification and an opportunity to be heard by the council must be given to the taxpayer of record. Failure of the taxpayer to receive the notice will not invalidate the certification. The council may certify unpaid cost to the county auditor for collection along with current taxes in the following year or in annual installments, not exceeding ten, as the council may determine in each case.

(a)  In recent years, there has been a significant increase in juvenile victimization and crime. At the same time, the crimes committed by and against juveniles have become more violent. A significant percentage of juvenile crime occurs during curfew hours. 
(b)  Because of their lack of maturity and experience, juveniles are particularly susceptible to becoming victims of older perpetrators. The younger a person is, the more likely he is to be a victim of crime. 
(c)  While parents have the primary responsibility to provide for the safety and welfare of juveniles, the city also has a substantial interest in the safety and welfare of juveniles. Moreover, the city has an interest in preventing juvenile crime, promoting parental supervision, and providing for the well-being of the general public. 
(d)  A city-wide curfew will reduce juvenile victimization and crime and will advance public safety, health, and general welfare.

Sec. 70-275. - Defenses. 
(a)  It is an affirmative defense for a juvenile to prove that the juvenile was: 
(1)  Accompanied by his parent, guardian, or other responsible adult. 
(2)  Engaged in a lawful employment activity or was going to or returning home from his place of employment.

ARTICLE VII. - SEXUAL PREDATOR RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS 

Sec. 70-277. - Findings and intent. 
(a)  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses. Most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(b)  It is the intent of this chapter to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of its citizens by establishing areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers, wherein certain sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

    Designated offender means any person who has been categorized as a Level III predatory offender under Minnesota Statutes Section 244.052, a successor statute, or a similar statute from another state.

    Temporary residence means a place, other than a person's permanent residence, where a person abides, lodges, or resides for a period of 14 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year or four or more consecutive or non-consecutive days during any month. 
(Ord. No. 182 3rd series, § 1, 1-9-2017) 
Sec. 70-279. - Residency prohibition; penalties; exception. 
(a)  Residency prohibition. 
(1)  It is unlawful for any designated offender to establish a permanent residence or temporary residence within 2,000 feet of any school, day care center, park or playground. 
(2)  For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of the permanent residence or temporary residence of the designated offender to the nearest outer property line of a school, day care center, park or playground. 
(b)  Penalties. A person who violates this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00, or by confinement for a term not exceeding 90 days, or by both such fine and confinement. Each day a person maintains a residence in violation of this chapter constitutes a separate violation. 
(c)  Exceptions. A designated offender residing within a prohibited area as described in subsection (a) does not commit a violation of this section if any of the following apply: 
(1)  The designated offender established the permanent residence or temporary residence and reported and registered the residence pursuant to M.S. §§ 243.166, 243.167, or successor statute, prior to the effective date of this section.

(5)  The residence is also the primary residence of the designated offender's parents, grandparents, siblings, spouse or adult children.

Sec. 78-4. - Enforcement. 
    If any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any building, structure or land is used, in violation of this chapter, the zoning administrator, in addition to other remedies, may institute any proper action or proceedings in the name of the city to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use to restrain, correct or abate such violations and to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about the premises. 
(Code 1984, § 10.13) 
Sec. 78-5. - Purpose. 
(a)  Guiding principles. 
(1)  The city is growing in population from a rural agricultural community to a rural residential community. Use of land for residential purposes is considered primary with other uses viewed as supporting this use. While present commercial or industrial activity, where consistent with residential use and other guiding principles, will be protected by ordinance or conditional use permit, it is not the intention to expand or allow all such commercial or industrial activity to a degree where it conflicts with the primary residential use and the other guiding principles. The continued use of land for farming and similar purposes will be protected by ordinance or conditional use permit where sufficient acreage allows such use to continue without conflict with expanding residential use. 
(2)  The maintenance of open space and the avoidance of overcrowding of land is a basic guiding principle in this plan. In addition to avoiding the ill effects of excessive, intensive land development, it is the policy to also avoid the threat to public health which occurs with excessive crowding of private sewage disposal systems on substandard building sites. 
(3)  The city has recognized that many of the open space policies which have previously provided the basic direction of the land use policies have proven to be inadequate. It is now clear that on-site disposal systems must not be allowed on any site of less than two acres. It is now clear that the physical characteristics of the city make the extension of public services such as sewer extremely expensive and almost impossible in some areas. The city and other governmental agencies have learned that the premature development of open areas can be costly and disastrous to the environment. 
(4)  Of paramount importance to the citizens of the city and to the citizens of the metropolitan area is the preservation of Lake Minnetonka and the wetlands that provide the only practical system of filtration and purification of the stormwater so vital to the preservation of Lake Minnetonka and the groundwater supplies in the area. The disastrous effects of intense residential and commercial development within the city, and especially in those areas adjacent to Lake Minnetonka and the wetlands, are painfully evident. The adoption of additional regulations, rezoning of certain areas and the creation of larger lot sizes in unsewered areas is mandatory in order to protect the safety, health and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(5)  The guiding principles of maintaining open spaces, avoiding the ill effects of overcrowding, avoiding premature development, avoiding the future pollution problems which are inherent in any plan to intensely develop land adjacent to wetlands and Lake Minnetonka, and the need to change some allowed uses in order to preserve the quality of the groundwater supplies in the area were recognized in the comprehensive municipal plan adopted on December 2, 1974, and the amendments to the comprehensive zoning chapter and map adopted by the council on December 19, 1974. The principles established in the 1974 comprehensive municipal plan were further reinforced by the 1980 Orono Community Management Plan adopted by Resolution No. 1338 on November 23, 1981, and the 2000-2020 Orono Community Management Plan adopted by Resolution No. 4723 on November 13, 2001. The official zoning map has since been revised by Ordinance No. 2 2nd series, adopted June 11, 1984; Ordinance No. 33 2nd series, adopted March 30, 1987; Ordinance No. 64 2nd series, adopted October 10, 1988; Ordinance No. 83 2nd series, adopted April 23, 1990; Ordinance No. 149 2nd series, adopted August 26, 1996; Ordinance No. 157 2nd series, adopted April 14, 1997; Ordinance No. 187 2nd series, adopted May 10, 1999; and Ordinance No. 207 2nd series, adopted October 22, 2001. 
(b)  Intent and purpose. This chapter is adopted for the purposes of: 
(1)  Protecting the public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience and general welfare; 
(2)  Dividing the city into zones and districts restricting and regulating therein the location, construction, reconstruction, alteration, and use of structures and land; 
(3)  Promoting orderly development of the residential, business, industrial, recreation and public areas; 
(4)  Providing adequate light, air and convenience of access to property; 
(5)  Limiting congestion in the public right-of-way; 
(6)  Preventing overcrowding of land and undue concentration of structures by regulating the use of the land and buildings and the bulk of buildings in relation to the land and buildings surrounding them; 
(7)  Providing for the compatibility of different land uses and the most appropriate use of land throughout the city, preventing the destruction of the natural environmental assets located within the city, protecting the quality of stormwater runoff, Lake Minnetonka, Long Lake, the wetlands and marshes within the city; 
(8)  Providing for a more orderly transition from a rural agricultural to rural residential environment; 
(9)  Providing for the administration of this chapter; 
(10)  Defining the powers and duties of the administrative, officers and bodies; and 
(11)  Prescribing penalties for the violation of the provisions of this chapter.

(Code 1984, § 10.03(2)) 
Sec. 78-8. - Prohibitions. 
    It is unlawful to convert, enlarge, reconstruct or alter any structure or use any structure or land for any purpose nor in any manner which is not in conformity with this chapter. 
(Code 1984, § 10.03(4)) 
Sec. 78-9. - Vacation of streets, alleys and public grounds. 
    Vacation of streets, alleys and public grounds shall follow the procedures set forth in this chapter; except that such vacation shall require a petition by a majority of the landowners abutting the property to be vacated, and a hearing preceded by two weeks' published and posted notice, all as required by Minn. Stat. § 412.851. The council may vacate any publicly owned utility easement or boulevard reserve which is not being used for sewer, drainage, electric, telegraph, telephone, gas and steam purposes or for boulevard reserve purposes, in the same manner as vacation proceedings are conducted for streets, alleys and other public ways. A boulevard reserve means an easement established adjacent to a dedicated street for the purpose of establishing open space adjacent to the street and which area is designated on the recorded plat as boulevard reserve.

Sec. 78-46. - Occupancy certificates. 
(a)  When required. A zoning occupancy certificate shall be required for occupancy and use of any buildings erected or structurally altered; for new occupancy and use of an existing building when the new use is of a different zoning classification; for occupancy and use of vacant land and, new use of vacant land when the new use is of a different zoning classification; and for any change in the use of a nonconforming use. Where appropriate, the zoning occupancy certificate may be issued as part of building permit. 
(b)  Prohibition. It is unlawful for any person to do any of the things mentioned in subsection (a) of this section as requiring an occupancy certificate without having one in force.

Failure to apply for such occupancy certificate will be prima facie evidence that such nonconforming use was either illegal or did not lawfully exist on January 1, 1975. 
(Code 1984, § 10.07(1)-(5)) 
Sec. 78-47. - Concept plan. 
(a)  Purpose. The concept plan serves as the basis for conceptual discussion between the city and the applicant. There are two general types of concept review: Policy and land use. Policy concept review allows the council to provide informal comments related to land use policy: i.e. would the council be willing to consider a rezoning or land use amendment. A land use concept review process provides the applicant with an opportunity to submit a plan showing the basic intent and the general nature of the entire development. Neither the city council nor the planning commission will take any formal action to approve or deny the application. Comments, remarks, or observations made by the city council, planning commission, or city staff on the concept plan are not binding on the city for subsequent stages. 
(b)  Requirements. A concept plan review may be completed for projects requiring one or more of the following applications: 
Land use amendment (comprehensive plan amendment) 
Zone change 
Zoning or Subdivision Ordinance text amendment 
A sketch plan may be prepared for certain subdivisions as outlined in section 82-85 sketch plans of this ordinance. 
(c)  Concept plan application. 
(1)  The planning commission shall review all concept plans based upon the applicant's application. Complete applications shall include the following: 
a.  Completion of all items on the concept plan application form; 
b.  Information on the proposal to sufficiently communicate the request; 
c.  Any additional information requested by the zoning administrator; and 
d.  Payment of the concept plan review fee. 
(d)  Concept plan review and recommendations. 
(1)  Concept plan review standards. City staff, the planning commission and city council shall study the concept plan, taking into consideration the requirements of generally accepted planning practice, applicable ordinances, and the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Recommendations to the applicant. After reviewing and discussing the concept plan, the planning commission and/or zoning administrator may advise in a general manner the applicant of the changes or additions, if any, which are recommended. 
(3)  Council review. Following planning commission review, the council may review a concept plan as was originally applied or in modified form. The council may provide comment on the proposal.

Sec. 78-48. - Public hearing. 
    When required by this ordinance, a public hearing shall be held. 
(a)  A notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be mailed at least ten days before the day of the hearing to each owner of affected property and property situated wholly or partly within 500 feet of the property. For the purpose of giving mailed notice, the person responsible for mailing the notice may use any appropriate records to determine the names and addresses of owners. A copy of the notice and a list of the owners and addresses to which the notice was sent shall be attested to by the responsible person, and shall be made a part of the records of the proceedings. The failure to give published or mailed notice to individual property owners or defects in the notice shall not invalidate the proceedings. This subsection shall not apply to amendments pursuant to section 78-43. 
(b)  In addition, a notice shall be published in the official newspaper once at least ten days before the day of the hearing.

DIVISION 2. - NONCONFORMING USES AND RELATED MATTERS 

Sec. 78-71. - Nonconforming structures and uses. 
(a)  General provisions. 
(1)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to regulate nonconforming structures and uses, and to specify those requirements, circumstances and conditions under which nonconforming structures and uses will be operated and maintained. The Zoning Code establishes zoning districts and specific uses which are permitted within each district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of these districts that nonconforming structures and uses not be permitted to continue without restriction. 
(2)  Effective date. Any structure or use lawfully existing upon the effective date of this section shall not be, enlarged, expanded, extended, or altered in any manner which increases its nonconformity, but may be continued at the size and in the manner of operation existing upon such date except as hereinafter specified or, subsequently amended. Any land or buildings which were actually and legally devoted to a nonconforming use on January 1, 1975, and which were thereafter specifically allowed to continue said nonconforming use under the terms of a conditional use permit issued by the city council, shall be allowed to continue under the terms of said conditional use permit. 
(3)  Safety repairs. Nothing in the Zoning Code shall prevent the placing of a structure in safe condition when said structure is declared unsafe by the building official. 
(b)  Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Change to conforming use. When any lawful nonconforming use of any structure or land in any district has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to any nonconforming use. 
(2)  Change to new nonconforming use. An existing nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
(3)  Relocation of nonconforming use. 
a.  No nonconforming use shall be moved to another lot or to any other part of the parcel of land upon which the same was conducted at the time of this section's adoption unless such movement shall bring the nonconformance into compliance with the requirements of this section. 
b.  Nonconforming non-structural hardcover may be relocated, including full replacement, to any other part of the parcel of land upon which the same was conducted at the time of this section's adoption, provided that: 
1.  The hardcover is nonconforming only by reason of the percentage of land devoted to the use or the square footage of the use. 
2.  The relocation does not physically enlarge the size of the nonconforming use. 
3.  The relocation does not substantially change the character of the nonconforming use. 
4.  The relocation does not create a new nonconformity with respect to size or placement by relocating to a different hardcover zone as such zones are defined in section 78-1288. 
5.  The relocation complies with all applicable setback requirements for the district in which it is located. 
6.  No relocation, in whole or part, is made within 75 feet of the ordinary high water level of any lake or tributary. 
(4)  Decrease in nonconforming use. A lawful nonconforming use of a structure or parcel of land may be changed to decrease the nonconformity of use. Once the nonconforming use of such structure or parcel of land has been so changed, said use shall not thereafter be altered to so as to increase the nonconformity from its decreased state. 
(5)  Discontinuation of nonconforming use. Whenever a lawful nonconforming use of a structure or land is discontinued and remains discontinued for a period of 12 months, any future use of said structure or land shall be in conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Code. 
(6)  Normal maintenance. Normal maintenance of a building or other structure containing or related to a lawful nonconforming use is permitted, including incidental alterations which do not physically extend or intensify the nonconforming use. 
(7)  Alterations to lawful nonconforming units. Alterations may be made to a conforming building containing lawful nonconforming units, provided they will not increase the number of units or the nonconformity. 
(8)  Expansion of nonconforming uses. Nonconforming uses may not be expanded or enlarged. However, a lawful nonconforming gun club may apply to the city council to modify its hours of operation or to expand its operations within the existing defined parameters of the property. 
(c)  Nonconforming structures. 
(1)  Involuntary damage or destruction. Whenever a lawful nonconforming structure shall have been damaged by fire, flood, explosion, earthquake, war, riot, or act of God, it may be reconstructed and used as before if within 12 months after such calamity the property owner applies for a building permit to replace the structure. If no permit is applied for within the time period then the whole structure shall be demolished, and any construction thereafter shall be in full compliance and accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code. 
(2)  Remodeling and reconstruction. This subsection is intended to apply to the voluntary and intentional removal of all or portions of a lawful nonconforming structure. Whenever a lawful nonconforming structure shall be destroyed by means other than fire, flood, explosion, earthquake, war, riot, or act of God, to any extent then such structure may be restored only if a building permit is applied for within 180 days of the commencement of the destruction. If no permit is applied for in the 180 days then the structure shall be built in full compliance and accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code. 
(3)  Expansion of nonconforming structures. "Expansion of nonconforming structures" includes any increase in a dimension, size, area, volume, or height; any placement of a structure or part thereof where none existed before; any addition of a site feature such as but not limited to a deck, patio, fence, driveway, parking area, or swimming pool; any improvement that would allow the land to be more intensely developed; and any exterior storage, signs, or lighting. No expansion of nonconforming structures shall be permitted except as specifically listed and allowed herein: 
a.  Expansion of nonconforming single family residence structures. Lawful, nonconforming single family residential structures may be expanded, provided: 
1.  That the expansion does not occupy any space within a non-conforming area that was previously not occupied either vertically or horizontally, and complies with all height, setback, hardcover and lot coverage requirements of the district in which it is located. 
2.  That if the structure is nonconforming only with respect to substandard lot area or width for the district in which it is located, the expansion shall meet all height, setback, hardcover and lot coverage requirements of the district in which it is located. 
3.  That in cases where the lot line setback of a structure is less than 50 percent of the required setback for that zoning district, the city will require at a minimum that applicant shall make up the discrepancy by enlarging the opposite required yard depth to result in an aggregate yard depth equivalent to the combined required yard. 
b.  Expansion of residential accessory structures. Lawful, nonconforming residential accessory buildings may be expanded provided: 
1.  That the expansion does not occupy any space within a non-conforming area that was previously not occupied either vertically or horizontally, and complies with all height, setback, and hardcover and lot coverage requirements of the district in which it is located. 
2.  That if the accessory structure is nonconforming only with respect to substandard lot area or width for the district in which it is located, the expansion shall meet all height, setback, hardcover and lot coverage requirements of the district in which it is located. 
3.  That in cases where an accessory structure encroaches upon the lot line setback, the city will require at a minimum that the existing accessory structure shall be modified so that it becomes completely conforming with respect to setbacks. 
(4)  Relocation. No nonconforming structure shall be moved to another lot or to any other part of the parcel of land upon which the same was constructed at the time of this section's adoption unless such movement shall bring the nonconformance into compliance with the requirements of the Zoning Code. 
(5)  Prior permit. Any proposed structure which will, under this section, become nonconforming but for which a building permit has been lawfully granted not more than six months prior to the effective date of this section, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans; provided construction is started within six months of the effective date of this section, and continues to completion within two years. Such structure shall thereafter be a legally existing nonconforming structure.

Sec. 78-121. - When granted. 
    The council upon application may grant variances from the strict application of the provisions of this chapter and impose conditions and safeguards in the variances so granted, in cases where there are practical difficulties in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this chapter and where the variance does not adversely affect the purpose and intent of this chapter nor the health or welfare of the public. 
(Code 1984, § 10.08(1); Ord. No. 88 3rd series, § 1, 6-27-2011) 
Sec. 78-122. - References to board. 
    Before authorization of any variances by the council, the request shall be referred to the board of appeals and adjustments for study concerning the effect of the proposed variance upon the comprehensive municipal plan and on the character and development of the neighborhood; and for its recommendation to the council for the granting of such variance so as to relieve such practical difficulties to the degree considered reasonable without impairing the intent and purpose of this chapter. The board of appeals and adjustments shall recommend such conditions related to the variance regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable. The council by unanimous action may waive reference to the board. 
(Code 1984, § 10.08(2)(A); Ord. No. 88 3rd series, § 2, 6-27-2011) 
Sec. 78-123. - Issuances. 
(a)  In considering applications for variance, the council shall consider the advice and recommendation of the board of appeals and adjustments and the effect of the proposed variance upon the health, safety and welfare of the community, existing and anticipated traffic conditions, light and air, danger of fire, risk to the public safety, and the effect on values of property in the surrounding area. Before granting a variance, the council shall hear requests for variances from the literal provisions of this chapter in instances where their strict enforcement would cause practical difficulties because of circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, and to grant such variances only when it is demonstrated that such actions will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of this chapter. The parameters within which a variance may be granted are as follows: 
(1)  The property owner in question proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner, however, the proposed use is not permitted by the official controls. 
(2)  The plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to his property not created by the landowner. 
(3)  The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. 
(4)  Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties. 
(5)  Practical difficulties also include but are not limited to inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. Variances shall be granted for earth-sheltered construction as defined in Minn. Stat. § 216C.06, subd. 2, when in harmony with this chapter. 
(6)  The board or the council may not permit as a variance any use that is not permitted under this chapter for property in the zone where the affected person's land is located. 
(7)  The board or council may permit as a variance the temporary use of a one-family dwelling as a two-family dwelling. 
(8)  The special conditions applying to the structure or land in question are peculiar to such property or immediately adjoining property. 
(9)  The conditions do not apply generally to other land or structures in the district in which the land is located. 
(10)  The granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant. 
(11)  The granting of the proposed variance will not in any way impair health, safety, comfort or morals, or in any other respect be contrary to the intent of this chapter. 
(12)  The granting of such variance will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant, but is necessary to alleviate demonstrable difficulty. 
(b)  The board or council may impose conditions in granting of variances. Any conditions imposed must be directly related to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the variance. No variance shall be granted or changed beyond the use permitted in this chapter in the district where such land is located. 
(Code 1984, §§ 2.56(2)(B), 10.06(1)(B)(1)(b), (1)(B)(1)(c), 10.08(3); Ord. No. 88 3rd series, § 3, 6-27-2011) 
Sec. 78-124. - Variances in border areas. 
    This chapter seeks to regulate land use throughout the city so that the location of the various zones will be compatible with each other and to existing uses and regulations. Where property in the city adjoins property in another municipality which is subject to regulations substantially different from those applying to the city property, so as to make strict enforcement of all the city regulations as to such property unreasonable, the council may take into account the location of the property and the regulations of the adjoining municipality in considering application for variances under this article. 
(Code 1984, § 10.08(4)) 
Sec. 78-125. - Denial. 
    Variances may be denied by motion of the council, and such motion shall constitute a finding and determination that the conditions required for approval do not exist. No application for a variance which has been denied wholly or in part shall be resubmitted for a period of six months from the date of the order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of change of conditions found to be valid by the planning commission. 
(Code 1984, § 10.08(5)) 
Sec. 78-126. - Failure of the board to act. 
    If no recommendation is transmitted by the board of appeals and adjustments within 60 days after referral of the application for variance to the board, the council may take action without further awaiting such recommendation. 
(Code 1984, § 10.08(6)) 
Sec. 78-127. - Violation of conditions. 
    A violation of any condition set forth in granting a variance shall be a violation of this chapter and automatically terminates the variance. 
(Code 1984, § 10.08(7)) 
Sec. 78-128. - Expiration. 
    Variances shall expire one year after the date of council approval if not used and an extension has not been granted. Any change in use of the property shall require a new variance. In no case shall more than three, one year extensions be granted. 
(Code 1984, § 10.08(8); Ord. No. 80 3rd series, § 1, 11-22-2010; Ord. No. 153 3rd series, § 2, 8-10-2015) 
Sec. 78-129. - Extension. 
    Extensions may be granted by either city staff or the city council pursuant to the following: 
(a)  (1)  An extension of up to one year may be granted by city staff upon the applicant's request, provided that the request is made at least 60 calendar days before the expiration of the variance. If an extension is granted, the variance shall expire at the end of the extension period unless the applicant applies to the city council for an additional one-year extension. 
(2)  If city staff denies an applicant's request for an extension, the applicant may request an extension from the city council. The city council may grant an extension of up to one year. If an extension is granted, the variance shall expire at the end of the extension period unless the applicant applies to the city council for an additional one-year extension. 
(b)  The city council may grant an additional extension at the expiration of an extension granted by either city staff or the city council upon the applicant's request, provided that the request is made at least 60 calendar days before the expiration of the variance extension. 
(c)  The terms and conditions applicable to a variance at the time of its original approval continue to apply when an extension is granted by either city staff or the city council. Upon receiving a request for an extension, neither city staff nor the city council may alter or amend any of the terms and conditions applicable to the variance or condition the granting of an extension on alteration or amendment of any of the terms or conditions applicable to the variance.

DIVISION 9. - RS SEASONAL RECREATIONAL DISTRICT[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Cross reference- Parks and recreation, ch. 22. 

Sec. 78-561. - Purpose. 
    The RS seasonal recreational district is intended to provide a district which will allow a low-density seasonal form of residential development or recreational activity on the three Lake Minnetonka islands within the city. Big Island, Mahpiyata Island and Deering Island are totally surrounded by water. Special problems exist because of their isolated location and because there is no direct access by land or bridge. Transportation is difficult, dangerous and slow, especially in fall or spring when the ice is forming or melting. Engineering, financial, administrative and practical difficulties prevent servicing the islands with sewer or water utilities, garbage collection, or complete police, fire, medical emergency or other municipal services. The islands have historically been used for summer cabins, camping spots, temporary boat landings and a disabled veterans' summer camp. As long as this usage remains minimal, public health and safety is reasonably maintained. But development forecasts indicate increasing pressures for more intensive usage that could easily exceed the city's public service capabilities. For these reasons, the city's comprehensive plans have long-established policies encouraging eventual public ownership of the islands as recreational resources for general lake users. In addition, limited private seasonal recreational use would be allowed to continue indefinitely, subject to strict conformance with special health and safety standards. The RS district is established to implement these special planning policies. 
(Code 1984, § 10.31(1)) 
Sec. 78-562. - Future amendments. 
    The RS district regulations represent an innovative attempt to solve the unique problems relating to historic use and previously platted substandard lots on the islands while at the same time assuring the property owners of continued reasonable use of their property. It may be found by subsequent city councils that this division was not restrictive enough to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and that new development potential granted to property owners by this division may have to be modified. Therefore, no new development rights granted by this division shall be deemed to be vested property rights but shall remain subject to future modification by the city. 
(Code 1984, § 10.31(19)) 
Sec. 78-563. - Nonconformities. 
(a)  Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  No new use of land or structures shall be permitted in the RS district except in compliance with this division. All existing uses of land or structures which may be made nonconforming by adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived shall be discontinued and/or made to be in full compliance with all use and performance standard requirements of this division within a period of seven years from the date of adoption, not to extend later than January 1, 1990. 
(2)  Upon notice of record lot classification pursuant to section 78-568(1) and within six months of January 13, 1983, any record lot owner may apply to the council with no application fee required for a variance to this section to allow a continued nonconforming use, subject to reasonable standards and timetables, established by the council for compliance with on-site sewage treatment, private security, private fire protection and other performance standard requirements established by this division. The applicant shall demonstrate and the council shall find that the use is and was legally existing as of November 9, 1981, the effective date of moratorium Ordinance No. 238. Failure to apply for such a variance within the time allowed shall be prima facie evidence that such a nonconforming use was either illegal or did not lawfully exist on that date. 
(b)  Nonconforming substandard properties. Restrictions applying to nonconforming uses shall not apply to record lots which are substandard in lot area or lot width but which are being used in conformance with this division: 
(1)  Record lots which are less than 2.0 acres in dry-buildable lot area and/or less than 200 feet in lot width became substandard lots on January 1, 1975, the effective date of Ordinance No. 172. 
(2)  Record lots, which are greater than 2.0 acres in dry-buildable lot area, but are less than 5.0 acres in dry-buildable lot area, became substandard lots on January 13, 1983. 
(3)  Substandard record lots may be used or developed pursuant to section 78-72(c). 
(c)  Nonconforming substandard buildings or structures. Restrictions applying to nonconforming uses shall not apply to existing buildings or structures which do not conform to location, height or hard cover limitations, but which are being used in conformance with this division. Existing buildings not conforming to the required minimum setbacks may continue to be used, repaired or maintained within the existing building envelope. These buildings may be enlarged vertically or horizontally within the required yard area without requiring a council-approved setback variance, provided: 
(1)  The addition conforms to all required setbacks, even if parts of the existing building do not. 
(2)  The addition extends an existing building line by not more than 20 feet and does not further encroach or reduce any required setback dimension less than already exists. 
(3)  The addition within the required setback area contains not more than 200 square feet, or 50 percent of the total existing building area, whichever is less. 
(4)  There shall be no setback exceptions permitted for addition to or enlargement of any accessory building or structure. 
(5)  There shall be no setback exceptions permitted that reduce any required setback to less than ten feet. 
(6)  There shall be no setback exceptions permitted for any horizontal building addition or hard cover increase of any kind within 75 feet of the shoreline or within a required wetland buffer or buffer setback. 
(7)  There shall be no setback exceptions permitted without a council-approved variance in cases where any existing building is being replaced by a new building, or where the proposed addition, remodeling and/or renovation work constitutes 50 percent or more of the assessor's fair market value for the existing building. In these situations, the new work shall conform to all required setbacks. 
(8)  The exceptions authorized by this section apply only to setback requirements and do not authorize variance of any lot area, hard cover, building height, building area or any other zoning or building code performance standard. 
(Code 1984, § 10.31(16)-(18); Ord. No. 28 3rd series, § 12, 8-22-2005; Ord. No. 92 3rd series, § 2, 3-26-2012) 
Sec. 78-564. - Permitted uses. 
    Within any RS seasonal recreational district, no land or structures shall be used except for any one of the following uses: 
(1)  Gardens. 
(2)  One-family detached dwellings used for seasonal recreational use not to exceed 180 days in any one year, and not to be the owner's principal residence for homestead tax credit purposes. 
(3)  One-family, seasonal recreational use of land without structures, or with accessory structures only, such as tent camping or day use only. Accessory structures permitted on land without a principal structure shall be limited to one or more of the following: 
a.  Docks conforming to city and LMCD code requirements. 
b.  Not more than one storage building not to exceed 120 square feet in area. 
c.  Fire rings or barbeque pits.

Sec. 78-565. - Conditional uses. 
    Within any RS seasonal recreational district, no land or structures shall be used for the following uses except by conditional use permit: 
(1)  Principal dwellings. One-family detached dwellings used or occupied for 181 days or more in any one year, or any dwelling regardless of the duration of use for which the owner wishes to claim a principal residence homestead tax credit. A conditional use permit may be issued for such nonseasonal dwelling use, provided the applicant demonstrates and the council finds that the property is large enough to be permanently self-supporting in terms of water supply and sewage treatment, and that extra private precautions are taken for fire protection and security of persons and property, as follows: 
a.  The minimum dry buildable record lot area required for approval of a principal dwelling conditional use permit without a variance shall be 5.0 acres. Approval of a principal dwelling conditional use permit on an existing record lot of less than 5.0 acres shall be subject to strict showing of compliance with health and sanitation performance standards. 
b.  An on-site sewage treatment system shall be provided in conformance with the requirements of section 78-574. 
c.  A domestic water well shall be provided which conforms to current state health department regulations for depth, for setback from lake, wetland and sewage treatment system components, and which is capable of supplying domestic fire protection.

(2)  Guest cabins. Accessory separate dwellings or sleeping quarters containing indoor toilet and/or kitchen facilities located on the same lot, parcel or property as a permitted seasonal dwelling or as a conditionally permitted principal dwelling. A conditional use permit may be issued for one or more private guest cabins, provided the applicant demonstrates and the council finds that the additional living or sleeping facilities will not contribute to overcrowding or overuse of a small property or will not adversely affect neighboring properties, and that extra private precautions are taken for fire protection and security of persons and property, as follows: 
a.  Private guest cabins shall be used solely by the occupants of the seasonal or principal dwelling, including their domestic employees, caretakers or nonpaying guests. Private guest cabins shall not be rented or leased for compensation.

Use of more than one accessory building for additional sleeping quarters, or use of an accessory building in excess of 600 square feet in floor area, shall require issuance of a conditional use permit and compliance with the provisions of subsection (2) of this section. 
(3)  Day-use recreation areas. Land or structures owned or used by any private club, association or group of unrelated individuals as a regular meeting place for group activities, including without limitation boating activities, swimming, fishing, picnicking, athletic fields, nature trails and other day use.

Sec. 78-567. - Permit for private improvements within public rights-of-way. 
    It is unlawful for any person to alter, improve or use for private purposes in any RS district any platted public right-of-way, any platted public park, or any other property owned by the city without first obtaining a permit from the council, as follows: 
(1)  Inland property access. Persons desiring access to property located inland and not abutting the shoreline may apply for a permit to privately use and/or improve platted public right-of-way for such purpose. The permit applicant shall demonstrate and the council shall find that there is no reasonable alternative access available, and that the proposed improvements and/or type of use would not unreasonably affect other properties abutting the right-of-way. The council may approve, deny or place restrictions on any such permit based upon public health, safety and welfare considerations, including without limitation the configuration of adjoining record lots, the location, width, topography, drainage and vegetation on the right-of-way and the number of existing or future property owners who may require access at the same location. Any land alterations or improvements approved shall be the minimum amount necessary to provide reasonable inland access. 
(2)  Land alterations. Grading or physical alteration of any platted public right-of-way for any purpose, including inland property access, is prohibited except when such work has been specifically authorized as part of a permit issued by the council. The permit applicant shall provide a detailed land survey of the right-of-way and appropriate engineering drawings sufficient to identify the full extent of all proposed work. Permit approval shall be subject to obtaining a grading permit from city staff; and land alterations involving filling and grading shall be performed with only clean fill, and all other permits as may be required by other agencies having jurisdiction. Public rights-of-way so improved shall be maintained by the licensee. 
(3)  Dockage on right-of-way. Installing, maintaining, keeping or using a private dock on any platted public right-of-way for any purpose, including inland property access, is prohibited except when such dock has been specifically authorized as part of a permit issued by the council. Not more than one seasonal dock will be approved for access to any one property. In review and approval or denial of such permit, the council shall consider the width and topography of the right-of-way, the number of property owners requesting dockage at that location, the plan of the proposed dock, and conformance with city and Lake Minnetonka Conservation District dock regulations. The council may establish reasonable standards or requirements in approving any such dock permit. 
(4)  Encroachments prohibited. No private property, buildings, structures, fences, boats, vehicles, dock parts, junk or debris shall be built, stored, parked or kept at any time within any platted public right-of-way, within any platted public park, or on any other property owned by the city except as specifically authorized by a permit issued under this section. 
(5)  Permit exceptions. No permit shall be required for any person to walk on or over any platted public right-of-way or any platted public park when such use is made without altering the natural state of the land. No permit shall be required for any person whose property abuts a platted public right-of-way or a platted public park to control weeds or brush, seed, sod, mow or otherwise maintain the right-of-way or park in a neat and presentable manner. Persons whose record lot established by section 78-568 consists of tax parcels divided by platted, unopened public right-of-way may incorporate and use such right-of-way as part of their yard without a permit, provided no permanent structures are erected or maintained within the right-of-way. 
(6)  Public use limited. Any permit issued under this section shall be deemed to open the platted public right-of-way only to the extent necessary as established in the permit, and for the limited use of the permittee and his invitees. 
(7)  Permit limitations. A permit issued under this section shall not grant or vest any property rights to use of the public right-of-way or other public property, or in any improvements. Permits issued under this section shall be valid for one year, shall be subject to change, alteration or revocation for cause by the council at any time, and shall be automatically renewable on the anniversary of the date of issuance except upon written notice from the city to the permittee at least 30 days prior to the anniversary date. 
(8)  Hold harmless. As a condition of issuance of any permit, the applicant shall in writing release, indemnify and hold harmless the city from any and all claims or causes of action arising out of the use or alteration of the platted right-of-way by applicant or his invitees. 
(9)  Permit hearing and notice. The planning commission or the council shall hold a public hearing or hearings on each application for a permit as required by section 78-48.

Sec. 78-568. - Lot area requirements. 
    Within any RS seasonal recreational district, no new lot or parcel shall be created less than 5.0 acres in dry-buildable lot area exclusive of any wetlands. Within any RS seasonal recreational district, the following provisions shall govern the buildability, use and/or subdivision of each existing record lot: 
(1)  Record lot definition. For purposes of the RS seasonal recreational district, a "record lot" shall mean all the contiguous or abutting land owned in common by the same person or persons as of November 9, 1981, or at any time such common ownership may occur thereafter, including one or more separately platted lots or unplatted parcels of land, and/or one or more separately identified tax parcels. Because of the unique circumstances and actual use patterns existing on the islands, also included within the definition of a "record lot" is commonly owned land that is contiguous except for being separated only by platted unopened public right-of-way. Each record lot shall be considered in its entirety to be one lot for zoning purposes. 
a.  The effective date for determination of common ownership is November 9, 1981, the date of adoption of Ordinance No. 238, establishing a moratorium on development, including land subdivision, on the Lake Minnetonka Islands. Common ownership as of that date has been and shall be determined by the deeds of record at the county recorder's office. This definition shall not preclude the city from recognizing or enforcing the common ownership/lot of record provisions of Ordinance No. 172, or any other similar prior ordinance. 
b.  The council has identified and establishes 69 record lots on Big Island, Mahpiyata Island and Deering Island as listed by record lot number in the left-hand column of subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this section. Each such record lot shall include all land identified by all tax parcel property identification numbers (PIDs) grouped together following the record lot number. 
c.  Within 60 days after January 13, 1983, the owner of each record lot shall be notified in writing at his last recorded address of the classification of each record lot, including all tax parcels determined to be included in such record lot. All existing uses in the RS district are identified in the record lot inventory, subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this section, and all such uses have been deemed to be seasonal in nature. The notice shall provide that in order to receive the benefits of the automatic lot area variances granted by subsections (6) and (8) of this section, the owner shall on a form provided by the city acknowledge the record lot and shall apply for combination of all separate tax parcels pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. Any record lot owner may appeal the record lot classification or use determination to the council with no application fee required within six months of the effective date of this division. The record lot inventory shall be considered accurate and final for all properties except those found on appeal to have a demonstrable cause for change or adjustment. 
d.  Notice of record lot establishment shall be filed by the city in the chain of title of each property. 
e.  Future changes in tax parcel property identification numbers caused by combination of parcels for tax purposes or for any other reason shall not alter the establishment of record lots. New record lots shall be created only by council approved subdivisions pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, or by combination of two or more complete record lots. 
(2)  Tax parcel combination required. No new building permit, variance or conditional use permit shall be issued for any purpose on any record lot composed of two or more tax parcels unless the owner of such record lot shall apply for a formal combination of all commonly owned property into one parcel. If contiguous, all property shall be combined into one tax parcel. If separated by public right-of-way, a special lot combination form shall be executed and filed in the chain of title of each separate parcel. 
(3)  Subdivision of record lots. All record lots established in this section shall be continued in common ownership and shall not be subdivided, sold in parts, reduced in area, leased or otherwise separated without application for and council approval of a subdivision in accordance with chapter 82. Such subdivisions will normally be approved and additional new record lots created only if all resulting lots are each 5.0 acres of dry-buildable lot area or more. No existing record lot shall be divided or reduced in area to less than 5.0 acres of dry-buildable lot area, except as follows: 
a.  Lot line rearrangements between abutting properties that do not create an additional building site will normally be approved. 
b.  Separation of platted lots divided by public rights-of-way may be approved provided the separated lot is combined with other abutting property to enlarge the property without necessarily creating an additional substandard building site. 
(4)  Subdividable record lot inventory . Record lots 1 through 4 inclusive are established, each of which is determined to have a dry-buildable lot area in excess of 10.0 acres per owner. Therefore, each of record lots 1 through 4 inclusive may be subdivided into two or more lots in conformance with the minimum lot area requirements of this section, subject to subdivision application and approval pursuant to subsection (3) of this section and to chapter 82. Record lots are identified by record lot number on the official record lot map and listing on file with the city clerk, and each includes all property identified thereafter by the listed tax parcel property identification numbers. 
(5)  Conforming record lot inventory . Record lots 1 through 7 inclusive are established, each of which is determined to have a dry-buildable lot area of 5.0 acres or more per owner. Therefore, each of record lots 1 through 7 inclusive are in conformance with the minimum lot area requirements of this section, and may be used for any one-family permitted or conditional use in the RS district, subject to all performance standards and approvals required, including tax parcel combination pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. Record lots are identified by record lot number on the official record lot map and listing on file with the city clerk, and each includes all property identified thereafter by the listed tax parcel property identification numbers. 
(6)  Substandard buildable record lot inventory . Record lots 8 through 62 inclusive are established, each of which is determined to have a dry-buildable lot area of less than 5.0 acres per owner, which lot area is substandard pursuant to the minimum lot area requirements of this section. Record lots 8 through 62 inclusive may be developed only in accordance with section 78-72(c). Record lots are identified by record lot number on the official record lot map and listing on file with the city clerk, and each includes all property identified thereafter by the listed tax parcel property identification numbers. 
(7)  Substandard unbuildable record lot inventory . Record lots 63 through 70 inclusive are established, each of which is approximately one-third acre in area or smaller, which lot area is too small to accommodate any form of new permanent use without available services such as municipal sewer. One-family seasonal recreational use without structures pursuant to section 78-564(2) shall be permitted subject to strict compliance with all on-site sewage treatment performance standard requirements for the RS district. Record lots 63 through 70 inclusive may be developed only in accordance with section 78-72(c). Record lots are identified by record lot number on the official record lot map and listing on file with the city clerk, and each includes all property identified thereafter by the listed tax parcel property identification numbers. 
(8)  Substandard unbuildable record lot exception. Any new record lot resulting from future combination for ownership and tax purposes of any two or more adjacent record lots listed in subsection (2) of this section with each other and/or with another vacant or undeveloped record lot, which total dry-buildable acreage meets or exceeds one-half acre, will be recognized by the council as a buildable lot as if it had been listed under subsection (6) of this section. Each such new record lot may be developed in accordance with section 78-72(c) on the official record lot map and listing on file with the city clerk.

Sec. 78-569. - Lot width requirements. 
    Within any RS seasonal recreational district, no new lot or parcel shall be created less than 200 feet in width measured at the shoreline and at the building site. No existing lot of record shall be reduced by any lot line rearrangement to less than 50 feet in width measured at the shoreline and at the building site.

Sec. 78-626. - Development standards. 
    Within the RPUD district all development shall be in compliance with the following: 
(1)  Minimum area; shoreland district limitation. Each site proposed for rezoning to RPUD shall have a minimum area of five acres, excluding areas within a designated wetland, floodplain or shoreland district or right-of-way, unless the council finds the existence of one of the following: 
a.  Unusual physical features of the property itself or of the surrounding neighborhood such that development as a RPUD will conserve a physical or topographic feature of importance to the neighborhood or community. 
b.  The property is directly adjacent to or across a public street from property which has been developed previously as a RPUD or planned residential development and will be perceived as and will function as an extension of that previously approved development. 
c.  The property is located in an area where the proposed development provides a transition between a commercial or industrial area and an existing residential area or on an intermediate or principal arterial as defined in the comprehensive plan. 
d.  The property contains steep slopes or a substantial number of significant trees that could be preserved through the clustering of buildings or other design techniques not generally allowed by the existing zoning district. 
No property located within 250 feet of the ordinary high water level (OHWL) of a protected lake or tributary as defined in article IX of this chapter shall be rezoned to RPUD. However, for a property that is partially located less than 250 feet from the OHWL and partially located more than 250 feet from the OHWL, the portion located more than 250 feet from the OHWL may be rezoned to RPUD at the discretion of the city council when all other requirements are met. 
(2)  Uses. Each property rezoned to RPUD shall only be used for the use or uses for which the site is designated in the comprehensive plan, except that the city may permit rezoning to RPUD on a site designated for commercial use if the city council finds that such use is in the best interests of the city and is consistent with the requirements of this division. If a commercial site is to be rezoned to RPUD, the city may forward a copy of the request to the metropolitan council for review. 
(3)  Sewer availability. A site proposed to be rezoned to RPUD with proposed density greater than one unit per two acres must be in the metropolitan urban services area (MUSA) and must be serviced by municipal sewer. 
(4)  Density. Each development in the RPUD district shall have a density within the range specified in the comprehensive plan for the specific site. If the site is not designated in the comprehensive plan for residential use, the appropriate density shall be determined by the city based upon the city council's finding that such density is consistent with the intent of this division and of the comprehensive plan. Developments with proposed densities in excess of the densities contemplated in the comprehensive plan shall be allowed only on properties which are currently zoned and guided for commercial use, in order to maintain the character and integrity of the areas zoned and guided for residential use. 
(5)  Incentives. The city may utilize incentives to encourage the construction of projects which are consistent with the city's housing goals. Incentives may include modification of density (only for properties currently zoned and guided for commercial use) and floor area ratio requirements for developments providing lifecycle housing and affordable and moderate cost housing. Incentives for affordable and moderate cost housing may be approved by the city only after the developer and city have entered into an agreement to ensure that the low and moderate cost units remain available to persons of low and moderate income for at least 20 years. 
(6)  Floor area ratio . Floor area ratios (FARs) shall be limited per the following table: 
Comprehensive Plan Designation Maximum Floor Area Ratio* Low or medium density residential (up to 50 and including 6.0 units per acre) 0.5 High density residential (in excess of 6.0 units per acre) 1.0  
*FAR = Total Building Floor Area/Total Lot Area 
Individual lots within a development in the RPUD district may exceed these standards as long as the average meets these standards. 
(7)  Development standards for attached and multifamily dwelling structures. Each site rezoned to RPUD and developed for attached or multiple-family dwelling uses shall be subject to the following standards: 
a.  Setbacks and separation of uses. Within the RPUD district the setback for all attached and multifamily dwelling buildings and their accessory buildings from any bordering or abutting street line shall be 35 feet for local streets and 50 feet from railroad lines or collector or arterial streets, as designated in the comprehensive plan, except that in no case shall the setback be less than the height of the building. The setback for all buildings from exterior RPUD site lot lines not abutting a public street shall be 35 feet, except that in no case shall the setback be less than the height of the building. Building setbacks from internal public streets shall be determined by the city based on characteristics of the specific RPUD site. Parking lots and driving lanes shall be set back at least 20 feet from all exterior lot lines of a RPUD site. The setback for parking structures, including decks and ramps, shall be 35 feet from local streets and 50 feet from all other street classifications, except that in no case shall the setback be less than the height of the structure. Parking structure setbacks from external lot lines shall be 50 feet or the height of the structure, whichever is greater, when adjacent to residential properties; 35 feet, when adjacent to nonresidential properties. Parking structure setbacks from internal public or private streets shall be determined by the city based on characteristics of the specific RPUD site. Where industrial uses abut developed or platted single-family lots outside the RPUD site, greater exterior building and parking setbacks may be required in order to provide effective screening. The city council shall make a determination regarding the adequacy of screening proposed by the applicant. Screening may include the use of natural topography or earth berming, existing and proposed plantings and other features, such as roadways and wetlands, which provide separation of uses. Property rezoned to RPUD shall be considered a residential district for purposes of determining building and parking setback requirements on adjacent high density residential, commercial and industrial property outside the RPUD. 
b.  Height limitations. For properties guided for residential use in the comprehensive plan, a building height limit of 30 feet shall apply. For properties currently zoned or guided in the comprehensive plan for commercial use, height may exceed 30 feet but shall not exceed three stories (not including underground parking level) and shall maintain a residential character by incorporating pitched or hipped roof structure. No mansard or flat roofed multiple-family building will be allowed. 
c.  Outside storage limitations. Building materials, recreational vehicles, boats, RV's, snowmobiles, and other items of personal property shall not be stored outside within any site used for attached or multifamily uses. 
(8)  Development standards for single-family detached dwellings in the RPUD district. Each RPUD site developed for single-family detached dwellings at medium density (i.e., densities ranging from one unit per acre to six units per acre) shall be subject to the following standards: 
a.  Permitted locations: in areas of the city where smaller single-family detached dwelling lots will allow for clustering to preserve significant natural features, or in areas where a mixture of higher density attached dwellings and lower density detached single-family dwellings will result in a development that does not exceed the overall guided density. 
b.  Minimum SFR lot size: 15,000 square feet. 
c.  Minimum lot width at the setback line: 90 feet. 
d.  Minimum lot depth: 125 feet. 
e.  Minimum front yard setback: 25 feet on internal streets within the RPUD site. On exterior or through streets a setback of 35 feet must be provided on local streets and a 50-foot setback on collector or arterial streets, as defined in the comprehensive plan. 
f.  Minimum side yard setback: ten feet along interior lot lines; 15 feet on lot lines along the exterior of the RPUD site. Side yards abutting streets must meet the minimum front yard setbacks as noted in subsection (8)e of this section. Structures in side yards abutting another residential zoning district shall meet the side yard setback requirement of the adjacent zoning district. 
g.  Rear yard setback: minimum of 40 feet or 20 percent of the depth of the lot, whichever is less. 
h.  Building height: maximum of 30 feet. 
i.  All dwelling units, including manufactured homes, shall have a depth of at least 20 feet for at least 50 percent of their width. All dwelling units, including manufactured homes, shall have a width of at least 20 feet for at least 50 percent of their depth. 
j.  All dwellings shall have a permanent foundation in conformance with the state building code. 
k.  Accessory structures shall conform to the setbacks established for principal structures, except as follows: 
1.  All accessory structures located more than ten feet from a principal structure may be located a minimum of ten feet from a rear or side lot line when that line does not abut a street right-of-way. 
2.  No accessory structure shall be located closer to the front lot line than the principal structure, regardless of the principal structure setback. 
l.  No accessory structure shall occupy more than 30 percent of the side or rear yard in which it is located, nor exceed 1,000 square feet in area, nor exceed 12 feet in height. 
m.  Off-street parking shall be provided for at least two vehicles for each single-family dwelling. A suitable location for a garage measuring at least 20 feet by 24 feet without a variance shall be provided and indicated as such on a site plan or certified site plan to be submitted when applying for a building permit to construct a new dwelling or alter an existing garage. 
(9)  More than one building allowed. More than one building may be placed on one platted or recorded lot in a RPUD site. 
(10)  Single housing type permitted. Any RPUD development which involves a single housing type shall be permitted, provided that it is otherwise consistent with the objectives of this division and the comprehensive plan. 
(11)  Private recreational area. Each RPUD development shall provide a minimum of ten percent of the gross project area in private recreational uses for project residents. Such area shall be for active or passive recreational uses suited to the needs of the residents of the project, including swimming pools, trails, nature areas, picnic areas, tot lots and saunas. Private recreational area requirements are in addition to the standard park dedication requirements. 
(12)  Ownership. All property to be included within a RPUD development shall be under unified ownership or control, or subject to such legal restrictions or covenants as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the approved master development plan and final site and building plan. 
(13)  Signage. Signs shall be restricted to those which are permitted in a sign plan approved by the city and shall be regulated by permanent covenants. 
(14)  Landscaping, screening and buffering. 
a.  Landscape plan requirements. Landscape plans shall be prepared by a landscape architect or other qualified person acceptable to the city, drawn to the scale of not less than one inch equals 50 feet and shall show the following: 
1.  Boundary lines of the property with accurate dimensions; 
2.  Locations of existing and proposed buildings, parking lots, roads, trails and other improvements; 
3.  Proposed grading plan with two-foot contour intervals;

10.  Details and cross sections of all required screening. 
b.  Minimum landscaping requirements. 
1.  All open areas of a lot which are not used or improved for required parking areas, drives, trails or storage shall be landscaped with a combination of deciduous and coniferous species, including overstory trees, understory trees, shrubs, flowers and groundcover materials. The plan for landscaping shall include ground cover, bushes, shrubbery, trees, sculpture, foundations, decorative walks or other similar site design features or materials in a quantity having a minimum value in conformance with the following table: 
Minimum Tree and Shrub Requirements Vegetation Type Size Quantity Overstory deciduous trees 2.5-inch bb (Caliper) One tree per 1,000 gross square feet of building footprint area or one tree per 40 lineal feet of site perimeter, whichever is greater. Coniferous trees 6-foot height bb Minimum of 30 percent of required overstory trees must be coniferous Understory shrubs 3-gal. potted or 18-inch One shrub per 300 gross square feet of building footprint area or one shrub per 30 lineal feet of site perimeter, whichever is greater. Ornamental deciduous trees 1.5-inch bb (Caliper) Not required; but two ornamental deciduous trees may be substituted for one required overstory deciduous tree (maximum substitution equals 25 percent of required overstory deciduous trees) Credits for existing trees: The city council shall have sole discretion whether credit shall be granted for existing healthy trees  
In instances where healthy plant materials of acceptable species exist on a site prior to its development, the application of the standards in subsection (14)b of this section may be adjusted by the city to allow credit for such material, provided that such adjustment is consistent with the intent of this division. 
2.  A reasonable attempt shall be made to preserve as many existing trees as is practicable and to incorporate them into the site plan. 
3.  All new overstory trees shall be balled and burlapped or moved from the growing site by tree spade. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum caliper of 21/2 inches. Coniferous trees shall be a minimum of six feet in height. Ornamental trees shall have a minimum caliper of 11/2 inches. 
4.  All site areas not covered by buildings, sidewalks, parking lots, driveways, trails, patios, or similar hardcover shall be covered with sod or an equivalent ground cover approved by the city. This requirement shall not apply to site areas retained in a natural state. 
5.  In order to provide for adequate maintenance of landscaped areas, an underground sprinkler system shall be provided as part of each new development, except one- and two-family dwellings and additions to existing structures which do not at least equal the floor area of the existing structure. A sprinkler system shall be provided for all landscaped areas, except areas to be preserved in a natural state. 
6.  Not more than 50 percent of the required number of trees shall be composed of one species. The city shall maintain a list of prohibited species, which shall not be used for landscaping. 
c.  Interior parking lot landscaping. 
1.  All parking lots containing over 100 stalls shall be designed to incorporate unpaved, landscaped islands in number and dimension as required by the city. All landscape islands shall contain a minimum of 180 square feet. Islands which are necessary to promote the safe and efficient flow of traffic shall not be subject to the 100-stall standard and shall be required by the city when warranted. 
2.  Parking lot landscape areas, including landscape islands, shall be reasonably distributed throughout the parking lot area so as to break up expanses of paved areas. Parking lot landscape areas shall be provided with deciduous shade trees, ornamental or evergreen trees, plus ground cover, mulch and/or shrubbery as determined appropriate by the planning commission. Parking lot landscape trees shall be provided at the rate of one tree for each 15 surface parking spaces provided, or major fraction thereof. Parking lot landscaping shall be contained in planting beds bordered by a raised concrete curb or equivalent approved by the planning commission. 
d.  Maintenance of landscaping. The owner, tenant and their respective agents shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping in a condition presenting a healthy, neat and orderly appearance and free from refuse and debris. Plants and ground cover which are required by an approved site or landscape plan, and which have died, shall be replaced within three months of notification by the city. However, the time for compliance may be extended up to nine months by the city in order to allow for seasonal or weather conditions. 
e.  Retaining walls. Retaining walls exceeding four feet in height, and staged walls which cumulatively exceed 16 feet in height or involve more than four tiers, must be constructed in accordance with plans prepared by a registered engineer or landscape architect. 
f.  Landscaping performance security required. When screening, landscaping or other similar improvements to property are required by this division, a letter of credit shall be supplied by the owner in an amount equal to at least 11/2 times the value of such screening, landscaping or other improvements. The letter of credit shall be conditioned upon reimbursement of all expenses incurred by the city for engineering, legal, contracting or other fees in connection with making or completing such improvements. The letter of credit shall be provided prior to the issuance of any building permit and shall be valid for a period of time equal to two full growing seasons after the date of installation of the landscaping. The city may accept some other form of security in lieu of a letter of credit in an amount and under such conditions that the city may determine to be appropriate. If construction of the project is not completed within the time prescribed by building permits and other approvals, the city may, at its option, complete the work required at the expense of the owner and the surety. The city may allow an extended period of time for completion of all landscaping, if the delay is due to conditions which are reasonably beyond the control of the developer. Extensions, which may not exceed nine months, may be granted due to seasonal or weather conditions. When an extension is granted, the city shall require such additional security as it deems appropriate. 
g.  Screening and buffering. 
1.  The following uses shall be screened or buffered in accordance with the requirements of this section: 
i.  Principal buildings and structures and any building or structure accessory thereto used for residential uses at a density of greater than four units per acre shall be buffered from residential lots located in any R district. 
ii.  Off-street parking facilities containing six or more spaces shall be buffered from streets located within 50 feet. Parking facilities shall be buffered with landscape zones. 
iii.  Loading docks shall be screened from all lot lines and public roads. 
iv.  Trash storage facilities shall be screened from all lot lines and public roads. 
v.  Access roads serving multifamily buildings shall be screened as necessary to eliminate the impact of vehicle headlights shining toward adjacent residential neighborhoods. 
2.  Required screening or buffering may be achieved with fences, walls, earth berms, hedges, or other landscape materials. All walls and fences shall be architecturally harmonious with the principal building. Earth berms shall not exceed a slope of 3:1. The screen shall be designed to employ materials which provide an effective visual barrier during all seasons. 
3.  All required screening or buffering shall be located on the lot occupied by the use, building, facility or structure to be screened. No screening or buffering shall be located on any public right-of-way or within eight feet of the traveled portion of any street or highway. 
4.  Screening or buffering required by subsection (14) of this section shall be of a height needed to accomplish the goals of subsection (14) of this section. Screening methods incorporating roofs over storage, trash or mechanical facilities to screen from higher adjacent properties or buildings may be required. Height of plantings required under subsection (14) of this section shall be measured at the time of installation. 
(15)  Architectural standards. 
a.  It is not the intent of the city to restrict design freedom unduly when reviewing project architecture in connection with a site and building plan. However, it is in the best interest of the city to promote high standards of architectural design and compatibility with surrounding structures and neighborhoods. Architectural plans shall be prepared by an architect or other qualified persons acceptable to the city and shall show the following for all structures other than single-family detached dwellings: 
1.  Elevations of all sides of the building. 
2.  Type and color of exterior building materials. 
3.  A typical floor plan. 
4.  Dimensions of all structures. 
5.  The location of trash and recycling containers and of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment. 
b.  Unadorned prestressed concrete panels, concrete block and unfinished metal shall not be permitted as exterior materials for residential principal and accessory buildings. This restriction shall apply to all principal structures and to all accessory buildings. The city may, at its discretion, allow architecturally enhanced block or concrete panels. 
c.  Accessory buildings shall be architecturally compatible with principal structures. 
d.  All rooftop or ground-mounted mechanical equipment and exterior trash and recycling storage areas shall be fully enclosed or screened so as to be not visible with materials compatible with the principal structure. 
e.  Underground utilities shall be provided for all new and substantially renovated structures (the term "substantially renovated" shall mean when the renovations exceed 30 percent of the prerenovation value of the structure). 
(16)  Flexibility. The uniqueness of each RPUD requires that specifications and standards for streets, utilities, public facilities and subdivisions may be subject to modification from the city ordinances ordinarily governing them. The city council may therefore approve streets, utilities, public facilities and land subdivisions which are not in compliance with usual specifications or ordinance requirements, if it finds that strict adherence to such standards or requirements is not required to meet the intent of this section or to protect the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the RPUD, the surrounding area or the city as a whole. 
(17)  Traffic studies. The city may require a traffic analysis to be prepared by a registered traffic engineer approved by the city to assess potential traffic impacts on local streets. If impacts on service levels of roadways and intersections are anticipated, the project will be approved only contingent upon a traffic management plan that adequately mitigates those impacts.

(f)  Simultaneous review. Applicants may combine the final site and building plan review with the master development plan review by submitting all information required for both stages simultaneously. 
(g)  Basis for approval; conditions. In evaluating a site and building plan, the planning commission and city council shall base their recommendations and actions regarding approval of a RPUD on a consideration of the following: 
(1)  Compatibility of the proposed plan with this section and consistency with the goals, policies, and objectives of the comprehensive plan and surface water management plan;

b.  The amount and location of open space and landscaping. 
c.  Materials, textures, colors and details of construction as an expression of the design concept and the compatibility of the same with the adjacent and neighboring structures and uses; and vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior drives and parking in terms of location and number access points to the public streets, width of interior drives and access points, general interior circulation, separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and arrangement and amount of parking. 
(4)  Promotion of energy conservation through design, location, orientation and elevation of structures, the use and location of glass in structures and the use of landscape materials and site grading; 
(5)  Protection of adjacent and neighboring properties through reasonable provisions for surface water drainage, sound and sight buffers, preservation of views, light and air and those aspects of design not adequately covered by other regulations which may have substantial effects on neighboring land uses; and 
(6)  Such other factors as the planning commission or city council deem relevant. 
The planning commission and city council may attach such conditions to their actions as they shall determine necessary or convenient to better accomplish the purposes of this section.

f.  Landscaping performance security required. When screening, landscaping or other similar improvements to property are required by this division, a letter of credit shall be supplied by the owner in an amount equal to at least 11/2 times the value of such screening, landscaping or other improvements. The letter of credit shall be conditioned upon reimbursement of all expenses incurred by the city for engineering, legal, contracting or other fees in connection with making or completing such improvements. The letter of credit shall be provided prior to the issuance of any building permit and shall be valid for a period of time equal to two full growing seasons after the date of installation of the landscaping. The city may accept some other form of security in lieu of a letter of credit in an amount and under such conditions that the city may determine to be appropriate. If construction of the project is not completed within the time prescribed by building permits and other approvals, the city may, at its option, complete the work required at the expense of the owner and the surety. The city may allow an extended period of time for completion of all landscaping if the delay is due to conditions which are reasonably beyond the control of the developer. Extensions, which may not exceed nine months, may be granted due to seasonal or weather conditions. When an extension is granted, the city shall require such additional security as it deems appropriate. 
g.  Screening and buffering. 
1.  The following uses shall be screened or buffered in accordance with the requirements of this section:

vi.  The light from automobile headlights and other sources shall be screened whenever it may be directed onto adjacent residential windows. 
2.  Required screening or buffering may be achieved with fences, walls, earth berms, hedges, or other landscape materials. All walls and fences shall be architecturally harmonious with the principal building. Earth berms shall not exceed a slope of 3:1. The screen shall be designed to employ materials which provide an effective visual barrier during all seasons. 
3.  All required screening or buffering shall be located on the lot occupied by the use, building, facility or structure to be screened. No screening or buffering shall be located on any public right-of-way or within eight feet of the traveled portion of any street or highway. 
4.  Screening or buffering required by subsection (8) of this section shall be of a height needed to accomplish the goals of subsection (8) of this section. Screening methods incorporating roofs over storage, trash or mechanical facilities to screen from higher adjacent properties or buildings may be required. Height of plantings required under subsection (8) of this section shall be measured at the time of installation. 
(9)  Architectural standards. 
a.  It is not the intent of the city to restrict design freedom unduly when reviewing project architecture in connection with a site and building plan. However, it is in the best interest of the city to promote high standards of architectural design and compatibility with surrounding structures and neighborhoods. Architectural plans shall be prepared by an architect or other qualified persons acceptable to the city and shall show the following for all structures in the B-6 district:

Sec. 78-821. - Purpose and review of building permit applications. 
(a)  General provisions. The purpose of the Industrial District is to permit and encourage the development of high quality industrial uses which are compatible with the aesthetic character of the city and to encourage the development of such industries that are able and willing to achieve superior standards of design and environmental protection. To this end, the city may find that improvements are required to a particular site which are greater than the minimum standards found as part of this district. 
(b)  Site plan review. All site reviews in any I-Industrial district shall be reviewed as set forth in article II, division 4 of this chapter. 
(c)  Determination of use. Whenever a proposed use is not clearly defined as to its inclusion in the list of permitted, conditional, or accessory uses in this district, the zoning administrator shall make a determination. The zoning administrator may refer the item to the city council for a final determination, if desired. 
(d)  Certificate of occupancy. Prior to occupancy of any building or premises within the I-Industrial district for which a building permit has been obtained, the applicant shall obtain a certificate of occupancy. As a part of this certificate, the applicant shall be required to demonstrate compliance with all of the terms of this division. 
(e)  Existing land uses. 
(1)  Any building or use that does not conform to the requirements of this division, existing prior to the passage of this division, shall be allowed to continue to operate in the same manner and to the same extent, subject to the requirements of article II, division 2 related to nonconforming uses and related matters. 
(2)  Where such changes increase the total usable floor area of an existing nonconforming building by less than 25 percent, a property owner may maintain the existing building in its nonconforming state. The requirements for bringing improvements into conformance shall also be applied to legal, nonconforming site improvements such as parking lots and landscaping. Such changes or additions may be made to coordinate with the existing building materials and design without meeting the requirements of this division. The 25 percent threshold shall be measured cumulatively from the date of the adoption of this division, and shall not be exceeded without applying the requirements of subsection 78-821(e)(3). 
(3)  Where such changes increase the total usable floor area of an existing nonconforming building by 25 percent or more, the property owner shall be required to bring the building and property into full conformance with this division. The requirements for bringing improvements into conformance shall also be applied to legal, nonconforming site improvements such as parking lots and landscaping. The 25 percent threshold shall be measured cumulatively from the date of the adoption of this division. 
(f)  All buildings in the I, Industrial District shall be required to be on platted lots. All changes to lot configuration shall require platting in accordance with chapter 82, article III, Orono Subdivision Regulations. No lot identified in whole or in part by a metes and bounds description shall be eligible for a building permit until a final plat has been approved and recorded for said lot.

(Ord. No. 32 3rd series, § 2, 3-27-2006; Ord. No. 94 3rd series, § 4, 9-24-2012; Ord. No. 173 3rd series, § 17, 6-27-2016) 
Sec. 78-826. - Building design and construction. 
(a)  General provisions. In addition to other restrictions of this chapter, the use, construction, alteration or enlargements to any buildings or structure within this district shall meet the following standards: 
(1)  Rooftop equipment: Rooftop equipment shall be screened from view from the ground at the property line with vertical extensions of the building walls or with parapets or other architectural design features of the same materials used on the walls of the building. Where the topography permits, it is desirable to screen such equipment from adjacent property, but it is not the intent of this requirement to increase the height of the screening significantly above that of the equipment in order to screen it from view from tall buildings or from higher ground. 
(2)  Form, scale and proportion: The form and proportion of buildings shall be consistent or compatible with the scale, form and proportion of existing development in the immediate area. 
(3)  Unusual buildings: The use of unusual shapes, color and other characteristics that cause new buildings to call excessive attention to themselves and create disharmony shall be avoided. 
(4)  Mass and voids: The rhythm of structural mass to voids, such as windows and glass doors, of a front facade should relate to the rhythms established in adjacent buildings. 
(5)  Long facades: Where large structures with overly-long facades (walls) are proposed, such as warehouses, building mass should be articulated with variations in the building plane and parapet height and through the use of other unique design or site plan features. 
(6)  Architectural design: Architectural design should create harmony through the use of different textures, complementary colors, shadow lines and contrasting shapes. The use of walls in a single color, with little detailing or completely blank is discouraged. 
(7)  Monotony: Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form and siting shall be used to provide visual interest. 
(8)  Roofs: Careful consideration of durable materials, proportions and shapes, emphasizing the importance of roofs as integral and embracing elements of the over-all design, is particularly important. 
(9)  Materials: Use of substantial amounts of high quality masonry materials (face brick, stucco, stone) is encouraged. Buildings shall be constructed with no less than 67 percent of these materials, excluding window and door areas. Architectural concrete panels and rock faced concrete block may comprise a maximum of 33 percent of the exterior materials used on the building. The 67 percent threshold may be reduced, or the 33 percent threshold exceeded, only by conditional use permit for alternative materials. The city council shall consider the architectural quality and whether the proposed building exceeds the various requirements of this section 78-826 in deciding whether or not to grant a conditional use permit for alternative materials. The use of aluminum siding, metal ribbed panels and extensive mirrored glass surfaces is discouraged except as accent materials. Evaluation of building materials shall be based on the quality of its design and relationship and compatibility to building materials in the immediate neighborhood. 
(10)  Design uniformity: Architectural treatments (e.g., building materials, colors, facade design, roof lines, screening) shall be consistent and compatible on all sides. Treatment that is uniform on all sides will be deemed to meet the requirements of this principle. Adjacent land uses, visibility from public streets and use of screening devices (walls, fences, berms, landscaping) are criteria to be considered when varying this treatment. The applicant will have the burden of demonstrating the reasons for differing treatment on different sides (e.g., the need for truck access on one side and pedestrian access on another). 
(Ord. No. 32 3rd series, § 2, 3-27-2006) 
Sec. 78-827. - Off-street parking.

State Law reference- Conditional use permits, Minn. Stat. § 462.3595. 

Sec. 78-911. - Purpose. 
    In order to give the district use regulation the flexibility necessary to achieve the objectives of this chapter, in certain districts, conditional uses are permitted, subject to the granting of a use permit. Conditional uses include those uses generally not suitable in a particular zoning district, but which may under some circumstances be suitable. When such circumstances exist, a conditional use permit may be granted. Conditions may be applied to issuance of the permit, and a periodic review of the permit may be required. The permit shall be issued for a particular use and not for a particular person. Because of their unusual characteristics, conditional uses require consideration so they may be located properly with respect to the objectives of this chapter and the comprehensive municipal plan and with respect to their effects on surrounding properties. In order to achieve these purposes, the council is empowered to grant and to deny applications for conditional use permits and to impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of these permits. 
(Code 1984, § 10.09(1)) 
Sec. 78-912. - Reference to planning commission. 
    Before the council may grant conditional use permits for such conditional uses as prescribed in the district regulations of this chapter, the request shall be referred to the planning commission for study concerning the effect of the proposed use on the ordinance and on the character and development of the neighborhood and for recommendation in regard to granting such conditional use and its conditions, if any, or for the denial of such conditional use. The council may by unanimous action waive reference to the planning commission. 
(Code 1984, § 10.09(2)) 
Sec. 78-913. - Application. 
    Whenever this chapter requires a conditional use permit, an application in writing may be filed with the zoning administrator, together with such filing fee as may be established by the council and shall be accompanied by a site plan and such information and showing as may be necessary or desirable, including but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Site plan drawn at scale dimensions with setbacks noted. 
(2)  Location of all buildings, heights and square footage. 
(3)  Curb cuts, driveways, parking spaces. 
(4)  Off-street loading areas. 
(5)  Drainage plan. 
(6)  Type of business, proposed number of employees by shift. 
(7)  Proposed floor plan with use indicated and building elevations. 
(8)  Sanitary sewer and water plan with estimated use per day. 
(9)  A lighting plan showing the lighting of parking area, walks, security lighting and driveway entrance light. 
(10)  A landscape plan with a schedule of the plantings. 
(11)  An abstractor's certified property certificate showing the property owners within 500 feet of the outer boundaries of the property in question. 
(Code 1984, § 10.09(3); Ord. No. 210 3rd series, § 13, 6-25-2018) 
Sec. 78-914. - Failure of planning commission to act. 
    If no recommendation is transmitted by the planning commission within 60 days after referral of the application for conditional use to the commission, the council may take action without further awaiting such recommendation. 
(Code 1984, § 10.09(4)) 
Sec. 78-915. - Hearings and notice. 
    The planning commission or council may hold a public hearing on each application for a conditional use permit as required by section 78-48. At the public hearing the planning commission or the council shall review the application and the statements and drawings submitted with the application and shall receive pertinent evidence concerning the proposed use and the proposed conditions under which it would be operated or maintained. Any party may appear at the hearing in person or by agent or attorney. Subject to such limitations as may be imposed by the council, the planning commission or the council may adopt rules for the conduct of proceedings before it. Such rules may include provisions for the giving of oaths to witnesses and the filing of written briefs by the parties. The city shall provide for a record of the proceedings, which shall include the minutes of the meetings, the findings, and the action taken on each matter heard, including the final action.

(13)  Designed to take into account the natural, scenic, and historic features of the area and to minimize environmental impact; 
(14)  All exterior lighting shall be so directed so as not to cast glare toward or onto the public right-of-way or neighboring residential uses or districts; and 
(15)  Not detrimental to the public health, public safety, or general welfare. 
(b)  A conditional use permit may be granted subject to such conditions as the council may prescribe. 
(c)  A conditional use permit shall remain in effect as long as the conditions imposed by the city council are observed, but nothing in this section shall prevent the city from enacting or amending official controls to change the status of conditional uses. 
(d)  A certified copy of any conditional use permit shall be filed with the county recorder or registrar of titles. The conditional use permit shall include the legal description of the property included. 
(Code 1984, § 10.09(6); Ord. No. 77 3rd series, § 1, 7-12-2010) 
Sec. 78-917. - Denial of permit. 
    The council shall set forth contemporaneously in writing and in detail all the reasons for the denial of the conditional use permit application. No application for a conditional use permit which has been denied wholly or in part shall be resubmitted for a period of six months from the date of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of changes of conditions found to be valid by the planning commission. 
(Code 1984, § 10.09(7)) 
Sec. 78-918. - Lapse of permit. 
    A conditional use permit shall lapse one year following the date on which it became effective unless prior to that time a building permit is issued by the building inspector and construction is commenced and pursued toward completion on the site which was the subject of the conditional use permit application. A conditional use permit may be renewed for an additional period of one year provided the request is filed prior to the expiration of one year from the date when the use permit is filed with the zoning administrator. The council may grant or deny an application for renewal of a conditional use permit. In no case shall more than three, one year extensions be granted. 
(Code 1984, § 10.09(8); Ord. No. 153 3rd series, § 4, 8-10-2015) 
Sec. 78-919. - Lapse of use. 
    Should a conditional use permit lapse or cease for a period of six months, future use shall be in conformance with the terms of this chapter unless such lapse or cessation is determined to be due to illness, natural disaster or acts of war.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE 

Sec. 78-1101. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of Orono, Minnesota, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 177 3rd series, § 1, 9-12-2016) 
Sec. 78-1102. - Purpose. 
(a)  This article regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the City of Orono. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions. 
(b)  National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This article is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(c)  This article is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development. 
(Ord. No. 177 3rd series, § 1, 9-12-2016) 
DIVISION 2. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 78-1103. - How to use this article. 
    This article adopts the floodplain maps applicable to the city and includes three floodplain districts: Floodway, flood fringe, and general floodplain. 
(1)  Where floodway and flood fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps, the standards in divisions 4 or 5 will apply, depending on the location of a property. 
(2)  Locations where floodway and flood fringe districts are not delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the general floodplain district. Within the general floodplain district, the floodway district standards in division 4 apply unless the floodway boundary is determined, according to the process outlined in division 6. Once the floodway boundary is determined, the flood fringe district standards in division 5 may apply outside the floodway. 
(3)  The use shall be permitted within the floodway district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other provision of this Code and provided all permits or authorizations are received as may be required by other provisions of this Code or regulation of other governmental agencies having jurisdiction, including without limitation, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District, and the Lake Minnetonka Conservation District. 
(Ord. No. 177 3rd series, § 1, 9-12-2016) 
Sec. 78-1104. - Lands to which article applies. 
    This article applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of Orono shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of the floodway, flood fringe, or general floodplain districts. 
(1)  The floodway, flood fringe and general floodplain districts are overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other requirements in this article. In case of a conflict, the more restrictive standards will apply. 
(Ord. No. 177 3rd series, § 1, 9-12-2016) 
Sec. 78-1105. - Incorporation of maps by reference. 
    The following maps together with all attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the official zoning map and this article.

Sec. 78-1106. - Regulatory flood protection elevation. 
    The regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) is an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
(Ord. No. 177 3rd series, § 1, 9-12-2016) 
Sec. 78-1107. - Interpretation. 
    The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by scaling distances on the flood insurance rate map. 
(1)  Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the official zoning map and actual field conditions, the flood elevations shall be the governing factor. The city administrator must interpret the boundary location based on the ground elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the regulatory floodplain, and other available technical data. 
(2)  Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a reasonable opportunity to present their appeal to the planning commission and to submit technical evidence. 
(Ord. No. 177 3rd series, § 1, 9-12-2016) 
Sec. 78-1108. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or other private agreements.

    Accessory use or structure means a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure. 
    Base flood elevation means the elevation of the "regional flood." The term "base flood elevation" is used in the flood insurance survey. 
    Basement means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level. 
    Conditional use means a specific type of structure or land use listed in the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that: 
(1)  Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist. 
(2)  The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood. 
    Critical facilities means facilities necessary to a community's public health and safety, those that store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials, and those that house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury. Examples of critical facilities include hospitals, correctional facilities, schools, daycare facilities, nursing homes, fire and police stations, wastewater treatment facilities, public electric utilities, water plants, fuel storage facilities, and waste handling and storage facilities. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Equal degree of encroachment means a method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows. 
    Farm fence means a fence as defined by Minn. Statutes § 344.02, subd. 1(a)-(d). An open type fence of posts and wire is not considered to be a structure under this article. Fences that have the potential to obstruct flood flows, such as chain link fences and rigid walls, are regulated as structures under this article. 
    Flood means a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM). 
    Flood frequency means the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded. 
    Flood fringe means the portion of the special flood hazard area (one percent annual chance flood) located outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood Insurance Study for Hennepin County, Minnesota. 
    Flood prone area means any land susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see "flood"). 
    Floodplain means the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood. 
    Floodproofing means a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages. 
    Floodway means the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to carry or store the regional flood discharge. Lake Minnetonka means the naturally occurring lake shown on all the official maps referenced in this chapter, including all bays, channels, inlets, lagoons, marshland and other water-connected portions, whether naturally occurring or artificially created: 
(1)  Defined ordinary high water elevation, 929.4 feet MSL. 
(2)  Defined floodplain boundary, 100-year flood, 931.5 feet MSL as established by the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District (MCWD). 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 60.3. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include the term "recreational vehicle." 
    New construction means structures, including additions and improvements, and placement of manufactured homes, for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of this article. 
    Obstruction means any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water. 
    One hundred-year floodplain means lands inundated by the "regional flood" (see definition). 
    Principal use or structure means all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures. 
    Reach means a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this article, the term recreational vehicle is synonymous with the term "travel trailer/travel vehicle." 
    Regional flood means a flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the one percent chance or 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood" used in a flood insurance study. 
    Regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) means an elevation not less than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
(1)  The regulatory flood protection elevation within the floodway and flood fringe districts, except for Lake Minnetonka, shall be established by adding 1.0 foot to the base flood water surface elevations within floodway listed in the floodway data table contained in the flood insurance study. Regulatory flood protection elevations between cross sections shall be interpolated. 
(2)  The regulatory flood protection elevation for Lake Minnetonka shall be 932.5 MSL. 
(3)  The regulatory flood protection elevation within the general floodplain district shall be calculated by a qualified registered professional engineer in accordance with procedures set forth in this article. 
    Repetitive loss means flood related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Special flood hazard area is a term used for flood insurance purposes synonymous with "one hundred-year floodplain." 
    Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement that occurred before the permit's expiration date. The actual start is either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in section 78-1137(2) of this article and other similar items. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means, within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." For the purpose of this article, "historic structure" is as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.

(3)  The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists. 
(f)  Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood protection elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for removal of such materials within the time available after a flood warning. 
(g)  Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards: 
(1)  Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer as being in compliance with the general design standards of the state building code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding. 
(2)  Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: 
a.  The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and 
b.  That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP3 or FP4 classifications in the state building code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.

(a)  Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the general floodplain district, the city administrator must obtain, review and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source. 
(b)  If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, the applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use would fall within the floodway or flood fringe district. Information must be consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards and the standards in section 78-1129(c) below. 
(c)  The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the following components, as applicable: 
(1)  Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (one percent chance) flood. 
(2)  Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas. 
(3)  Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage increase than one-half foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 
(4)  The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the floodway or flood fringe district and to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000-6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective department of natural resources' area hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. 
a.  A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water information. 
b.  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground, pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, and the location and elevations of streets. 
c.  Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and downstream, and soil types. 
d.  Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development. 
(d)  The city administrator will review the submitted information and assess the technical evaluation and the recommended floodway and/or flood fringe district boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of previous floodway encroachments. The city administrator may seek technical assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency, including the department of natural resources. Based on this assessment, the city administrator may approve or deny the application. 
(e)  Once the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries have been determined, the city administrator must process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of division 4 and 5 of this article.

(a)  Permit required. A permit must be obtained from the city administrator prior to conducting the following activities: 
(1)  The erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation, or alteration of any building, structure, or portion thereof. Normal maintenance and repair also requires a permit if such work, separately or in conjunction with other planned work, constitutes a substantial improvement as defined in this article. 
(2)  The use or change of use of a building, structure, or land. 
(3)  The construction of a dam, fence, or on-site septic system, although a permit is not required for a farm fence as defined in this article. 
(4)  The change or extension of a nonconforming use. 
(5)  The repair of a structure that has been damaged by flood, fire, tornado, or any other source. 
(6)  The placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of materials or equipment within the floodplain. 
(7)  Relocation or alteration of a watercourse (including new or replacement culverts and bridges), unless a public waters work permit has been applied for. 
(8)  Any other type of "development" as defined in this article. 
(b)  Application for permit. Permit applications must be submitted to the city administrator on forms provided by the city administrator. The permit application must include the following as applicable: 
(1)  A site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, existing or proposed buildings, structures, and significant natural features having an influence on the permit. 
(2)  Location of fill or storage of materials in relation to the stream channel. 
(3)  Copies of any required municipal, county, state or federal permits or approvals. 
(4)  Other relevant information requested by the city administrator as necessary to properly evaluate the permit application. 
(c)  Certificate of city compliance for a new, altered, or nonconforming use. No building, land or structure may be occupied or used in any manner until a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued by the city administrator stating that the use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this article. 
(d)  Certification. The applicant is required to submit certification by a registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this article. Floodproofing measures must be certified by a registered professional engineer or registered architect. 
(e)  Record of first floor elevation. The city administrator must maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the floodplain. The city administrator must also maintain a record of the elevation to which structures and alterations or additions to structures are floodproofed. 
(f)  Notifications for watercourse alterations. Before authorizing any alteration or relocation of a river or stream, the city administrator must notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work in public waters pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 103G.245, this will suffice as adequate notice. A copy of the notification must also be submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
(g)  Notification to FEMA when physical changes increase or decrease base flood elevations. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date such supporting information becomes available, the city administrator must notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy of the relevant technical or scientific data. 
(Ord. No. 177 3rd series, § 1, 9-12-2016) 
Sec. 78-1147. - Variances and appeals. 
(a)  Variance applications. An application for a variance to the provisions of this article will be processed and reviewed in accordance with applicable state statutes and Title IV, Article II, Division 3 of this article. 
(b)  Adherence to state floodplain management standards. A variance must not allow a use that is not allowed in that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state law. 
(c)  Additional variance criteria. The following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied: 
(1)  Variances must not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(2)  Variances may only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(d)  Flood insurance notice. The city administrator must notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 2) Such construction below the base or regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification must be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(e)  General considerations. The community may consider the following factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and conditional uses in floodplains: 
(1)  The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments; 
(2)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of others; 
(3)  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the ability of these systems to minimize the potential for disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions; 
(4)  The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(5)  The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use to the community; 
(6)  The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location; 
(7)  The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding; 
(8)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future; 
(9)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive land use plan and flood plain management program for the area; 
(10)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(11)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site. 
(f)  Submittal of hearing notices to the department of natural resources (DNR). The city administrator or designee shall submit hearing notices for proposed variances to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days' notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist. 
(g)  Submittal of final decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions granting variances must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist. 
(h)  Record-keeping. The city administrator must maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and must report such variances in an annual or biennial report to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program, when requested by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(i)  Appeals. The city council shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement or administration of this article. An appeal must be filed within ten days of the administrative official's order, requirement, decision, or determination. Failure to file an appeal within ten days of the decision shall constitute a waiver of the person's right to a hearing.

Sec. 78-1212. - Statement of purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by providing for the wise subdivision, use and development of shorelands abutting public waters that exist within the city's corporate boundaries. The city recognizes that the uncontrolled use and development of shorelands has a negative impact on not only the quality of surface waters, but on the economic, recreational and natural environmental values of shorelands and the waters they surround. The specific intent of this article is to: 
(1)  Protect the water quality of Lake Minnetonka and other lakes within the city by allowing development of uses in the shoreland areas which are compatible with the city's comprehensive land use management plan. 
(2)  Provide appropriate standards for development which will minimize the impact of shoreland development on the water quality and the economic, aesthetic and natural environment values of the city's lakes.

Sec. 78-1218. - Establishment of Shoreland Overlay District. 
    The Shoreland Overlay District is defined and established to include the following lands within the city: 
(1)  All lands within 1,000 feet of the ordinary high water level of the lakes classified natural environment, recreational development, and general development in section 78-1217. The Shoreland Overlay District includes lands within the city that are located within 1,000 feet of lakes located in adjacent cities, namely Hadley Lake in the City of Plymouth and Wolsfeld Lake in the City of Medina. 
(2)  All lands within 300 feet of the ordinary high water level of the watercourses classified as tributary streams in section 78-1217. Where the floodplain of the tributary streams as defined in article VIII of this chapter or as defined elsewhere in this chapter extends further than 300 feet from the ordinary high water level, the boundary of the Shoreland Overlay District shall be extended to include those areas designated as floodplain. 
(Ord. No. 101 2nd series, § 1(10.56(8)), 2-24-1992) 
Sec. 78-1219. - Adoption of official map and interpretation of district boundaries. 
    The official map of the Shoreland Overlay District is adopted. A copy of the map shall be kept on file at all times with the city clerk. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. The boundaries of the Shoreland Overlay District shall be determined by scaling distances on the official map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official map, the city engineer shall make necessary interpretation based on the ordinary high water level. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the city and to submit technical evidence if he so desires.

Sec. 78-1221. - Subdivision/platting provisions. 
(a)  Land suitability. Each lot created through subdivision, including planned unit developments or planned residential developments authorized elsewhere in the zoning and platting codes, must be suitable in its natural state for the proposed use with minimal alteration. In analyzing the suitability of land for a specific use, the city shall consider: 
(1)  Susceptibility to flooding; 
(2)  Existence of wetlands; 
(3)  Soil and rock formations with severe limitations for development; 
(4)  Severe erosion potential; 
(5)  Steep topography; 
(6)  Inadequate water supply or sewage treatment capabilities; 
(7)  Near-shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for water-based recreation; 
(8)  Important fish and wildlife habitat; 
(9)  Presence of significant historic sites; or 
(10)  Any other feature of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community. 
(b)  Consistency with other controls. Subdivisions shall conform to all official controls of the city. Subdivision will not be approved where a later variance from one or more standards in the official controls would be needed to use the lots for their intended purpose. In areas not served by publicly owned sewer and water systems, a subdivision will not be approved unless adequate and conforming water supply and sewage treatment systems can be provided for each lot in conformance with chapter 58, article II. Each lot shall meet the minimum lot size and dimensional requirements set forth elsewhere in this Code, including at least a minimum contiguous lawn area, that is free of limiting factors sufficient for the construction of two standard soil treatment systems. Lots that would require use of holding tanks must not be approved. 
(c)  Information requirements. Sufficient information must be submitted by the applicant for the city to make a determination of land suitability. In addition to information required by other provisions in this chapter and chapter 82, the following information shall also be submitted: 
(1)  Topographic contours at two-foot intervals showing limiting site characteristics. 
(2)  The surface water features required in Minn. Stat. § 505.02, subd. 1, to be shown on plats, obtained from United States Geological Survey quadrangle topographic maps or more accurate sources. 
(3)  Adequate soils information to determine suitability for building and on-site sewage treatment capabilities for every lot from the most current existing sources or from field investigations, such as soil borings, percolation tests or other methods. 
(4)  Information regarding adequacy of domestic water supply; extent of anticipated vegetation and topographic alterations; near-shore aquatic conditions, including depths, types of bottom sediments, and aquatic vegetation; and proposed methods for controlling storm water runoff and erosion, both during and after construction activities. 
(5)  Location of 100-year floodplain areas and floodway districts from existing adopted maps or data. 
(6)  A line or contour representing the ordinary high water level, the toe and the top of bluffs, and the minimum building setback distances from the top of the bluff and the lake or stream. 
(d)  Dedications. When a land or easement dedication is a condition of subdivision approval, the approval must provide easements over natural drainage or ponding areas for management of stormwater and significant wetlands, as regulated in article VIII of this chapter. 
(e)  Lakeshore access lots. Lots intended as accesses to public waters or as recreational areas for use by owners of nonriparian lots within a subdivision must meet or exceed the minimum standards set forth in this section. 
(Ord. No. 101 2nd series, § 1(10.56(18)), 2-24-1992) 
Sec. 78-1222. - Riparian access and rights. 
    For properties which as a result of the designation of the OHWL are found to abut the boundary of a lake, stream or tributary, no section of this chapter shall be construed as obligating the city to approve variances to provisions of this chapter prohibiting physical improvements, structures or land alteration within protected wetlands, floodplain areas or shorelands. Nothing in this chapter shall be considered as establishing or increasing riparian rights. This article is intended to regulate land use and establish building and zoning restrictions only.

Sec. 78-1278. - Lakeshore access lots. 
    Lots intended as accesses to public waters or as recreation areas for use by owners of nonriparian lots within subdivisions are permissible and must meet the following minimum standards: 
(1)  Any such lakeshore access lot shall be designated as an outlot and shall not be considered as a buildable residential lot. 
(2)  Such an outlot shall not be subject to minimum lot area or width standards, except that the number of inland nonriparian lots which may gain access via such outlot shall not exceed the number obtained by dividing the outlot width measured at the shoreline by the required zoning district lot width, rounded down to the nearest whole number. 
(3)  Such outlot shall be jointly owned by all owners of nonriparian lots in the subdivision who are provided riparian access rights on the access outlot. 
(4)  No such access outlot shall be created as part of a subdivision plat except when the building lots within the subdivision are separated by an existing public or private roadway from the lakeshore, and the land on either side of the roadway was in common ownership as of the effective date of Ordinance No. 101, adopted February 24, 1992. 
(5)  Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments must be developed that specify which lot owners have authority to use the access lot and what activities are allowed. The activities may include watercraft launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring or docking. They can also include other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly conflict with general public use of the public water or the enjoyment of normal property rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of the nonsignificant conflict activities include swimming, sunbathing or picnicking. The covenants must limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked or stored over water, and must require centralization of all common facilities and activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and vegetation alterations. They must also require all parking areas, storage buildings and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as much as practical from view from the public water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. Such covenants are subject to city approval.

(a)  No live tree within 75 feet of the shoreline or within the bluff impact zone with a diameter of six inches or more (or 19 inches in circumference or greater) measured three feet above the ground may be removed without first obtaining a permit from the city staff, provided that at least the equivalent number of replacement trees of a size and nature found acceptable to the staff are planted at the same setback from the shoreline as those removed. Removal of trees that are dead shall not require a permit, but such trees must be inspected by city staff prior to their removal. 
(b)  Intensive vegetation clearing within 75 feet of the shoreline, on steep slopes or within the bluff impact zone within the Shoreland Overlay District is prohibited. Limited clearing of shrubs and trees less than six inches in diameter and cutting, pruning and trimming of trees of any size is allowed to provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to accommodate the placement of permitted stairways and landings, picnic areas, access paths, beach and watercraft access areas, and permitted lockboxes, provided that the screening of structures, vehicles or other facilities as viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not substantially reduced. 
(Ord. No. 101 2nd series, § 1(10.56(16)(I)), 2-24-1992; Ord. No. 127 2nd series, § 7, 7-11-1994; Ord. No. 178 3rd series, § 14, 10-10-2016) 
Sec. 78-1286. - Topographic alterations/grading and filling. 
(a)  Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways under validly issued construction permits for these improvements do not require the issuance of a separate grading and filling permit. However, all grading and filling activity as a part of approved permits for construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways shall adhere to the grading and filling standards of this article. 
(b)  Grading, filling or excavating of more than 50 cubic yards is prohibited without an interim use permit within the shore setback of the public waters enumerated in section 78-1217. 
(c)  New Public and private roads, driveways, parking areas, and public or private watercraft access ramps shall not be constructed within the shore setback of the public waters enumerated in section 78-1217. If no alternatives exist, such improvements shall be subject to the standard zoning variance review procedure, and such review shall consider the following: 
(1)  Such improvements shall be designed to take advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view from public waters. 
(2)  All roads and parking areas shall be designed and constructed to minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the requirements of all agencies with jurisdiction and in accordance with City Code chapter 79. 
(d)  Except for those projects requiring permits for construction of structures, sewage treatment systems and driveways, an administrative land alteration permit will be required as follows: 
(1)  For movement of up to 50 cubic yards of material within the shore setback as per item (b) above,

Sec. 78-1376. - Home occupations. 
(a)  Purpose. Home occupation regulations are established to ensure that home occupations will not adversely affect the character and livability of the surrounding residential neighborhood. The home occupation shall function as an accessory and subordinate use to the principal use of the dwelling unit. In order to protect the public health, safety and welfare within residential neighborhood, home occupations shall be divided into two regulatory levels: 
(1)  Level 1 home occupations: Home occupations that comply with all standards of subsection (d) of this section and which have no potential neighborhood impacts. Level 1 home occupations may be operated without a license or permit. 
(2)  Level 2 home occupations: Home occupations that comply with all standards of subsection (d) of this section but which could have potential neighborhood impacts; and home occupations that do not comply with all standards of subsection (d) of this section and which are not prohibited home occupations under subsection (e) of this section. Level 2 home occupations are required to be licensed under the provisions of section 26-76. Level 2 home occupations may include but are not strictly limited to: 
a.  Those with employed persons other than occupants of the dwelling. 
b.  Those carried out partially or wholly in an accessory structure, where allowed, including storage of materials, equipment or commercial vehicles in an accessory building. 
c.  Those involving the use or parking of a commercial or nonpassenger vehicle, whether such use or parking is in a building or outside. 
d.  Those which do not meet one or more of the specified performance standards. 
e.  Those which generate excessive traffic under the standards of subsection (d)(13) of this section. 
In cases where it is unclear whether a home occupation should be classified as level 1 or level 2, the zoning administrator shall make such a determination subject to city council confirmation if requested by the operator of the home occupation. 
(b)  Conformance required. All existing home occupations shall be brought into conformity with this section within one year of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(c)  License required for level 2 home occupations. An annual license shall be obtained by any person operating a level 2 home occupation as defined in this chapter, under the provisions of section 26-76 of this Code. 
(d)  Home occupation regulations. The regulations recognize that many types of home occupations can be conducted with minimal or no effect on the surrounding neighborhood. Home occupations shall be subject to the following standards: 
(1)  The home occupation shall be clearly incidental and secondary to the residential use of the premises, and shall result in no incompatibility with or disturbance to the surrounding area. 
(2)  Employed persons. No one other than the occupants of the dwelling and one employee or associate shall be on the property at any given time in relation to the home occupation. No employee or associate or combination of either shall work on the premises for more than 40 hours in one week. The home occupation may employ additional nonresident employees only if their work activities are performed off the premises. Personal vehicles of employees working off the premises shall be parked within a building or shall be fully screened from the street and from adjoining properties. Domestic employees shall not be considered employees of the home occupation. 
(3)  Exterior alterations or modifications that change the residential character or appearance of the dwelling unit or accessory structure to that of a commercial nature shall be prohibited. 
(4)  Interior alterations or modifications that eliminate the kitchen, habitable areas for sleeping, and bathrooms shall be prohibited. 
(5)  The home occupation shall be conducted within the enclosed area of the dwelling unit, with the exception of lessons or instruction for outdoor activities, such as equestrian training and riding, tennis and other court sports, gardening and swimming. In the RR-1A and RR-1B, one-family rural residential districts, home occupations or storage associated with the home occupation may be conducted within accessory structures subject to the following conditions: 
a.  No home occupation conducted wholly or in part in an accessory structure shall produce noise, light and glare, odor, vibration or traffic that will in any way have a perceptible effect upon adjacent or nearby property. 
b.  The home occupation shall conform with all other applicable zoning requirements. 
c.  The property must be conforming in area, and the accessory structure must be conforming in location. 
(6)  Outdoor storage prohibited. Outdoor storage or display of materials, goods, supplies or equipment related to the conduct of the home occupation shall be prohibited, except that licensed passenger vehicles used in the home occupation may be parked outside provided they are in compliance with all other requirements of this section. 
(7)  Parking. All vehicle parking required for conduct of the home occupation shall be off-street. The off-street parking area required for the principal residential use shall be retained exclusively for the principal residential use and shall not be made unusable by the home occupation. Off-street parking areas providing more than two spaces for the home occupation shall be visually screened from adjacent residential lots. 
(8)  Commercial or nonpassenger vehicles. Parking/storage of any commercial or nonpassenger vehicles used in the home occupation shall be within a fully enclosed building. Noise, odors or vibration from the operation of such vehicles shall not be discernible at the property line. 
(9)  No equipment, machinery, or materials other than of a type normally found in or compatible with a dwelling unit shall be allowed. 
(10)  No retail sales and delivery of products or merchandise to the public shall occur on the premises except when accessory to the services provided. 
(11)  No home occupation activity of a non-residential character shall be discernible from any private or public street. There shall be no exterior signage or display, or interior signs or display which are visible from outside the dwelling, except that a single nameplate sign of not more than two square feet in area per surface, nor more than two surfaces, may be placed on the property. Such sign, if displayed, shall include only the name of property owner and the site address, and shall not identify the type of business. 
(12)  The hours of operation that a home occupation may be accessible to the public shall be limited to the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. 
(13)  The home occupation shall not generate excessive traffic that is detrimental to the residential character of the surrounding properties or the neighborhood. For the purposes of this provision, more than five customers or clients per day, or more than two customers at any given time, may be determined to be an excessive and detrimental level of traffic. The number shall apply to each dwelling unit, regardless of the number of home occupations conducted in the dwelling unit. The criteria used by the zoning administrator to determine impact shall include, but not be limited to: 
a.  The characteristics of the neighborhood, including current land use, lot sizes, lot widths, parking availability, and screening. 
b.  Type of street, width, and traffic volumes. 
c.  The availability and location of off-street parking. 
(14)  Shipment and delivery of products, merchandise, or supplies shall be limited to the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and shall regularly occur only in single rear axle straight trucks or smaller vehicles typically used to serve residential areas. 
(15)  No sound or noise created by the operation of the home occupation shall be audible at the property lines except between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Home occupations shall otherwise comply with all noise provisions of this chapter. 
(16)  Any activity or event organized for the purpose of displaying or selling merchandise shall not be held more than six times per year. This section shall not be construed as requiring a license or permit for occasional garage sales or tag sales. 
(e)  Prohibited home occupations. The following uses, by their nature of operation, have a pronounced tendency to increase beyond the limits permitted for home occupations. These uses have objectionable operational characteristics that adversely impact residential neighborhoods and shall be prohibited as home occupations: 
(1)  Service, repair, or painting of any motorized vehicle, including but not limited to motor vehicles, trailers, boats, personal watercraft, recreational vehicles, and snowmobiles. 
(2)  Hair styling establishments that serve more than one person at a time. 
(3)  Adult uses, as defined in this Code. Adult uses are prohibited as a home occupation for the reasons set forth in Ordinance No. 193, Second Series (section 78-1377 of this Code), adopted by the city council on November 8, 1999, based on the effects and impacts of sexually oriented businesses as set forth in the state attorney general's Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, dated June 6, 1989, and in the Task Force Report on Sexually Oriented Businesses, authored by the Cities of Minnetonka, St. Louis Park and Shakopee, which considered relevant studies from six cities.

(Ord. No. 2015 3rd series, § 1, 9-10-2018) 
Sec. 78-1466. - Purpose. 
    Purpose. This Sign Code is intended to establish a comprehensive and balanced system of sign control that accommodates the need for a well-maintained, safe, and attractive community, and the need for effective communications, including business identification. It is the intent of these sign regulations, to promote the health, safety, general welfare, aesthetics, and image of the community by regulating signs that are intended to communicate to the public in all areas of the city. It is not the purpose or intent of this division to regulate the message displayed on any sign. The purpose of this division is to authorize: 
(1)  Permanent signs which establish a high standard of aesthetics and are appropriate for the planned character in each sign district as established in section 78-1478; 
(2)  Signs that are compatible with their surroundings; 
(3)  Signs that are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained in a manner that does not adversely impact public safety or create a hazard to motorists, pedestrians, or cyclists; 
(4)  Signs that are proportioned to the scale of, and are architecturally compatible with, principal structures; 
(5)  Permanent signs which give preference to the on-premise owner or occupant; 
(6)  Temporary commercial signs and advertising displays which provide an opportunity to advertise while restricting signs that create visual clutter and hazards at public right-of-way intersections; 
(7)  Minimize adverse effects on nearby property; and 
(8)  Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations set forth herein under the authority of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2015 3rd series, § 1, 9-10-2018) 
Sec. 78-1467. - Findings. 
    Findings. The city finds it is necessary for the promotion and preservation of the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the community to control the construction, location, size, and maintenance of signs. Further the city finds: 
(1)  Permanent and temporary signs have a direct impact on and relationship to the image and aesthetic of the community; 
(2)  The manner of installation, location, and maintenance of signs affects the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the community; 
(3)  An opportunity for viable identification of community businesses, residences, and institutions must be established; 
(4)  The safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians, and other users of public streets and property is affected by the number, size, location, and appearance of signs that create a hazard for drivers; 
(5)  Installation of signs suspended from, projecting over, or placed on the tops of buildings, walks, or other structures may constitute a hazard during periods of high winds and an obstacle to effective fire-fighting and other emergency service; 
(6)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs and sign types adversely impact the image and aesthetic attractiveness of the community and thereby undermine economic value and growth; 
(7)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs, particularly temporary signs which are commonly located within or adjacent to public right-of-way or are located at driveway/street intersections, result in roadside clutter and obstruction of views of oncoming traffic. This creates a hazard to drivers and pedestrians and also adversely impacts a logical flow of information; 
(8)  Commercial signs are generally incompatible with residential uses and should be strictly limited in residential zoning districts; and 
(9)  The right to express noncommercial opinions in any zoning district must be protected, subject to reasonable restrictions on size, height, location, and number. 
(Ord. No. 2015 3rd series, § 1, 9-10-2018)

ARTICLE XI. - WETLANDS PROTECTION 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 78-1601. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  The purpose of this section is to recognize, preserve and protect the environmental, aesthetic and hydrologic functions of the city's wetlands by regulating the use of wetlands and their adjacent properties in conjunction with the goals of the environmental protection plan within the community management plan. These functions include, but are not limited to, sediment control, pollution control, filtration, fish and wildlife habitat and aquifer recharge. The surface water management plan will provide guidance for stormwater treatment requirements and wetland restoration opportunities in order to protect the integrity of wetlands. 
(b)  The intent of this section is to protect wetlands to the maximum extent possible while allowing a reasonable use of the property. This section adopts the regulations and standards of the Wetland Conservation Act of 1991 (WCA), Laws of Minnesota 1991, Chapter 354, as amended, and the rules adopted pursuant to the WCA. It also establishes a wetland overlay district. This overlay district further regulates the underlying land use as allowed by other districts or the WCA. 
(Ord. No. 28 3rd series, § 1, 8-22-2005; Ord. No. 94 3rd series, § 8, 9-24-2012; Ord. No. 103 3rd series, § 1, 5-28-2013) 
DIVISION 2. - DESIGNATION OF PROTECTED WETLANDS 

Sec. 78-1602. - Wetland types. 
    The wetlands protected and regulated by this section are types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 wetlands, as defined in circular 39, "Wetlands of the United States", 1971 edition, United States Department of the Interior, unless the wetland is within a shoreland district in which case the more restrictive rules regarding setbacks would apply. Protected wetlands are further defined as follows: 
(1)  Type 1-Seasonally flooded basins or floodplains: Type 1 wetlands are seasonally flooded basins or flats in which soil is covered with water or is waterlogged during variable seasonal periods but usually is well-drained during much of the growing season. Type 1 wetlands are located in depressions and in overflow bottom lands along water courses. Vegetation varies greatly according to the season and duration of the flooding, and includes bottom land hardwoods, as well as herbaceous plants. 
(2)  Type 2-Inland fresh meadow: Occurs along the shallow edges of lakes, marshes and floodplains, or in perched depressions. The soil is usually without standing water during much of the growing season, but is waterlogged within at least a few inches of the surface. Vegetation includes grasses, sedges, rushes and various herbaceous plants. 
(3)  Type 3-Inland shallow fresh marsh: Soil is usually water logged during the growing season, often covered with as much as six inches or more of water. Vegetation includes grasses, bulrushes, cattails, arrowheads, smartweeds and other emergent aquatic vegetation. 
(4)  Type 4-Inland deep fresh marsh: Soil covered with six inches to three feet or more of water during growing season. Vegetation includes cattails, reeds, bulrushes and wild rice. Open water areas may contain pondweeds, naiads, coontail, water milfoils and other submergent aquatic vegetation. 
(5)  Type 5-Inland open fresh water: Water is usually less than ten feet deep and is fringed by a border of emergent vegetation. Vegetation includes pondweeds, naiads, coontail, water milfoils and other submergent aquatic vegetation. 
(6)  Type 6-Shrub swamp: Occurs along sluggish streams or on floodplains. The soil is usually waterlogged during the growing season, and is often covered with as much as six inches of water. Vegetation includes alder, willow and dogwood. 
(7)  Type 7-Wooded swamp: Occurs along sluggish streams, on floodplains, on flat perched depressions and in shallow lake basins. The soil is waterlogged to within a few inches of its surface during the growing season and is often covered with as much as one foot of water. Vegetation typical to this wetland includes tamarack, white cedar, black spruce, balsam fir, red maple and black ash. 
(8)  Type 8-Bog: Occurs along sluggish streams, on flat perched depressions and shallow lake basins. The soil is waterlogged and supports a spongy covering of mosses. Vegetation typical to this wetland type includes sphagnum moss, heath shrubs and sedges. Minnesota bogs contain leatherleaf, Labrador tea, cranberries and pitcher plants. Scattered stunted black spruce and tamarack also are common features of bogs. 
(Ord. No. 28 3rd series, § 1, 8-22-2005) 
Sec. 78-1603. - Boundaries of the wetland overlay districts and designation of official city wetland map. 
    This section establishes wetland overlay districts. These districts are subject to additional requirements beyond those required by the WCA. The boundaries of the wetland overlay districts are identified graphically on the official city wetland map (CWM) which is hereby adopted by reference, a copy of which shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk and shall be available for public review during all normal office hours. Wetlands in addition to those shown on the city wetland map may exist, and may be identified by wetland delineations under WCA rules. If a specific wetland delineation has been done under WCA rules, then the boundaries of the wetland overlay district for that location will be as shown in the delineation. The city may require wetland delineations to determine compliance with WCA rules and to determine administrative wetland boundaries; however, property owners may have wetland delineations done for their properties on their own initiative. The delineation must be done by a qualified professional according to WCA rules and be acceptable to the city administrator, who may require review by city consultants or a technical evaluation panel if necessary. Approved WCA wetland delineations must be provided to the city in a hard copy format and a CAD or GIS format in Hennepin County coordinates. The city administrator will have the approved WCA wetland delineations shown on the official city wetland map. Public waters are not included in the overlay district, unless a wetland is part of a public water. 
(Ord. No. 28 3rd series, § 1, 8-22-2005; Ord. No. 196 3rd series, § 1, 5-22-2017) 
Sec. 78-1604. - Interpretation of wetlands boundaries. 
    Whenever a wetland boundary is disputed or uncertain, the city administrator may require the submission of a registered survey of the property and field staking showing the city-designated wetland contour or a delineation of the wetland, and such other information as the director may require in order to resolve the dispute or uncertainty. The city administrator may require review by city consultants or a technical evaluation panel if necessary. No boundary change may be authorized on the basis of fill that was placed on the site after the city designated the area as part of the wetland overlay district. Persons aggrieved by a decision of the city administrator may appeal such decision in accordance with the provisions of section 78-99 of this chapter and the WCA rules. 
a.  Delineation types. 
A Tier 1 Boundary determination is a review of known information to determine an understood boundary, and may be used when the proposed project is located on a lot where a wetland is believed to exist, but the project is not likely to impact the wetland due to project scope, distance, and/ or topography. Known information may include aerial photography, third party studies, and/ or site visits. A Tier 1 Boundary determination is not a delineation. 
A Tier 2 Delineation is a delineation is conducted by a certified wetland delineator and verified by the Local Government Unit. Tier 2 delineation information shall be provided on a certified certificate of survey. 
b.  Delineation required. The type of delineation shall be determined by the city administrator or their designee. 
Tier 1 Boundary determinations may be required for accessory structures, accessory buildings, and other projects primarily outside the wetland or wetland buffer area. 
Tier 2 Delineations shall be required for projects that include a new residential principal structure, a project that impacts the wetland, a subdivision, or a project that otherwise is regulated by the Waterbody Crossings and Structures Rule or Stormwater Management Rule of the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District, unless waived by the Watershed District. A Tier 2 Delineation may also be required for a project proposed at or within 5' of the buffer/setback line. 
A Tier 1 Boundary determination may be substituted for the Tier 2 delineation when the applicant can demonstrate the wetland boundary location to the satisfaction of the city and the watershed district, due to topography, distance of the project to the wetland, site specific features, and known information.

DIVISION 3. - BUFFER AREAS 

Sec. 78-1605. - Wetland buffer areas and setbacks. 
(a)  This subsection establishes authority for wetland buffer areas around protected wetlands. Buffer areas are necessary and beneficial to maintain the health of wetlands. Buffer areas protect the edge of wetlands from erosion while filtering sediment, chemicals and other nutrients from runoff that drains into wetlands. Buffer areas can improve the biological diversity and health of a wetland environment while reducing the adverse impacts of human activities. 
(b)  All wetlands within the City of Orono are within the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District (MCWD), which has rules and regulations for the establishment and maintenance of wetland buffers. In an effort to avoid overlapping or conflicting regulations, the city defers jurisdiction for the establishment and maintenance of wetland buffers to the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District. If application of MCWD buffer regulations is in conflict with city regulations, the Watershed District requirements shall apply. 
(c)  Setbacks. Where the MCWD has established or requires a wetland buffer, the wetland buffer rules shall apply. 
i.  Where the MCWD does not require a buffer, a 25 foot setback shall be required between the edge of all wetlands from any building (principal or accessory) or other structure, septic systems, or wells. The wetland edge shall be determined as required in section 78-1604 of this Code. 
ii.  Setback revegetation. Areas within the required setback area subject to filling, grading or excavation as part of a construction project shall be revegetated immediately upon completion of such earthwork. 
(d)  The City of Orono has established wetland protection strategies in the Orono Surface Water Management Plan (SWMP) (January 2011). The protection classification for each wetland will be found on the "Wetland Management Classification Map & List" which is hereby adopted by reference, a copy of which shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk and shall be available for public review during all normal office hours. The Minnehaha Creek Watershed District required buffer area widths are based on the four protection classifications.

DIVISION 5. - STANDARDS FOR THE WETLAND OVERLAY DISTRICT, BUFFER AREAS AND NEIGHBORING LANDS 

Sec. 78-1608. - Standards. 
    The following standards apply to all land within the wetland overlay districts, existing and MCWD-required wetland buffer areas, and to neighboring lands: 
(1)  Protection of wetlands. 
a.  Except as modified or regulated by the standards of this subsection, all requirements of the underlying zoning district apply. 
b.  No structures are allowed in the wetland overlay districts except those allowed as of right or by conditional use permit by sections 78-1606 or 78-1607 of this article. 
c.  Activities including, but not limited to, building (other than a boardwalk or dock), paving, mowing, vegetation removal, filling, dumping, yard waste disposal or fertilizer application are prohibited. Invasive non-native vegetation, such as European buckthorn and noxious weeds, may be removed by obtaining a vegetation removal permit from the city. 
d.  Before grading or construction near a wetland , the owner or contractor must place erosion control fencing on the upland side of the perimeter of the wetland, or as required by the city. This fencing must remain in place until all development activities that may affect the wetland have been finished and adequate vegetative cover has been established at which time the fencing must be removed. 
e.  All structures must have a minimum basement floor elevation not less than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation. 
f.  All hard-surface runoff must be treated in accordance with the requirements of the city and the appropriate watershed district. Treatment may include site retention, skimmers, weirs or sedimentation ponds of appropriate scale. Structures and ponds serving this purpose must be properly maintained and serviced by the property owner. 
g.  Discharge into the wetlands must occur at a rate no greater than allowed by the city engineer in accordance with the city's surface water management plan and the appropriate MCWD requirements. 
(2)  Protection of wetland buffer areas. Existing and MCWD-required wetland buffers shall be maintained and protected per the requirements of existing covenants as well as MCWD regulations as administered by MCWD. 
(3)  Nonconformities. 
a.  Effect of wetland boundary expansion. An existing structure, driveway or parking area meeting the required setback from a city-designated wetland boundary or existing established buffer area is considered a legal nonconforming development if a later wetland delineation or implementation of a wetland buffer shows that the wetland or its buffer is closer than the required setback. 
b.  Existing nonconformities. An existing structure, driveway or parking area that does not meet the required setback from a city-designated wetland boundary or buffer area, is considered a legal nonconforming development. 
(Ord. No. 28 3rd series, § 1, 8-22-2005; Ord. No. 103 3rd series, § 5, 5-28-2013; Ord. No. 196 3rd series, § 4, 5-22-2017) 
Sec. 78-1609. - Removal of lands from the wetlands overlay district. 
(a)  Removal of wetlands from a wetland overlay district (i.e. by filling, etc.) requires a zoning amendment and an amendment of the official city wetland map. The amendments must be made pursuant to the provisions of section 78-43 of this chapter and WCA replacement rules. These amendments must be consistent with the purpose of this article, the city's surface water management plan and the goals and policies of the community management plan. In determining the appropriateness of a rezoning request, the city council will consider the size of the wetland overlay district, the magnitude of the area proposed for removal, hydrological and ecological effects and the type and function of wetlands involved in order to provide the maximum feasible protection. 
(b)  Wetlands within an overlay district may only be removed according to WCA rules and if at least an equal area of wetland replacement is created to compensate for the wetland being filled. Unless otherwise approved by the city council, compensatory wetland area must be provided within Orono and within the same subwatershed (Painter's Creek, Long Lake Creek, Classen Creek, Lake Minnetonka) as the wetland being altered, if available. 
(c)  In addition to application requirements, the city may require submission and approval of the following information: 
(1)  A copy of the wetland replacement plan application submitted to the MCWD; 
(2)  A concept plan showing the ultimate use of the property; 
(3)  A grading plan, in hard copy format and a CAD or GIS format in Hennepin County coordinates, with appropriate drainage calculations and erosion controls prepared by a registered engineer; 
(4)  A landscaping or revegetation plan; 
(5)  Such other information as may be necessary or convenient to evaluate the proposed permit; and 
(6)  A MnRAM assessment approved by the MCWD. 
(Ord. No. 28 3rd series, § 1, 8-22-2005) 
Sec. 78-1610. - Alteration of wetlands. 
(a)  No alteration of land within a wetland overlay district or an existing established wetland buffer is allowed without a wetlands alteration permit, subject to recommendation by the planning commission and approval of the city council. The planning commission must hold a public hearing per section 78-48. Activities that constitute an alteration regulated by this section include changes to the size, depth or contour of the wetlands or its existing established buffer, dredging, or alterations of wetlands or buffer vegetation. Alterations do not include wetland planting or the selective clearing or pruning of trees or vegetation that are dead, diseased, noxious weeds or similar hazards. A wetland alteration permit is not required when a wetland district is rezoned to another zoning classification. 
(b)  Alteration of land within a wetland overlay district will only be allowed if water storage is provided in an amount compensatory to that removed. Unless otherwise approved by the city council, compensatory wetland area must be provided within the same subwatershed district as the wetland being altered. In determining the appropriateness of an alteration request, the city council will consider the size of the total wetland district, the magnitude of the area proposed for alteration, the aesthetic, hydrological and ecological effect, the type and function of wetlands involved, and such other factors as may be appropriate in order to provide the maximum feasible protection to the wetlands. Application for a wetlands alteration permit must be accompanied by such information as required by the city, including: 
(1)  A copy of the wetland replacement plan application submitted to the MCWD; 
(2)  A concept plan showing the ultimate use of the property; 
(3)  A grading plan, in hard copy format and a CAD or GIS format in Hennepin County coordinates, with appropriate drainage calculations and erosion controls prepared by a registered engineer;

Sec. 78-1611. - Public control of wetlands. 
(a)  The city council may require that the owner of any property affected by this article must establish wetland easements or restrictive covenants to be recorded within the property's chain of title. These easements or covenants must describe the boundaries of the wetland; and prohibit any building, paving, mowing, cutting, filling, dumping, yard waste disposal or fertilizer application within the wetland. The owner or developer must record these easements or covenants with the final plat, with deeds from a lot division or, if no subdivision is involved, before the city issues a grading permit or building permit for an affected property. The applicant must submit evidence that the easement or covenant has been submitted to the county for recording. 
(b)  If the city council does not require an easement or covenant, the city may record a notice of the wetland requirements against the property. The property owner must still comply with the requirements of this section.

ARTICLE XII. - CONSERVATION DESIGN 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 78-1631. - Purpose and intent. 
    The City of Orono as a result of the Rural Oasis Study conducted in 2005 finds that there is an intrinsic link between the natural systems and the valued scenic character that exist throughout the community. The requirements of this conservation design ordinance are meant to preserve and enhance this ecological/aesthetic character by requiring: (1) protection and enhancement of drainageways and water quality; (2) protection and enhancement of ecological communities; (3) reinforcement and establishment of ecological connections throughout the city; (4) augmentation and preservation of viewsheds including corridor enclosure and buffering; (5) preservation and improvement of views; and (6) preservation or reinterpretation of local landmarks. 
(Ord. No. 67 3rd series, § 1, 1-11-2010) 
Sec. 78-1632. - Applicability. 
    The Conservation Design Master Planning requirements of this article apply to all proposed residential subdivisions or multi-unit residential developments greater than five acres in total area or guided for urban density (greater than one unit per two acres). 
(Ord. No. 67 3rd series, § 1, 1-11-2010) 
Sec. 78-1633. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Conservation design means a two-phased approach to design and development that maintains or improves ecological assets, provides infrastructure that works with the land, and incorporates people's instinctive desire to experience nature. Some conservation design strategies include: identifying and avoiding sensitive natural features, planning roads along contours, allowing lots to border natural open space, integrating ecological stormwater management, using smaller lots, and educating developer and buyers about the ecological values of the landscape. The first phase entails an inventory and analysis of the potential development site's natural features, existing land uses, and wetland delineation. The second phase entails analyzing the design implications of the findings from the initial phase, alternative stormwater design, and a conceptual design for road and lot layouts. 
    Minnesota Land Cover Classification System (MLCCS) means the Minnesota Land Cover Classification System (MLCCS) displays data on natural/semi-natural and cultural cover types at the highest level of classification. The next four levels of classification each reveal further specifications such as plant types, soil hydrology, hardcover and plant species. Using MLCCS data is the first step in producing a natural resource inventory of a development site. 
    Orono Natural Resource Inventory means an element of the Orono Community Management Plan that displays the ecological connections within and beyond the City of Orono. 
    Corridor enclosure means the nature, appearance and relative degrees of screening provided by roadside vegetation. Corridor enclosure types include: 
Open enclosure: Long views beyond the right-of-way, no real sense of corridor enclosure. 
Edged enclosure: Solid wall of vegetation along roadside, views focused along corridor. 
Tunneled enclosure: Vegetation begins to completely enclose roadway, above and sides, creating a "small scale" roadway experience. 
Varied enclosure: Enclosure changes rapidly along corridor, short stretches of open, edged, and tunneled corridor. 
    View analysis means the process of determining whether a view is positive or negative. 
Positive views: Views of natural areas, water bodies, established parks, wetlands, rural and historic land uses. 
Negative views: Views of structures, particularly multi-family residential, institutional, and commercial and industrial uses. Views of power lines, telephone poles and other utility infrastructure. 
    Landmark preservation and enhancement means preserving and maintaining distinct cultural features, landmarks and unique points of local character, both natural and man-made, to maintain a familiar sense of place in the community. 
    Ecological Management Categories: 
Level 1: Ecological "off-limits" areas, including wetlands and required buffers, historic drainage. 
Level 2: Ecological opportunities, including existing degraded drainageways and existing degraded ecosystem remnants. 
Level 3: Ecological possibilities: Areas suitable for stormwater treatment. 
Note: These Ecological Management Categories are not intended to directly correlate with MLCCS M-34X Natural Community Quality Modifiers. 
    Significant tree stand means a grouping or cluster of coniferous and/or deciduous trees with contiguous crown cover, occupying 500 or more square feet of property, which are comprised of deciduous trees six inches or larger in diameter (d.b.h.) or coniferous trees 12 feet or more in height. Additionally, those forest or woodland remnants identified as high, moderate or good quality in the Orono Natural Resources Inventory shall be considered as significant tree stands. 
(Ord. No. 67 3rd series, § 1, 1-11-2010; Ord. No. 94 3rd series, § 9, 9-24-2012) 
DIVISION 2. - BASIC APPLICATION AND PLAN REQUIREMENTS

(2)  If the property exists adjacent to a documented corridor in the Rural Oasis Study, review and respond to the existing aesthetic and ecological analysis. 
(3)  If the property is not adjacent to a documented corridor in the Rural Oasis Study, developer shall have a qualified consultant prepare a similar analysis and submit it to the city for review. This analysis shall include the documentation of views, corridor enclosure, and landmarks through a plan analysis and photographs. Developer shall be charged a standard fee established in the city fee schedule to cover the expenses of the city in hiring a consultant to review the ecological site analysis submitted by the developer. 
(4)  Additionally, submit a natural resources inventory of the site, including all of the following elements: 
a.  Review of the MLCCS data pertinent to the site. 
b.  Tree survey, including all significant individual trees greater than six feet diameter, and stands of trees, identifying tree species and size. 
c.  Wetland inventory, including delineation reports. 
d.  Topographic survey indicating existing drainage patterns. 
e.  Analysis of the site based on the findings and recommendations of the Orono Natural Resources Inventory with regards to:

Sec. 78-1635. - Basic Conservation Design Master Plan requirements and evaluation criteria. 
    The developer shall prepare a Conservation Design Master Plan for development of the property, consisting of written and visual documentation including maps in an acceptable electronic format, addressing the following topics: 
(1)  Consideration of the existing drainage system; 
(2)  Establishment of a stormwater management system, using multi-cell treatment principles, and defining proposed methods of stormwater phosphorus reduction; 
(3)  Removal of invasive species and diseased trees; 
(4)  Protection of significant tree stands and woodlands that support scenic and/or ecological goals, including mitigation of any such stands to be impacted by development activities; 
(5)  Protection of existing wetlands, including augmentation of buffers, mitigation of impacts, and enhancement of degraded systems; 
(6)  Justification and mitigation of any negative impact to ecological communities. "Negative impact" includes any modification to a lower level of ecological community quality, as described by the Minnesota Land Cover Classification System (M-34X Modifiers); 
(7)  Maintenance of ecological connections through site design, as shown on the Orono Natural Resource Inventory; 
(8)  Maintenance and protection of existing positive views, and mitigation of any existing or proposed negative views using appropriate measures such as site layout, screening, building design and coloration, etc.; and 
(9)  Preservation or reinterpretation of existing landmarks. 
    The planning commission and city council shall evaluate the Conservation Design Master Plan to determine whether the proposed development: 
(1)  Preserves existing drainage patterns and enhances stormwater collection and conveyance by applying an ecologically-based multi-cell stormwater management system that improves ecosystems by reducing reliance on manmade infrastructure, reducing downstream runoff of contaminants, and enhancing ecological connections; 
(2)  Includes a program for the removal of invasive species and diseased trees; protects significant tree stands and woodlands that support scenic and/or ecological goals; and includes mitigation of any such stands that will be impacted by development activities; 
(3)  Protects existing wetlands by implementing new buffers or augmenting existing buffers; mitigates identified wetland impacts; and enhances degraded wetland systems; 
(4)  Results in no negative impact to ecological communities of Ecological Management Categories 1 and 2; results in no negative modification of any ecological communities as described by the Minnesota Land Cover Classification System; and establishes, maintains and improves native ecological communities including natural and semi-natural areas to provide wildlife habitat and support natural ecological functions (i.e. drainage, filtering, buffering, etc.); 
(5)  Establishes or maintains ecological connections through site design, as shown on the Orono Natural Resource Inventory that will enhance stormwater collection and conveyance, promote ecological and wildlife corridors, and provide recreational opportunities for residents; 
(6)  Preserves and where appropriate augments or improves roadway corridor enclosure to promote community aesthetics associated with the city's rural character; preserves open rural views and other aesthetic elements of the landscape; and mitigates the negative visual impacts of development; 
(7)  Preserves, maintains, or reinterprets existing landmarks and unique points of local character, and preserves distinct cultural features that will maintain a familiar sense of place in the community. 
(Ord. No. 67 3rd series, § 1, 1-11-2010) 
DIVISION 3. - DENSITY BONUS STANDARDS 

Sec. 78-1636. - Density bonuses for urban density development. 
    For residential development in Orono's defined urban area (zoning districts allowing densities in excess of one unit per two acres, and including properties identified in the Orono Community Management Plan for conversion to urban density) within the ranges of the guided density a density bonus may be allowed if the city council finds that the performance bonus requirements of this division have been met. The city council shall determine the extent of density bonus awarded for such properties. Example: Properties guided in the Community Management Plan for a density range of two-four units per acre have a base density of two units per acre; while the high end of the density range is not guaranteed, the city council at its discretion may allow development at a final density of up to four units per acre through the performance bonus process. 
(Ord. No. 67 3rd series, § 1, 1-11-2010) 
Sec. 78-1637. - Performance bonus requirements. 
    Within the urban density area, developers have the opportunity to increase the base density by going above and beyond the Basic Conservation Design Master Plan requirement. By implementing a combination of development enhancements that not only preserve but improve the natural characteristics of the property or preserve and enhance existing landmarks, the developer shall become eligible for a density bonus. The extent of such density bonus shall be determined by the city council. Development enhancements include but are not necessarily limited to the following: 
(1)  Reforestation beyond existing woodland limits; 
(2)  Water quality improvements; 
(3)  Improvements in ecological grade of existing communities; 
(4)  Upgrading of edge buffering to maximum, or tunneled, character; and 
(5)  Major preservation or enhancement of existing landmarks.

(2)  Tier 2 parcels. Hardcover shall not exceed 30 percent of the gross lot area. 
(3)  Tier 3 parcels. Hardcover shall not exceed 35 percent of the gross lot area. 
(4)  Tier 4 parcels. Hardcover shall not exceed 50 percent of the gross lot area. 
(5)  Tier 5 parcels. Hardcover shall not exceed 85 percent of the gross lot area. 
(Ord. No. 94 3rd series, § 11, 9-24-2012) 
Sec. 78-1701. - Tier assignment methodology 
    The inclusion of parcels into the stormwater quality overlay district is based on the following methodology. 
(1)  Examine each parcel and determine whether or not it abuts a protected lakeshore or stream. 
a.  All parcels that abut a protected lakeshore or stream shall be placed into Protection Tier 1. 
b.  All parcels that do not abut a protected lakeshore or stream shall be examined under the criteria in subsection 78-1701(2) below. 
(2)  Determine the location of the primary building area on the parcel being examined. The primary building area shall be identified by the location of an existing primary structure (if applicable), or by considering required setbacks and/or the average location of structures on adjacent lots. 
a.  If the primary building area is wholly within 250 feet of a protected lakeshore or stream, the parcel shall be placed into Protection Tier 1. 
b.  If the primary building area is wholly not within 250 feet of a protected lakeshore or stream, the parcel shall continue to be examined under the criteria in subsection 78-1701(3) below. 
c.  If the primary building area is divided by the 250-foot delineation line, the following assessment shall guide the designation: 
1.  If an adjacent parcel abutting by a side lot line is already assigned to Protection Tier 1, the parcel shall be placed into Protection Tier 1. 
2.  If all adjacent parcels abutting by a side lot line have not been assigned to a protection tier, the parcel shall continue to be examined under the criteria in subsection 78-1701(3) below. 
(3)  Using the location of the primary building area as identified in section 78-1701(2), determine the distance between the primary building area and the nearest protected lake or stream. Distances shall be measured from the required setback nearest the protected water body to the OHWL. 
a.  If any portion of the primary building area is at a distance of 300 feet or less from a protected stream or is at all touching the landward extent of floodplain from a stream, the parcel shall be placed into Protection Tier 2. 
b.  If any portion of the primary building area is at a distance between 250' and 500' from a protected lakeshore, the parcel shall be placed into Protection Tier 2. 
c.  If the primary building area is at a distance greater than 500 feet and up to 1,000 feet from a protected lakeshore, the parcel shall be placed into Protection Tier 3. 
d.  If the primary building area is beyond a distance of 1,000 feet from a protected lakeshore or stream, the parcel shall continue to be examined under the criteria in subsection 78-1701(4) below. 
(4)  Determine the zoning of the subject parcel. 
a.  If the property is zoned residential planned unit development (RPUD), the parcel shall be placed into Protection Tier 4. 
b.  If the property is zoned industrial (I), the parcel shall be placed into Protection Tier 5. 
c.  If the parcel being examined has not yet been assigned to a protection zone, the parcel shall continue to be examined under the criteria in subsection 78-1701(5) below. 
(5)  Determine whether the unassigned parcel (or group of unassigned parcels) is within a gap. A gap is an area of 20 acres or less that is largely surrounded by parcels assigned to protection tiers. Roadways, if present, will be used as a dividing line when identifying gap areas. 
a.  Beginning with parcels on an individual basis, if more than half of the border of a parcel is regulated via one of the protection tiers, the parcel shall be placed into the tier which abuts the parcel by the greatest percentage. 
b.  Unassigned parcel groupings of 20 acres or less that have more than half of the group's overall border regulated via one of the protection tiers shall be placed into the tier which abuts the group area by the greatest percentage. 
c.  Parcels still unassigned to a protection tier following review under subsection 78-1701(5)(b) above shall be exempt from stormwater quality overlay district regulations. 
    As new parcels are created within the city as a result of subdivision, each new parcel shall be examined under this methodology to determine whether it belongs within a protection tier as part of the overlay district, or be exempt from the regulations of this article.

DIVISION 2. - PERMIT 

Sec. 78-1745. - Definition, purpose and intent. 
(a)  Definition. An interim use is a temporary use of property until a particular date, until the occurrence of a particular event, or until zoning regulations no longer permit it. 
(b)  Purpose and intent. Because of their unusual characteristics, interim uses require consideration so that they may be located and regulated properly with respect to the objectives of this chapter and the comprehensive plan, and with respect to their impacts on surrounding properties. In order to achieve these purposes, the city council is empowered to grant and to deny applications for interim use permits and to impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of these permits. Additionally, the intent of allowing interim uses is: 
1.  To allow a use for a brief period of time until a permanent location is obtained or while the permanent location is under construction. 
2.  To allow a use that is presently judged acceptable by the city council, but that with anticipated development or redevelopment, will not be acceptable in the future or will be replaced in the future by a permitted or conditional use allowed within the respective zoning district. 
3.  To allow a use which is reflective of anticipated long range change to an area and which is in compliance with the comprehensive plan provided that said use maintains harmony and compatibility with surrounding uses and is in keeping with the architectural character and design standards of existing uses and development.

Sec. 79-8. - Stormwater pollution prevention plan review process. 
(a)  Process. For any subdivision, the stormwater pollution prevention plan shall be submitted with the preliminary plat application. For all other applications, the stormwater pollution prevention plan meeting the requirements of section 79-7 and minimum BMP requirements of section 79-9 must be reviewed by the city engineer or designated representative who may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the stormwater pollution prevention plan prior to any land disturbing activity on the site. 
(b)  Duration. Approval of a stormwater pollution prevention plan submitted under the provisions of this article shall expire one single year after the date of approval unless construction has commenced in accordance with the plan. However, if prior to the expiration of the approval, the owner makes a written request to the city for an extension of time to commence construction setting forth the reason for the requested extension, the city engineer may grant one extension of not more than one single year. Receipt of any request for an extension shall be acknowledged by the city within 15 days. The city shall make a decision on the extension within 30 days of receipt. Any plan may be revised in the same manner as originally approved. 
(c)  Conditions. A stormwater pollution prevention plan may be approved subject to compliance with conditions reasonable and necessary to ensure that the requirements contained in these regulations are met. Such conditions may, among other matters, limit the size, kind or character of the proposed development, require replacement of vegetation, establish required monitoring procedures, stage the work over time, or require alteration of the site design to ensure buffering, and require the conveyance to the city or other public entity of certain lands or interests therein. 
(d)  Financial security. The adequacy, conditions and acceptability of any financial security shall be determined by the city. 
(Ord. No. 55 3rd series, § 1, 4-13-2009; Ord. No. 69 3rd series, § 1, 4-12-2010) 
Sec. 79-9. - Minimum SWPPP Best Management Practices (BMPs). 
(a)  [Plan standards required.] No stormwater pollution prevention plan that fails to meet the standards contained in this section shall be approved by the city council or designated representative. 
(b)  Site dewatering. Water pumped from the site shall be treated by temporary sedimentation basins, grit chambers, sand filters, upflow chambers, hydrocyclones, swirl concentrators or other appropriate controls as appropriate. All water from dewatering must be discharged in a manner that does not cause nuisance conditions, erosion in receiving channels or on downslope properties, or inundation in wetlands causing significant adverse impact to the wetland. 
All discharge points must be adequately protected from erosion and scour. The discharge must be dispersed over natural rock riprap, sand bags, plastic sheeting or other accepted energy dissipation measures. Adequate sedimentation control measures are required for discharge water that contains suspended solids. 
(c)  Construction site waste. 
(1)  Waste and material disposal: All waste, unused building material (including garbage debris, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials or hazardous materials), collected sediment, asphalt and concrete millings, floating debris, paper, plastic, fabric, construction and demolition debris and other wastes must be properly contained on site and disposed of off site, not allowed to be carried by runoff into receiving channel or storage sewer system. 
(2)  Hazardous materials: Oil, gasoline, paint and any hazardous substances must be properly stored, including secondary containment, to prevent spill, leaks or other discharge. Restricted access to storage areas must be provided to prevent vandalism. Concrete wash must be limited to a defined area of the site and runoff must be contained within the defined area. Storage of hazardous waste must be in compliance with MPCA regulations. 
(3)  Liquid waste: All non stormwater discharges (concrete truck washout, vehicle washing, maintenance spills, etc.) conducted during the construction activity must comply with the newest version of the state NPDES permit. 
(4)  Sanitary facilities: Adequate on-site sanitary facilities shall be provided in convenient location(s) for all persons who work on the site. 
(d)  Tracking. Each site shall have graveled roads, access drives and parking areas of sufficient width and length to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by street cleaning before the end of each workday. 
(e)  Drain inlet protection. All storm drain inlets shall be protected during construction with control measures as approved by the city. These devices shall remain in place until final stabilization of the site. A regular inspection and maintenance plan shall be developed and implemented to assure these devices are operational at all times. 
(f)  Site erosion control. 
(1)  Channelized runoff from adjacent areas passing through the site shall be diverted around disturbed areas, if practical. Diverted runoff shall be conveyed in a manner that will not erode the conveyance at receiving channels. All temporary or permanent drainage channels must be stabilized within 24 hours of being connected to a water of the state. Sediment control is required along channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel. 
(2)  All activities on the site shall be conducted in a logical sequence to minimize the area of bare soil exposed at any one time. 
(3)  All disturbed ground left inactive for 14 or more days must have temporary or permanent stabilization year round. 
(4)  For sites with more than ten acres disturbed at one time, or if a channel originates in the disturbed area, one or more temporary or permanent sedimentation basins shall be constructed. Each sedimentation basin shall have a surface area of at least one percent of the area draining to the basin and at least three feet of depth and constructed in accordance with accepted design specifications. Sediment shall be removed to maintain a depth of three feet. The basin discharge rate shall also be sufficiently low as to not cause erosion along the discharge channel or the receiving water. 
(5)  Perimeter sediment control measures shall be placed along all down gradient perimeters of the site. If a channel or area of concentrated runoff passes through the site, perimeter sediment control measures shall be placed along the channel edges to reduce sediment reaching the channel. All down gradient perimeter sediment control measures must include a maintenance and inspection schedule. 
(6)  Any soil or dirt storage piles containing more than ten cubic yards of material should not be located within 25 feet from a roadway or drainage channel. If remaining for more than 14 days, they shall be stabilized by mulching vegetative cover, tarps or other means and enclosed with down gradient perimeter sediment controls. Piles which will be in existence for less than 14 days shall be enclosed with perimeter sediment controls. 
(7)  Pipe outlets must have energy dissipation installed within 24 hours of connection to waters of the state. 
(g)  Inspections and maintenance. The owner shall be responsible for conducting inspections and maintenance of all erosion and sediment control BMPs on site. 
(1)  Inspections, maintenance, and rainfall on site must be documented and readily available for review. Inspections are required as followed: 
a.  Once every seven days on exposed soil areas. 
b.  Within 24 hours after a one-half inch or greater rain event over 24 hours. 
c.  Once every 30 days on stabilized areas. 
d.  As soon as runoff occurs or prior to resuming construction on frozen ground. 
(2)  Maintenance is required as follows: 
a.  When sediment reaches 1/3 the height of the BMP on perimeter control devices, sediment must be removed within 24 hours of discovery. 
b.  If the perimeter control device is not functional it must be repaired or replaced within 24 hours of discovery. 
c.  Temporary sediment basins shall be maintained when sediment reaches 1/2 the outlet height or 1/2 the basin storage volume. Basins must be drained or sediment removed within 72 hours of discovery. 
d.  Sediment must be removed from paved surfaces within 24 hours of discovery. 
(3)  Erosion into streets, wetlands or water bodies. If eroded soils (including tracked soils from construction activities) enter or appear likely to enter streets, wetlands, or other water bodies, prevention strategies, cleanup and repair must be immediate with the appropriate approvals from the DNR, MPCA, or any other state, federal, or local agencies as necessary. The owner shall provide all traffic control and flagging required to protect the traveling public during cleanup operations. 
(4)  Erosion off-site. If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the owner shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain right-of-entry from the adjoining property owner and get appropriate approvals from all state, federal, and local agencies as necessary. Then implement the cleanup and restoration plan within 48 hours of obtaining the adjoining property owner's permission and approval from any appropriate state, federal, and local agencies.

(Code 1984, § 11.30(1)) 
Sec. 82-212. - Special requirements for class II and III subdivisions. 
    The following provisions apply to class II and class III subdivisions: 
(1)  Improvements. All public and/or private improvements required by the city to be completed by the subdivider prior to final plat approval shall be fully completed and shall have had a certificate of satisfactory completion issued by the city engineer prior to endorsement of the final plat by the city. All public and/or private improvements required by the city to be completed by the subdivider after final plat approval shall be fully set forth in a subdivider's agreement to be executed prior to final subdivision approval. All local streets in subdivisions where sewer and water are not available shall be private unless otherwise approved by the city at preliminary subdivision approval. The city reserves the right to determine whether a road is to be public or private in all areas of the city. 
(2)  Public roads. Public streets and roads will be required to be platted, constructed and dedicated to the city when required by the council consistent with the recommendations of the planning commission and the city staff and the established city practices and design standards. Public roads shall be completed and issued a certificate of satisfactory completion by the city engineer prior to final plat approval or, when specifically authorized by the council, shall be subject to the conditions of a subdivider's agreement to be executed prior to final plat approval. 
(3)  Private roads. When the preliminary plat has been approved on the basis of a private access road providing the only access to three or more lots, the private road shall be identified on the final plat as a separate outlot. The private road shall be identified by name if the road serves four or more lots. Whenever a private road outlot is proposed, the subdivider shall be required to provide for a permanent homeowners' association or road maintenance agreement acceptable to the city in order to ensure ownership and maintenance of the road outlot. 
(4)  Road and utilities easements. The council may, upon recommendation of the planning commission and/or city staff, require the subdivider to convey to the city certain road and utilities easements permitting public ingress, egress and access over private roads as a condition of final subdivision approval. 
a.  Whenever a private access road is authorized, the required outlot shall be included on and conveyed in a road and utilities easement in the standard city form. 
b.  Whenever areas of the plat are to be set aside for public or private utility construction and use, such areas shall be described and dedicated for public use on the plat. This shall include areas shown on record plat drawings as drainage and utilities easements. 
c.  Whenever a road and utilities easement is required, the easement shall be fully executed prior to final plat approval, using the legal descriptions of the final plat, and shall thereafter be filed in the chain of title of the property concurrent with the filing of the final plat. 
(5)  Flowage and conservation easements. The council may, upon recommendation of the planning commission and/or city staff, require the subdivider to convey to the city a flowage and conservation easement restricting the use, improvement and development of certain portions of the land to be subdivided. Flowage and conservation easements will be made a condition of final plat approval as follows: 
a.  Whenever any open water, creek, stream or natural drainageway occurs in any portion of the subject tract, the floodplain or floodway of the lake, pond, stream, creek or drainageway shall be described as a drainage easement subject to a flowage and conservation easement to the city. 
b.  Whenever any wetlands, marshlands or lowland acting as a stormwater retention area occurs within any portion of the subject tract, that area shall be described consistent with established flood or water retention elevations, soil type characteristics and vegetation characteristics as a drainage easement subject to a flowage and conservation easement to the city. 
c.  Flowage and conservation easements may be described and conveyed by metes and bounds with the ownership and maintenance responsibilities remaining with the individual parcels of class I subdivisions. 
d.  Whenever a flowage and conservation easement is required, the easement shall be fully executed prior to final plat approval, using the legal descriptions of the final plat, and shall thereafter be filed in the chain of title of the property concurrent with the filing of the final plat. 
(6)  Homeowners' association agreements. The council may, upon recommendation of the planning commission and/or city staff, require the subdivider to create a viable homeowners' association, acceptable to the city, which will be responsible for the ownership and maintenance of, among other things, common facilities, private roads, private sewer and water lines, open space, pathways, drainageways, and drainage ponds, and any improvements which are not to be accepted by the city for public ownership and maintenance. Such maintenance shall include, among other things, repair, replacement when necessary, snow removal, grass cutting, weed control, cleanup of trash and debris, mosquito control, odor control, silt removal from drainage ponds and drainageways, and grading and surfacing of private roads. If a reasonable maintenance standard is not maintained by the homeowners' association, the city shall have the right to take corrective action it deems appropriate to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public and to assess against the homeowners' association and/or land in the subdivision for all costs incurred. Such corrective action will not change the status of a private improvement. Such a homeowners' association agreement is required by the city; or whenever a subdivider intends to create a homeowners' association, the form and content of the association agreement must be approved by the city prior to final plat approval. The subdivider shall submit three copies of the proposed association agreement, bylaws and articles of incorporation for incorporated associations to the city attorney for review. 
(7)  Subdivider's agreements. The council may, upon the recommendation of the planning commission and/or city staff, require the subdivider to execute a subdivider's agreement prior to final plat approval. The subdivider's agreement shall set forth in the standard city form those improvements required to be completed as a condition of subdivision approval, the party responsible for the installation and maintenance of the improvements, and the method of payment of the installation and maintenance costs. 
(Code 1984, § 11.10(21)) 
Sec. 82-213. - Assurance for completion and maintenance of required public or private improvements-Improvements and public bond (class II and III subdivisions). 
    The following provisions apply to class II and class III subdivisions: 
(1)  Completion of required public or private improvements. Before the mayor and city clerk sign a final plat, the subdivider shall complete or agree to complete at his cost all of the required public or private improvements as required in this chapter and as specified in the resolution approving the final plat and in the subdivider's agreement, and in the case of public improvements, to dedicate them to the city, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public improvements thus dedicated. 
(2)  Performance bond. 
a.  The city may waive the requirement that the subdivider complete certain public and private improvements and dedicate certain public improvements prior to the signing of the final plat, and that, as an alternative, the subdivider post a bond at the time of the application for the final plat approval in an amount estimated by the city engineer as sufficient to secure to the city the satisfactory construction, installation and where appropriate dedication of the incompleted portion of the required private and public improvement. The amount of the performance bond shall be equal to 11/2 times the estimated amount. 
b.  Such performance bonds shall comply with all statutory requirements and be satisfactory to the city attorney as to form and manner of execution. The period within which the required public and private improvements must be completed shall be specified by the city in the resolution approving the final subdivision plat or in the subdivider's agreement and shall be incorporated in the bond and shall not exceed two years from date of final plat approval. The city may, upon proof of difficulty, extend the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one additional year. The city may at any time during the period of such bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond. 
(3)  Temporary improvement. The subdivider shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by the city and shall maintain them for the period specified by the city. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, the subdivider shall file with the city a separate suitable performance bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained and removed. 
(4)  Cost of improvements. All required public and private improvements shall be made by the subdivider, at his expense, without reimbursement by the city. 
(5)  Governmental units. Governmental units to which these bonds and contract provisions apply may file in lieu of a contract or bond a certified resolution or ordinance of that governmental unit's agreeing to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
(6)  Failure to complete required improvements. For subdivisions for which no performance bond has been posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period specified by the city in the resolution approving the final plat, the approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a performance bond has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the term of such performance bond and resolution approving the final plat, the city may thereupon declare the bond in default and require that all improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default. Moreover, the city may withhold building permits and certificates of occupancy for lots in the subdivision until the required improvements have been installed. If the city undertakes the installation of the required private improvements, the city, by doing so, will not undertake the subsequent maintenance of those private improvements. 
(7)  Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of streets, public areas, easements and parks for which the city thereafter will be responsible shall be by resolution of the city. Acceptance of deeds and easements granting to the city open spaces, flowage and conservation easements, underlying public road easements, and utility easements shall be by resolution approving the final subdivision plats, which acceptance shall not be deemed to constitute or imply acceptance of a formal dedication of those properties for which the city thereafter would be responsible. The approval by the city of a final plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply acceptance by the city of any streets, easement or park shown on the plat. The city may require the plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. 
(Code 1984, § 11.12) 
Sec. 82-214. - Inspection of required public and private improvements. 
(a)  General procedure and fees. The city may inspect required public and private improvements during construction. The applicant shall pay to the city an inspection fee based on the current city fee schedule for public and private improvements required as a result of subdivision approval. If the city finds upon inspection that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the city's construction standards and specifications, the subdivider shall be responsible for completing the improvements; and no building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until the required improvements have been completed by the subdivider. Wherever the cost of improvements is covered by a performance bond, the subdivider and the bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the improvements according to specifications. 
(b)  Release or reduction of performance bond. 
(1)  Certificate of satisfactory completion. The city will not accept dedication of required improvements, nor release nor reduce a performance bond, until the city engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the subdivider's engineer or surveyor has certified to the city engineer, through submission of a detailed as-built construction drawing and survey plat of the subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials and other information required by the city, that the layout of the line and grade of all required improvements is in accordance with construction plans for the subdivision. The city may require that a title insurance policy be furnished to and approved by the city attorney, indicating that the required public improvements are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances. Upon such approval and recommendations, the city may thereafter accept the public improvements for dedication in accordance with the established procedure. 
(2)  Reduction of performance bond. A performance bond may be reduced upon actual dedication of public improvements or upon satisfactory completion of the private improvement and then only to the ratio that the improvement bears to the total required improvements for the plat. In no event shall a performance bond be reduced below 25 percent of the principal amount until satisfactory completion of all required improvements. 
(Code 1984, § 11.13) 
Sec. 82-215. - Maintenance of required public and private improvements. 
(a)  The subdivider shall be required to maintain all private improvements and individual lot improvements and provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks until acceptance of such private improvements by a subsequent lot owner or homeowners' association. The subdivider shall be required to maintain all public improvements and provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks until acceptance of such public improvements by resolution of the city. If there are any certificates of occupancy upon a street not already dedicated to and accepted by the city, the city may on 12-hours' notice plow the street or effect emergency repairs and charge the cost to the subdivider, and, if the subdivider fails to pay those amounts within ten days of receipt, the city may declare a portion of the performance bond to be in default and to charge those moneys against that portion of the performance bond. 
(b)  The subdivider shall be required to file a warranty bond with the city, prior to the issuance of the certificate of satisfactory completion, in an amount considered adequate by the city engineer and in a form satisfactory to the city attorney in order to ensure the satisfactory condition of the required public and/or private improvements, including all lot improvements on the individual subdivided lots for a period of one year after the date of the issuance of the certificate of satisfactory completion. 
(Code 1984, § 11.14) 
Sec. 82-216. - Deferral of required public or private improvements. 
(a)  The city may defer at the time of the approval of the final subdivision, subject to appropriate conditions, the installation of any or all such public or private improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of the inadequacy or lack of connecting public or private improvements. 
(b)  Whenever it is deemed necessary by the city to defer the construction of any public or private improvements required in this section because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting public or private improvements, or for other reasons, the subdivider shall pay his estimated share of the cost of the future improvements to the city prior to the signing of the final subdivision; or the subdivider may post a bond insuring completion of such improvements upon demand of the city. 
(Code 1984, § 11.15) 
Sec. 82-217. - Nonresidential subdivisions. 
(a)  General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect to such land shall make such provision as the council may require. A nonresidential subdivision shall also be subject to all the requirements of the site plan approval set forth in chapter 78. Site plan approval and nonresidential subdivision approval may proceed simultaneously at the discretion of the council. A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of this chapter, as well as such additional standards required by the council, and shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in the comprehensive municipal plan, and chapter 78. 
(b)  Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in this chapter, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the subdivider shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the council that the street, parcel and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be observed: 
(1)  Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated. 
(2)  Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated upon them. 
(3)  Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to street, curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and construction. 
(4)  Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and stormwater drainage. 
(5)  Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision, including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped buffer strip when necessary. 
(6)  Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or potential residential areas. 
(Code 1984, § 11.61) 
Sec. 82-218. - Subdivisions straddling municipal and school district boundaries. 
    Whenever access to subdivision is required across land in another local government, the council may request assurance from the city attorney that access is legally established, and from the city engineer that the access road is adequately improved, or that a performance bond has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure the construction of the access road. In general, lot lines shall be laid out so as not to cross municipal and school district boundary lines. 
(Code 1984, § 11.30(2)) 
Sec. 82-219. - Monuments. 
    The applicant shall place permanent reference monuments in the subdivision as required by statute. 
(Code 1984, § 11.30(3)) 
Sec. 82-220. - Character of the land. 
    Land which the council finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, soil conditions, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the council, upon recommendation of the city engineer, to solve the problems created by the unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not involve such a danger. 
(Code 1984, § 11.30(4)) 
Sec. 82-221. - Subdivision name. 
    The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered by this chapter. The council shall have final authority to designate the name of the subdivision, which shall be determined at preliminary subdivision approval. 
(Code 1984, § 11.30(5)) 
Sec. 82-222. - Drainage and storm sewers. 
(a)  General requirements. The city shall not approve any subdivision which does not make adequate provision for stormwater or floodwater runoff. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown for each lot and block. The stormwater drainage system shall be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed by the method as approved by the city, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried across or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter in urban areas. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point; and basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point. 
(b)  Nature of stormwater facilities. 
(1)  Location. The subdivision shall be required by the city to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either previously to or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in accordance with the city's construction standards and specifications. 
(2)  Accessibility to public storm sewers. 
a.  Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the subdivider shall install storm sewer facilities; or, if no outlets are within a reasonable distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of stormwaters, subject to the specifications of the city. However, in subdivisions containing lots less than 22,000 square feet in area and in business and industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall be constructed throughout the subdivisions and be conducted to an approved outfall. 
b.  If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually, as determined by the city, the subdivider shall make arrangements for future stormwater disposal by a public utility system at the time the subdivision receives final approval. Provision for such connection shall be incorporated by inclusion in the performance bond required for the final subdivision. 
(3)  Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. The city shall determine the necessary size of the facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development permitted by chapter 78 and comprehensive municipal plan. 
(4)  Effect on downstream drainage areas. The city shall also study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. City drainage studies, together with such other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the city may withhold approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of the potential condition at the subdivider's expense and in such sum as the city shall determine. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an adequate drainage watercourse or facility. 
(5)  Floodplain areas. The city may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety or welfare of the population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage and sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the floodplain of any stream, lake or drainage course. These floodplain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or damage resulting from clearing, grading or dumping of earth, waste material or stumps by the appropriate conservation easement. 
(c)  Dedication of drainage easements. 
(1)  General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a wetlands, swamp, watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement, conservation and flowage easement, or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of such width and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for maximum potential volume of flow. 
(2)  Drainage easements. 
a.  Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines and with satisfactory access to a public roadway. Easements shall be indicated on the plan if subdivision is a plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural watercourse or to other drainage facilities. 
b.  When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the plan if the subdivision is a plat. 
c.  The subdivider shall dedicate, by drainage or conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a distance to be determined by the city. 
d.  Wetlands, swamps and low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainageways; and conservation and flowage easements for those areas shall be dedicated to the city. Such lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be computed in determining the number of lots to be utilized for average density procedure nor for computing the area requirements of any lot. 
(Code 1984, § 11.41) 
Sec. 82-223. - Water facilities. 
(a)  Public water systems. 
(1)  Where a public water main is accessible, the subdivider shall install adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, subject to the specifications of the state or city. 
(2)  Water main extensions shall be approved by the city. 
(3)  To facilitate the provisions of subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the location of all fire hydrants and all water supply improvements and all improvements proposed to be served shall be shown on the preliminary subdivision, and the cost of installing such improvements shall be included in the performance bond to be furnished by the subdivider. 
(b)  Individual wells. 
(1)  In the discretion of the city, if a public water system is not available, individual wells may be used. Water samples shall be submitted to the state health department for its approval. 
(2)  If the city requires that a connection to a public water main be eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual well, the subdivider shall make arrangements for future water service at the time the subdivision receives final approval. 
(Code 1984, § 11.42) 
Sec. 82-224. - Sewerage facilities. 
(a)  General requirements. Where public sanitary sewer is available, the subdivider shall install sanitary sewer facilities in a manner prescribed by the city's construction standards, specifications and provisions of this Code. All plans shall be designed in accordance with the rules, regulations and standards of the city, state health department, and other appropriate agencies. Plans shall be approved by these agencies. 
(b)  Connection. Where a public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible, the applicant shall connect the system and provide sewers accessible to each lot in the subdivision. 
(c)  Central system. Where public sanitary sewerage systems are not reasonably accessible but will become available within a reasonable time (not to exceed 15 years), the applicant may choose a central sewerage system. The maintenance cost shall be assessed against each property benefited. Where plans for future public sanitary sewerage systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals and mains to be in permanent conformance with such plans and ready for connection to such public sewer mains. 
(d)  Septic system. Where sanitary sewerage systems are not reasonably accessible and will not become available for a period in excess of 15 years, the applicant may install a sewerage system in accordance with chapter 58, article II. 
(e)  Design criteria for sanitary sewers. 
(1)  Generally. These design criteria are not intended to cover extraordinary situations. Deviations will be allowed and may be required in those instances where considered justified by the city. 
(2)  Design factors. Sanitary sewerage systems should be designed for the ultimate tributary population. Due consideration should be given to current zoning regulations and approved planning and zoning reports where applicable. Sewer capacities should be adequate to handle the anticipated maximum hourly quantity of sewage and industrial waste together with an adequate allowance for infiltration and other extraneous flow. Sewers shall be designed in accordance with standards and specifications approved by the city. 
(Code 1984, § 11.43) 
Sec. 82-225. - Utilities. 
(a)  Location. All utility facilities, including but not limited to gas, electric power, telephone and CATV cables, shall be located underground throughout a subdivision. Wherever existing utility facilities are located above ground, except where existing on public roads and rights-of-way, they shall be removed and placed underground. All utility facilities existing and proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary subdivision plan. Underground service connections to the street property line of each platted lot shall be installed at the subdivider's expense. At the discretion of the city, the requirements for service connections to each lot may be waived in the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership and intended to be developed for the same primary use. 
(b)  Easements. Easements centered on rear and side lot lines shall be provided for utilities (private and municipal), and such easement shall be at least ten feet wide and have satisfactory access to the publicly dedicated and opened road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat. Proper coordination shall be established between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for the establishment of utility easements established in adjoining properties. 
(Code 1984, § 11.45) 
Sec. 82-226. - Preservation of natural features and amenities. 
(a)  Generally. Existing features which would add value to residential development or to the city as a whole, such as trees, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change of grade of the land effected until approval of the preliminary subdivision has been granted. All trees on the subdivision plan required to be retained shall be preserved, and all trees where required shall be welled and protected against change of grade. The vegetation map shall show the number and location of existing trees, as required by this chapter, and shall further indicate all those marked for retention, and the location of all proposed shade trees required along the street side of each lot as required by this chapter. 
(b)  Shade trees planted by subdivider. 
(1)  As a requirement of subdivision approval, the city may require that the subdivider plant shade trees on the property of the subdivision. Such trees are to be planted within five feet of the right-of-way of the roads within and abutting the subdivision, or, at the discretion of the city, within the right-of-way of such roads. One tree shall be planted for every 40 feet of frontage along each road unless the council, upon recommendation of city staff, shall grant a waiver. 
(2)  New trees to be provided pursuant to this chapter shall be approved by the city and shall be planted in accordance with the specifications of the city. Such trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter, measured 12 inches above ground level, of not less than two inches. Only oak, honey locust, hard maples, ginkgo, ash or other long-lived shade trees acceptable to the city shall be planted. 
(Code 1984, § 11.60) 
Sec. 82-227. - Parks and playgrounds, class II and III subdivisions. 
    The following provisions apply to class II and III subdivisions: 
(1)  Lands for public use. The city finds that when land is subdivided, including a planned residential development or a planned unit development, the resulting additional housing units or commercial/industrial buildings have an impact on the city's park system. Therefore, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 462.358, subd. 2b, the city requires all persons, corporations or other legal entities that subdivide land within the city, as a prerequisite to approval of a lot division, final plat, planned residential development or planned unit development, to convey to the city or dedicate to the public, for use as parks, playgrounds, trails or open space, a given percentage of the land being platted or developed as specified in this section, such portions to be approved by the city. In lieu thereof, the subdivider shall, at the option of the city, pay to the city, for use in the acquisition, development or improvement of public parks, playgrounds, trails, wetlands or open spaces and debt retirement in connection with the foregoing, an equivalent amount in cash based upon the fair market value of the land to be developed. The form of contribution (cash, land, or any combination) shall be decided by the city council based upon the need and conformance with the comprehensive plan. The amount of the dedication requirement shall be roughly proportional to the impact of the subdivision on the city's park system. 
(2)  Dedicated land requirements. Any land to be dedicated as a requirement of this section shall be reasonably adaptable for the public purposes listed in subsection (1) of this section. Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of proposed dedicated areas shall include size, shape, topography, drainage, geology, tree cover, access and location. 
(3)  Land dedication minimum area. Subdividers shall be required to dedicate to the city for parks, playgrounds, trails, open spaces and other public purposes as a minimum that percentage of gross land area, or other such amount as may be determined by the city council, as set forth below: 
a.  In residential/agricultural/multiple residential zoned land, dedication requirement of eight percent of the land being platted or subdivided. The dedication required shall be roughly proportional to the projected impact of the proposed development on the city's park system. Because of the vastly differing land values in the city, the eight percent park dedication requirement could result in park dedication requirements that are either significantly greater than or significantly less than the amount which is roughly proportional to the impact of the proposed development on the city's park system. Periodically, therefore, the city will establish both a maximum and minimum park dedication amount per dwelling unit based on an updated projection of the cost of the city's park system and the proportionate share of this projected cost to be borne by new dwelling units in the city. This will be done by a resolution of the city council. 
b.  In commercial/industrial zoned land, dedication requirement of eight percent of the land being platted or subdivided. The dedication required shall be roughly proportional to the projected impact of the proposed development on the city's park system. The city finds that the employees of commercial/industrial developments in the city make use of the city's park system, particularly trails and natural areas. Because the city's park system is focused on trails and natural areas versus active community parks and ballfields, commercial/industrial employees use the city's park system in ways similar to city residents. Therefore, the commercial/industrial dedication requirement will be tied to the residential dedication requirement by determining the number of employees that is equivalent to a residential dwelling unit in terms of impact on the city's park system. Periodically the city will establish both a maximum and minimum park dedication amount per employee based on this determination and the determination of the residential dedication requirement as set out in subsection (3)a of this section. This will be done by resolution of the city council. 
c.  Because the city's park system is focused on trails and natural open space areas, the city does not have a broad system of neighborhood parks. If a subdivision is planned to be served by a neighborhood park, this subdivision will receive a greater benefit from the city's park system than that received by the general population. Therefore, the maximum park dedication amount as determined in subsection (3)a of this section may be exceeded up to the full eight percent dedication requirement in the case of a subdivision that is planned to be served by a neighborhood park. 
(4)  Cash contribution in lieu of lands. In those instances where a cash contribution is to be made by the subdivider, in lieu of a conveyance or dedication of land, the cash contribution to be contributed shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the equivalent undeveloped land that would otherwise have been conveyed or dedicated. The city shall account for such funds in a special fund named park dedication funds. These funds are to be used only for the acquisition, development and improvement of public parks, playgrounds, trails, wetlands or open spaces, and debt retirement in connection with the foregoing. 
(5)  Fair market value of lands. Fair market value for purposes of this section shall be the land predevelopment value to be determined by the city council as of the time of preliminary plat application in accordance with the following: 
a.  The city assessor shall recommend to the city council as to the fair market value of the land after consultation with the subdivider. 
b.  If agreement is not reached between the city assessor and subdivider, the fair market value shall be determined in accordance with the following: 
1.  Fair market value as determined by the city council based upon a current appraisal submitted to the city by the subdivider, at his expense. The appraisal shall be made by appraisers who are approved members of SREA or MAI, or equivalent real estate societies. 
2.  If the city disputes such appraisal amounts, it may obtain an appraisal of the property by a qualified real estate appraiser which the city council selects and which appraisal may be accepted by the city as being an accurate appraisal at fair market value. The cost of the appraisal shall be paid by the subdivider. 
c.  The determination of fair market value of the undeveloped land by the city assessor, city council or designated appraisers shall be determined at the time of preliminary subdivision approval, provided that there is final plat approval within the time limits as set forth in this chapter. The time of preliminary plat approval is utilized because the nature of the subdivision, its probable population, lot size and value, and other relevant factors are known. If an extension of the time limits in this chapter is approved by the city council, the fair market value shall be determined as of the time of the approval of that extension. In determining the fair market value as of time of preliminary plat application, or its extension, the factors to be included in the analysis shall include any and all factors which are generally accepted and used by approved members of SREA or MAI or equivalent real estate appraisal societies. 
(6)  Future subdivision. Any land which is further subdivided, divided or replatted or applied for such subdivision, division or replatting subsequent to May 1, 1990, shall be subject to the requirements of the ordinance then in effect concerning dedication of land for public purposes; and credit shall be given for any charges previously imposed upon that land if the subdivider can prove that fees were previously paid. In no event shall the city be liable for any payment which may be due because of a subsequent reduction in the application percentage of land or equivalent market value in cash to be dedicated.

DIVISION 2. - LOTS 

Sec. 82-251. - Performance bond to include lot improvement. 
    The performance bond shall include an amount to guarantee completion of all requirements contained in this division, including but not limited to soil preservation, final grading, lot drainage, lawn-grass seeding, removal of debris and waste, fencing, and all other lot improvements required by the city. 
(Code 1984, § 11.31(9)) 
Sec. 82-252. - Lot arrangement. 
    The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with chapter 78 and in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved street. 
(Code 1984, § 11.31(1)) 
Sec. 82-253. - Lot dimensions. 
    Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of chapter 78. Where lots are more than double the minimum required area for the zoning district, the city may require that such lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance with chapter 78. In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both streets. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in chapter 78. 
(Code 1984, § 11.31(2)) 
Sec. 82-254. - Lot area, minimum. 
    The minimum area requirements for each proposed lot as prescribed in chapter 78. The lot area must also comply with chapter 58, article II. Public and private rights-of-way, vehicular or pedestrian easements, or surface areas below the ordinary high water mark of any surface water or wetlands or floodplain areas may not be used in order to meet any portion of the minimum lot area requirements. 
(Code 1984, § 11.31(3)) 
Sec. 82-255. - Lakeshore lots. 
    The granting of easements which purport to grant access to the lake to any person for any uses, including but not limited to docking, mooring, swimming and launching of boats, is prohibited and shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subject to all of the penalties and proceedings as set forth in this chapter. 
(Code 1984, § 11.31(4)) 
Sec. 82-256. - Double-frontage lots, access to lots, and front/back lot divisions. 
(a)  Double-frontage lots. Double-frontage and reversed-frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
(b)  Access from any arterial roadway. Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from an arterial roadway. Where driveway access from any arterial roadway may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the council may require that such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazard on such roadway. Where possible, driveways shall be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on any arterial roadway. 
(c)  Front/back lot subdivisions. Flag lots and easement back lots shall not be created. Front/back lot divisions shall be allowed only in conjunction with the creation of an outlot to provide access from the back lot to the public or private road. Such outlot shall not be allowed as creditable lot area for either the back or front lots. Front/back lot subdivisions shall adhere to the following standards: 
(1)  Applicability. 
a.  Front/back lot divisions may be used when existing property dimensions are narrow and deep, such that lot width does not allow for a side-by-side lot split, but acreage is adequate to provide a front lot and a back lot without requiring an area variance when the area of the outlot access corridor is excluded. 
b.  Front/back lot divisions may be used for individual lot splits but may not be used when subdividing a large parcel into numerous lots if creation of a back lot is merely a convenience to the developer rather than supported by unique site factors. 
c.  A front/back lot division shall not be allowed when any existing residence on a neighboring property abutting the proposed access outlot is located nearer its affected side lot line than a distance equivalent to the zoning district required front yard depth. 
(2)  Dimensional standards. Dimensional standards for back lots shall be as follows: 
a.  Lot area shall be 150 percent of the zoning district requirement. Wetlands may be allowed as area credit for meeting the 150 percent back lot area requirement, as long as the back lot contains sufficient contiguous dry buildable land to satisfy the minimum acreage requirement of the underlying zoning district. 
b.  Lot width measured parallel to the front or street lot line at the street yard setback line of a lakeshore back lot, or at the rear of the front yard setback line of a non-lakeshore back lot, shall meet the zoning district width requirement. The street yard or front yard for any back lot will be a yard starting where the narrow access outlot corridor ends and the lot begins. Lakeshore back lots shall meet the lot width standard at the shoreline, at the lakeshore setback line and at the street yard setback line. 
c.  The depth of the required street yard or front yard shall be 150 percent of the zoning district front yard requirement. 
d.  The required side yard and rear yard depths for back lots shall be 150 percent of the zoning district yard requirements. The required lakeshore yard of a lakeshore back lot shall meet the zoning district lakeshore yard requirements. 
(3)  Dimensional standards for front lots. A front lot created as part of a front/back lot division shall meet all zoning district area, width and setback standards; except that the required side yard of the front lot adjacent to the access outlot shall be equivalent to the side street yard requirement for that zoning district. 
(4)  Access requirements. 
a.  Access outlots shall be 30 feet minimum width, and shall be wide enough to accommodate drainage, snow removal and screening without encroaching on neighboring properties. 
b.  In approving front/back lot divisions, the city may require that both front lot and back lot share a driveway access within the access outlot if the council determines that creating an additional access to the existing street will be a potential safety hazard. 
c.  Driveways within a back lot shall be located at least ten feet from the side or rear lot lines of adjacent lots. 
d.  No more than two residences may be served by a driveway located within an access outlot. 
e.  No access outlot may be platted abutting an adjacent outlot except when the intent is to combine the two access outlots for creation of a public or private road meeting city standards. 
(5)  Screening requirements and accessory structure standards. Front/back lot subdivisions shall be designed in a manner such that the screening requirements and accessory structure standards of section 78-1370 can be met. 
(6)  Effective date. The requirements and standards of this section shall apply only to those front/back lot divisions which received preliminary plat approval after January 1, 1994. 
(Code 1984, § 11.31(5); Ord. No. 122 2nd series, § 3, 12-13-1993; Ord. No. 64 3rd series, § 2, 9-14-2009) 
Sec. 82-257. - Soil preservation, grading and seeding. 
(a)  Soil preservation and final grading. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until final grading has been completed in accordance with the approved final subdivision and the lot precovered with soil with an average depth of at least six inches, which shall contain no particles over two inches in diameter over the entire area of the lot, except that portion covered by buildings or included in streets, or where the grade has not been changed or natural vegetation seriously damaged. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least three inches of cover on the lots and boulevards. 
(b)  Lawn-grass seed and sod. Lawn-grass seed shall be sown at not less than four pounds to each 1,000 square feet of land area. The seed shall consist of a maximum of ten percent rye grass by weight and a minimum of 90 percent of permanent bluegrass and/or fescue grass by weight. All seed shall have been tested for germination within one year of the date of seeding, and the date of testing shall be on the label containing the seed analysis. All lots shall be seeded from the roadside edge of the unpaved right-of-way back to a distance of 25 feet behind the principal residence on the lot. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until respreading of soil and seeding of lawn has been completed; except that during the period of the year when seed cannot be sown, the property owner and/or developer shall submit an agreement in writing to assure that respreading of soil and seeding of lawn will be done during the immediate following planting season, and shall leave a security in a form acceptable to the city for performance in such an amount as shall be determined by the city. The developer may choose to include final lot grading and required lawn grass seeding improvements in a subdivider's agreement and shall leave a security in a form acceptable to the city for performance in such an amount as shall be determined by the city. Sod may be used to comply with any requirements of seeding set forth in this section. 
(c)  Lot drainage. Lots shall be graded so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots. 
(Code 1984, § 11.31(6)) 
Sec. 82-258. - Debris and waste. 
    No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy on a subdivision, nor shall any be left or deposited in any area of the subdivision at the time of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of public improvements, whichever is sooner. 
(Code 1984, § 11.31(7)) 
Sec. 82-259. - Water bodies and watercourses. 
    If a tract being subdivided contains a body of water, marsh, wetlands, etc., or a portion of such areas, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of those areas among the fee owners of adjacent lots. The council may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of those areas is so placed that it will not become the city's responsibility. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, of a design approved by the city.

DIVISION 3. - ROADS AND PUBLIC WAYS 

Sec. 82-281. - Design standards. 
(a)  Generally. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation and road maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards for roads are required: 
(1)  Road surfacing and improvements. After the sewer and water utilities have been installed by the subdivider, the subdivider shall construct all road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, culs-de-sac, and sidewalks in conformance with all construction standards and specifications adopted by the city and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted to the subdivider for final subdivision approval. 
(2)  Rights-of-way. Rights-of-way shall be in accordance with the following performance standard: 
a.  Minimum right-of-way widths. 
Principal arterial, intermediate arterial As recommended by the State Department of Transportation Minor arterial  80 feet Collector  70 feet Local  50 feet Parkway 100 feet Culs-de-sac  50 feet radius  
b.  Rights-of-way are needed for future roadways in the opinion of the city. 
c.  Right-of-way widths or additional widths in existing rights-of-way in excess of the standards designated in this chapter when, due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes shall not be in excess of 3:1. 
(b)  Railroads and limited-access roadways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited-access roadways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows: 
(1)  In residential districts, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited-access roadway. 
(2)  In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall be at a sufficient distance to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites. 
(3)  Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade shall be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
(4)  Streets crossing the railroads shall be avoided. 
(c)  Intersections. 
(1)  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle or less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet from the intersection. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the city. 
(2)  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Intersection jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be continuous. Intersections of arterial roadways shall be at least 800 feet apart. 
(3)  Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets shall be at least 15 feet, and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving a collector street or local streets in a commercial or industrial area shall be at least 25 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement. 
(4)  Intersections shall be designed with a flat stopping area of at least 30 feet in a residential area and 60 feet in a commercial or industrial area. The stopping area shall be designed to provide a maximum grade of two percent. 
(5)  Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the subdivider shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary by the city to provide an adequate sight distance. 
(6)  The crown of all streets, including intersections, shall be three percent or less. 
(d)  Typical section. The typical section indicated in this subsection is as determined for a clay subgrade (A-6 soil classification) and may be subject to change. Soil borings may be required to be determined by the city.

Sec. 82-282. - Off-site premises; roadways. 
(a)  Access to improved public or private roadways. No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided shall have adequate access from an existing publicly dedicated and opened roadway or on a private roadway open to travel or vehicular use pursuant to an easement between persons or between persons and the city. Such roadway must be suitably improved as required by the city, the state or the county. If the public roadway, including but not limited to existing bridges, drainage structures, lighting, shoulders, base, pavement, alignment or sight distance, is not suitable to handle the proposed additional vehicular traffic from the subdivision, the subdivider at his expense will be responsible for first improving the public roadway to a standard acceptable to the city, to ensure that the health, safety and welfare of the citizens presently using the roadway and in the future will be protected and will not be adversely affected by the increased use of the roadway caused by the subdivision. This improvement shall be accomplished prior to final subdivision approval unless the city agrees and the subdivider provides a suitable performance bond to complete the improvements in the subdivider's agreement. 
(b)  Access to improved public roadways over existing private roadways. Wherever the area to be subdivided is to utilize an existing private roadway in order to gain access to the public roadway, such private roadway shall be suitably improved as provided in this section for public roadways. 
(Code 1984, § 11.32(1)) 
Sec. 82-283. - On-site roadways. 
(a)  Grading and improvement plan. Roadways shall be graded and improved to conform to the city's construction standards and specifications and shall be approved as to design and specifications by the city engineer, in accordance with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to final subdivision approval. 
(b)  Topography and arrangement. 
(1)  Roadways shall be related appropriately to the topography. Roadways shall be curved wherever possible to avoid conformity of lot appearance. All roadways shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as possible of the building sites at or above the grades of the street. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided. 
(2)  All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established in the comprehensive municipal plan. 
(3)  All thoroughfares shall be properly related to specific traffic generators, such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses. 
(4)  Roadways shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of roadways necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property. 
(5)  The gridiron roadway pattern need not necessarily be adhered to, and the use of curvilinear roadways or U-shaped roadways shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable layout. 
(6)  Culs-de-sac shall be discouraged; proposed roadways shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless in the opinion of the city such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. 
(7)  In business and industrial developments, the roadways and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provisions of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian. 
(c)  Blocks. 
(1)  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to arterial roadways, railroads or waterways. 
(2)  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated; but block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 1,500 feet or 12 times the minimum lot width required in the zoning district, nor be less than 400 feet in length from centerline to centerline of adjacent streets. Wherever practicable, blocks along arterial collector roadways shall be not less than 1,000 feet in length. 
(3)  In all blocks, the city shall require the reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities or pedestrian traffic. Pedestrian ways or crosswalks, not less than ten feet wide, may be required by the city through the center of blocks more than 800 feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation of access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation or other community facilities. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be determined suitable by the city for prospective use. 
(d)  Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial, the city may require that access to such roadways be limited by one of the following means: 
(1)  The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the arterials and front onto a parallel local or collector roadway; no access shall be provided from the arterial, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the rear property line of such lots. 
(2)  A series of culs-de-sac, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial. 
(3)  A marginal-access or service road separated from the arterial by a planting or grass strip and having access to the arterial at suitable points. 
(e)  Road names and street addresses. The sketch plan as submitted shall not indicate any names upon proposed streets. The city shall name all roads at the time of preliminary subdivision approval and assign street addresses. The local postmaster shall be consulted by the zoning administrator. Names shall be sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other road names in the area so as not to cause confusion. A road which is or is planned as a continuation of an existing road shall bear the same name. 
(f)  Road regulatory signs. The subdivider shall deposit with the city at the time of final subdivision approval the sum of money as determined by the city for each road sign and the installation cost. The city shall install all road signs before issuance of certificates of occupancy for any residence on the streets approved. The city shall place all signs at the developer's expense at all intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which shall be approved by the city. 
(g)  Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property to such street. 
(h)  Construction of roads and dead-end roads. 
(1)  Construction of roads. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of streets between adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, for efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation is in accordance with the city comprehensive municipal plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. The city may limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with this chapter. 
(2)  Dead-end roads (permanent). Where a road does not extend to the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the city for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the city may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic or utilities. A cul-de-sac shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with the city's construction standards and specifications. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be discouraged and where allowed be limited in length in accordance with this chapter. 
(Code 1984, § 11.32(2)) 
Sec. 82-284. - Road dedication and reservations. 
(a)  New perimeter streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The city may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width within his own subdivision boundaries. 
(b)  Widening and realignment of existing roads. Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road or when the comprehensive municipal plan or some other agency indicates plans for realignment or widening a road that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to improve and dedicate at his expense such areas for widening or realignment of such roads. Such frontage roads and streets shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider at his own expense to the full width as required by this chapter. 
(c)  Use of reserved land. Land reserved for any road purposes may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of chapter 78, whether the land is to be dedicated to the city in fee simple or an easement is granted to the city. 
(Code 1984, § 11.40) 
Sec. 82-285. - Pedestrian access. 
    The council may require sidewalks or other pedestrian pathways in order to facilitate pedestrian access from the roads to schools, parks, playgrounds or other nearby roads at least five feet in width. Sidewalks shall be five feet in width and pathways no more than eight feet in width.
