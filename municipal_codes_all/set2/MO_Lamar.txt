PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Lamar, Missouri. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1991 Code, as supplemented through May 19, 2014, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of Aldermen. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1991 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Janis Adams, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Bev Baker, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(e)  All sections, articles, chapters or other provisions of this Code desired to be repealed should be specifically repealed by section number, article number, chapter or other number, as the case may be.

Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any such ordinance or resolution shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  In addition to the penalty provided for in subsection (a) of this section, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code or ordinance or resolution of the city shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated by the city as provided by law, and each day that such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense.

The vote on this question shall be taken by ayes and nays and the names entered upon the journal, and if two-thirds of all the members-elect shall vote in the affirmative, the city clerk shall certify the fact on the roll, and the bill thus certified shall be deposited with the proper officer, and shall become an ordinance in the same manner and with like effect as if it has received the approval of the mayor.

    Special hazard area means an area having special flood hazards and shown on an FHBM, FIRM or FBFM as zones (unnumbered or numbered) A or AE. 
    Start of construction includes substantial improvements, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvements were within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, the installation of streets and/or walkways, excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, the erection of temporary forms, nor installation on the property of accessory structures, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. The term "structure" for insurance purposes, means a walled and roofed building, other than a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home on a permanent foundation.

(3)  The term "substantial damage" does not apply to: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
b.  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure; or 
c.  Any improvement to a building. 
    Substantial improvement. 
(1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any combination of reconstruction, alteration, or improvement to a building, taking place during the life of the building, in which the cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds 50 percent of the current market value of the building. For the purposes of this definition, an improvement occurs when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
(2)  The term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work done. 
(3)  The term "substantial improvement" does not apply to: 
a.  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions; 
b.  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure; or 
c.  Any building that has been damaged from any source or is categorized as repetitive loss. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief by the city from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. Flood insurance requirements remain in place for any varied use or structure and cannot be varied by the city. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplain. 
(Code 1991, § 9-158; Ord. No. 1742, § 2(exh. A), 2-21-2011) 
Sec. 18-21. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by: 
(1)  The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and 
(2)  The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
(1)  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article. It is the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials dated March 17, 2011, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
(2)  Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
(Code 1991, § 9-2; Ord. No. 1742, § 2(exh. A), 2-21-2011) 
Sec. 18-22. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in section 18-21; to establish or maintain the city's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 CFR 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(c) by applying the provisions of this article to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard.

    Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to the pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report containing the information described in section 36-207(b)(4) through (6). For industrial users subject to equivalent mass of concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 36-146. 
(Code 1991, § 18-314; Ord. No. 1430, § 6, 6-15-1992)

(a)  Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard shall, at a frequency determined by the administrator, but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by the pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 36-146. 
(b)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(c)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements in and of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in section 36-217, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.

Sec. 36-212. - Reports of potential problems. 
(a)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in section 36-80), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user. 
(b)  Within five days following the discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the administrator, submit a detailed written report describing the causes of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. The notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall the notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article. 
(c)  Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this article. 
(d)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (a) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

Sec. 36-214. - Notice of violation; repeat sampling and reporting. 
    If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the industrial user's site at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the industrial user's initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling. 
(Code 1991, § 18-319; Ord. No. 1430, § 6, 6-15-1992) 
Sec. 36-215. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. The notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than ten kilograms of the waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent the information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of the constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under the requirements of section 36-211. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 36-207, 36-209, and 36-210. 
(b)  Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than the quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of the substance within 90 days of the effective date of the regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

Sec. 36-217. - Sample collection. 
(a)  Except as indicated in subsection (b) of this section, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the administrator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

Sec. 36-354. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met. 
(c)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the causes of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance. 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue. 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(Code 1991, § 18-330.16; Ord. No. 1430, § 13, 6-15-1992) 
Sec. 36-355. - General and specific prohibitions. 
    An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 36-80 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Code 1991, § 18-330.17; Ord. No. 1430, § 13, 6-15-1992) 
Sec. 36-356. - Bypass. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
    Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. The term "severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  Allowable bypass. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Written and oral notice of bypass. 
(1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible. 
(2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  Bypass prohibitions. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

"PD" Planned Development District
1. Purpose: The purpose of this district is to provide for elements of flexibility in design, placement, arrangement, bulk and other considerations involved in planned districts; to provide a framework within which the structures and uses in the planned district may be interrelated with adjacent development and areas; and to maintain the desired overall intensity of land use, desired population densities, and desired areas of open space. The use of planned zoning procedures is intended to encourage large-scale developments, efficient development of small tracts, innovative and imaginative site planning, and conservation of resources.
2. Use of the "PD" District: With the exception of standard single-family and two-family residential subdivisions, zoning proposals which are intended to be subdivided into multiple lots should seek the "PD" zoning district classification. Planned developments are groupings of structures or sites that are planned as an integrated unit or cluster on property under unified control at the time of zoning. The sale, subdivision or other partition of the site after zoning approval does not exempt the project or portions thereof from complying with the development standards and other conditions that were committed to at the time of the rezoning. The Planned Development District must always be used in conjunction with one of the other zoning districts, known as the "underlying district." The requirements of the "PD" District shall be in addition to the requirements of the underlying district, except that the "PD" District may modify some of the regulations of the underlying district in specific situations. A "PD" District may be used in conjunction with any of the other zoning districts or with any combination of districts.
An application for rezoning to the "PD" District shall include a Preliminary Development Plan and may include a concurrent request to change the underlying zoning classification. If the rezoning is approved, the new district shall include the designation of the underlying district followed by "PD". For example, a Planned Development District of an "R-1" District shall be known as "R-1-PD."
Approval of the rezoning based on the Preliminary Development Plan shall allow the applicant to submit a Final Development Plan for approval. No structure or occupancy permit shall be issued until a Final Development Plan has been approved. The use of the "PD" district shall be separate from the Subdivision Regulations of the City, and the Development Plans required by the "PD" District shall not be construed as plats. It is recommended that the subdivision process follow the Rezoning/Preliminary Plan approval, but precede the approval of the Final Development Plan. Resubdivision may be a prerequisite to approval of the Final Development Plan.
3. Use Regulations: Any use permitted in the underlying zone may be permitted. The uses permitted may be voluntarily restricted by the applicant, or restricted as a condition of approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
4. Height Regulations: The height regulations provided for the underlying zoning district shall be required, provided that the allowed height may be increased by one floor or 15

2. Nonconforming Lots of Record: The Building Inspector shall issue a building permit for any nonconforming lot of record, provided that:

Enlargement, Repair, Alterations: Any nonconforming structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled; provided, however, no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or remodeling shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure; provided further, existing manufactured home parks not meeting the requirements of this ordinance shall be declared nonconforming and shall not be permitted to add spaces or make any improvements inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this ordinance.
C. Damage or Destruction: In the event that any nonconforming structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of its appraised value, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located. When a structure is damaged to the extent of 50 percent or less, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a building permit is obtained and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
D. Moving: No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being moved.

Change in Use: If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may as a conditional use be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board of Adjustment either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with Article 13. Once a change is made to a more appropriate use, the use shall not be returned to the original use or a less appropriate use.
H. Abandonment or Discontinuance: When a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of 12 consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be

A. Status of Existing Conditional Uses: Where a use exists at the effective date of these regulations and is permitted by these regulations only as a conditional use in the zoning district in which it is located, such use shall not be deemed to be a nonconforming use, but shall, without further action, be deemed a lawful con-forming use in such zoning district. Such conditional use shall not be enlarged or expanded unless a conditional use application is approved as set out in Article 11 of these regulations.
B. Status of Future Conditional Uses: Any use for which a conditional use permit has been issued, as provided in these regulations, shall not be deemed to be a nonconforming use, but shall, without further action, be deemed a lawful con-forming use.

CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
1. General Considerations:
A. Delegation of Power: The Board of Aldermen shall decide whether conditional use permits shall be granted only after having received a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission. In no event shall a conditional use permit be granted where the proposed use is not authorized by the terms of these regulations, or where the standards of this Article are not found to exist.
B. Conditions and Guarantees: Prior to the granting of any conditional use permit, the Planning and Zoning Commission or Board of Aldermen may stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the conditional use permit as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and conditions contained herein. In all cases in which a conditional use permit is granted, the Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend or the Board of Aldermen may require such evidence and guarantees as may be deemed necessary to ensure that the conditions stipulated are being, and will be, fully complied with.
C. Conditional Use Permits in Residential Districts: In no event shall conditional use permits in residential districts be transferable from an owner-applicant to a subsequent owner of the subject real estate or structure.
2. Procedures:
A. Application: A written application for a conditional use permit shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and shall include a statement indicating the section of the ordinance under which the permit is sought, the grounds upon which it is requested, and sufficient evidence to show that the use will conform to the standards set forth. The application shall be accompanied by an area map and site plan of the subject property.

SITE PLAN REVIEW
1. Intent: The City of Lamar recognizes that the very nature of land development creates potential for traffic congestion, overcrowding, adverse visual environmental impacts, and health problems. Also, the City strives to achieve the goal of promoting growth in Lamar, while stabilizing the established residential patterns of the area. The City seeks to ensure that any location that must accommodate urban uses, shall be subject to Site Plan Review by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Site Plan Review process shall help ensure that the meaning and intent of the Zoning Regulations, and all portions thereof, are fully complied with.
The Site Plan Review regulates the development of structures and sites in a manner which considers the following concerns:
A. The balancing of landowners' rights to use their land, with the corresponding rights of abutting and neighboring landowners to live without undue disturbances (e.g., noise, smoke, fumes, dust, odor, glare, storm water runoff, etc.);
B. The convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within the site, and in relation to adjacent areas or roads;
C. The adequacy of waste disposal methods and protection from pollution of surface or groundwater;
D. The protection of historic and natural environmental features on the site under review, and in adjacent areas; and
E. The stability of the built environment--particularly residential neighborhoods--by promoting urban development which is compatible with clearly identified natural resources.
2. Applicability: The Zoning Administrator shall require that all applications for building permits for developments in the multifamily, commercial and industrial zoning districts be subject to Site Plan Review in accordance with these regulations, and for redevelop-ments in the following circumstances: if the redevelopment enlarges the size of the original structure by more than 50 percent. Developments shall be encouraged to implement the objectives of the Future Land Use Plan to foster compatibility among land uses in the City of Lamar. Site Plan Reviews shall be performed by the Zoning Administrator, and submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for approval.
3. Site Plan Review: The Planning and Zoning Commission shall perform their review at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission for which the item may be scheduled and shall adjourn and reconvene as is determined necessary.

(3) The impact of this traffic upon existing abutting public and private ways in relation to existing road capacities. Existing and proposed daily and peak hour traffic levels, as well as road capacity levels, shall also be given.
CITY OF LAMAR, MISSOURI ZONING ORDINANCE
Article 12 Site Plan Review
E:\ZONREGS.DOCX April 20, 1998
5. Standard of Review: The recommendations of the Zoning Administrator shall be based on the following standards:

E. The extent to which the location of streets, paths, walkways, and driveways are located so as to enhance safety and minimize any adverse traffic impact on the surrounding area.
6. Development Guidelines, Commercial and Industrial Districts:
In zoning districts permitting commercial and industrial uses, buildings should meet the following minimum guidelines, based on site plan review:
A. Raised exterior walls or screen walls should be designed to enclose groups of equipment. Roof mounted equipment, including ventilators and satellite dishes shall be screened from view (100% opacity) or isolated so as not to be visible from ground level of any adjacent public thoroughfare or residentially-zoned area, up to a maximum of three hundred feet (300') away. The appearance of roof screens shall be coordinated with the building to maintain a unified appearance.
B. The form and proportion of buildings shall be consistent or compatible with the scale, form and proportion of existing development in the immediate area.
C. The use of unusual shapes, color and other characteristics that cause new buildings to call excessive attention to themselves and create disharmony shall not be allowed.
D. The rhythm of structural mass to voids, such as windows and glass doors, of a front facade should relate to the rhythms established in adjacent buildings.
E. Where large structures are proposed with overly-long facades (walls), where one dimension exceeds the length of the perpendicular dimension, such as warehouses, building mass should be articulated with variations in the building plane and parapet height and through the use of other unique design or site plan features. Parking lots along the facade can also relieve horizontally through the use of landscaped fingers and islands containing trees and shrubs.
CITY OF LAMAR, MISSOURI ZONING ORDINANCE
Article 12 Site Plan Review
E:\ZONREGS.DOCX April 20, 1998
F. Architectural design should create visual interest through the use of different textures, complementary colors, shadow lines and contrasting shapes. The use of walls in a single color, with little detailing or completely blank is discouraged.
G. Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be used to provide visual interest.
H. Careful consideration of durable materials, proportions, and shapes, emphasizing the importance of roofs as integral and embracing elements of the over-all design is particularly important.
I. Use of substantial amounts of masonry materials (face brick, stucco, stone) is encouraged. The use of aluminum siding, metal ribbed panels, and extensive mirrored glass surfaces are discouraged. Evaluation of building materials shall be based on the quality of its design and relationship and compatibility to building materials in the immediate neighborhood.
Corrugated metal facades should be complemented with abundant use of masonry, whether brick, stone, stucco, or split-face block, especially along perimeter streets. Architectural metal panels may be an acceptable substitute for masonry. Appropriate landscaping can be used to complement and enhance a building's design, color and material.
J. Architectural treatments (e.g., building materials, colors, facade design, roof lines, screening) shall be consistent and compatible on all sides. Treatment that is uniform on all sides will be deemed to meet the requirements of this principle. Adjacent land uses, visibility from public streets, use of screening devices (walls, fences, berms, landscaping) are criteria to be considered when varying this treatment. The applicant will have the burden of demonstrating the reasons for differing treatment on different sides (e.g., the need for truck accesses on one side and pedestrian access on another).
Long expanses of overhead doors should be relieved by matching their color to the wall or trim, recessing the doors, or adding architectural details to diminish the dominance of the doors.

AMENDMENTS
1. Amendments to Change Zoning Regulations or District Boundaries: The City of Lamar Board of Aldermen from time to time, may supplement, change or generally revise the boundaries or regulations contained in zoning regulations by amendment. A proposal for such amendment may be initiated by the Board of Aldermen or the Planning and Zoning Commission. If such proposed amendment is not a general revision of the existing regulations and affects specific property, the amendment may be initiated by application of the owner of property affected. Applications for conditional use permits shall be considered by the same procedure as zoning district amendments. Any such amendment, if in accordance with the adopted comprehensive plan, shall be presumed to be reasonable.
2. Public Hearing: All such proposed amendments first shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for recommendation. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing thereon at its next regular meeting for which the application may be scheduled, shall cause an accurate written summary to be made of the proceedings, and shall give notice in like manner as that required for recommendations on the original proposed zoning regulations. Such notice shall fix the time and place for such hearing and contain a statement regarding the proposed changes in regulations or restrictions or in the boundary or classification of any zone or district. If such proposed amendment is not a general revision of the existing regulations and affects specific property, the property shall be designated by legal description or a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration.
3. Public Notice: In addition to such publication notice, written notice of such proposed amendment shall be mailed at least 15 days before the hearing to all owners of record of lands located within at least 185 feet of the area proposed to be altered. All notices shall include a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection and shall indicate where such information is available. When the notice has been properly addressed and deposited in the mail, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Board of Aldermen. Such notice is sufficient to permit the Planning and Zoning Commission to recommend amendments to zoning regulations which affect only a portion of the land described in the notice or which give all or any part of the land described a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice. At any public hearing held to consider a proposed rezoning, an opportunity shall be granted to interested parties to be heard.
4. Adoption: The procedure for the consideration and adoption of a recommendation to amend zoning district boundaries shall be in the same manner as that required for the consideration and adoption of the original zoning regulations. A majority of a quorum of the Planning and Zoning Commission at the hearing shall be required to recommend
CITY OF LAMAR, MISSOURI ZONING ORDINANCE
Article 15 Amendments
E:\ZONREGS.DOCX April 20, 1998
approval or denial of the amendment to the Board of Aldermen. If the Planning and Zoning Commission fails to make a recommendation on a rezoning request, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be deemed to have made a recommendation of disapproval. When the Planning and Zoning Commission submits a recommendation of approval or disapproval of such amendment and the reasons therefore, the Board of Aldermen may: (1) Adopt such recommendation by ordinance; (2) Override the Planning and Zoning Commission's recommendation by a 2/3 vote of the membership of the Board of Aldermen; or (3) return such recommendation to the Planning and Zoning Commission with a statement specifying the basis for the Board of Aldermen's failure to approve or disapprove.
If the Board of Aldermen returns the Planning and Zoning Commission's recommendation, the Planning and Zoning Commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original recommendation giving the reasons therefore or submit a new and amended recommendation. Upon the receipt of such recommendation, the Board of Aldermen, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendation by the respective ordinance or it need take no further action thereon. If the Planning and Zoning Commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the Board of Aldermen following the Planning and Zoning Commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the Board of Aldermen's report, the Board of Aldermen shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the Planning and Zoning Commission as a resubmission of the original recommendation and proceed accordingly. The proposed rezoning shall become effective upon publication of the respective adopting ordinance or resolution.
5. Applications: Any party desiring any change in zoning district boundaries or regulations contained in this Zoning Ordinance, as to any lot, tract or area of land, shall file with the Zoning Administrator an application, and such application shall be accompanied by such data and information as prescribed in these Regulations.
6. Filing Deposit and Fee: An application fee and filing deposit in amounts as established by the Board of Aldermen shall accompany each application filed with the City. Promptly upon the filing of any such application, the Zoning Administrator shall refer the application to the Planning and Zoning Commission agenda for study and recommendation and shall submit a report to the Board of Aldermen concerning the nature of the application and that said application has been referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
7.
