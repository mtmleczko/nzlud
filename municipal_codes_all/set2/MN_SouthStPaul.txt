PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of South St. Paul, Minnesota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code, as supplemented through April 17, 2005, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Code Attorney, and Kyle S. Meyer, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. John Sachi, City Engineer, and Ms. Darcy Erickson, Attorney at Law, for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(6)  Billing. The reinspection fees authorized above shall be billed directly to the responsible party to which the underlying orders to correct were issued. Failure to timely pay such fees shall be grounds for denial, revocation, suspension, or nonrenewal of any city-issued license or permit held by the party. This subsection shall not be considered the exclusive method of collecting reinspection fees and shall not preclude collection by any other lawful methods. Payment shall be due within 30 days after the initial billing.

The clerk must also post a copy of the written notice on the bulletin board in the main lobby of the municipal building. Notices of special meetings will be sent to those members of the news media who have requested, in writing, that their names be placed on a special meeting mailing list on file in the city with the clerk. 
(c)  Biennial organizational meeting. At its organizational meeting the council must: 
(1)  Designate the depositories of city funds; 
(2)  Designate the official newspaper; 
(3)  Choose an acting mayor from the council, who shall perform the duties of the mayor during the disability or absence of the mayor from the city or, in case of a vacancy in the office of mayor, until a successor has been appointed and qualified; 
(4)  Appoint officers, employees and members of boards, commissions, and committees as necessary; and 
(5)  Perform such other duties as are required by law, Charter or this Code. 
(d)  Procedures to be followed at meetings of city council, city boards, commissions, etc. The following provisions shall apply to meetings of the city council. The provisions also apply to meetings of the city boards, commissions, committees, subcommittees, and departments (individually herein referred to as "city public body"): 
(1)  Regular city public body meetings. The regular meetings of each city public body must be held on the days, times and places specified in a schedule of regular meetings to be filed by each city public body with the city clerk. If a regular meeting is to be held at a different time or place than specified in its filed schedule, notice of the meeting must be given as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section. A regular meeting falling on a holiday must be held as determined by the respective city public body at its previous regular meeting. 
(2)  Requester list. A person may file a written request with the clerk for notice of special meetings ("requester"). The request must contain the complete mailing address and the telephone number of the requester. The city clerk must maintain a list of all requests filed ("requester list"). A requester may limit the request to notification of special meetings of the city council or of a particular city public body and also may limit the request to meetings concerning particular subject matters, in which case the city is only required to provide notice to that requester concerning special meetings of the city council or of that particular city public body, as the case may be, or involving that particular subject matter. The requester list expires annually on December 31. If a person desires to receive notice of special meetings for the next year, a written request therefor must be filed with the city clerk.

As an alternative to mailed or delivered notice to requesters, the notice may be published once in the official newspaper of the city at least three days before the meeting. 
(4)  Emergency meeting . 
a.  Circumstances that warrant the meeting; minutes. An "emergency meeting" is a special meeting called because of circumstances that, in the judgment of the city council or city public body, require immediate consideration by the city council or city public body, as the case may be. If matters not directly related to the emergency are discussed or acted upon at an emergency meeting, the minutes of the meeting must include a specific description of the matters. An emergency meeting of the city council may be called by the mayor, or at the mayor's refusal, by any four councilmembers, by written demand filed with the city clerk stating the purpose, date, time and place of the emergency meeting. 
b.  Notice.

Stat. ch. 429 or any other law or Charter provision requiring a public hearing by the city council or a city public body.

State Law reference- Open meeting requirements and notice of meetings, Minn. Stat.  16D.01 et seq. 
Sec. 2-53. - Procedures. 
(a)  Presiding officer. The mayor presides at meetings of the council. In the absence of the mayor, the acting mayor presides. In the absence of both the mayor and acting mayor, the city clerk must call the meeting to order and preside until the councilmembers present choose one of their members to act as presiding officer. The presiding officer must preserve order, enforce the rules of procedure prescribed by this Code, and determine without debate, subject to the final decision of the council on appeal, questions of procedure and order. 
(b)  Rules of procedure. Except as otherwise provided by law, Charter or this Code, the proceedings of the council are conducted in accordance with "Robert's Rules of Order Revised." The city attorney is the parliamentarian. A member may appeal to the council from a ruling of the presiding officer. If the appeal is seconded, the member may speak once solely on the question involved and the presiding officer may explain the ruling, but no other councilmember may participate in the discussion. The appeal is sustained and the decision of the chair reversed if approved by a majority of the members present exclusive of the presiding officer. 
(c)  Minutes. Minutes of council meetings are kept by the clerk, or, in the absence of the clerk, the deputy clerk. Ordinances need not be recorded in full in the minutes if they appear in other permanent records of the clerk and can be accurately identified from the description given in the minutes. The minutes of each meeting must be reduced to typewritten form, signed by the clerk, and copies thereof delivered to each councilmember as soon as practicable after the meeting. At the next regular council meeting following that delivery, approval of the minutes must be considered by the council. The minutes need not be read aloud, but the presiding officer must call for any additions or corrections. If there is no objection to a proposed addition or correction, the correction or addition may be made without a vote of the council. If there is an objection, the council must vote upon the addition or correction. If there are no additions or corrections, the minutes are approved. 
(d)  Order of business. Each meeting of the council shall convene at the time and place appointed therefor. The order of business at a council meeting shall be established by the council by resolution. 
(e)  Quorum. A majority of the councilmembers constitutes a quorum to transact business. The votes of the members on a question pending before the council may be by voice vote, standing vote, or in any other manner of voting which signifies the intention of the members, except that the vote on ordinances, resolutions or the appropriation of money must be by "ayes" or "noes" and shall be entered upon the journal. But if the vote is not unanimous there must be a roll call and the names of those voting for and against the question must be recorded in the minutes. If any member, being present, does not vote, the minutes, as to that member, must be marked, "Present-Not Voting." A majority vote of all members of the council prevails unless a larger number is required by statute or Charter. 
(f)  Ordinances. An ordinance must be presented in writing and read twice by the clerk before the council prior to its passage, but may not be read twice at the same meeting and may be passed only at a regular meeting. Every ordinance introduced or considered must be recorded in the minutes by title. The first reading of an ordinance is by title, and unless the rules are suspended each member of the council must be furnished a copy of the ordinance before the next council meeting. Not more than 60 calendar days may pass between the first reading and the second reading of an ordinance. The second reading must be by sections, at which time amendments, if any, may be offered, but the reading of a section does not prevent a councilmember from offering amendments to a previous section. If no amendments are made, the presiding officer must submit the ordinance to a vote, but if amendments are made, the presiding officer must so report, and each section must be read as amended before a vote on the ordinance is taken.

DIVISION 2. - PURCHASING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 

Sec. 2-211. - Statement of policy. 
(a)  Honesty and prudence (making the best decision) are the guiding principles of procurement of goods and services with public monies. Because of the relatively small size of the city and the wide ranging expertise required to deal with the broad variety of goods and services used by the city, a decentralized purchasing system is most efficient. A decentralized system places great responsibility on a large number of people, and it is important that clear purchasing policies and practices are followed, but smart purchasing and impeccable honesty need to be supported by sufficient documentation. Written purchasing documents properly filed and maintained serve both as an in-house information resource and provide the best evidence if the system is audited or individual purchasing decisions are questioned by outside parties. 
(b)  Purchasing considerations include price, quality, availability, and a variety of special concerns depending on the particular commodity or service. Because of the convenience factor and the general economic benefit to the city, businesses will be seriously considered and selected for city's purchases when it is prudent to do so. To insure that this statement of policy is implemented and to provide ongoing evidence of compliance to outside parties, the procedures of this division have been established. 
Sec. 2-212. - Purchasing procedures. 
(a)  Although not required, obtaining competing quotations for all large purchases is encouraged. However, at least two quotes must be secured and documented on the city's verified claim form for all purchases of goods and services over $2,500.00. If extenuating circumstances make obtaining quotes impossible or impractical, such reason will be noted on the claim form. Examples of such circumstances include emergencies, one-of-a-kind products, availability from only a single source, speed of delivery, and others. The finance department will be authorized to waive this procedure when deemed appropriate. The use of purchase orders is discretionary on the part of each department. State statutes and regulations related to obtaining multiple quotations and conducting formal sealed bid purchasing procedures are hereby incorporated in this division. 
(b)  Conducting private auctions, whereby a purchasing agent returns to one or more previous bidders to see if they will beat the other vendor's price, is discouraged. However, it is allowable as long as all bidders have equal information and equal opportunity to change their bid (somewhat like the concept of the sealed bid process). 
(c)  Going hand in hand with purchasing is receiving and disbursement. To create a clear record of the transaction, all invoices must be submitted with a completed verified claim form signed by an authorized employee before they are paid. 
Sec. 2-213. - Disbursement procedures. 
(a)  Typically, only specific invoices are paid not blanket amounts on monthly statements. To create a clear record of the transaction, all original invoices must be submitted with a completed verified claim form signed by an authorized employee before they are paid. The signer is verifying, with his or her signature, the following facts: 
(1)  The merchandise or service has been received in a timely manner and is acceptable; 
(2)  The terms of the invoice are correct including price, discounts, and quantities; 
(3)  Proper purchasing procedures have been followed; 
(4)  The expense coding properly reflects what the item is and which operating division/department received the goods/services; and 
(5)  Payment of the invoice will not create a budget problem. 
(b)  Any questions on these policies and procedures should be directed to the attention of the finance department, which department is responsible for system oversight.

Sec. 18-349. - Purpose; definitions.

The purpose of this article is therefore to prevent pawnbrokering and precious metal businesses from being used as facilities for thee commission of crimes and to ensure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city. To help the police department better regulate current and future pawn and precious metal businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the pawn and precious metal industries, and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawn and precious metal industries through the timely collection and sharing of pawn and precious metal transaction information, this article also implements and establishes the required use of the automated pawn system (APS).

ARTICLE XVIII. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 18-484. - Findings. 
    The city council makes the following findings regarding the need to regulate sexually oriented businesses. The findings are based upon the experiences of other cities where such businesses have located, and upon the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, dated June 6, 1989, prepared by Hubert H. Humphrey III, attorney general of the state (the "report"). The report considered evidence from studies conducted in various cities throughout the country relating to sexually oriented businesses. 
(1)  The report concluded that sexually oriented businesses are associated with high crime rates and depression of property values. In addition, the character of a neighborhood can dramatically change when there is a concentration of sexually oriented businesses adjacent to residential property. 
(2)  Sexually oriented businesses have an impact on the neighborhoods surrounding them that is distinct from the impact caused by other commercial uses. 
(3)  Residential neighborhoods located within close proximity to adult theaters, bookstores, and other sexually oriented businesses experience increased crime rates (sex-related crimes in particular), lowered property values, increased transiency, and decreased stability of ownership. 
(4)  The adverse impacts which sexually oriented businesses have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the sexually oriented businesses increases. 
(5)  Studies of other cities have shown that among the crimes which tend to increase either within or in the near vicinity of sexually oriented businesses are rapes, prostitution, child molestation, indecent exposure, and other lewd and lascivious behavior. 
(6)  The Phoenix, Arizona, study confirmed that the sex crime rate was on the average 500 percent higher in areas with sexually oriented businesses. 
(7)  Many members of the public perceive areas within which sexually oriented businesses are located as less safe than other areas that do not have such uses. 
(8)  Studies of other cities have shown that the values of both commercial and residential properties either are diminished or fail to appreciate at the rate of other comparable properties when located in proximity to sexually oriented businesses. 
(9)  The Indianapolis, Indiana, study established that professional real estate appraisers believe that an adult bookstore would have a negative effect on the value of both residential and commercial properties within a one- to three-block area of the store. 
(10)  The suburban characteristics of the city are similar to those of the cities cited by the report when considering the effects of sexually oriented businesses and that the findings concerning the effects of sexually oriented businesses in other cities documented in the report are relevant to potential circumstances in the city. 
(11)  Sexually oriented businesses have the potential for adverse secondary effects upon certain pre-existing land uses within the city and that in studies documented in the report, it is not necessary for the city to conduct its own independent study concerning the effects of sexually oriented businesses locating within the city. 
(12)  The city is currently without an ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses within the city. 
(13)  The United States Supreme Court, in City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 106 S. Ct. 925 (1988), and others, has made it clear that a total prohibition against sexually oriented businesses would be unconstitutional. 
(14)  The location of sexually oriented businesses within the city will have a potentially detrimental effect on the city by unnecessarily lowering property values within the city if said establishments were located in inappropriate areas. 
(15)  There will be the risk of increased crime within the city from inadequate regulations of sexually oriented businesses locating and operating within the city. 
(16)  Content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions that regulate the licensing of sexually oriented businesses are necessary in the city to minimize the potential adverse secondary effects which will accompany the location and operation of said businesses within the city but that said regulations should be drafted in such a manner as to allow for reasonable opportunity to open and operate sexually oriented businesses within the city while minimizing the secondary adverse effects.

(1)  Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health requiring prevention or abatement. 
(2)  Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. 
(3)  Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of an irresponsible user. 
(4)  Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present, and condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol. 
(5)  Even though giving or furnishing alcohol to an unrelated underage person is a crime, it is difficult to prove, and an ordinance is necessary to help further combat underage consumption. 
(6)  A deterrent will be created by holding a person criminally responsible for hosting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption of alcohol occurs.

ARTICLE IV. - ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS 

Sec. 38-102. - Purpose. 
    The city council seeks to offer an alternative method of enforcement for city code violations rather than relying on the criminal court system. The formal criminal prosecution process does not provide an environment to adequately address the unique and sensitive issues that are involved in city code violations, including, but not limited to, neighborhood concerns, livability issues, economic impact, physical limitations of the offenders and the stigma and unintended consequences of being charged with or convicted of a misdemeanor offense. In addition, the court system is a slow, overburdened and methodical process that is not conducive to dealing with the violations in a prompt and timely manner. Finally, the penalties afforded the criminal court system are restricted to fines or physical confinement, which are not effective solutions to address city code violations. 
    In order to provide more flexibility in addressing city code violations on an individual basis that will be more efficient and effective, the city council finds that an alternative enforcement process is necessary. Therefore, to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of South St. Paul, it is the city council's intent to create a process for the use and imposition of administrative civil penalties that will provide the public and the City of South St. Paul with a more effective alternative method for addressing city code violations. 
(Ord. No. 1227,  2, 5-3-2010) 
Sec. 38-103. - Alternative methods of enforcement. 
    A violation of the City Code is a misdemeanor pursuant to city code subsection 1-7(c); however, this subsection seeks to gain compliance with the City Code prior to the commencement of any formal civil or criminal court action. The administrative civil penalties proceedings are in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy available to the city for city code violations. The city may, in its, discretion, choose not to issue an administrative citation and may initiate criminal charges instead.

Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
(b)  It is the intent of this chapter to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence. 
(Ord. No. 1309,  1, 10-3-2016)

(b)  A property owner's failure to comply with provisions of this section shall constitute a violation of this section. 
(c)  If a property owner discovers or is informed that a tenant is a designated offender after signing a lease or otherwise agreeing to let the offender reside on the property, the owner or property manager may evict the offender. 
(Ord. No. 1309,  1, 10-3-2016)

ARTICLE IV. - PARK DEDICATION REQUIREMENT[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1173,  1-5, adopted April 17, 2006, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion herein as Art. IV,  42-89-42-93, was at the discretion of the editor. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 42-89. - Purpose and intent. 
    The city council recognizes it is essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of South St. Paul that the character and quality of the environment be considered to be of major importance in the planning and development of the city. In this regard, the manner in which land is developed or redeveloped and used is of high priority. The preservation of land for park, playground, and public open space purposes as it relates to the use, development, and redevelopment of land for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes is essential to maintaining a healthful and desirable environment for all citizens of the city. The city council wishes to provide these amenities for the citizens today, and be mindful of future citizens. 
    The city council finds that development and redevelopment of land for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes creates a need for the preservation, improvement and development of park and recreational land and facilities within the city that is consistent with the parks master plan. The parks master plan notes that there has been minimal reinvestment in South St. Paul Parks for the past 20 years, yet there has been much growth, putting pressures on existing park facilities and infrastructure. It is the intent and purpose of this ordinance to address the need for the preservation, improvement, acquisition and development of park and recreational land and facilities through park land dedication. 
(Ord. No. 1173,  1, 4-17-2006; Ord. No. 1198,  1, 2-4-2008) 
Sec. 42-90. - Dedication. 
    Pursuant to Minn. Stat.  462.358, Subd. 2b(b), the city council shall require as a condition of approval of any plan, replat, or subdivision, one of the following: 
(1)  That a reasonable portion of the buildable land be dedicated to the public to be preserved for public uses such as, but not limited to a park, playground, trail, or open space; 
(2)  That an equivalent cash contribution be made to the special park fund; or 
(3)  That a partial dedication of land and cash be made pursuant to section 42-93, as determined by the city council. 
    This article applies to plats, replats or subdivisions that create at least one new platted lot, provide for at least one additional dwelling unit, or provide for at least one additional commercial, mixed-use, nonresidential, or industrial unit. 
(Ord. No. 1173,  2, 4-17-2006; Ord. No. 1198,  1, 2-4-2008) 
Sec. 42-91. - Land dedication required. 
(a)  The amount of land required for dedication is based upon a reasonable portion of buildable land to be subdivided and equals the land the city reasonably finds it will need to acquire for park or other recreational purposes as a result of approval of the land division. The percentage of land dedication that is required is as follows: 
Type of Use: Land Dedication Percentage: Residential 10% Commercial 5% Industrial 5%  
(b)  The land dedication requirements are not satisfied if the city council determines that the land proposed for dedication is unsuitable for public use. 
(c)  With approval of the city council, the required percentage of land dedication may be located on property outside the development. 
(Ord. No. 1173,  3, 4-17-2006; Ord. No. 1198,  1, 2-4-2008; Ord. No. 1252,  1, 11-21-2011) 
Sec. 42-92. - Cash payment in lieu of land dedication. 
(a)  [Generally.] The city may require a cash payment in lieu of land dedication. In determining whether to require a cash payment or land dedication, the city council may consider such factors as whether the parks master plan indicates that land is needed in the proposed location, whether the proposed dedication is suitable for the intended park, trail, or open space use, and whether a cash payment would be more beneficial to the development of the entire park system. 
(b)  Amount of cash payment. The cash payment in lieu of land dedication is determined by the fair market value of the land as determined by the Dakota County Assessor at the time of final plat approval, including the value added by existing utilities, streets, and other public improvements serving the property, but excluding the value added of all other existing improvements on the land. The cash payment is determined at the time of final plat, replat, subdivision or lot division approval by applying the appropriate percentage stated in section 42-91 to the fair market value. The cash payment in lieu of land dedication shall not exceed the following: 
Type of Use: Maximum Cash Payment: Single-family dwelling, per unit $ 2,500.00 Two-family dwelling, per unit   2,500.00 Multiple-family dwelling (3 or more), per unit   2,500.00 Commercial, per acre of land   5,000.00 Industrial, per acre of land   5,000.00  
(c)  Special park fund. Cash payments in lieu of land dedication are due no later than final plat, replat, subdivision, or lot division approval. No final signatures, resolutions or approvals shall be conveyed by the city until the cash payment in lieu of land dedication has been paid.

(d)  Permit fee. The application must be accompanied by the permit fee set forth by the city council. 
(e)  Security for completion of work. Prior to commencement of work, the company may be required to deposit with the city security in the form of certified check, letter of credit or construction bond in a sufficient amount as determined by the director for the completion of the work. The securities will be held until the work is completed plus a period of up to 12 months thereafter to guarantee that restoration work has been satisfactorily completed. Upon application of the company providing such information as the director may require, if two or more work projects are to be constructed during a calendar year, the director may accept, in lieu of separate security for each project, a single security for multiple projects in such form and amount as determined in the discretion of the director to be sufficient to ensure completion of all projects which may be in progress at any one time during that calendar year and to guarantee that restoration work will be satisfactorily completed. The security will then be returned to the company with interest if required by law and then interest at the applicable statutory rate.

If the company undertakes the defense, the company shall have complete control of such claim or action, but it may not settle without the consent of the city, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Thereafter, right-of-way users must comply with city code section 54-420(a) to provide "as built" mapping. 
(2)  At the request of any public right-of-way user, information required by the city that qualifies as "trade secret" data under Minnesota law will be protected accordingly. 
(c)  Service laterals. The holder of a permit for the installation or repair of service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minnesota Rules, must establish the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and, when the engineer reasonably requires it, the vertical locations of service laterals. Permittees or their subcontractors must submit this information to the engineer in a form reasonably satisfactory to the engineer within 30 days after completion of the work. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or the denial of future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.

Sec. 54-422. - General public right-of-way regulations. 
(a)  Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other applicable law, and with Minnesota Rules 7819.3100, 7819.5000, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities. 
(b)  Corridors. The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facilities that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue. 
    Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service needs and hardship to the registrant. 
(c)  Limitation of space. To protect health, safety, and welfare, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest. 
(d)  Damage to other facilities. When the city does work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a registrant's facilities to protect it, the city shall notify the local representative as early as is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that registrant and must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing.

Sec. 58-5. - Traffic signal preemption system. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose for using the traffic signal preemption system (TSPS) in the city is to allow authorized emergency vehicles to perform emergency services in a safer and more timely manner by temporarily controlling motorized vehicle traffic flow at signalized intersections. Also, the TSPS is to be used only for response to emergencies, and is not to be used by vehicles that are not authorized emergency vehicles under any circumstances. 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them: 
    Traffic signal preemption system or TSPS. A traffic control system designed for use by authorized emergency vehicles to improve traffic movement by temporarily controlling signalized intersections. The TSPS is comprised of four separate components: an emitter, a detector, an indicator, and a phase selector. The emitter (a high-intensity light source) is attached to the authorized emergency vehicle and functions like a strobe light, pulsating at a frequency in excess of ten "beats" per second. As an authorized emergency vehicle approaches the intersection, a detector that is located at or near the traffic signal receives this pulsating light. The detector relays the coded message to the phase selector, located in the traffic light control box, which then either holds the existing green light in favor of the approaching authorized emergency vehicle or accelerates the normal cycle of a signal change to provide green by the time the vehicle reaches the intersection. The indicator is a light source located near the detector that is directed toward the oncoming authorized emergency vehicle to indicate to the driver whether or not the traffic signal has been preempted in favor of the authorized emergency vehicle. 
(c)  Conditions for use. Conditions for use of the TSPS are as follows: 
(1)  Authorized emergency vehicles shall use the TSPS while on emergency responses only. All other uses of the TSPS by authorized emergency vehicles are prohibited. 
(2)  Unless specifically approved herein, it shall be unlawful for any person to activate the TSPS in the city by any means whatsoever. Installation of TSPS emitters on any vehicle not an authorized emergency vehicle are prohibited. 
(d)  Procedures for operating. Procedures for operating the TSPS are as follows: 
(1)  When the TSPS is being used by an authorized emergency vehicle responding to an emergency situation, standard light and siren operation should be followed in accordance with police or fire department policy, as the case may be. 
(2)  When the TSPS is being used in an emergency situation where the use of sirens is not appropriate, standard emergency light operations should still be used. Increased caution and reduced speeds, particularly at intersections, are then required. 
(3)  Emergency personnel must be aware that the TSPS may fail to provide right-of-way at all signalized intersections due to the following: 
a.  The intersection may not be TSPS-equipped; 
b.  One or more TSPS components may be inoperative; 
c.  Speed of the authorized emergency vehicle may cause the authorized emergency vehicle to arrive at the intersection too soon for the TSPS to cycle the signal to green; 
d.  Another authorized emergency vehicle using TSPS may be coming from a cross-flow direction and may already have seized command of the intersection signal; 
e.  Severe weather conditions may disrupt the detection of the emitted signal, thereby preventing the TSPS from recognizing the signal preemption request; or 
f.  Other conditions may exist which prevent the TSPS from operating as designed. 
(4)  Upon reaching the emergency destination, the TSPS emitter shall be turned off immediately to ensure that it does not inadvertently seize control of surrounding signalized intersections. 
(5)  Whenever the TSPS appears not to be functioning properly, it is the emergency vehicle driver's responsibility to immediately report the defect and the location of the defective signal to the chief of police. 
(e)  Maintenance. The city shall maintain the TSPS, or cause it to be maintained, in a proper functioning condition. 
(f)  Training. An explanation of the policies and procedures governing the use of the TSPS in the city shall be included in the basic and in-service training courses for the police and fire departments.

(g)  Street surface. The contractor must backfill the hole or trench to the bottom of the existing base course and then place a minimum thickness of ten inches of class 5 gravel material up to the surface of the pavement. Tunneling will not be permitted in the roadway portion of the street right-of-way, unless approved by the city. A charge will be made for all holes and trenches cut in any street within the city, as established in chapter 26 of this Code as an excavation charge. This charge will be estimated and collected at the time a permit is issued to install the service connection. Any overcharge or undercharge will be reimbursed or billed, as the case may be, to the contractor upon completion of the work. In the event that the compaction of the trench or hole was not done properly, and there is a settlement in the street after the bituminous patch has been made, the street department will repair the settled area and a charge will then be made against the contractor who originally made the excavation. The contractor will be notified before the repair is made. On completion of the repair, a bill will be sent to the contractor for payment. In the case of failure to pay this repair bill, no further plumbing permits will be issued to the contractor.

(Ord. No. 1240,  1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 62-27. - Repairs and maintenance. 
(a)  Intent and purposes. The council has determined that when breaks and defects occur in the water service lines and appurtenances thereto, there arise potential hazards to the city's water system and to the city streets under which the water service lines lie. The council has determined that the city's welfare and safety is promoted and maintained by prompt repair of such water service lines and appurtenances thereto in an approved manner. Minn. Stat.  429.101 authorizes the city to place primary responsibility for such repair upon the property owner or occupant and authorizes the city to impose special charges for such repair on the property owner or occupant in the event the city makes such repair because of the property owner's or occupant's failure to do so. If such special charges are not paid in a timely fashion, the act authorizes the city to make a special assessment against the property benefited by the repairs. Minn. Stat.  429.101 authorizes the city to adopt other regulations consistent with that law. It is the intent and purpose of this section to use the authority granted by Minn. Stat.  429.101. 
(b)  Owner and occupant responsible for maintenance and repair of water service line, etc. 
(1)  Water service line and appurtenances serving the premises. The property owner and occupant are responsible for maintaining and repairing the water service line, corporation cocks, curb stops and curb boxes serving the premises from the building to the main in the street. 
(2)  Period of time allowed for repair. Breaks, leaks or other defects in the water service line, corporation cocks, curb stops and curb boxes serving the premises must be made by the property owner or occupant within 72 hours after discovery thereof.

(4)  Specifications for service lines. Service lines, corporation cocks, curb stops and curb boxes must conform to the specifications promulgated by the city engineer. 
(c)  Failure to repair. 
(1)  Notice. When a break, leak or other defect is discovered in the water service line, corporation cock, curb stop or curb box, the city must notify the occupant of the premises served or the owner thereof that the repair and maintenance must be made within 72 hours and that failure to make the repair and maintenance in a manner approved by the city will result in the city making the repair and maintenance and charging the cost thereof to the owner or occupant. 
(2)  City to perform. If the owner or occupant does not perform the repairs and maintenance within 72 hours or if the owner or occupant does not perform the repairs and maintenance in a manner receiving the city's approval, the city will make the repairs and maintenance and shall charge the cost thereof to the owner or occupant of the premises. Necessary street and sidewalk restoration will be included as part of the repair cost. 
(3)  Charges. A written statement for the repair and maintenance charges must be sent to the owner or occupant, and the charges are due and payable within 30 days after the statement is sent, or such charges with interest at the prevailing rate imposed by the city on unpaid special assessments will be payable over three years in 12 equal installments made together with the regular quarterly water bill payment. 
(4)  Assessment. If the charges are not paid in a timely fashion, the city will levy a special assessment against the property benefited in the manner prescribed by Minn. Stat.  429.101.

DIVISION 4. - RATES AND CHARGES 

Sec. 62-163. - Sanitary sewer rates and charges. 
(a)  Basic charges. The charge for sewage is the sum of the sanitary sewer service charge and the commodity charge. 
(b)  Sanitary sewer service charge. 
(1)  The sewer service charge is designed to cover administration, operation, maintenance and equipment replacement of interceptor sewers and public sewer systems of the city. 
(2)  The quarterly service charges shall be as established in chapter 26 of this Code. 
(c)  Commodity charge. 
(1)  The commodity charge is imposed upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises connected with the public sewer system of the city, including intercepting sewers, and upon other persons discharging sewage wastes, water or other liquids, directly or indirectly, into the public sewage system of the city, including intercepting sewers, and said charge is payable by either the owner or occupant of the premises. The charge is made for paying the city's share of the metropolitan council environmental services' annual budget. The users of the sewer system are classified as either residential, commercial, or high volume user. 
(2)  The commodity charges shall be as established in chapter 26 of this Code. 
(d)  Residential and commercial uses. 
(1)  Commercial. The commodity charge to commercial users is based on the quantity of water used as measured by the water meter installed at the premises and is at a rate per 1,000 gallons. Commodity charges for commercial and industrial users, including schools, church schools, apartments, hospitals, nursing homes and mobile home parks, are based on the user's water consumption for the quarter in which the commodity charge is made. 
(2)  Residential users and churches. For residential users and churches, sewer commodity charges for the winter calculation quarter are based on the actual consumption for the winter calculation quarter. For the next three billing quarters, the sewer commodity charges are based on either the winter calculation quarter, or 4,000 gallons, whichever is greater. 
(e)  High volume users. Commodity charges to high volume users are based upon the quantity of water used as measured by the water meter or other approved metering devices installed at said premises, and shall be at a rate per 1,000 gallons. Where measuring or metering devices exist, charges are based upon the quantity of sewage thus measured or metered. In the absence of properly functioning measuring or metering devices, commodity charges are based upon the quantity of sewage as estimated by the city engineer, until the devices are repaired and functioning properly. 
(f)  Special sewer charges (city resident). The owner or occupant of any lot, building parcel of land or premises served by the facilities of the city sewage system and served by the City of St. Paul water system must pay sewer charges based on consumption of water as determined from the records of St. Paul Regional Water Services. 
(g)  Nonresident sewer connections. Connections made with the consent of the city, directly or indirectly, through intermediary, private or public sewers, to the sewer system of the city to serve property lying outside the limits of the city may continue upon the payment of charges for each connection. The connections are allowed to continue for the purpose of discharging sanitary sewage only, and no stormwater or ground drainage water from said premises shall be directed into the sewer. Permission granted for a sewer connection may be revoked at any time by resolution of the city council and, upon the passage of the resolution, the connection must be terminated by the owner of the property. 
(h)  Delinquent accounts. Sewage charges billed are subject to a delinquency charge in the amount as established in chapter 26 of this Code.

Sec. 62-166. - Billing and payment. 
(a)  Timing; penalty. Water and sewer services are billed on the same statement, with sewer and water charges listed separately. Bills are sent quarterly except that high volume user consumers are billed monthly. Accounts must be paid 30 days following billing, at which date the accounts become delinquent. A penalty will be added to the balance of delinquent accounts as established by chapter 26 of this Code. 
(b)  Deferral. Upon the verified application of a user prior to certification of unpaid charges to the county auditor for collection with taxes, the council may defer the collection and payment of sewage or water charges or a portion of either to a future date or dates and upon such terms and conditions as the council may determine, in those cases in which the council finds that payment thereof when due cannot be made because of a present temporary adverse economic situation of the user, and collection and payment when due would result in undue economic hardship to the user. 
(c)  Adjustment. In the event a bill is abnormally high because of a verifiable faulty plumbing system which has been or will in the near future be repaired, the customer shall pay the current bill, but an equitable adjustment shall be made by setting the sewer maximums back to the prior year, or to the average of the last two years, or to an average based on family size, whichever is most appropriate under all of the circumstances. The finance director or designee is delegated authority to make the adjustment in accordance with the foregoing criteria.

Accounts that are delinquent on November 1 of each year, along with an administrative fee and a delinquent penalty in amounts established by chapter 26 of this Code, will be certified by the clerk to the county auditor in a timely manner. The amounts so certified will be extended on the tax rolls against the premises serviced for collection with the following year's property taxes. The clerk, in so certifying such charges, must specify the amount thereof, and furnish a description of the land, lot, or premises served. The amount so certified must be then extended by the county auditor on the tax rolls against such premises in the same manner as other taxes are extended. The charges will then be collected by the clerk along with other taxes. The council, at its option, may direct that any charges levied by and pursuant to this section, which have been billed to the occupants of any premises served, and not paid within 30 days after the same are due, be recovered from the owner or occupant of the premises served in a civil action by the city in a court of competent jurisdiction.

ARTICLE IV. - STORM SEWER UTILITY 

Sec. 62-192. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  In the exercise of its governmental authority, and in order to promote public health, safety, convenience, and welfare, the city has constructed, operated and maintained a storm sewer system (the "facilities"). The ordinance from which this article is derived has been adopted in the further exercise of such authority. 
(b)  The facilities have been financed by various methods, including grant and ad valorem taxes, which were appropriate methods at the time used. It is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering the future costs of establishment, operation, maintenance, depreciation, replacements, improvements, enlargements, and necessary extension of the facilities by the imposition of charges as provided in this article. 
(c)  It is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make the charges just and equitable. Taking into account the status of the completion of the facilities, past methods of recovery, facilities costs, and other relevant factors, it is determined to be just and equitable to establish charges on the basis of the expected stormwater runoff from the various parcels of land within the city. Assigning costs and making charges based upon expected stormwater runoff cannot be done with mathematical precision, but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits based upon use. 
(Ord. No. 1240,  1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 62-193. - System established. 
    A city storm sewer system is hereby established. The system consists of all storm sewer conduits, manholes and catchbasins, ditches, and ponds within the public right-of-way, and storm sewer conduits, manholes and catchbasins, ditches, and ponds in public purpose easements as of November 1, 2003, and any additional storm sewer facilities and appurtenances required by the city in the future. 
(Ord. No. 1240,  1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 62-194. - Rates and charges. 
(a)  Land use rate calculation. Rates and charges to be imposed for the use and availability of the facilities shall be determined by the use of a residential equivalent factor (REF), which is defined as the ratio of the average volume of surface water runoff from one acre of land subjected to a particular use to the average volume of surface water runoff from one acre of land subject to typical single-family uses within the city during a standard rainfall event. All developed single-family parcels shall be considered to have an acreage of one-fourth-acre per unit. Calculations of stormwater utility rates for various land uses shall be based upon their REF. The REF values for various land uses are as follows: 
(1) Land use category REF a. Single-family residential 1.0 b. Multifamily residential 1.5 c. Commercial 1.9 d. Industrial 2.0 e. Airport hangars 2.0 f. Public and semipublic 1.2 g. Vacant, developable land 0.4  
(2)  Land use categories include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Single-family residential. Residential areas within the city include single-family and multifamily homes located within a typical single residential lot. 
b.  Multifamily residential. Multifamily land use is defined as a parcel containing three or more units and is typically on a lot larger than a typical single-family unit. This land use includes apartments, townhomes and mobile home parks. 
c.  Commercial. This land use consists of commercial, retail, and office space as identified within the city's land-use plan. 
d.  Industrial. These areas are utilized for industrial uses as outlined in the city's land-use plan. 
e.  Airport. The airport has been divided into two segments for the purposes of this article. The airport consists of the runway segment, which the city is responsible for owning and maintaining, and the hangar segment, which is a leased portion of the airport for use by individuals and businesses. 
f.  Public and semipublic. These areas include churches and schools, as outlined in the city's land-use plan. 
g.  Vacant developable land. These are areas within the city as identified on the land-use map that are available for future development. 
(b)  Calculation of charge. The charge to be billed to each billing unit shall be a just and equitable share of the total cost of the facilities. Charges shall be apportioned similarly to similar uses of property. These charges shall be as established in chapter 26 of this Code. 
(c)  Other land uses. Land uses not listed in the class charge rate calculation table shall be classified by the city administrator or designee on assigning them to the class most nearby like the listed uses from the standpoint of probable hydraulic response. Appeal from the city administrator or designee's decision may be made in writing to the city council within 14 days of the decision. 
(d)  Appeal process. 
(1)  The stormwater utility charge may be appealed by a property owner by providing data clearly demonstrating that the actual stormwater runoff volume from the property is substantially different from the calculations for the class of parcels in which the property is listed. The appeal shall be made to the city engineer who may make adjustments to individual parcels based on the data provided. The decision of the city engineer shall be in writing, a copy of which shall be mailed to the property owner. 
(2)  A property owner may appeal from the decision of the city engineer to the city council by written notice of appeal filed with the city clerk within ten business days of the date of the decision by the city engineer. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds and basis for the appeal. The appeal shall be heard upon not less than ten days' written notice to the property owner of the date and time of the hearing. The city council may sustain the decision of the city engineer or may make an adjustment of the stormwater utility charge. 
(3)  An adjustment of the stormwater utility charge may not be made retroactive. 
(4)  If an adjustment would affect the charge and the calculation for all or substantially all of the land uses in a particular classification, the adjustment must be made by amending the class charge rate calculation table. 
(e)  Excluded lands. A charge shall not be made against land that is: 
(1)  Outside the corporate limits of the city; 
(2)  A railroad right-of-way; 
(3)  Vacant and undevelopable; 
(4)  City-owned land, except that which is leased to persons and nongovernmental entities; 
(5)  Owned in special school district number six; or 
(6)  A cemetery. 
(f)  Information. The owner, tenant, occupant, or person in charge of the premises must supply the city with such information as the city may reasonably request related to the use, development and area of the premises. If the information requested is not provided, the charge for the premises will be estimated and billed in accordance with the estimate, which will be based on information available to the city. 
(g)  Billing. The charges shall be included on the utility accounts of each property and are payable in accordance with the provision for billing and payment of water and sanitary sewer bills. 
(h)  Penalties; certification to county auditor. Penalties for late payment or nonpayment of billings for charges shall be as established in Chapter 26. The city may certify delinquent, unpaid charges to be certified to the county auditor with taxes against the property served for collection as other taxes and collections as provided by section 62-167. 
(Ord. No. 1240,  1, 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 62-195. - Revenues.

Sec. 62-226. - Authority and purpose. 
    Minn. Stat.  429.021 authorizes cities to install, replace, extend and maintain street lights and street lighting systems and special lighting systems. South St. Paul Charter section 8.05 states that the City of South St. Paul may own and operate a light utility for supplying its own needs for utility service or for supplying utility service to private consumers or both. The city council has determined that in order to promote the general health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, it is in the best interest of the citizens that the city operate and maintain a city-wide street lighting system utility and has further determined that the operation and maintenance of such utility benefits each and every property within the city. The city council has therefore determined that it is fair, appropriate and reasonable that the costs of such operation and maintenance be paid on a fair and reasonable basis by all of the property in the city so benefitted and the cost should be charged and collected from all such benefitted property, except for those exempted in subsection 62-228(d).

(a)  Building permit fee. When plans have been approved by the building official or building inspector, the applicant must pay the building permit fee set forth in the schedule of building permit fees in chapter 26 of this Code. The determination of value or valuation under any of the provisions of the state building code is made by the building official or building inspector. The value to be used in computing the building permit and plan review fees is the total value of all construction work for which the permit is issued as well as all finish work, painting, roofing, electrical, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, elevators, fire extinguishing systems and any other permanent equipment. 
(b)  Plan review fees. When a plan or other data are required to be submitted by the state building code, a plan review fee shall be paid at the time of submitting plans and specifications for review. The plan review fee shall be 65 percent of the building permit fee as shown in chapter 26 of this Code. Where plans are incomplete or changed so as to require additional plan review, an additional plan review fee will be charged at the rate shown in chapter 26 of this Code. Applications for which no permit is issued within 180 days following the date of application expire by limitation, and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the building official or building inspector. The building official or building inspector may extend the time for action by the applicant for a period not exceeding 180 days upon request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken. An application may not be extended more than once. In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant must resubmit plans and pay a new plan review fee. 
(c)  Investigation fee. Whenever any work for which a permit is required by the state building code has been commenced without first obtaining the permit, a special investigation must be made before a permit may be issued for such work. An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, will be collected whether or not a permit is then or subsequently issued. The investigation fee shall be at the rate established by the city council. The payment of the investigation fee does not exempt a person from compliance with other provisions of the state building code nor from any penalty prescribed by law. 
(d)  Fee refunds. Upon receipt of a written request by the original permittee that is filed with the building official within 180 days after the fee was paid, the building official may authorize refunding of any fee paid under this section, pursuant to the following: 
(1)  The full permit fee may be refunded for any fee that was erroneously paid or collected; 
(2)  Not more than 80 percent of the permit fee paid may be refunded when no work has been done under a permit; 
(3)  Not more than 80 percent of the plan review fee paid may be refunded when an application for which a plan review fee has been paid is withdrawn or canceled before any plan reviewing is done.

ARTICLE V. - AIRCRAFT NOISE ATTENUATION[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
State Law reference- Aircraft noise attenuation, Minn. Stat.  473.192. 

Sec. 106-145. - Policy. 
(a)  Findings of fact. The city finds that development within certain areas of the city is impacted by aircraft noise, that the noise is beyond the regulatory authority of the city to control, that certain uses of land are inappropriate in areas of high aircraft noise, that some structures do not adequately attenuate aircraft noise, resulting in negative impacts on the health, safety and welfare of the residents or inhabitants of the structures, that, through proper construction methods, the means exist to attenuate aircraft noise to interior levels which alleviate such negative impacts, and that the requirements of this article are necessary to promote and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to require that new or redeveloped buildings within the city be constructed with materials and in such a manner that aircraft noise is attenuated by the structure to an interior level which has no adverse impact on the health, safety and general welfare of the residents, all in accordance with the city council's guidelines for land use compatibility with aircraft noise. These guidelines are part of the aviation chapter of the metropolitan development guide. 
(Code 1992,  445.03) 
Sec. 106-146. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Aircraft noise zone means any one of the four zones identified on the maps included under section 106-149 and incorporated herein. 
    dBA means a unit of sound pressure level weighted by use of the A metering characteristics and weighting as specified in the American National Standards Institute Specification for Sound Level Meters (ANSI S1.4-1983), which is hereby incorporated by reference. "dBA" is also referred to as an "A-weighted decibel." 
    Ldn means the day-night average level, or the 24-hour equivalent continuous sound level (time-average A-weighted sound level) from midnight to midnight, obtained after the addition of 10 dBA to sound levels measured from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. 
    Leg means the equivalent continuous sound level that, over the period of one hour, has the same A-weighted sound energy as the time varying sound. 
    Noise reduction level means the difference between the exterior and interior sound level, expressed in dBA, which is achieved by the intervening structure. 
    Recognized acoustical specialist means a person qualified by education and experience to conduct sound analysis of buildings and approved for such purpose by the city's building inspector. The approved individual must have at least three years of experience in the field of sound control, a degree from a recognized institute of higher learning in acoustics or a closely related discipline, and demonstrated expertise in the process of sound analysis of buildings. 
    Sound means energy that is transmitted by pressure waves in the air or in other materials and is the objective cause of the sensation of hearing; sound is commonly called "noise" if it is unwanted. 
    Sound attenuation means the reduction in sound level that occurs between the source and receiver. 
    Sound leak means an opening in a structure through which sound can pass. Sound leaks are often extremely small holes or cracks; in general, an air leak is a sound leak. 
    Sound level means the level of sound pressure measured with a sound level meter and one of its weighting (frequency) networks; when A-weighting is used, the sound level is expressed as dBA. 
    Sound transmission class (STC) means a single-number rating for describing the degree of sound transmission loss specified for a wall, window, partition or other building element. The higher the STC, the more attenuation the building element will afford. 
(Code 1992,  445.05) 
Sec. 106-147. - Scope and effect/aircraft noise zones established. 
    The aircraft noise zones established by this article overlay the zoning districts established by the zoning code so that any parcel or land lying in an overlay zone shall also lie in one or more of the established zoning districts. Territory within a given overlay zone is subject to the requirements established by the other applicable ordinances and regulations of the city. Within each adopted overlay zone, uses are permitted in accordance with the regulations for the underlying zoning districts; provided, however, that the appropriate building permit is first obtained, and, provided further, that no use designed as inconsistent on the noise compatibility tables incorporated herein shall be permitted. This article applies to construction requiring a building permit after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, except decks, patios, swimming pools, breezeways, and similar outdoor uses, remodeling or rehabilitation of an existing residential building or the construction of an appurtenance to an existing residential building. In the case of conflict between this article and applicable codes or ordinances, the more restrictive requirements apply.

Sec. 106-150. - Noise compatibility tables. 
    The noise compatibility tables are adopted from the metropolitan council's guidelines for land use compatibility with aircraft noise. The noise reduction level numbers, expressed in dBA, specify for each type of land use the amount of interior sound level reduction necessary for the use to be compatible in the applicable aircraft noise zone. All construction or reconstruction requiring a building permit and located within an aircraft noise zone (except remodeling or rehabilitation of an existing residential building) must be constructed in such a way that the applicable noise level reduction requirements contained in the noise compatibility tables are met or exceeded. Where a particular structure contains different land uses, the more stringent requirements of the applicable table shall apply, except where it is architecturally possible to achieve the appropriate noise reduction level for each different use and the uses are acoustically separate by a wall or partition with a minimum STC of 25.

If such a plan would have been required, then the disturbed land area shall be shaped and stabilized in accordance with the city's requirements as soon as possible; or 
f.  Any activity that, in the discretion of the city, should be exempt from the provisions of this section. The city may exempt an activity from the provisions of this section if all of the following standards and requirements are met: 
1.  Existing draining and ponding patterns are not significantly altered so as to adversely affect adjoining land; 
2.  The resultant grade and slopes at the property line are in substantial conformity to the surrounding natural topography and are set so as to minimize erosion and provide for sufficient drainage so that both natural and stormwater enter and leave the property at the original or natural drainage points; 
3.  All banks will be left with a slope not greater than one foot vertical to four feet horizontal, except that greater slope shall be permitted if it is in substantial conformity to the immediately surrounding area, and in the judgment of the city, it is not expected to adversely affect future development of the site.

Outdoor burner/boiler does not include any heating device that uses gas or oil as a primary fuel source. 
(Ord. No. 1316,  1, 4-17-2017) 
Sec. 110-152. - Restrictions for outdoor burners/boilers. 
    The requirements and regulations specified in this chapter shall be subject to the following: 
(a)  Findings. The city council of the City of South St. Paul adopts the following findings concerning outdoor burners/boilers and the need to prohibit new outdoor burners/boilers: 
(1)  Wood smoke is one of the chief causes of certain types of air pollution in the United States. ("Smoke Gets In Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers in New York State," Elliot Spitzer, Attorney General of New York State, Environmental Protection Bureau, August 2005, p. 6.) 
(2)  Residential wood smoke contains fine particles and toxic air pollutants (e.g., benzene and formaldehyde). ("Strategies for Reducing Residential Wood Smoke," outreach and information division, air quality planning division, office of air quality planning and standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, October 29, 2009, p. 4.) 
(3)  Outdoor wood burners/boilers may emit significant pollution because the basic design of the outdoor wood burner/boiler causes fuel to burn incompletely, or smolder, which results in thick smoke and high particulate emissions. ("Smoke Gets in Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers In New York State," Elliot Spritzer, Attorney General of New York State, Environmental Protection Bureau, August 2005, p. 5.) 
(4)  Smoke emitted from outdoor wood burners/boilers can cause or contribute to short term health harms such as eye, nose throat, and lung irritation, coughing and shortness of breath, and may exacerbate asthma or trigger asthma attacks. ("Smoke Gets in Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers In New York State," Elliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York state, environmental protection bureau, August 2005, p. 5.) 
(5)  Chronic exposure to smoke can cause long term effects such as asthma, hearth and lung diseases, and cancer. ("Smoke Gets in Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers in New York State," Elliot Spitzer, Attorney General of New York State, Environmental Protection Bureau, August 2005, p. 5.) 
(6)  There is public concern about the use of older technology hydronic heaters (also known as wood boilers) and their growing use, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest ("Strategies for Reducing Residential Wood Smoke," Outreach and Information Division, Air Quality Planning Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency October 29, 2009, p. 4.) 
(7)  As traditional sources of fuel (e.g., natural gas and heating oil) prices have gone up over the last several years, the purchase and use of wood fired hydronic heaters, also known as "outdoor wood boilers" have increased. ("Strategies for Reducing Residential Wood Smoke," Outreach and Information Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, October 29, 2009, p. 6.) 
(8)  Outdoor wood burner/boiler chimneys are often short and thus do not carry the smoke past the heights of neighboring homes, thus resulting in undispersed smoke and more concentrated pollution at lower elevations. ("Smoke Gets in Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers in New York State, Elliot Spitzer, Attorney General of New York State, Environmental Protection Bureau, August 2005, pgs. 5, 12.) 
(9)  The United States Environmental Protection Agency does not currently regulate the manufacture, sale, or efficiency claims of outdoor wood burners/boilers. ("Smoke Gets in Your Lungs: Outdoor Wood Boilers in New York State, Elliot Spitzer, Attorney General of New York State, Environmental Protection Bureau, August 2005, p. 17.) 
(10)  In light of the significant harm that wood smoke can present, the city council finds that the burning of other similar plant based materials poses similar risks when burned in outdoor burners/boilers. 
(11)  Given the potential for significant harm to residents' health, the city council hereby finds and declares that outdoor burners/boilers constitute a public nuisance. 
(b)  Prohibition of New Outdoor Burners/Boilers. From and after April 23, 2017, outdoor burners/boilers are prohibited subject to subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  Prohibition of Use and Operation of Existing Outdoor Burners/Boilers. The owner of an existing outdoor burner/boiler must not use or operate the outdoor burner/boiler from and after May 31, 2019.

(j)  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 60 degrees. 
(k)  Sight easements with tangent distances of 30 feet shall be provided at street intersections or the city council may permit property lines at street intersections to be rounded with a radius deemed necessary. 
(l)  Street right-of-way width shall be as shown in the master plan, and where not shown therein shall not be less than as follows: 
Street Type Minimum Right-Of-Way Feet Arterial and major 100 to 150 Collector 80 Local 60 Half-street 30

8.  Expansion or enlargement of nonconforming buildings. 
i.  For purpose of this subsection, the total square feet of the existing nonconforming building shall be determined as the total size of the existing building that existed on the effective date of this section.

Sec. 118-39. - Variances. 
(a)  Application. Any owner of property, a person, firm, association, or corporation holding a contract to purchase property, an optionee holding an option conditioned solely on the grant of a variance, or the duly authorized agent of such person, may make application for a variance, which shall include the written consent of the fee owner. The application shall be made on forms supplied by the city and filed with the city planner. The application shall contain the following: 
(1)  The legal description of the property; 
(2)  The zoning district in which the property is located; 
(3)  A brief statement of the reasons the variance is requested; and 
(4)  A statement of the ownership interest therein of the applicant. 
(b)  Variances prohibited . No variance may be granted for a use of any property different from that permitted by this chapter. Variances may be granted for the extension of the nonconforming use of a property that was nonconforming on the date of the adoption of this chapter and such nonconforming use or any extension thereof shall not have expired. 
(c)  Procedures . 
(1)  All applications for a variance shall be referred to the planning commission for its review and recommendation to the city council, and property owners within 350 feet of the property in question shall be notified by mail of the hearing date and time, although failure of any property owner to receive such notification shall not invalidate the proceedings. Either the planning commission or the city council shall hold a public hearing on the application. A notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be published in the official newspaper of the city at least ten days prior to the day of the public hearing. 
(2)  The planning commission shall make written findings of the practical difficulties, and shall forward its recommendation to the city council; if no recommendation is transmitted after referral of the application to the planning commission, the city council may take action without such recommendation. 
(3)  Variances shall be granted or denied by resolution of the city council. 
(d)  Standards for granting a variance . A variance may only be granted when: 
(1)  The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the ordinance; 
(2)  The terms of the variance are consistent with the comprehensive plan; and 
(3)  The applicant for the variance establishes that there are practical difficulties in complying with the ordinance. Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties. "Practical difficulties" as used in connection with the granting of a variance means that: 
a.  The property owner proposes to utilize the property in a reasonable manner; 
b.  The plight of the property owner is due to circumstances unique to the property that were not created by the property owner; and 
c.  The variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood. 
(e)  Conditions . The city may attach such reasonable conditions to the granting of a variance as it shall determine necessary or desirable to bring it within the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(f)  Termination . The violation of any condition in the grant of the variance may terminate the variance, following a hearing by the city council. If the property is not used or improvements substantially begun within a period of one year after the decision granting the variance, the variance shall terminate, and the city planner shall notify the owner of the termination thereof. The owner, in the event of any such termination, shall have the right of appeal as set forth in this chapter.

State Law reference- Variances, Minn. Stat.  462.357, subd. 6. 
Sec. 118-40. - Conditional use permits. 
(a)  Purpose and public policy . In the enactment of this chapter, the city recognizes that there are certain uses that, because of their characteristics, limited number, or unique character, cannot be classified into any particular district or districts without providing extensive regulatory provisions. It is also recognized that certain uses, while generally not suitable in a particular zoning district, may, under some circumstances and conditions, be suitable. A conditional use permit shall apply to the use of land and not to a particular person. Any change in land ownership, lease, rental, occupancy or other similar change shall not affect the conditional use permit. The provision for conditional use permits is, therefore, established in order that the regulations of the city with respect to zoning may be continued on an individual basis as follows: 
(1)  In situations where this Code specifically provides for the use by a conditional use permit. 
(2)  In the instances where the particular use sought is not or cannot by a reasonable interpretation thereof be brought within the purview of this chapter in any district provided therein. 
(3)  To provide for government use and uses that are traditionally considered to be affected with a public interest. 
(4)  Reserved. 
(5)  If a use is listed as both a permitted and a conditional use in this chapter, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. 
(6)  The city may deny issuance of any conditional use permit not in conformity to the basis and criteria for granting such permits. 
(b)  Application . Any owner of property, a person, firm, association, or corporation holding a contract to purchase property, an optionee holding an option conditioned solely on the grant of a variance, or the duly authorized agent of such person, may make application for a variance, which shall include the written consent of the fee owner. The application shall be made on forms supplied by the city and filed with the city planner. The application shall contain the following: 
(1)  The legal description of the property; 
(2)  The zoning district in which the property is located and the section number of this chapter which permits the issuance of the conditional use permit; 
(3)  A brief statement describing the use and why the applicant believes that it can be allowed under this chapter; and 
(4)  A statement of the ownership interest therein of the applicant. 
(c)  Procedures . 
(1)  All applications for a conditional use permit shall be referred to the planning commission for its review and recommendation to the city council, and if the site is less than five acres, property owners within 350 feet of the property shall be notified by mail of the hearing date and time, although failure of any property owner to receive such notification shall not invalidate the proceedings. Either the planning commission or the city council shall hold a public hearing on the application. A notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be published in the official newspaper of the city at least ten days prior to the day of the public hearing. 
(2)  The planning commission shall make written findings, and shall forward its recommendation to the city council; if no recommendation is transmitted after referral of the application to the planning commission, the city council may take action without such recommendation. 
(3)  Conditional use permits shall be granted or denied by resolution of the city council. 
(d)  Standards for approving a conditional use permit . The planning commission shall make the following affirmative determinations before a conditional use permit may be recommended for approval by the city council: 
(1)  That the conditional use, with such conditions as the commission shall determine and attach, conforms to the general purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(2)  If the application is based on the conditional use provision in this chapter that the issuance conforms to the general characteristics of the district of which it will become a part. 
(3)  That the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of property in the neighborhood for uses permitted in the district or districts affected. 
(4)  That adequate utilities, access roads, streets, drainage, and other necessary facilities have been or will be provided. 
(5)  That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress in such a manner as to minimize traffic congestion and hazards in the public streets. 
(6)  In residential districts, certain uses may not be considered appropriate within the interior of residential neighborhoods because of noise, traffic, or other conditions that would tend to adversely affect the residential character of the neighborhood and possibly reduce property values. These may be considered appropriate only on the periphery of residential neighborhoods or under such conditions as the city council may deem proper. The uses may represent "buffer" uses for those areas lying between residential dwellings and nonresidential uses. 
(7)  In consideration of an application, the following standards shall apply: 
a.  Business districts . Certain uses are considered, as a rule, unsuitable in commercial areas because of inherent characteristics (e.g., traffic hazards, noise, light glare), proximity to residential areas, the fact that they tend not to serve nearby residential areas, or may adversely affect nearby permitted business uses. 
b.  Industrial districts . Certain uses may be considered generally unsuitable in industrial districts because of conditions that would tend to discourage other industrial development in the vicinity; these conditions may include noise, vibrations, dust, glare, unsightliness, or similar nuisances. Certain other industrial land uses are considered generally inappropriate because they represent underutilization of land, which, in turn, means a low tax return from land that under fuller development would be contributing needed revenue to the city's tax base. 
c.  Temporary uses in all zoning districts . Certain uses that are generally not suitable within a particular zoning district may be potentially suitable on a temporary basis. This may be due to the lack of development of existing property, a short-term need, or a limited degree of adverse effects upon adjacent land use. 
(e)  Conditions . The city may attach such reasonable conditions to the granting of a conditional use permit as it shall determine necessary or desirable to bring it within the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(f)  Termination . The violation of any condition in the grant of the conditional use permit may terminate the conditional use permit, following a hearing by the city council. If the property is not used or improvements substantially begun within a period of one year after the decision of the city council, the conditional use permit shall terminate, and the city planner shall notify the owner of the termination thereof. The owner, in the event of any such termination, shall have the right of appeal as set forth in this chapter.

Sec. 118-41. - Interim use permits. 
(a)  Definition. As used in this section, the term "interim use" shall mean a temporary use of property until a particular date, until the occurrence of a particular event, or until zoning regulations no longer permit it. 
(b)  Application. Any owner of property, a person, firm, association, or corporation holding a contract to purchase property, an optionee holding an option conditioned solely on the grant of an interim use permit, or the duly authorized agent of such person, may make application for an interim use permit, which shall include the written consent of the fee owner. The application shall be made on forms supplied by the city and filed with the city planner. 
(c)  Procedures . 
(1)  All applications for an interim use shall be referred to the planning commission for its review and recommendation to the city council. Either the planning commission or the city council shall hold a public hearing on the application. A notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be published in the official newspaper of the city at least ten days prior to the day of the public hearing. 
(2)  The planning commission shall forward its recommendation to the city council; if no recommendation is transmitted after referral of the application to the planning commission, the city council may take action without such recommendation. 
(3)  Interim use permits shall be granted or denied by resolution of the city council. 
(d)  Standard for granting interim use permit . The city council may grant an interim use permit for the interim use of property if: 
(1)  The use conforms to the zoning regulations; 
(2)  The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified with certainty; 
(3)  Permit of the use will not impose additional costs on the city if it is necessary for the city to take the property in the future; and 
(4)  The user agrees in writing to any conditions that the city council deems appropriate for permission of the use. 
(e)  Conditions . The city may attach such reasonable conditions to the granting of an interim use permit as it shall determine necessary or desirable to bring it within the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(f)  Termination . The violation of any condition in the grant of the interim use permit may terminate the interim use permit, following a hearing by the city council. If the property is not used or improvements substantially begun within a period of one year after the decision of the city council, the interim use permit shall terminate, and the city planner shall notify the owner of the termination thereof. The owner, in the event of any such termination, shall have the right of appeal as set forth in this chapter.

Sec. 118-42. - Amendments. 
    The zoning code (text or district map) may be amended whenever the public necessity and convenience and general welfare require such an amendment by following the procedure specified in this section. An amendment may be initiated by the city council, the planning commission, an individual property owner, or by the verified petition of the owners of not less than 50 percent of the frontage of the area affected by the proposed amendment. 
(1)  Application . Any owner of property, a person, firm, association, or corporation holding a contract to purchase property, an optionee holding an option conditioned solely on the grant of a rezoning, or the duly authorized agent of such person, may make application for a rezoning text or map amendment, which shall include the written consent of the fee owner. The application shall be made on forms supplied by the city and filed with the city planner. The application shall contain the following: 
a.  The overall size of the exterior of the existing or proposed building or buildings. 
b.  The general character and appearance of the buildings in elevation. 
c.  A site plan showing the placement of all buildings on the site, the layout of proposed parking areas showing both ingress and egress, the existing and proposed contours of the site showing any retaining walls proposed and the final slope of the finished ground as proposed. The contours of the existing land may be a maximum of five-foot intervals, and the contours of proposed grades must be on a maximum of two-foot intervals. 
d.  The general layout of access roads proposed and sewer and water connections needed. 
(2)  Procedures . 
a.  All applications for an rezoning text or map amendment shall be referred to the planning commission for its review and recommendation to the city council.

For the purpose of giving mailed notice, the person responsible for mailing the notice may use any appropriate records to determine the names and addresses of owners. A copy of the notice and a list of the owners and addresses to which the notice was sent shall be attested to by the responsible person and shall be made a part of the records of the proceedings. The failure to give mailed notice to individual property owners, or defects in the notice shall not invalidate the proceedings, provided a bona fide attempt to comply with this section has been made.

(1)  Application for a certificate of occupancy for a new use of land, new building or for an existing building that has been altered may be filed with the city engineer after the application for a building permit for such building. The certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the city engineer within ten days after the construction or alteration of such building or part thereof has been completed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and the state building code. Pending the issuance of said certificate, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the city engineer, subject to the provisions of the building code, for a period not to exceed 12 months during the completion of the erection or the alteration of such building. The temporary certificate shall not be construed as in any way altering the respective rights, duties, or obligations of the owners or of the city relating to the use or occupancy of the premises or any other matter except under such restrictions and provisions as will adequately ensure the safety of the occupants. The use of any structure for which a building permit is required shall be considered a violation of this chapter unless a certificate of occupancy has been issued.

Sec. 118-170. - EB, existing business overlay district. 
(a)  General. The EB district is designated as an overlay district to recognize and permit certain existing commercial and industrial land uses which may technically not be in conformance with the comprehensive municipal plan. Such uses shall be conforming uses within the EB district and are subject to the conditions and regulations in this section. The boundaries of the EB district are established as indicated on the map entitled "Existing Business Overlay district" which is made a part of this chapter by reference. 
(b)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be all commercial and industrial uses of structures and land that existed within the C-1, GB, and I zoning districts prior to the adoption of the South St. Paul City Code of 1992 for which either a conditional permit had been issued or a certificate of occupancy had been issued or which existed on February 1, 1969, in the area designated industrial (I) district under the zoning regulations in effect as of that date. EB district uses and structures may be continued, expanded, and intensified on the site and may be replaced by a use that is a permitted use in the underlying zoning district. The word "site," as used in this section, means the land occupied by and used in conjunction with the EB district use and that is described in any existing business statement issued pursuant to this section. To be considered a permitted use, each existing EB use shall furnish to the city a statement in writing of its existing business status within one year of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. Such statement shall include a description of the land use and the date that the EB status became effective, which shall be the effective date of the ordinance adopting this chapter. The city shall work with all existing users to assist them in furnishing the required items within the required time limit. 
(c)  Conditional uses. The following uses shall be allowed only upon issuance of a conditional use permit: 
(1)  New or moved signs, new or changed off-street parking, new exterior lights, or other similar changes or alterations. 
(2)  Expansion of an EB district onto adjacent land owned or controlled by the owner of the existing commercial or industrial land use located within the EB district; provided, however, that such expansion is prohibited if the adjacent land is in an underlying R-1, R-2, R-3 or R-4 zoning district. 
(d)  Exceptions and additions. 
(1)  Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the city council may require reasonable improvements and conditions in the public interest, such as removal of junk and debris, installation of screening, building and yard maintenance, and conformity to certain performance standards of this Code. 
(2)  Nothing in this Code shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any portion of a building or structure declared unsafe by the city. 
(3)  Use of a building or premises in the EB district that has been abandoned for a period of at least one year shall not thereafter be resumed if the use is not a permitted or conditional use in the surrounding zone. A building or use shall not be considered abandoned if the use is interrupted due to acts of God, such as fire, flood, storms or explosion, or strike, sale of business, or circumstances beyond the control of the owner, and the owner restores the use to the building as soon as practicable after the event is over. 
(e)  Landscaping. Landscaping requirements for additions in excess of 5,000 square feet to existing structures in the EB district shall be the same as those required in the industrial zone section 118-129. 
(Code 1992,  1500.20) 
Sec. 118-171. - Floodplain districts. 
(a)  Authority; findings of fact; purpose. 
(1)  Statutory authorization . The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minn. Stat. chs. 103F and 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of the City of South St. Paul, Minnesota, does ordain as follows: 
(2)  Findings of fact . 
a.  [Public health, safety, general welfare.] The flood hazard areas of the City of South St. Paul, Minnesota, are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures or flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
b.  Methods used to analyze flood hazards . This section is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. 
c.  National Flood Insurance Program compliance . This section is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(3)  Statement of purpose . It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in subsection (a)(2)a. by provisions contained herein. 
(b)  General provisions . 
(1)  Lands to which section applies . This section shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the Floodway and Flood Fringe districts. 
(2)  Establishment of official zoning map . The official zoning map together with all materials attached thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section. The attached material shall include the flood insurance study for Dakota County, Minnesota, and incorporated areas and flood insurance rate map panels therein numbered 27037C0041E, 27037C0043E, 27037C0044E, 27037C0107E and the flood insurance rate map index (map number 27037CIND4A), all dated December 2, 2011, and prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The official zoning map shall be on file in the office of the city clerk and the city planner. 
(3)  Regulatory flood protection elevation . The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
(4)  Interpretation . 
a.  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city council and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
b.  The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the zoning administrator, the board of adjustment shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the community adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the board of adjustment and to submit technical evidence. 
(5)  Abrogation and greater restrictions . It is not intended by this section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(6)  Warning and disclaimer of liability . This section does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(7)  Severability . If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Ordinance shall not be affected thereby. 
(8)  Definitions . For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall be used. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this section shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and so as to give this section its most reasonable application. 
a.  Accessory use or structure means a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure. 
b.  Basement means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level. 
c.  Conditional use means a specific type of structure or land use listed in the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that: 
1.  Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist. 
2.  The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood. 
d.  Equal degree of encroachment means a method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows. 
e.  Flood means a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas. 
f.  Flood frequency means the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded. 
g.  Flood fringe means that portion of the floodplain outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood Insurance Study for Dakota County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas. 
h.  Floodplain means the beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood. 
i.  Floodproofing means a combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of flood damages. 
j.  Floodway means the bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those portions of the adjoining floodplain which are reasonably required to carry or store the regional flood discharge. 
k.  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor. 
l.  Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include the term "recreational vehicle." 
m.  Obstruction means any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory floodplain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water. 
n.  Principal use or structure means all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures. 
o.  Reach means a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or manmade obstruction. In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach. 
p.  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this section, the term recreational vehicle shall be synonymous with the term travel trailer/travel vehicle. 
q.  Regional flood means a flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood" used in a flood insurance study. 
r.  Regulatory flood protection elevation means the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
s.  Structure means anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in subsection (h)(3)a. of this section and other similar items. 
t.  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
u.  Substantial improvement means within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure." For the purpose of this section, "historic structure" shall be as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, part 59.1. 
v.  Variance means a modification of a specific permitted development standard required in an official control including this section to allow an alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation. 
w.  Zoning administrator means the city engineer or the city engineer's designee. 
(9)  Annexations . The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference into subsection (b)(2) above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the city at the time of adoption of this section. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the city after the date of adoption of this section, the newly annexed floodplain lands shall be subject to the provisions of this section immediately upon the date of annexation into the city. 
(c)  Establishment of zoning districts. 
(1)  Districts. 
a.  Floodway district . The Floodway district shall include those areas designated as floodway on the flood insurance rate map adopted in subsection (b)(2). 
b.  Flood Fringe district . The Flood Fringe district shall include those areas designated as floodway fringe. The Flood Fringe district shall include those areas shown on the flood insurance rate map as adopted in subsection (b)(2) as being within zones AE but being located outside of the floodway. 
(2)  Compliance . No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be constructed, located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this section. Within the Floodway and Flood Fringe districts, all uses not listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in subsections (d) and (e) that follow, respectively, shall be prohibited. In addition, a caution is provided here that: 
a.  New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain travel trailers and travel vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this section and specifically subsection (h). 
b.  Modifications, additions, structural alterations, normal maintenance and repair, or repair after damage to existing nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of structures or land are regulated by the general provisions of this section and specifically subsection (j). 
c.  As-built elevations for elevated or floodproofed structures must be certified by ground surveys and floodproofing techniques must be designed and certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as specified in the general provisions of this section and specifically as stated in subsection (i). 
(d)  Floodway district (FW). 
(1)  Permitted uses. 
a.  General farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, truck farming, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting. 
b.  Industrial-commercial loading areas, parking areas, and airport landing strips. 
c.  Private and public golf courses, tennis courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, shooting preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting and fishing areas, and single or multiple purpose recreational trails. 
d.  Residential lawns, gardens, parking areas, and play areas. 
(2)  Standards for floodway permitted uses. 
a.  The use shall have a low flood damage potential. 
b.  The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists. 
c.  The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and shall not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of materials or equipment. 
(3)  Conditional uses. 
a.  Structures accessory to the uses listed in [subsection] (d)(1) above and the uses listed in [subsections] (d)(3)b. through (d)(3)h. below. 
b.  Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials. 
c.  Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water-control structures. 
d.  Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines, and pipelines. 
e.  Storage yards for equipment, machinery, or materials. 
f.  Placement of fill or construction of fences. 
g.  Recreational vehicles either on individual lots of record or in existing or new subdivisions or commercial or condominium type campgrounds, subject to the exemptions and provisions of subsection (h)(3). 
h.  Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency flood event. 
(4)  Standards for floodway conditional uses. 
a.  All uses. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected. 
b.  All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained in subsection (i)(4). 
c.  The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists. 
d.  Fill. 
1.  Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method. 
2.  Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a longterm site development plan is submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan. 
3.  As an alternative, and consistent with subsection 2. immediately above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the city council has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the office of the county recorder. 
e.  Accessory structures. 
1.  Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation. 
2.  Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of floodwaters: 
(i)  Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and 
(ii)  So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures. 
3.  Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards: 
(i)  The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; 
(ii)  Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed; and 
(iii)  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
f.  Storage of materials and equipment. 
1.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
2.  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city council. 
g.  Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minn. Stat., ch. 103G. Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory floodplain shall not be allowed in the floodway. 
h.  A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream. 
(e)  Flood Fringe district (FF). 
(1)  Permitted uses . Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s). If no preexisting, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in the Flood Fringe district provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe district "permitted uses" listed in subsection (e)(2) and the "standards for all flood fringe uses" listed in subsection (e)(5). 
(2)  Standards for flood fringe permitted uses. 
a.  All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon. 
b.  As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at their largest projection may be internally floodproofed in accordance with subsection (d)(4)e.3. 
c.  The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of 1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a conditional use, unless said fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection (e)(2)a. 
d.  The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
e.  The provisions of subsection (e)(5) shall apply. 
(3)  Conditional uses . Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with subsections (e)(2)a. and (e)(2)b. and or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in subsections (e)(2)c. and (e)(2)d. shall only be allowable as a conditional use. An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in subsections (e)(4), (e)(5) and (i)(4). 
(4)  Standards for flood fringe conditional uses. 
a.  Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 
1.  The enclosed area is above grade on at least one side of the structure; 
2.  It is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood-resistant materials; and 
3.  It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards: 
(i)  Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding. 
(ii)  Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: 
(iii)  A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters without any form of human intervention; and 
(iv)  That the enclosed area will be designed of flood-resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage. 
b.  Basements, as defined by subsection (b)(8)b., shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
2.  Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with subsection (e)(4)c. 
c.  All areas of nonresidential structures including basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted. 
d.  When at any one time more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing a state approved shoreland management ordinance. In the absence of a state approved shoreland ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city council. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists. 
e.  Storage of materials and equipment: 
1.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
2.  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city council. 
f.  The provisions of subsection (e)(5) shall also apply. 
(5)  Standards for all flood fringe uses. 
a.  [New principal structures.] All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the city council must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist. 
b.  Commercial uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four upon occurrence of the regional flood. 
c.  Manufacturing and industrial uses. Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in subsection (e)(5)b. above. In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in floodplain areas. 
d.  [Fill.] Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation; FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multistructure or multilot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested. 
e.  [Floodplain developments.] Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map. 
f.  Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in subsection (h)(3). 
g.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(f)  Subdivisions. 
(1)  Review criteria . No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots within the floodplain districts shall be able to contain a building site outside of the Floodway district at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this section and have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe district boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents. 
(2)  Removal of special flood hazard area designation . The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multistructure or multilot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested. 
(g)  Public utilities, railroads, roads, and bridges. 
(1)  Public utilities. All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the floodplain shall be floodproofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(2)  Public transportation facilities. Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located within the floodplain shall comply with subsections (d) and (e). Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety. 
(3)  On-site sewage treatment and water supply systems. Where public utilities are not provided: 
a.  On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems; and 
b.  New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters and they shall not be subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system designed in accordance with the state's current statewide standards for on-site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this section. 
(h)  Manufactured homes and manufactured home parks and placement of recreational vehicles. 
(1)  New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing manufactured home parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on subdivisions by subsection (f). 
(2)  The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in existing manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are located in floodplain districts will be treated as a new structure and may be placed only if elevated in compliance with subsection (e). If vehicular road access for preexisting manufactured home parks is not provided in accordance with subsection (e)(5)a., then replacement manufactured homes will not be allowed until the property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan acceptable to the city council. 
a.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(3)  Recreational vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria specified in subsection (h)(3)a. below shall be subject to the provisions of this section and as specifically spelled out in subsections (h)(3)c. and (h)(3)d. below. 
a.  Exemption . Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this section if they are placed in any of the areas listed in subsection (h)(3)b. below and further they meet the following criteria: 
1.  Have current licenses required for highway use. 
2.  Are highway ready meaning on wheels or the internal jacking system, are attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks and the recreational vehicle has no permanent structural type additions attached to it. 
3.  The recreational vehicle and associated use must be permissible in any pre-existing, underlying zoning use district. 
b.  Areas exempted for placement of recreational vehicles. 
1.  Individual lots or parcels of record. 
2.  Existing commercial recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds. 
3.  Existing condominium type associations. 
c.  [Loss of exemption.] Recreational vehicles exempted in subsection (h)(3)a. lose this exemption when development occurs on the parcel exceeding $500.00 for a structural addition to the recreational vehicle or exceeding $500.00 for an accessory structure such as a garage or storage building.

(5)  Conical surface. One foot in height for each 20 feet of horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal surface extending outward to a distance of 5,000 feet and upward to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation, or a height of 1,170 feet, mean sea level datum. 
(c)  Turning zones. An airport turning zone is hereby established which shall consist of the areas between each of the airport approach zones and the outer area of the approach zone where the glide ratio exceeds 150 square feet, except those areas included within the transition zone. The outer boundary of the turning zone shall be a series of intersecting arcs completely around the airport, each arc being swung on a two-mile radius from the midway point of the inner boundary of each airport approach zone, but in any event limited to that part thereof in the county. 
(d)  Transition zone. A transition zone is hereby established which shall consist of the area described as follows: 
(1)  Beginning with a line running parallel to and 250 feet from the centerline of such runway, and from such line extending upward at a slope of seven to one until a height of 150 feet is reached. 
(2)  Beginning at the edge of the approach zone to each runway and extending upward from the top of such approach zone at a slope of seven to one until a height of 150 feet is established. 
All zones established by this subsection shall be indicated on a map on file in the city clerk's office and shall not change except upon specific amendment to this subsection. 
(e)  Height zones. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no structure shall be constructed, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow to a height above the level of the airport in excess of the height limit in any airport approach, turning, or transition zone. The following height limits are hereby established: 
(1)  Airport approach zones to each runway . One foot in height for each 20 feet in distance from the nearest point on the shortest boundary of such zone. 
(2)  Airport turning zones . One hundred fifty feet in height in the area described in the turning zone. 
(3)  Transition zone. One foot in height for each seven feet in distance in the area described in the transition zone up to a height of 150 feet. 
Provided that in no event shall a height limit be less than 20 feet above the control level in any zone, regardless of the height limitations of this subsection. However, any point beyond 1,000 feet from the airport boundary uses otherwise permissible may be made up to 50 feet above the ground level, regardless of the height limitations. 
(f)  Other restrictions. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, no use may be made of land in an airport approach or turning zone in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft. Use of searchlights or other types of light in such a way as to make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off or maneuvering of aircraft is prohibited. 
(g)  Nonconforming uses. The regulations prescribed in subsections (e) and (f) of this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any nonconforming use except as otherwise provided in this subsection. Before any nonconforming structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, or replanted, a permit shall be secured authorizing such replacement, change, or repair. No such permit shall be granted that would allow the structure or tree to be made higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted. Whenever the city engineer determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 50 percent torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations, and whether application is made for a permit under this subsection or not, the city engineer may by appropriate action compel the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree, at his own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip such object as may be necessary to conform to the regulations. If the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree shall neglect or refuse to comply with such order after ten days' notice thereof, the city engineer may proceed to have the object so lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped, and assess the cost and expense thereof upon the object or the land whereon it is or was located. Unless such an assessment is paid within 90 days from the service of notice thereof on the agent or owner of such object or land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent per annum until paid, and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes. Except as indicated herein, all applications for permits for replacement, change, or repair of nonconforming uses shall be granted. 
(h)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use property not in accordance with this subsection may apply to the airport board of adjustment for a variance from the regulation in question. A variance may be allowed where a literal application of enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest, do substantial justice, and be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations; provided that any variance may be allowed subject to any reasonable conditions that the board may deem necessary to effectuate the purpose of this subsection. 
(i)  Building zone permits. No material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected, altered, or moved, and no tree shall be planted in any zone created in this subsection within 1,000 feet of the airport boundary, or, if over 50 feet in height and beyond 1,000 feet of the airport boundary, without a permit therefor. Application for such a permit shall be made to the city engineer and shall indicate the use for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit determination whether such use would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the city engineer shall issue the permit applied for. 
(j)  Hazard warnings. Any permit or variance granted under this subsection may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purposes of this subsection and reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the city, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. 
(k)  Board of adjustment. An airport board of adjustment is established and continues consisting of the airport board established and described in this Code. The board shall have and exercise the powers set out in this subsection and subsections (l) through (n) of this section. 
(1)  The board may hear and decide appeals from any order, requirements, decision, or determination made by the engineer in the enforcement of the airport zoning regulations. 
(2)  The board may hear and decide any special exception to the terms of the airport zoning regulations upon which the board may be required to pass under such regulations. 
(3)  The board may hear and decide specific variances under subsection (h) of this section. 
The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the board of adjustment shall be sufficient to reverse any order, requirements, decision or determination of the city engineer, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under the airport zoning regulations, or to effect any variation in such regulations. 
(l)  Board procedures. The board shall adopt rules in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Meetings shall be held at the call of the chair and at such other times as the board may determine. The chairperson or, in the absence of the chairperson, the acting chairperson, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All hearings of the board shall be made public. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examination and other official action, all of which shall immediately be filed in the office of the city clerk and shall be a public record. 
(m)  Administration. The city engineer shall enforce this section through appropriate legal channels. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the engineer. Those applications that are by this subsection to be decided by the engineer shall be promptly considered and granted or denied by the engineer. Applications for action by the board shall be transmitted forthwith by the city engineer to the board for hearing and decision. 
(n)  Appeals and review. Any person aggrieved, or taxpayers affected by any decision of the city engineer made in the administration of this section, or the city council when it is the opinion that a decision of the engineer is an improper application of airport zoning regulation of concern to the city council, may appeal to the board in accordance with Minn. Stat.  360.068. Any person aggrieved or taxpayer affected by any decision of the board or the city council when it is of the opinion that a decision of the board is illegal may secure judicial review of such decision in the manner provided by Minn. Stat.  360.072.

(Code 1992,  1500.28, subd. 34) 
Sec. 118-271. - Personal wireless services tower. 
(a)  Location priorities. The 1996 Federal Telecommunications Act granted the wireless telecommunications industry expanded authority for licensing and creating new wireless communications systems. This will result in the development of new wireless communications facilities, including towers and antennas. The city desires to locate new wireless communications facilities in the best interest of its residents, consistent with sound land use planning principles and fiscal policy. Therefore, the following location priorities for PWS antennas and towers are established: 
(1)  First priority. Location of PWS antenna by lease on existing city facilities, such as water towers. 
(2)  Second priority. Location of PWS towers and antennas by lease on city-owned real property. 
(3)  Third priority . Collocate antennas on existing PWS towers. 
(4)  Fourth priority . Location of PWS towers and antenna on existing structures. 
(5)  Fifth priority . Freestanding towers and antenna. 
An applicant for a conditional use permit or building permit, as the case may be, must prove that it is not feasible to locate the tower or antenna at a location in any of the lesser numbered priority categories. 
(b)  Design . 
(1)  PWS towers and antennas shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color and architectural treatment, except in instances where the color is dictated by federal or state authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration. 
(2)  PWS towers shall be of a monopole design unless the city council determines that an alternative design would better blend into the surrounding environment or better facilitate collocation. 
(3)  The towers, poles, antennas and related structures must be screened by security fencing to prevent unauthorized entry. The base of the tower and any accessory structures shall be landscaped with vegetation or in any manner that is compatible with the surrounding character, buildings or landscape. 
(c)  Setback requirements . PWS towers must be set back from the side and rear lot line a distance at least equal to the required setback of the underlying zoning district. The tower must be designed, constructed and maintained so that no part of the tower will fall on neighboring property, should the tower collapse. All towers must be set back a minimum 500 feet from the North Concord Street and South Concord Street rights-of-way. This setback is necessary for the following reasons: 
(1)  To avoid conflict with the Concord Street Redevelopment Plan, as outlined in the 1999 city comprehensive plan, which clearly outlines improving aesthetics and an enhanced "gateway experience." 
(2)  Because of the smaller lots and higher density of the commercial development along Concord Street, there must be adequate setback and buffer from the corridor to guarantee an adequate "drop zone" in case of catastrophic tower failure. 
(d)  Tower heights . Freestanding towers are not to exceed 170 feet in height, including antenna attachments. 
(e)  Lighting . Towers shall not be illuminated by artificial means and shall not display strobe lights unless such lighting is specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other federal or state authority. When incorporated into the approved design of the tower, light fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots, or similar areas may be attached to the tower. 
(f)  Attachments . No signs, pictures, or messages shall be attached to the antenna tower or its antennas or appurtenances, except an owner's identification plat is required. 
(g)  Accessory buildings . Accessory equipment associated with the PWS tower shall be located within a building or on the ground within a screen designed and landscaped to be compatible with the proposed structure and surrounding environment. All utility buildings and accessory structures shall be architecturally designed to blend in with the surrounding environment and shall meet the minimum setback requirements of the underlying zoning district. Ground-mounted equipment shall be screened from view by suitable vegetation, except where a design of nonvegetative screening better reflects and compliments the architectural character of the surrounding neighborhood. 
(h)  Construction . All PWS towers erected, constructed, or located within the city and all wiring therefor shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  All applicable provisions of this Code. 
(2)  PWS tower design shall be certified by a qualified and licensed professional engineer to conform to the structural standards of the state building code. 
(3)  Any proposed PWS tower shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects to accommodate both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two additional users, with antenna ports located at ten-foot intervals. 
(4)  Metal towers shall be constructed of or treated with corrosive resistant material. 
(5)  No part of the antenna or tower nor any lines, cable, equipment or wires or braces in connection with either shall at any time extend across or over any part of the right-of-way, public street, highway, sidewalk, or property line. 
(6)  Antennas and metal towers shall be grounded for protection against a direct strike by lightning and shall comply as to electrical wiring and connections with all applicable local statutes, regulations, and standards. 
(i)  Collocation requirements for existing towers . Existing towers and buildings shall provide rates, terms and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory for physical collocation of equipment. 
(j)  Building permit; inspection . All towers, monopoles, antennas and the like must obtain a building permit and are subject to inspection by the city building official to determine compliance with the state building code construction standards. Deviations from the original construction for which a permit is obtained is a misdemeanor. 
(k)  Abandoned or unused towers . Abandoned or unused towers shall be removed within six months of the cessation of operations at the site unless a time extension is approved by the city building inspector. Cessation of operations shall be communicated to the city building inspector by the landowner who owns the property on which the tower is located. To ensure the removal of obsolete and unused towers, the applicant shall, before the issuance of a building permit, provide security in the form of either an unconditional bond, a letter of credit in an amount sufficient to cover the removal costs of the tower and its accessory facilities, or such other form of financial assurance as will satisfy the city council. 
(l)  Analysis and study. At the time of PWS antenna or tower application the city shall commission a radio frequency and structural analysis study (the "study") performed by a certified communications engineer engaged by the city. The applicant shall reimburse the city for all costs of the study. 
(m)  Application for antenna mounted on or within an existing structure or building. A PWS antenna may be mounted on the outside of any existing structure 30 feet in height or higher in an R-4, LB, C-1, GB, or I district upon the issuance of a conditional use permit. In all zoning districts, PWS antennas may be mounted on the outside of an institutional building or structure, as defined in section 118-207, of any height upon issuance of a conditional use permit. PWS antennas may not extend higher than 18 feet above the highest point of a building or structure. In all zoning districts, a visibly obscure PWS antenna and related accessory equipment may be mounted inside any building or structure upon issuance of a building permit. In addition to other building permit application requirements, an application for a building permit for a PWS antenna to be mounted on or within an existing building or structure shall contain the following information: 
(1)  A site plan showing the location of the proposed antenna on the structure and documenting that the request meets the requirements of all applicable zoning building codes; 
(2)  A building plan showing the construction of the antennas, the proposed method of attaching them to the existing structure, and documenting that the request meets the requirements of this Code; 
(3)  A report prepared by a qualified and licensed professional engineer indicating the existing structure or tower's ability to support the antennas; 
(4)  An intermodulation study to ensure there will be no interference with existing tenants or public safety telecommunication providers; 
(5)  Accessory equipment and structures associated with the PWS antenna shall be located within the principal structure on top the principal structure, or ground mounted. Any exterior placement of accessory equipment and structures shall be screened and shall be architecturally designed to blend in with the surrounding neighborhood and the principal structure. All accessory equipment and structures shall be required to meet minimum requirements of the underlying zoning district. Ground-mounted accessory equipment and structure shall be screened from view by suitable vegetation and decorative privacy fencing with a minimum 85 percent opacity. The design of the screening for all ground mounted accessory equipment and structures must reflect and complement the architectural character of the surrounding neighborhood and principal structure. The screening plan is subject to review and approval of the city planner. If the screening plan is part of a conditional use permit application, it shall be subject to the approval of the city council. If the total area of all ground mounted equipment and accessory structures exceeds 120 square feet, a conditional use permit shall be required. 
(n)  Additional requirements. 
(1)  A conditional use permit is not required, but a building permit is required, for: 
a.  An antenna or combination of antenna and PWS tower rigidly attached to a building provided that the combination of antenna and PWS tower and building do not exceed a total height of 15 feet above the highest point of attachment, or the permissible height in that zoning district, whichever is lower; 
b.  Antennas and towers used by the city for municipal purposes; 
c.  The adjustment or replacement of the elements of an antenna array affixed to a PWS tower or antenna, provided the replacement does not reduce the safety factor and a building permit is first obtained therefor; and 
d.  Antennas and towers erected temporarily for test purposes, for emergency communication, or for broadcast remote pickup operations, provided that a building permit is first obtained therefor and provided further that the antennas and towers, as the case may be, must be removed within 72 hours following installation. 
(2)  In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city, the regulation of PWS towers is necessary to minimize adverse visual effects through careful design and siting standards, to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements, to maximize the use of existing and approved PWS towers and buildings, and to accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce duplication of PWS towers. 
(3)  In the case of an application for a PWS tower conditional use permit, the following additional information must be submitted with the application: 
a.  A report from a qualified and licensed professional engineer that does the following: 
1.  Describes the tower height and design, including a cross section and elevation; 
2.  Documents the height above grade for all potential mounting positions for collocated antennas and the minimum separation distances between antennas; 
3.  Describes the tower's capacity, including the number and type of antennas that it can accommodate; 
4.  Documents that the tower and proposed associated antennas conform with accepted electrical engineering methods and practices; 
5.  Includes an engineer's stamp and registration number; and 
6.  Includes other information necessary to evaluate the request. 
b.  Proof that the proposed PWS tower complies with all applicable regulations administered by Federal Aviation Administration. 
c.  For all PWS towers, a letter of intent committing the tower owner and successors thereof to allow the shared use of the tower if an additional user agrees in writing to meet reasonable terms and conditions for shared use. 
d.  Before attaching additional antennas or modifying any existing PWS tower, a qualified professional must evaluate and determine that each additional antenna or modification will not interfere with the existing antennas and that the PWS tower can support the additional antennas or modification. Proof of this evaluation must be filed with the city building inspector prior to the attachment of additional antennas or any modifications are made. 
e.  PWS tower, criteria for approval. An application for a conditional use permit for a new PWS tower shall not be approved unless it can be established by the applicant that the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or building within a one-mile radius of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following reasons: 
1.  The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost. 
2.  The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or building as documented by a competent radio frequency engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost. 
3.  Existing or approved towers and buildings within the one-mile radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a competent radio frequency engineer.

Sec. 118-351. - Applicability. 
    The off-street parking, loading and unloading requirements shall apply to all buildings, structures, and land uses hereinafter established or authorized. Regulations and requirements are as provided in this article.

Sec. 118-352. - General provisions. 
(a)  Reduction limitation. Existing off-street parking and loading spaces on the effective date of the ordinance adopting this chapter shall not be reduced in number unless said number exceeds the requirements set forth herein. 
(b)  Benches in places of public assembly . In stadiums, sport arenas, churches, and other places of public assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy seats, benches, pews, or other similar seating facilities, each bench shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining requirements for off-street parking facilities under this section. 
(c)  Parking spaces . Each parking space shall not be less than nine feet wide and 18 feet in length, exclusive of an adequately designed system of access drives. Parking lots that separate vehicles based on size may be designed with parking spaces less than or greater than nine feet wide and 18 feet in length, depending upon the size of the vehicle to be accommodated as long as adequate space is provided for easy and safe ingress and egress for the vehicle to be parked. 
(d)  Use of parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities accessory to residential uses shall be utilized solely for the parking of passenger vehicles. Under no circumstances shall required parking facilities accessory to residential structures be used for the parking of employees, owners, tenants, or customers of off-premises business or manufacturing establishments. 
(e)  Joint parking facilities . Off-street parking facilities for a combination of mixed buildings, structures, or uses may be provided collectively in any nonresidential zoning district in which separate parking facilities for each separate building, structure, or use would be required, provided that the total number of spaces provided shall equal the sum of the separate requirements of each use during any peak-hour parking period and a copy of the joint parking agreement is approved by the city engineer and placed on file with the city along with a certificate of occupancy for all land area involved. 
(f)  Control of off-street parking facilities . When required, accessory off-street parking facilities are provided elsewhere than on the lot on which the principal use served is located, they shall be in the same ownership or control, either by deed or longterm lease, as the property occupied by such principal use, and the owner of the principal use shall file a recordable document with the city engineer requiring the owner and the heirs and assigns thereof to maintain the required number of off-street parking spaces during the existence of said principal use. 
(g)  Prohibited use of parking spaces . Required off-street parking space in any zoning district shall not be utilized for open storage of goods and materials or for the storage of vehicles that are inoperable, not currently licensed, for sale, for rent, or other nonparking purposes. 
(h)  Minimum driveway area. In residential districts, no more than 25 percent of the required yard area shall be surfaced or utilized for driveway or vehicle parking space. 
(i)  Minimum space requirements. The number of off-street parking spaces required for various land uses as specified herein shall be considered as absolute minimum requirements. Additional off-street parking spaces may be required by the city council for any land use which, as determined by the city council, may for any reason generate more parking demand than called for by the minimum parking standards contained herein. Factors such as anticipated business volume, number of employees, number of visitors, hours and nature of business operation, and other such factors affecting potential parking needs may be considered. 
(j)  Parking on grass, yards prohibited. In all zoning districts within the city, off-street parking of any type of motor vehicle shall be permitted only on driveways or parking areas that are constructed of asphalt or concrete material. No more than one-third of the front yard of any property used for residential purposes may be paved for parking areas. Parking in landscaped yards and boulevards is prohibited, except as follows: 
(1)  For any property used for residential purposes, in order to aid in snow removal from residential streets and alleys, from November 15 to April 1, up to three motor vehicles registered to the property owner or occupant may be parked in a landscaped rear or side yard. Parking in a front yard is prohibited. 
(2)  For any property used for residential purposes, a recreational vehicle may be parked in a landscaped rear or side yard if the following conditions are met: 
a.  The recreational vehicle is not permanently affixed to the ground in a manner that would prevent its removal; 
b.  The recreational vehicle is not used for living, sleeping, or housekeeping purposes; 
c.  The recreational vehicle is in good, operable condition and is properly licensed for operation; 
d.  The recreational vehicle is not partially dismantled or used for sale or parts;

f.  The recreational vehicle is stored on a parking pad constructed of asphalt, concrete, landscape pavers or uniform rock, as depicted on a plan approved by the city engineer. The parking pad must encompass the entire parking area on which the recreational vehicle is located. If uniform rock is used, the rock must be contained by the use of edging and commercial-grade weed prevention fabric. 
(3)  For any property used for residential purposes, no more than two recreational vehicles may be stored in a grassy landscaped rear or side yard of a lot or a combination of contiguous lots in common ownership, if they meet the following requirements: 
a.  They are noncommercial utility trailers, typically used for transporting boats, snowmobiles, ATVs or similar vehicles; and 
b.  They are less than 20 feet in length (as measured from the tongue of the trailer to the rear of the trailer, but not including any vehicle that may be stored on the trailer and extends beyond the rear of the trailer); and 
c.  They have a GVW rating of less than 9,000 pounds. 
Exterior storage of items on the trailer other than a boat, snowmobile, ATV or similar vehicle is prohibited. All landscaped areas used for such parking or storage of utility trailers must comply with section 66-49 regarding weeds. 
(4)  For any property used for commercial purposes, passenger vehicles may be parked in paved portions of rights-of-way if the vehicles do not obstruct sidewalks, paths, rights-of-way or sight triangle areas. Parking in landscaped areas is prohibited.

(Code 1992,  1500.27, subd. 1; Ord. No. 1193,  1-3, 9-4-2007) 
Sec. 118-353. - Design and maintenance of off-street parking areas. 
(a)  Driveway width limitation. Parking areas shall be designed so as to provide adequate means of access to a public street or alley. Such access driveway widths and surface type shall be in accordance with standards approved by the city engineer, but in no case shall they exceed 22 feet in width unless approved or required by the city engineer. Driveway access shall be so designed and located as to cause the least interference with traffic movement on a street or alley. There shall be only one driveway access off a public street for each one-family residential lot. 
(b)  Calculating space. When calculating the number of off-street parking spaces required results in a fraction, such fraction shall require a full space. No street or alley right-of-way shall be used in calculating space for required off-street parking. 
(c)  Signs. No signs shall be located in any off-street parking area except as necessary for orderly operation of traffic movement and such signs shall not be a part of any permitted advertising space. 
(d)  Drainage. Off-street parking areas shall be so graded and constructed as to drain all water from the parking area and access drive in a manner as approved by the city engineer. All parking area and access drive surfacing must be completed prior to occupancy of the principal use building served unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. 
(e)  Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking shall be so designed and arranged as not to allow the direct source of light to be directly visible from the adjoining property; in most cases, this will require that the light be aimed downward in a vertical direction. However, in no case shall parking lot lighting exceed two footcandles in a business or industrial zone, nor one-half footcandle in a residential zone, all as measured at the lot line. 
(f)  Curbing and landscaping. All open off-street parking areas designed to have head-in parking along the property line shall provide six-inch integral concrete curb and gutter around the entire perimeter of the parking and driveway areas not less than five feet from the side property line. When said parking area is for six or more vehicles, a curb shall be installed and screening not over four feet in height shall be erected along the front yard setback line with grass or other plantings to occupy the space between the parking area and the front sidewalk or street curb. Wheel guards as approved by the city engineer may be utilized in lieu of other requirements. 
(g)  Planting islands. For each additional 3,000 square feet or a portion thereof of parking area beyond the first 3,000 square feet, one planting island of identical size to the neighboring parking space, but not less than 200 square feet, shall be installed within the interior of the parking lot, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. All planting islands installed shall have six-inch integral concrete curb and gutter around the entire perimeter, and a landscaped interior. 
(h)  Screening, six parking spaces or more. When a required off-street parking area for six or more vehicles is located adjacent to a residential use or district, a fence or screening not less than four feet in height shall be erected along the residential property line; additional screening may be required by the city engineer. 
(i)  Maintenance of off-street parking areas. It shall be the joint responsibility of the parking lot operator and landowner of the principal use or building to reasonably maintain the parking area, access drive, landscaping, and fencing and screening. Surfaced areas shall be kept free of dirt and debris, potholes, major cracks, material deterioration, and snow piles. Landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy condition and replaced if lost to winterkill, drought, or other causes. 
(j)  Access. All off-street parking spaces shall have access from driveways and not directly from the public street. Except for one-family and two-family homes, all vehicular egress from off-street parking areas shall be forward-moving rather than backing onto a public street, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. 
(k)  Determination of areas. When planning a parking lot, the parking space per vehicle shall not be less than 350 square feet of parking and maneuvering area or an area equal to the width of the parking space multiplied by the length of the parking space plus 12 feet. In most cases, however, the city engineer may require that a plan be submitted showing parking stalls and access drives as anticipated to be constructed even in the very early stages of planning a development with accessory parking lots. 
(l)  Minimum distance from building. In any zoning district other than for one-family and two-family homes, no parking space shall be closer than five feet to any building, except for garage parking. 
(m)  Fire lanes. Fire access lanes shall be provided as required by the fire code, state building code, or the city engineer based upon advice from the city fire department. 
(n)  Calculation of floor space for retail uses. Floor space, for purposes of calculating required parking space for retail uses, shall include only the floor area devoted to retail sales and shall not include storage space, restroom, interior pedestrian mall space, unless retail activities are to be located on floor area of said mall, hallways, enclosed walkways, utility rooms, window displays, office of building management or maintenance, lobbies, or similar floor space not generating a demand or need for parking space. Due consideration shall, however, be given to floor area which may and could reasonably be expected to be converted to retail or other commercial activity and thereby increase the need for parking. 
(o)  Shopping centers and large retail outlets. Shopping centers or individual retail outlets with over 50,000 square feet of floor area shall provide parking on the basis of 51/2 spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross leasable or useable floor area, as the case may be. 
(p)  Setbacks (yards). Except as specifically authorized and permitted by zoning district provisions, off-street parking shall not be located on required yards. 
(q)  Location. All required off-street parking shall be located on the same lot as the principal building served unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. No driveway or off-street parking area shall be located closer than two feet from an adjacent lot zoned or used for residential purposes.

Sec. I. - Purpose and authority. 
    The South St. Paul Joint Airport Zoning Board, created and established by joint action of the councils of the Cities of Inver Grove Heights, Newport, St. Paul Park, and South St. Paul, pursuant to the provisions and authority of Minn. Stat.  360.063, hereby finds and declares that: 
(a)  An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the South St. Paul Municipal Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity, and also if of the obstructive type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the South St. Paul Municipal Airport and the public investment therein. 
(b)  The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the region served by the South St. Paul Municipal Airport. 
(c)  For the protection of the public health, safety, order, convenience, prosperity and general welfare, and for the promotion of the most appropriate use of land, it is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of airport hazards. 
(d)  The prevention of these airport hazards should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation. 
E.[(e)]  The prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds.

Section IV. - Airspace obstruction zoning. 
A.  Airspace zones. In order to carry out the purpose of this ordinance, as set forth above, the following airspace zones are hereby established: primary zone, horizontal zone, conical zone, approach zone, precision instrument approach zone, and transitional zone and whose locations and dimensions are as follows: 
1.  Primary zone. All that land which lies directly under an imaginary primary surface longitudinally centered on a runway and extending 200 feet beyond each end of Runway 16-34. 
The elevation of any point of the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. The width of the primary surface is 500 feet for Runway 16-34. 
2.  Horizontal zone. All that land which lies directly under an imaginary horizontal surface 150 feet above the established airport elevation, or a height of 970 feet above mean sea level, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is 6,000 feet for Runway 16-34. 
3.  Conical zone. All that land which lies directly under an imaginary conical surface extending upward and outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet as measured radically outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface. 
4.  Approach zone. All that land which lies directly under an imaginary approach surface longitudinally centered on the extended centerline at each end of a runway. The inner edge of the approach surface is at the same width and elevation as, and coincides with, the end of the primary surface. The approach surface inclines upward and outward at a slope of 40:1 for Runway 16-34. 
The approach surface expands uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet for Runway 16-34 at a distance of 10,000 feet to the periphery of the conical surface. 
5.  Transitional zone. All that land which lies directly under an imaginary surface extending upward and outward at right angles to the runway centerline and centerline extended at a slope of 7 to 1 from the sides of the primary surfaces and from the sides of the approach surfaces until they intersect the horizontal surface or the conical surface. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision instrument approach surface which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the precision instrument approach surface and at right angles to the extended precision instrument runway centerline. 
B.  Height restrictions. Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, except as necessary and incidental to airport operations, no structure or tree shall be constructed, altered, maintained, or allowed to grow in any airspace zone created in section IV.A so as to project above any of the imaginary airspace surfaces described in said section IV.A hereof. Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitations shall prevail, provided, however, with respect to those areas covered by section 1.b below the least restrictive limitations shall prevail. 
1.  Exceptions. 
a.  In those areas legally where existing terrain or trees penetrate one or more of the imaginary airspace surfaces, the height of the structures shall be restricted to the height of the imaginary airspace surface or to the height of the tree canopy which provides a natural shield to the structure, whichever is the greater height. 
b.  In those areas described below, the highest point of a structure shall be restricted to the height of the imaginary airspace surface or to 100 feet above the existing terrain, whichever is the greater height, provided it is determined by the Federal Aviation Administration that no hazard will result from the structure being erected. 
The elevation from which the 100 feet shall be measured shall be determined by adding the lowest elevation of the existing terrain under the proposed structure and the highest elevation of the existing terrain under the proposed structure and dividing by two. Existing terrain shall be that shown on the topographical surveys prepared by Mark Hurd, which shall be on file in the office of the airport zoning administrator. 
LEGAL DESCRIPTION 
That portion of "Kassan Ridge" lying south of the south right-of-way line of Interstate Highway 494; AND that part of "Warren and McDowells Acre Lots No. 2" lying south of the south right-of-way line of Interstate Highway 494; and that portion of "Glenwood Addition" lying south of the south right-of-way line of Interstate Highway 494; and that portion of "Sarles Addition" lying south of the south right-of-way line of Interstate Highway 494 and west of the corporate limits of the City of South St. Paul; and that portion of "Edgewood Addition" lying west of the corporate limits of the City of South St. Paul; and that portion of "Woodland Addition" lying west of the corporate limits of the City of South St. Paul; and the following described properties:

B.  Use restrictions. 
1.  General. Subject at all times to the height restrictions set forth in section IV.B, no use shall be made of any land in any of the safety zones defined in section V.A which creates or causes interference with the operations of radio or electronic facilities on the airport or with radio or electronic communications between airport and aircraft, makes it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights, results in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airport, or otherwise endangers the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 
2.  Zone A. Subject at all times to the height restrictions set forth in section IV.B and to the general restrictions contained in section V.B.1 areas designated as zone A shall contain no buildings, temporary structures, exposed transmission lines, or other similar above-ground land use structural hazards, and shall be restricted to those uses which will not create, attract, or bring together an assembly of persons thereon. Permitted uses may include, but are not limited to, such uses as agriculture (seasonal crops), horticulture, animal husbandry, raising of livestock, wildlife habitat, light outdoor recreation (nonspectator), cemeteries, and auto parking. 
3.  Zone B. Subject at all times to the height restrictions set forth in section IV.B, and to the general restrictions contained in section V.B.1, areas designated as zone B shall be restricted in use as follows:

4.  Zone C. Zone C is subject only to height restrictions set forth in section IV.B, and to the general restrictions contained in section V.B.1. 
5.  Exemptions-Established residential neighborhoods. 
a.  Land uses which existed as of July 2, 1979 in the established residential neighborhoods set forth in section V.A.4 above, and as shown on the zoning map are subject to the height restrictions of section IV.B and the general restrictions of section V.B.1. Land uses which come into existence after July 2, 1979 are treated as though they were not in a designated established residential neighborhood and are subject to the zone A or zone B restrictions as the case may be. 
b.  Land uses in established residential neighborhoods which violate any of the following restrictions are prohibited as safety hazards and must be acquired, altered or removed at public expense. Those conditions are as follows: 
(1)  The following land uses, if they exist in safety zones A or B and in an established residential neighborhood in a built-up urban area, are considered by the commissioner to constitute airport safety hazards so severe, either to persons on the ground or to the air-traveling public, or both, that they must be prohibited under local airport zoning ordinances: 
(a)  Any structure which a person or persons customarily use as principal residence and which is located entirely inside safety zone A within 1000 feet of the end of the primary zone; 
(b)  Any structure which a person or persons customarily use as a principal residence and which is located entirely within safety zones A or B and which penetrates an imaginary approach surface as defined by section IV.A; 
(c)  Any land use in safety zone A or B which violates any of the following standards: 
(i)  The land use must not create or cause interference with the operation of radio or electronic facilities on the airport or with radio or electronic communications between the airport and aircraft; 
(ii)  The land use must not make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights; 
(iii)  The land use must not result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport or impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport. 
(d)  Any isolated residential building lot zoned for single-family or two-family residences on which any structure, if built, would be prohibited by subparagraphs b.(1)(a), (b) or (c) above. An "isolated" residential building lot is one located in an area in which the predominant land use is single-family or two-family residential structures; and 
(e)  Any other land use which presents, in the opinion of the commissioner, a material danger to the landing, taking off or maneuvering of aircraft or to the safety of persons on the ground. In making such a determination, the commissioner shall consider the following factors: 
(i)  Possibility that the land use may contribute to or cause a collision of two or more aircraft or an aircraft and some other object; 
(ii)  Possibility that the land use may, in case of an aircraft accident, cause an explosion, fire or the release of harmful or noxious fumes, gases or substances; 
(iii)  Tendency of the land use to increase the number of persons that would be injured in case of an aircraft accident; 
(iv)  Effect of the land use on availability of clear areas for emergency landings; and 
(v)  Flight patterns around the airport, the extent of use of the runway in question, the type of aircraft using the airport, whether the runways are lighted, whether the airport is controlled, and other similar factors. 
C.  Boundary limitations. The land use restrictions set forth in this section shall apply for a distance not to exceed one mile beyond the perimeter of the airport boundary and in that portion of an airport hazard area under the approach zone for a distance not exceeding two miles from the airport boundary. 
Section VI. - Airport zoning map, "Exhibit A." 
    The several zones herein established are shown on the South St. Paul Municipal Airport Zoning Map consisting of three sheets, prepared by Short-Elliott-Hendrickson, Inc., and dated August 1, 1986, attached hereto and made a part hereof, which map, together with such amendments thereto as may from time to time be made, and all notations, references, elevations, data, zone boundaries, and other information thereon, shall be and the same is hereby adopted as part of this ordinance. 
Section VII. - Nonconforming uses. 
    Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this ordinance, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and is diligently prosecuted and completed within two years thereof. 
Section VIII. - Permits. 
A.  Future uses. Except as specifically provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structures shall be erected, altered, or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted by the zoning administrator, hereinafter, provided for. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
1.  However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal distance of 4,200 feet from each end of the runway except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend the height or land use limit prescribed for the respective zone. 
2.  Nothing contained in this foregoing exception shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration, or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limitations established by this ordinance as set forth in section IV and the land use limitations set forth in section V. 
B.  Existing uses. Before any existing use or structure may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, or rebuilt within any zone established herein, a permit must be secured authorizing such replacement, change, or repair. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this ordinance or any amendments thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
C.  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down, deteriorated, or decayed no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. Whether application is made for a permit under this paragraph or not, the zoning administrator may order the owner of the abandoned or partially destroyed nonconforming structure, at the owner's own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip the same in the manner necessary to conform to the provisions of this ordinance. In the event the owner of the nonconforming structure shall neglect or refuse to comply with such order for ten days after receipt of written notice of such order, the zoning administrator may, by appropriate legal action, proceed to have the abandoned or partially destroyed nonconforming structure lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped and assess the cost and expense thereof against the land on which the structure is or was located. Unless such an assessment is paid within ninety days from the service of notice thereof on the owner of the land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent per annum from the date the cost and expense is incurred until paid, and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes. 
Section IX. - Variances. 
    Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this ordinance may apply to the board of adjustment, hereinafter provided for, for a variance from such regulations. If a person submits an application for a variance by certified mail to the members of the board and the board fails to grant or deny the variance within four months after the last member receives the application, the variance shall be deemed to be granted by the board. When the variance is granted by reason of the failure of the board to act on the variance, the person receiving the variance shall notify the board and the commissioner of transportation by certified mail that the variance has been granted. The applicant shall include a copy of the original application for variance with this notice to the commissioner. The variance shall be effective 60 days after this notice is received by the commissioner subject to any action taken by the commissioner pursuant to Minn. Stat.  360.063, subd. 6a. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this ordinance provided any variance so allowed may be subject to any reasonable conditions that the board of adjustment or commissioner may deem necessary to effectuate the purpose of this ordinance. 
Section X. - Hazard marking and lighting. 
A.  Nonconforming uses. The owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the zoning administrator to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the City of South St. Paul. 
B.  Permits and variances. Any permit or variance granted by the zoning administrator or board of adjustment as the case may be, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this ordinance and be reasonable in the circumstances, so condition such permit or variance as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question at the owner's own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of an airport hazard. 
Section XI. - Zoning administrator. 
    It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the airport zoning administrator upon a form furnished by him. Permit applications shall be promptly considered and granted or denied by him in accordance with the regulations prescribed herein. Variance applications shall be forthwith transmitted by the airport zoning administrator for action by the board of adjustment hereinafter provided for. For the purpose of this ordinance, the zoning administrator shall be as follows: 
1.  For lands located in Inver Grove Heights, the Inver Grove Heights Building Inspector. 
2.  For lands located in Newport, the Newport City Administrator. 
3.  For lands located in St. Paul Park, the St. Paul Park Building Inspector.

Upon their appointment, the members shall select a chair to act at the pleasure of the board. Members shall be removable by the joint airport zoning board for cause, upon written charges, after a public hearing.

2.  The board of adjustment shall make written findings of fact and conclusions of law giving the facts upon which it acted and its legal conclusions from such facts in reversing, affirming, or modifying any order, requirement, decision or determination which comes before it under the provisions of this ordinance. 
3.  The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the board of adjustment shall be sufficient to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the zoning administrator or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance or to effect any variation in this ordinance. 
Section XIII. - Appeals. 
A.  Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected by any decision of the zoning administrator made in administration of this ordinance may appeal to the board of adjustment. Such appeals may also be made by any governing body of a municipality, county, or airport zoning board, which is of the opinion that a decision of the zoning administrator is an improper application of this ordinance as it concerns such governing body or board. 
B.  All appeals hereunder must be commenced within 30 days of the zoning administrator's decision, by filing with the zoning administrator a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the board of adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. In addition, any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected by any decisions of the zoning administrator made in administration of this ordinance who desires to appeal such decision shall submit an application for a variance by certified mail to the members of the board of adjustment in the manner set forth in Minn. Stat.  360.068, subd. 2. 
C.  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board of adjustment, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the board of adjustment on notice to the zoning administrator and on due cause shown. 
D.  The board of adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for hearing appeals, give public notice and due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. 
E.  The board of adjustment may, in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination, as may be appropriate under the circumstances, and to that end, shall have all the powers of the zoning administrator. 
Section XIV. - Judicial review. 
    Any person aggrieved, or any taxpayer affected by any decision of the board of adjustment, or any governing body of a municipality, county, or airport zoning board, which is of the opinion that a decision of the board of adjustment is illegal may present to the District Court of Dakota County a verified petition setting forth that the decision or action is illegal, in whole or in part, and specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the decision is filed in the office of the board of adjustment. The petitioner must exhaust the remedies provided in this ordinance before availing himself to the right to petition a court as provided by this section. 
Section XV. - Penalties. 
    Every person who shall construct, establish, substantially change, alter or repair any existing structure or use, or permit the growth of any tree without having complied with the provision of this ordinance or who, having been granted a permit or variance under the provisions of this ordinance, shall construct, establish, substantially change or substantially alter or repair any existing growth or structure or permit the growth of any tree, except as permitted by such permit or variance, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not more than $700.00 or imprisonment for not more than 90 days or by both. Each day a violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense. The airport zoning administrator may enforce all provisions of this ordinance through such proceedings for injunctive relief and other relief as may be proper under the laws of Minn. Stat.  360.073 and other applicable law. 
Section XVI. - Conflicts. 
    Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations prescribed in this ordinance and any other regulations applicable to the same area, whether the conflict be with respect to the height of structures or trees, the use of land, or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or regulation shall govern and prevail. 
Section XVII. - Severability. 
A.  In any case in which the provision of this ordinance, although generally reasonable, are held by a court to interfere with the use or enjoyment of a particular structure or parcel of land to such an extent, or to be so onerous in their application to such a structure or parcel of land, as to constitute a taking or deprivation of that property in violation of the constitution of this state or the constitution of the United States, such holding shall not affect the application of this ordinance as to other structures and parcels of land, and to this end the provisions of this ordinance are declared to be severable. 
B.  Should any section or provision of this ordinance be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any part thereof other than the parts so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
Section XVIII. - Effective date. 
    This ordinance shall take effect on the 20th day of March, 1990. Copies thereof shall be filed with the commissioner of transportation, division of aeronautics, State of Minnesota, and the register of deeds, Dakota and Washington County(s), Minnesota.
