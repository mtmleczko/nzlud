supplemented to incorporate the most recent legislation of the City as provided in Section 101.04
of this Chapter. Any reference to the number of any section contained herein shall be understood
to refer to the position of the same number, its appropriate chapter and title heading, and to the

this City Code by title in any legal documents. (1993 Code)

ordinance of any part of this City Code. All such amendments or revisions by ordinance shall be
immediately forwarded to the codifiers, and the said ordinance material shall be prepared for
insertion in its proper place in each copy of this City Code. Each such replacement page shall be
properly identified and shall be inserted in each individual copy of the City Code. (1993 Code)
101.05: CODE ALTERATIONS: It shall be deemed unlawful for any person to alter,
change, replace or deface in any way any section or any page of this City Code in such a manner
that the meaning of any phrase or order may be changed or omitted. Replacement pages may be
inserted according to the official instructions when so authorized by the Municipal Council. The
City Administrator shall see that the replacement pages are properly inserted in the official
copies maintained in the office of the City Administrator. Any person having in their custody a
copy of the City Code shall make every effort to maintain said Code current as to the most recent
ordinances passed. Each person shall see to the immediate insertion of new or replacement
pages when such are delivered to them or made available to them through the office of the City
Administrator. Said Code books, while in actual possession of officials and other interested
persons, shall be and remain the property of the City and shall be returned to the office of the
Municipal City Administrator when directed so to do by order of the Municipal Council.

REFERENCE1: Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes 471.62, various codes, statutes and new
ordinances are adopted by reference in this Code. In all cases where codes, statutes and
ordinances have been adopted by reference, three (3) copies thereof shall be marked as official

Subd. 1. Offenses Against Former Ordinances: No new ordinance shall be construed or held
to repeal a former ordinance whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not,
as to any offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done, any
penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising under
the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any such offense or act so
committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred or any right
accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance takes effect, save only that the
proceedings thereafter shall conform to the ordinance in force at the time of such
proceeding, so far as practicable, if any penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be
mitigated by any provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by consent of the
party affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes effect.

express words or implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new
provisions upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
Subd. 3. Effect of Provisions: Nothing contained in this Chapter shall be construed as
abating any action now pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the City
herein repealed, and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this Code shall
be deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the same provisions;
nor shall this Chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any
penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or
corporation, or as waiving any right of the City under any ordinance or provision thereof
in force at the time of the adoption of this Municipal Code. (1993 Code)
102.04: SEVERABILITY CLAUSE: If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph,
sentence, clause or phrase of this Municipal Code or any part thereof is for any reason held to be
unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision
shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions of this Code, or any part
thereof. The Municipal Council hereby declares that it would have passed each section,
subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that
any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be
declared unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective. (1993 Code)

the following rules shall apply:
Subd. 1. Conflict Between Code Provisions: If the provisions of different sections or
chapters of the Code conflict with or contravene each other, the provisions of each
section and each chapter shall prevail as to all matters growing out of the subject matter
of such chapter.
Subd. 2. Conflict within Chapter: If conflicting provisions are found in different sections of
the same chapter, the provisions of the section which is last in numerical order shall
prevail unless such construction is inconsistent with the meaning of the chapter.
Subd. 3. Provision Adopted by Reference in Conflict with Code: If one of the conflicting
provisions has been adopted by reference and the other provision fully set forth in this
Code, the provision or section fully set forth in this Code shall control.
Subd. 4. Provisions Adopted by Reference in Conflict with Each Other: If a provision of
some code or material adopted by reference in this Code conflicts with a provision of
some other code or material adopted by reference, the following rules shall govern:
a. If either of the sources adopted by reference is statutory, the statutory provision
shall control.

from the code or material most closely related to the chapter of this Code which is sought
to be applied shall control.

and at least once in a newspaper or trade paper published in a city of the first class no less
than three (3) weeks before the last day for submission of bids.

general circulation.
d. Advertisement: The advertisement shall specify the work to be done, shall state the
time when the bids will be publicly opened for consideration by the Council, which shall
be not less than ten (10) days after the first publication of the advertisement when the
estimated cost is less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) and not less than
three (3) weeks after such publication in other cases, and shall state that no bids will be
considered unless sealed and filed with the City Administrator and accompanied by a
cash deposit, cashier’s check, bid bond or certified check payable to the City

In providing for the advertisement for bids, the Council may direct that bids shall be
opened publicly by two (2) or more designated officers or agents of the Municipality and
tabulated in advance of the meeting at which they are to be considered by the Council.
Nothing herein shall prevent the Council from advertising separately for various portions
of the work involved in an improvement, or from itself, supplying by such means as may
be otherwise authorized by law, all or any part of the materials, supplies or equipment to
be used in the improvement or from combining two (2) or more improvements in a single
set of plans and specifications or a single contract. (Amended, Ord. 844, 5-20-10)
City of Mounds View
202.08 202.08
Subd. 2. Contracts; Day Labor:
a. In contracting for an improvement, the Council shall require the execution of
one (1) or more written contracts and bonds, conditioned as required by law. The Council
shall award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder, or it may reject all bids. If any
bidder to whom a contract is awarded fails to enter promptly into a written contract and to
furnish the required bond, the defaulting bidder shall forfeit to the Municipality the
amount of the defaulter’s cash deposit, cashier’s check, bid bond or certified check, and
the Council may, thereupon, award the contract to the next lowest responsible bidder.
b. When it appears to the Council that the cost of the entire work projected will be less
than twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or whenever no bid is submitted after
proper advertisement or the only bids submitted are higher than the Director of Public
Works/City Engineer’s estimate, the Council may advertise for new bids or, without
advertising for bids, directly purchase the materials for the work and do it by the
employment of day labor or in any other manner the Council considers proper. The
Council may have the work supervised by the Director of Public Works/City Engineer or
other qualified person but shall have the work supervised by a registered engineer if done
by day labor and it appears to the Council that the entire cost of all work and materials for
the improvement will be more than two thousand dollars ($2,000.00).
c. In case of improper construction or unreasonable delay in the prosecution of the
work by the contractor, the Council may order and cause the suspension of the work at
any time and relet the contract or order a reconstruction of any portion of the work
improperly done, and where the cost of completion or reconstruction necessary will be
less than twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), the Council may do it by the
employment of day labor.
City of Mounds View
202.08 202.08 (Rev. 5/10)
Subd. 3. Day Labor; Detailed Report:
a. When the Council has performed construction work by day labor, it shall cause a
detailed report to be filed with the City Administrator and certified by the registered

show: (Amended, Ord. 844, 5-20-10)
(1) The complete cost of the construction.

Subd. 4. Alternate Procedure on Street Improvements: As to any improvements consisting
of grading, graveling or bituminous surfacing of streets and alleys, the Council may
proceed in the manner provided in this Chapter; except, that it may:
a. Order the work done by day labor, regardless of the estimated cost of such
improvements.
b. Use Municipal equipment or hire equipment and purchase materials for all such
improvements to be done by day labor in any twelve (12) month period by advertising
once therefor, such advertisement to call for bids for the furnishing of equipment, if the
City does not use its own equipment, and for materials at unit prices based on the
quantities which the Council estimates will be required.
c. Contract at one time on a unit-price basis for part or all of the street improvements
to be constructed by the Municipality during the current year, including improvements
which may thereafter be ordered constructed.
Subd. 5. Cooperation with State or Local Government: When an improvement is made
under a cooperative agreement with the State or another political subdivision by the terms
of which the State or other subdivision is to construct the improvement, it shall not be
necessary to comply with subdivisions 1 and 2 hereof.
City of Mounds View
202.08 202.08
Subd. 6. Percentage Payment on Engineer’s Estimate: In case the contractor properly
performs the work, the Council shall, from month to month before completion of the
work, pay contractor not to exceed ninety five percent (95%) of the amount already
earned under the contract, upon the estimate of the engineer or other competent person
selected by the Council, and the contract shall so provide, and shall further agree that
when the work is ninety five percent (95%) or more completed, upon the
recommendation of the engineer, such portions of the retained price shall be released as
the Council determines are not required to be retained to protect the City’s interest in
satisfactory completion of the contract.
Subd. 7. Modification of Contracts: After work has been commenced on an improvement
undertaken pursuant to a contract awarded on a unit price basis, the Council may, without
advertising for bids, authorize changes in the contract so as to include additional units of
work at the same unit price if the cost of the additional work does not exceed twenty five
percent (25%) of the original contract price. Original contract price means that figure
determined by multiplying the estimated number of units required by the unit price. (1988
Code §26.08)
Subd. 8. Time Limit on Improvements: When the Council determines to make any local
improvement, it shall let the contract for all or part of the work or order all or part of the
work done by day labor or otherwise as may be authorized by law, no later than one (1)
year after the public hearing on the improvement. (1988 Code §26.17)
City of Mounds View
202.09 202.09 (Rev. 2/00)
202.09: APPORTIONMENT OF COST:
Subd. 1. The cost of any improvement, or any part thereof, may be assessed upon property
benefited by the improvement, based upon the benefits received, whether or not the
property abuts on the improvement, and whether or not any part of the cost of the
improvement is paid from the County-State Aid Highway Fund, the Municipal State Aid
Street Fund or the Trunk Highway Fund. The area assessed may be less than but may not
exceed the area proposed to be assessed as stated in the notice of hearing on the
improvement, except as provided below. The Municipality may pay such portion of the
cost of the improvement as the Council may determine from general ad valorem tax
levies or from other revenues or funds of the Municipality available for the purpose,
subject to the provisions of subdivision 8.04(2) of the Charter. The City may
subsequently reimburse itself for all or any of the portion of the cost of a water, storm
sewer or sanitary sewer improvement so paid by levying additional assessments upon any
properties abutting on but not previously assessed for the improvement, on notice and
hearing as provided for the assessments initially made.
To the extent that such an improvement benefits nonabutting properties which may be
served by the improvement when one (1) or more later extensions or improvements are
made but which are not initially assessed therefor, the City may also reimburse itself by
adding all or any of the portion of the cost so paid to the assessments levied for any of
such later extensions or improvements; provided, that notice that such additional amount
will be assessed is included in the notice of hearing on the making of such extensions or
improvements. The provisions of Section 202.07 shall apply to such extensions or
improvements in the same manner as if they were new improvements.
(1988 Code §26.09)

202.09 202.09 (Rev. 2/00)
Subd. 2. The following are methods of street reconstruction and rehabilitation, which will be
utilized by the City of Mounds View in considering future projects and assessments. It
will be noted that the design standard for either reconstruction or rehab will be the current
design of the street section. Projects may be constructed to higher designs if warranted
and/or approved by the City Council. (Ord. 654, 2-14-00)
Improvement Type and Apportionment of Cost:
a. Street Reconstruction Including Curb and Gutter: The cost of street reconstruction
shall be recovered by the adjusted front footage method. The front footage rate shall be
determined by dividing the project cost by the total number of adjusted front feet in the
project area. The assessments per adjusted front foot may vary depending on the
underlying zoning of a parcel. Assessments for residential properties which are on
collector or arterial streets (MSA, county road) shall be assessed for one hundred percent
(100%) of the pavement surface and base, up to a width of twenty six (26) feet, equally
divided by both sides of the street. This amount shall not exceed fourteen dollars and
sixty cents ($14.60) per front foot. (Ord. 654, 2-14-00)
(1) Non-Collector Street Residential property owners will be assessed for the cost
of the pavement and base for the front footage side of the property, which shall not
exceed fourteen dollars and sixty cents ($14.60) per frontage foot. This amount will
be adjusted annually by resolution, in accordance with the Engineering News
Record (ENR). (Ord. 654, 2-14-00)
(2) Residents requesting Curb and Gutter, any required storm sewer and/or
installation of sidewalks/trails on a construction project will be assessed twenty five
percent (25%) of the total cost of the project additions which will include
engineering, additional removals, base and all other associated expenses. All
additional project requests shall be assessed at twenty five percent (25%) of the
total costs associated with the improvements. (Ord. 654, 2-14-00)
(3) One hundred percent (100%) of the turn back funds received from Ramsey
County will be applied to the new construction or pavement cost of the road that
was received. (Ord. 654, 2-14-00)
The remaining cost shall be recovered by means of the general ad valorem property tax
paid by the entire community or by other funds that may become available to the City for
infrastructure cost recovery. (Ord. 654, 2-14-00)

202.09 202.09 (Rev. 2/00)
b. Street Resurfacing: Street resurfacing is commonly known and referred to as street
overlaying whereby a new bed of road material such as bituminous is installed over an
existing paved road to a specific thickness. Assessments shall be determined by the
adjusted front footage method at one hundred percent (100%) to properties on both sides
of the street. A mill and overlay to an existing paved road will be assessed by the
adjusted front footage method at one hundred percent (100%) percent to properties on
both sides of the street. A recycle and overlay to an existing paved road will be assessed
by the adjusted front footage method at one hundred percent (100%) to properties on both
sides of the street. Assessments will be based on physical project costs plus engineering,
administration costs, ROW expenditures and other related project costs. The method of
rehabilitation or resurfacing shall be determined by the Pavement Condition Index (PCI)
of the combined segments of the streets considered for the project. (Ord. 654, 2-14-00)
c. Sidewalk: Sidewalk improvements may be done in conjunction with a street
reconstruction or as a separate project. In any event, sidewalks requested that are not
included in the City’s sidewalk and trail plan shall be recovered by assessing twenty five
percent (25%) to the affected property owners and the remainder paid by the general ad
valorem property tax paid by the entire community or by other funds that may become
available to the City for infrastructure cost recovery. Sidewalks are generally installed on
the City’s major streets or in accordance with the City’s sidewalk and trail plan, which
will connect several neighborhoods and community attractions in a logical pattern; these
improvements will not be assessed to the abutting properties. (Ord. 654, 2-14-00)
d. Sealcoating: Sealcoating, patching and cracksealing are considered general
maintenance activities and the expenses of such acts will be paid for by ad valorem
property tax or any other funds available to the City at that time.
e. Sanitary Sewer and Water Mains: Repair and replacement of sewer or water mains
is usually done in conjunction with a street reconstruction project and the cost of this
work should be included as part of the total major street project cost and should also be
considered to be included in the rate assessed for street reconstruction. If it is determined
that the repair and replacement work results in a greater benefit to some properties and
not to others, the Council should consider establishing a different assessment rate based
on the benefits received.
f. Sanitary Sewer and Water Trunk Improvements: Trunk sewer and water mains are
usually designed to carry larger volumes of flow than are necessary within an immediate
property area in order to serve additional properties beyond the area of their immediate
placement. Therefore, one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of trunk improvements
will be assessed on a unit basis to all properties within a district deemed to be benefited
from the trunk improvements.
City of Mounds View
202.09 202.09 (Rev. 2/00)
g. Sewer and Water Services: Individual sewer and water services benefit only the
properties they serve and one hundred percent (100%) of their cost shall be assessed to
the property for which they are installed.
h. Drainage Improvements: Storm drainage and ponding/basin systems are usually
constructed to serve a specific drainage or “watershed” district. These drainage districts
have trunk lines, which are large diameter pipes that transport large volumes of water
from one (1) or more drainage districts. Property within drainage districts that would
receive benefit from a trunk storm sewer, would be assessed a unit amount of four
hundred dollars ($400.00) per lot for a single family residential lot. This amount would
be determined and adjusted annually by resolution using the Engineering News Record
(ENR). Multifamily housing lots that exceed one-third (1/3) acre would be assessed
based on the number of acres, multiplied by the unit cost of one thousand two hundred
dollars ($1,200.00) per acre. Commercial/Industrial property would be assessed based on
the number of acres that are determined to benefit from the trunk line multiplied by the
unit cost of one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200.00) per acre to a maximum amount
of three (3) acres or three thousand six hundred dollars ($3,600.00). The remaining cost
will be paid for by the Storm Water Surface Utility and/or by an ad valorem property tax
paid by the entire community or by other funds that may become available to the City for
infrastructure cost recovery. Should a project be initiated on a particular street that
requires storm sewer laterals which would be connected to the trunk lines, the Surface
Water Utility would fund these expenses. (Ord. 600, 5-12-97)
i. Special Conditions: Special consideration shall be given to the “age” of a street or
utility system when determining the proportion of cost to be assessed to benefited
properties. If it is necessary to reconstruct or resurface a street or perform major
repair/replacement work on sewer and water utilities, before a reasonable amount of time
(ten (10) to twelve (12) years for resurfacing, twelve (12) to seventeen (17) years for
partial reconstruction and seventeen (17) to twenty five (25) years for total
reconstruction) the assessment shall be calculated on a pro-rated basis. The remaining
cost shall be recovered by means of the general ad valorem property tax paid by the entire
community or by other funds that may become available to the City for infrastructure cost
recovery. (Ord. 567, 11-13-95)
j. In projects involving new street construction, and mill and overlays, mailboxes will
be grouped on gang posts in numbers logical to the spacing required. This practice will
insure the proper placement of the mailboxes, reduce potential roadside hazards, and
generally clean up the edge of the street. The cost of the new posts and installation will
be added to the project. Residents of overlays and mill and overlays may request the new
posts and installation, which will be added to the cost of the project. (Ord. 654, 2-14-00)
City of Mounds View
202.09 202.09
Subd. 3. Methods of Assessment:
a. The nature of an improvement determines the method of assessment. The objective
is to choose an assessment method which will arrive at a reasonable, fair and equitable
assessment which will be uniform upon the same class of property within the assessed
area. The most frequently recognized assessment methods are: the unit assessment, the
front footage assessment and the area assessment. Depending upon the individual
project, any one (1) or a combination of these methods may be utilized to arrive at an
appropriate cost distribution. City staff will consider all methods and weigh their
applicability to the project and present a recommendation to the City Council in the form
of a mock assessment roll (or rolls). A description of each assessment and its
corresponding policy application is presented. A separate section (Section III) will
identify the appropriate matchup of method with a specific type of project and analyze
why each is generally used.
The purpose of assessment formulas is to allocate assessed costs among benefited
properties, the formula should result in an allocation of assessments which is reasonably
related to the benefit received. Any one (1) predetermined formula will not be
appropriate in all cases because of circumstances unique to the relationship between the
specific project and the specific properties benefited. When considering an assessment
method or formula for any given project, it may be necessary to combine assessment
methods or to modify the methods described below. Therefore, the following description
of methods of assessments should be regarded as guidelines, which may not be
appropriate in all cases.
City of Mounds View
202.09 202.09 (Rev. 2/00)
b. Unit Assessment: A unit assessment shall be derived by dividing the total project
cost by the number of Residential Equivalent Density (RED) units in the project area.
A RED unit is defined as a single family residential unit. All platted and unplatted
property will be assigned RED unit values equivalent to the underlying zoning. When
the existing land use is less than the highest and best permitted use, the Council may
consider the current use as well as the full potential of land use in determining the
appropriate number of RED units. Otherwise, the following RED chart will apply on a
per unit basis, subject to adjustment by the Council for any inequities:
Single Family 1.00 RED
Duplex 1.00 RED
Condominium 0.80 RED
Multifamily (3 units or more) 0.80 RED
Townhouse 0.80 RED
Commercial 2.00 Units
Industrial 2.00 Units
The unit approach has proven to be the best method in those instances whereby the
improvement largely benefits everyone to the same degree and the cost of the
improvement is not generally affected by parcel size.
c. Area Assessment: The assessable area shall be expressed in terms of the number of
acres or the number of square feet subject to assessment. When determining the
assessable area, the following considerations will be given:
(1) Ponding Assessment Consideration: Lakes, ponds and swamps may be
considered a part of the assessable area of a parcel.
(2) Road Right-of-Way Assessment Consideration: Up to twenty percent (20%) of
the gross acreage may be deducted for street right-of-way purposes within unplatted
parcels of five acres or more depending upon the parcel configuration and is only
applicable to single family residential use. Parcels of less than five (5) acres may
not qualify and may be assessed full acreage. The reason for this size restriction is
that, in most instances, parcels of less than five (5) acres cannot support an internal
public road system.
(3) Park Dedication Assessment Consideration: When park land is dedicated as
part of a residential development, as required by Subdivisions Code – Chapter
1204.02, the developer shall not be assessed an acreage charge on the portion of
land dedicated.
City of Mounds View
202.09 202.09
d. Front Footage Assessment: The actual physical dimensions of a parcel abutting
an improvement (i.e., street, sewer, water, etc.) will generally not be construed as the
frontage utilized to calculate the assessment for a particular parcel. Rather, an “adjusted
front footage” will be determined. The purpose of this method is to equalize assessment
calculations for lots of similar size. Individual parcels by their very nature differ
considerably in shape and area. The following procedures will apply when calculating
adjusted front footage. The selection of the appropriate procedures will be determined by
the specific configuration of the parcel. All measurements will be scaled from available
plat and section maps and will be rounded down to the nearest one-half (1/2) foot
dimension with any excess fraction deleted.
e. Categorical type descriptions are as follows:
Standard Lots
Rectangular Variation Lots
Triangular Lots
Cul-de-sac Lots
Curved Lots
Irregularly Shaped Lots
Corner Lots
Flag Lots
Double Frontage Lots
The ultimate objective of these procedures is to arrive at a fair and equitable distribution
of cost whereby consideration is given to lot size and parcels are comparably assessed.
(1) Standard Lots. In this instance, the adjusted front footage for rectangular lots
would be the actual front footage of the lot. The frontage measured shall be the lot
width at the front lot line.
City of Mounds View
202.09 202.09
(2) Rectangular Variation Lots. For a lot which is approximately rectangular and
uniform in shape, the adjusted front footage is computed by averaging the front and
back sides of the lot. This method is used only where the divergence between front
and rear lot lines is twenty (20’) feet or less.
(3) Triangular Lots. For a triangular shaped lot, the adjusted front footage is
computed by averaging the front and back lot lines. The measurement at the back
lot line shall not exceed a maximum distance in depth of one hundred fifty (150’)
feet.
City of Mounds View
202.09 202.09
(4) Cul-de-Sac Lots. The adjusted front footage for those lots that exist on cul-desacs
will be calculated at the midsection of the lot at the most reasonably defined
and determinable position. This line will be computed by connecting the midpoints
of the two (2) side lot lines. Or, if the lots are similar in nature and configuration, a
common lot width, such as the standard setback of thirty (30’) feet may be assigned
based upon an evaluation of typical lots within the subdivision.
(5) Curved Lots. In certain situations such as those where lots are located along
meandering trail system streets, read patterns create curvilineal frontages. In such
instances, the adjusted front footage will be the width of the lot measured at the
midpoint of the shortest side lot line.
City of Mounds View
202.09 202.09
(6) Irregularly Shaped Lots. In many cases, unplatted parcels that are legally
described by a metes and bounds description are irregular and odd shaped. The
adjusted front footage will be calculated by measuring the lot width at the thirty
(30’) foot building setback line.
(7) Corner Lots
a. On a corner lot, one hundred percent (100%) of the adjusted front
footage of the short side will be assessed and twenty-five percent (25%) of
the adjusted front footage of the long side will be assessed for
improvements benefiting the respective sides. The length of the property
sides and not the orientation of the principal building shall determine
adjusted front footage in this case. A series of lots (two (2) or more) under
common ownership shall be considered as one (1) parcel or lot for
determining which is the short or long side of a property. However, this
shall only apply to series of lots on which only one (1) principal building
is situated.
City of Mounds View
202.09 202.09 (Rev. 5/97)
b. General Commercial Zoned Corner Lots. The adjusted front footage
shall be the entire frontage of the side of the lot immediately abutting the
improvement. (Ord. 600, 5-12-97)
(8) Flag Lots. Properties which utilize a narrow private easement or maintain
ownership of access to their property exceeding a minimum length of one hundred
twenty five (125’) feet, thereby having a small frontage on a street, will be assigned
an adjusted front footage of seventy five (75’) feet. This dimension is consistent
with the subdivision ordinance which prescribes such length as the minimum lot
frontage along a public roadway. The adjusted front footage for flag lots whose
driveway access is under one hundred twenty five (125’) feet will be measured at
the building setback line from the access terminus.
City of Mounds View
202.09 202.10 (Rev. 11/95)
(9) Double Frontage Lots. If a parcel, other than a corner lot, comprises frontage
on two streets and is eligible for subdivision, then an adjusted front footage
assessment will be charged along each street. For double frontage lots lacking the
necessary depth for subdivision, only a single adjusted front footage will be
computed. The frontage with driveway access to front of house, shall be assessed.
(Ord. 567, 11-13-95)

under the direction of the Council. The Council shall then determine by resolution the
amount of the total expense the City will pay, other than the amount, if any, which it will
pay as a property owner, and the amount to be assessed. Thereupon, the City
Administrator, with the assistance of the engineer or other qualified person selected by
the Council, shall calculate the proper amount to be specially assessed for the
improvement against every assessable lot, piece or parcel of land, without regard to cash
valuation, in accordance with the provisions of Section 202.09 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 844, 5-20-10)

within ten (10) days after service upon the Mayor or City Administrator. The notice
shall also inform property owners of the provisions of Section 202.13 of this
Chapter and the existence of any deferment procedure established pursuant thereto
in the City. (Amended, Ord. 844, 5-20-10)
(5) For the purpose of giving mailed notice, owners shall be those shown to be such
on the records of the County Auditor or the records of the County Treasurer, but
other appropriate records may be used for this purpose. Such publication and
mailing shall be no less than two (2) weeks prior to such meeting of the Council.
Except as to the owners of tax-exempt property or property taxes on a gross
earnings basis, every property owner whose name does not appear on the records of
the County Auditor or County Treasurer shall be deemed to have waived such
mailed notice unless the property owner has requested, in writing, that the County
Auditor or County Treasurer, as the case may be, include the property owner’s
name on the records for such purpose.
Subd. 2. Adoption of Assessment; Lien; Interest:
a. At such meeting or at any adjournment thereof, the Council shall hear and pass
upon all objections to the proposed assessment, whether presented orally or in writing.
The Council may amend the proposed assessment as to any parcel and by resolution
adopt the same as the special assessment against the lands named in the assessment roll.
Notice of any adjournment of the hearing shall be adequate if the minutes of the meeting
so adjourned show the time and place, when and where the hearing is to be continued.
b. The assessment, with accruing interest, shall be a lien upon all private and public
property included therein, from the date of the resolution adopting the assessment,
concurrent with the general taxes, but the lien shall not be enforceable against public
property as long as it is publicly owned, and during such period, the assessment shall be
recoverable from the owner of such property only in the manner and to the extent
provided in Section 202.15 of this Chapter. (1988 Code §26.10)
City of Mounds View
202.11 202.11 (Rev. 5/10)

City of Mounds View
202.12 202.12
202.12: PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS:
Subd. 1. Installments:
a. Except as provided below, all assessments shall be payable in equal annual
installments extending over such period, not exceeding thirty (30) years, as the resolution
determines, payable on the first Monday in January in each year, but the number of
installments need not be uniform for all assessments included in a single assessment roll
if a uniform criterion for determining the number of installments is provided by the
resolution. The first installment of each assessment shall be included in the first tax rolls
completed after its adoption and shall be payable in the same year as the taxes contained
therein; except, that the payment of the first installment of any assessment levied upon
unimproved property may be deferred until a designated future year or until the platting
of the property or the construction of improvements thereon, upon such terms and
conditions and based upon such standards and criteria as may be provided by resolution
of the Council.
b. In any event, every assessment, the payment of which is so deferred, when it
becomes payable, shall be divided into a number of installments such that the last
installment thereof will be payable not more than thirty (30) years after the levy of the
assessment1.
Subd. 2. Interest: All assessments shall bear interest at such rate as the resolution
determines, not exceeding the maximum permitted by law; except, that the rate may, in
any event, equal the average annual interest rate on bonds issued to finance the
improvement for which the assessments are levied.
1 See Section 202.13 for deferral of assessments.
City of Mounds View
202.12 202.12
Subd. 3. Application of Interest to Installments:
a. To the first installment of each assessment shall be added interest on the entire
assessment from a date specified in the resolution levying the assessment, not earlier than
the date of the resolution, until December 31 of the year in which the first installment is
payable, and to each subsequent installment shall be added interest for one year on all
unpaid installments, or alternatively, any assessment may be made payable in equal
annual installments, including principal and interest, each in the amount annually
required to pay the principal over such period with interest at such rate as the resolution
determines, not exceeding the maximum period and rate specified above. In the latter
event, no prepayment shall be accepted under subdivision 7 of this Section without
payment of all installments due to and including December 31 of the year of prepayment,
together with the original principal included in such installments, computed on an annual
amortization basis.
b. When payment of an assessment is deferred, as authorized in this subdivision,
interest thereon for the period of deferment may be made payable annually at the same
times as the principal installments payable on account of assessable real property; except,
that interest accruing shall not begin to run until the notice provided in subdivision
202.10(1)c of this Chapter has been properly given and thirty (30) days thereafter have
elapsed.
c. The Council shall provide for the payment of these amounts and shall take
appropriate action to that end.
Subd. 4. Notice of Installment: If the assessment is not paid in a single installment, the City
Finance Director/Treasurer shall annually mail to the owner of any right of way and, as
long as the property is publicly owned, to the owner of any public property, a notice
stating that an installment is due and should be paid to the City Finance
Director/Treasurer.
Subd. 5. Collection from Railroads and Public Utilities: The City may collect the amount
due on account of the right of way of any railroad or privately owned public utility by
distress and sale of personal property in the manner provided by law in case of taxes
levied upon personal property or by suit brought to enforce the collection of this
indebtedness unless a different method of collecting such amounts is provided for by a
contract between the owner of any right of way and the City. (1988 Code §26.10)
City of Mounds View
202.12 202.12
Subd. 6. Partial Prepayment of Assessments: Any person desiring to partially prepay any
assessment for a public improvement, the assessment roll of which has been certified to
the Ramsey County Auditor for collection with general taxes, the County Treasurer and
the County Auditor are hereby authorized to establish whatever procedure is necessary to
make possible the payment of said balance to said County officials in lieu of paying same
to the Municipal Finance Director/Treasurer as provided for by subdivision 7 of this
Section. The County officials are hereby designated as agents of Mounds View to collect
such assessments, and the mechanics therefor shall be set up by the County Auditor,
County Treasurer and the Municipal Clerk-Administrator so that the intent and purpose
of this Chapter can be accomplished. (1988 Code §20.04)
Subd. 7. Payment of Remaining Unpaid Installments: Any person desiring to pay the
remaining unpaid installments of an assessment for a public improvement, the assessment
roll of which has been certified to the Ramsey County Auditor for collection with general
taxes, the County Treasurer and the County Auditor are hereby authorized to establish
whatever procedure is necessary to make possible the payment of said balance to the said
County officials in lieu of paying same to the Municipal Finance Director/Treasurer as
provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 429.061, subdivision 3, as amended. The said
County officials are hereby designated as agents of Mounds View to collect such
assessments, and the mechanics therefor shall be set up by the County Auditor, County
Treasurer and the Municipal Clerk-Administrator so that the intent and purpose of this
Chapter can be accomplished. (1988 Code §20.05)
City of Mounds View
202.13 202.14
202.13: DEFERRED PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS:
Subd. 1. Senior Citizens Hardship Special Assessment Deferral: After making a special
assessment, the Council may, at its discretion, defer the payment of that assessment for
any homestead property owned by a person sixty five (65) years of age or older for whom
it would be a hardship to make the payments. The Council shall adopt a resolution
establishing standards and guidelines for determining the existence of a hardship relative
to any special assessment adopted under this Chapter. Such standards and guidelines shall
be made in a nondiscriminatory manner and shall not give the applicant an unreasonable
preference or advantage over other applicants. (1988 Code §26.18)
Subd. 2. Procedure to Obtain Deferred Assessment: The eligible homeowner shall make
application for deferred payment of special assessments on forms prescribed by the
Ramsey County Auditor. Where the deferred assessment is granted, the Auditor shall
record a notice thereof with the County Recorder which shall set forth the amount of the
assessment. The Council may determine by resolution the amount of interest, if any, on
the deferred assessment, and this rate shall be recorded by the Auditor along with and in
the same manner as the amount of the assessment. (1988 Code §26.19)
Subd. 3. Termination of Right to Deferred Payment: The option to defer the payment of
special assessments shall terminate, and all amounts accumulated, plus applicable
interest, shall become due upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
a. The death of the owner; provided, that the spouse is otherwise not eligible for the
benefits hereunder;
b. The sale, transfer or subdivision of the property or any part thereof;
c. If the property should, for any reason, lose its homestead status; or
d. If, for any reason, the Council shall determine that there would be no hardship to
require immediate or partial payment. (1988 Code §26.20)
202.14: SERVICE CHARGES; SPECIAL ASSESSMENT AGAINST BENEFITTED
PROPERTY:
Subd. 1. Property Owner or Occupant: The Council may place the primary responsibility
upon the property owner or occupant to do the work authorized herein themselves, except
in the case of street sprinkling or other dust treatment, alley repair, tree trimming, care
and removal or the operation of a street lighting system, upon notice before the work is
undertaken.
City of Mounds View
202.14 202.14
Subd. 2. Service Cost Assessments: As authorized under Section 8.05 of the Charter, the
Council may provide by ordinance that the cost of City services to streets, sidewalks or
other public or private property may be assessed against property benefited and may be
collected in the same manner as special assessments. Such costs shall not be deemed to
be “special assessments” for the purposes set forth in Section 8.03 of the Charter. Such
City services shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of snow, ice or rubbish removal
from sidewalks, weed elimination from streets or private property, removal or elimination
of public health or safety hazards from private property, installation or repair of water
service lines, street sprinkling or other dust treatment of streets, the trimming and care of
trees and the removal of unsound trees from any street, the treatment and removal of
insect infested or diseased trees on private property, the repair of sidewalks and alleys or
the operation of a street lighting system.
Subd. 3. Procedure for Assessment: Any special assessment levied under subdivision 2
above shall be payable in single installment or by up to ten (10) equal annual installments
as the Council may provide. With this exception, Sections 202.10, 202.11 and 202.16 of
this Chapter shall apply to assessments made under this Section. However, nothing shall
prevent the property owner or other person served to pay the City directly such charges
when due prior to the assessment herein being authorized and certified.
Subd. 4. Issuance of Obligations: After a contract for any of the work enumerated in
subdivision 2 of this Section has been let or the work commenced, the Council may issue
obligations to defray the expenses of any such work financed, in whole or in part, by
special charges and assessments imposed upon benefited property under this Section.
Section 202.19 of this Chapter shall apply to such obligations with the following
modifications:
a. Such obligations shall be payable not more than two (2) years from the date of

202.15: SPECIAL ASSESSMENT AGAINST PROPERTY OF GOVERNMENTAL
UNITS:
Subd. 1. Authority to Assess: The City may levy special assessments against the property of
a governmental unit benefited by an improvement to the same extent as if such property
were privately owned, but no such assessments, except for storm sewers and drain
systems, shall be levied against a governmental unit for properties used or to be used for
highway rights of way. A “governmental unit” means a county, city, public corporation
or a school district. If the amount of any such assessment, except one against property of
the State, is not paid when due, it may be recovered in a civil action brought by the City
against the governmental unit owning the property so assessed.
Subd. 2. Determination and Collection of Assessment: In the case of property owned by the
State or any instrumentality thereof, the Council may determine the amount that would
have been assessed had the land been privately owned. Such determination shall be made
only after the Council has held a hearing on the proposed assessment after at least two (2)
weeks’ notice of the hearing has been given by registered or certified mail to the head of
the instrumentality, department or agency having jurisdiction over the property. The
amount thus determined may be paid by the instrumentality, department or agency from
available funds. If no funds are available and such instrumentality, department or agency
is supported, in whole or in part, by appropriations from the general revenue fund, then it
shall include in its next budget request the amount thus determined. No instrumentality,
department or agency shall be bound by the determination of the Council and may pay
from available funds or recommend payment in such lesser amount as it determines is the
measure of the benefit received by the land from the improvement.
Subd. 3. Exclusiveness: This Section shall not modify any law authorizing the imposition of
special assessments against governmental units. (1988 Code §26.16)
City of Mounds View
202.16 202.16
202.16: SUPPLEMENTAL ASSESSMENTS AND RE-ASSESSMENTS:
Subd. 1. Supplemental Assessments: The Council may make supplemental assessments to
correct omissions, errors or mistakes in the assessment relating to the total cost of the
improvement or any other particular. A supplemental assessment shall be preceded by
personal or mailed notice to the owner of each parcel included in the supplemental
assessment and a hearing as provided for the original assessment.
Subd. 2. Re-Assessment: When an assessment is, for any reason whatever, set aside by a
court of competent jurisdiction as to any parcel of land, or in event the Council finds that
the assessment or any part thereof is excessive or determines, on advice of the City
Attorney, that the assessment or proposed assessment or any part thereof is or may be
invalid for any reason, the Council may, upon notice and hearing as provided for the
original assessment, make a re-assessment or a new provided assessment as to such
parcel.
Subd. 3. Reapportionment Upon Land Division: When a tract of land against which a
special assessment has been levied is thereafter divided or subdivided by plat or
otherwise, the Council may, on application of the owner of any part of the tract or on its
own motion, equitably apportion among the various lots or parcels in the tract all the
installments of the assessment against the tract remaining unpaid and not then due if it
determines that such apportionment will not materially impair collection of the unpaid
balance of the original assessment against the tract. The Council may, and if the special
assessment has been pledged to the payment of improvement warrants shall, require the
owner, as a condition of such apportionment, to furnish a satisfactory surety bond fully
protecting the City against any loss resulting from failure to pay any part of the
reapportionment assessment when due. Notice of such apportionment and of the right to
appeal shall be mailed to or personally served upon all owners of any part of the tract.
Within thirty (30) days after the mailing or service of the notice of such apportionment,
any such owner may appeal as provided in Section 202.11 of this Chapter.
Subd. 4. Re-Assessment of Tax Forfeited Land1:
a. When a parcel of tax-forfeited land is returned to private ownership and the parcel
is benefited by an improvement for which special assessments were cancelled because of
the forfeiture, the City may, upon notice and hearing as provided for the original
assessment, make a re-assessment or a new assessment as to the parcel in an amount
equal to the amount remaining unpaid on the original assessment. (1988 Code §26.11)
b. The Council may make a re-assessment or a new assessment pursuant to
subdivision 4a above; notwithstanding, that the original assessment may have been made
pursuant to other general law or special law. (1988 Code §26.23)

City of Mounds View
202.17 202.18
202.17: FEES AND CHARGES FOR TAX-FORFEITED LANDS RETURNED TO
PRIVATE OWNERSHIP1: When tax-forfeited land is returned to private ownership and the
land is benefited by a public improvement for which special assessments were cancelled because
of the forfeiture, the City may impose fees or charges for the use or availability of the
improvement or for connections therewith in an amount not to exceed the amount remaining
unpaid on the cancelled assessment. The City may make the fees or charges a charge against the
owner, lessee, occupant or all of them and may certify unpaid fees or charges to the Ramsey
County Auditor with taxes against the property for collection as other taxes are collected.
(1988 Code §26.25)
202.18: IMPROVEMENTS ABANDONED:
Subd. 1. Cancellation of Assessments: When a local improvement proposed to be made by
the City is abandoned before it is completed to an extent sufficient to result in benefits
equal to special assessments which have theretofore been levied for such improvement,
the City shall notify the agency acting as collecting agent for such special assessment of
such fact. Upon such notification, all installments of such assessments and interest
thereon which are not already collected or in the process of collection shall be cancelled
by such agency. However, nothing herein shall prevent the City from making a
re-assessment of any amount not exceeding the special benefits which actually accrue
from the improvement to part or all of the properties originally assessed, and nothing
herein shall affect the obligations of the Municipality to provide funds sufficient to pay
any bonds issued to finance the improvement and the interest thereon.
Subd. 2. Notice; Refund of Assessments:
a. The Council shall instruct the City Clerk to publish and mail notice as provided for
in subdivision 202.10(1) of this Chapter, describing the improvement and stating that it
has been abandoned and that any person who paid any special assessments levied on
account of such improvement may file a claim, within six (6) months following the date
of publication of the notice, for refund of such assessments paid by the Clerk, together
with any interest paid thereon. Failure to give mailed notice, or any defects in the notice,
shall not invalidate the proceedings.
b. The City is not required to, but may, pay such claims filed after the period allowed,
and it may require any claimant to furnish satisfactory evidence that claimant be paid the
amounts claimed. Such claims may be paid out of monies in the fund of the improvement
which was abandoned unless obligations have been issued payable therefrom or may be
paid out of monies in the General Fund.

Section 203.02 of this Title if not needed to pay costs of the improvement and if not held in a
debt redemption fund. (1988 Code §26.21)
202.19: FINANCING OF IMPROVEMENTS:
Subd. 1. Authority to Issue Obligations: At any time after one or more improvements are
ordered as contemplated in Section 202.07 of this Chapter, the Council may issue
obligations in such amounts as it deems necessary to defray, in whole or in part, the
expense incurred and estimated to be incurred in making the improvements, including
every item of cost of the kinds authorized in Minnesota Statutes, section 475.65. In the
event of any omission, error or mistake in any of the proceedings required by this Chapter
or by the Home Rule Charter precedent to the ordering of any improvement1, the validity
of the obligations shall not be affected thereby.
Subd. 2. Due Diligence Responsibility of Council: The Council shall cause all further
actions and proceedings to be taken with due diligence that are required for the
construction of each improvement financed wholly or partly from the proceeds of
obligations and issued hereunder and for the final and valid levy of special assessments
and the appropriation of any other funds needed to pay the obligations and interest
thereon when due.
Subd. 3. Types of Obligations Permitted:
a. Improvement Bonds: The Council may, by resolution adopted prior to the sale of
obligations, pledge the full faith, credit and taxing power of the Municipality for the
payment of the principal and interest. Such obligations shall be called improvement
bonds, and the Council shall pay the principal and interest out of any fund of the
Municipality when the amount credited to the specified fund is insufficient for the
purpose and shall each year levy a sufficient amount to take care of accumulated or
anticipated deficiencies, which levy shall not be subject to any statutory or Charter tax
limitation2.

2 See Charter Section 7.03 for taxation provisions.
City of Mounds View
202.19 202.19
b. Improvement Warrants: Obligations for the payment of which the full faith and
credit of the Municipality is not pledged shall be called improvement warrants and shall

City Finance Director/Treasurer to pay maturing principal and interest on warrants out of
funds on hand in the proper special fund and not otherwise.
c. Temporary Improvement Bonds:
(1) In anticipation of the issuance of improvement bonds, the Council may, by
resolution, issue and sell temporary improvement bonds maturing within not more
than three (3) years from their date of issue to pay any part or all of the cost of one
or more improvements.
(2) To the extent that the principal of and interest on the temporary improvement
bonds cannot be paid when due from receipts of special assessments, taxes or other
funds appropriated for the purpose, they shall be paid from the proceeds of
improvement bonds or additional temporary improvement bonds which the Council
shall offer for sale in advance of their maturity, but the indebtedness funded by an
issue of temporary improvement bonds shall not be extended by the issue of
additional temporary improvement bonds for more than six (6) years from the date
of the first issue.
(3) The holders of any temporary improvement bonds shall have and may enforce,
by mandamus or other appropriate proceedings, all rights respecting the levy and
collection of sufficient special assessments and taxes to pay the cost of the
improvements financed by them which are granted by law to holders of
improvement bonds, except the right to require the levies to be collected prior to the
maturity of the temporary improvement bonds.
(4) If any temporary improvement bonds are not paid in full at maturity, the
holders may require the issuance in exchange for them, at par, of new temporary
improvement bonds maturing within one year from their date of issue (but not
subject to any other maturity limitation) and beating interest at the maximum rate
permitted by law.

a. All obligations shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of the Charter and
Minnesota Statutes 475; except, that an election shall be required for bonds if less than
twenty percent (20%) of the cost of the improvement to the Municipality is to be assessed
against benefited property.
b. The maturities shall be such as, in the opinion of the Council, are warranted by the
anticipated collections of assessments and ad valorem levies for the City’s share of the
cost; except, that the Council may, in its discretion, issue and sell temporary
improvement bonds at any time prior to completion of the work to be financed, maturing
within not more than three (3) years from their date of issue, in which event, the
Municipality shall be obligated to pay such bond and the interest thereon out of the
proceeds of definitive improvement bonds which the Council shall issue and sell at or
prior to the maturity of the temporary bonds, to the extent that the same cannot be paid
out of the assessments and taxes theretofore collected or out of any other Municipal funds
which are properly available and appropriated by the Council for such purpose.
c. The holders of such temporary bonds and the taxpayers of the City shall have and
may enforce, by mandamus or other appropriate proceedings, all rights respecting the
levy and collection of sufficient assessments and taxes to pay the cost of the
improvements financed thereby which are granted by law to holders of other
improvement bonds, except the right to require such levies to be collected prior to the
maturity of the temporary bonds, and shall have the additional right to require the
offering of said definitive improvement bonds at public sale or, if such bonds have not
been sold and delivered prior to the maturity of the temporary bonds, to require the
issuance in exchange therefor, on a par-for-par basis, of either new temporary bonds or
definitive bonds, bearing interest at the maximum rate permitted by law.
d. Any funds of the City may be invested in temporary improvement bonds in
accordance with the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, sections 471.56 and 475.66;

bonds of the City, the holders of such other bonds shall have the right to enforce the
City’s obligation to sell definitive bonds at or before the maturity of the temporary bonds
or to exchange the same in the same manner as holders of such temporary bonds.
All obligations shall state upon their face the purpose of the issue and the fund from
which they are payable.
f. The amount of any obligations issued hereunder shall not be included in
determining the net indebtedness of the City under the provisions of any law limiting
such indebtedness.

special assessments levied and other monies appropriated for each improvement to be

fund which shall be used solely to defray expenses of such improvements and payment of
principal and interest due upon the obligations prior to completion and payment of all
costs of the improvements so financed.
b. Any balance of the proceeds of bonds remaining therein may be used to pay the
cost, in whole or in part, of any other improvement instituted pursuant to this Chapter.

purchased upon their initial issue but shall be purchased only from funds which the
Council determines will not be required for other purposes before the maturity date and
shall be resold before maturity only in case of emergency.
b. If purchased from a debt service fund securing other bonds, the holders of those
bonds may enforce the Municipality’s obligations on the temporary improvement bonds
in the same manner as if they held the temporary improvement bonds.

general obligation temporary improvement bonds, and the Council shall levy taxes for
their payment in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, section 475.61.
b. Proceeds of improvement bonds or temporary improvement bonds not yet sold may
be treated as pledged revenues, in reduction of the tax otherwise required by Minnesota
Statutes, section 475.61 to be levied prior to delivery of the obligations.

assessment against each property shall be proportionate to the original principal amount
thereof and shall be paid to the claimant who paid the last installment of the assessment
aggregating more than the amount to be refunded. No refund shall be made in respect to
any assessment which is delinquent as to either principal or interest. Any installment of

installments and shall levy, if necessary, a general ad valorem tax upon all taxable
property within the Municipality, to be spread upon the tax rolls for each property with
year of the term of the bonds, in amounts for all years such that if collected in full, they,
together with the taxes theretofore levied and appropriated to the Redemption Fund, plus

reserves the right to certify to the County Auditor the fact and amount thereof and to
request the Auditor to reduce by the amount so certified the amount otherwise to be

512.01: PURPOSE AND INTENT: Because the City recognizes that many persons under
the age of 18 years purchase or otherwise obtain, possess and use tobacco, tobacco products,
tobacco-related devices, and electronic delivery devices, and the sales, possession, and use are
violations of both state and federal laws; and because studies, which the City hereby accepts and
adopts, have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the age of 18 years
and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years without having started smoking are
significantly less likely to begin smoking; and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of
several serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of
government; this ordinance shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession and use of tobacco,
tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, and electronic delivery devices for the purpose of
enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious effects associated with
the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, and electronic delivery
devices, and to further the official public policy of the state in regard to preventing young people
from starting to smoke as stated in M.S. § 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time. In
making these findings, the City Council accepts the conclusions and recommendations of Center
for Disease Control in their study “Selected Cigarette Smoking Initiation and Quitting Behaviors
Among High School Students, United States, 1997,” and of the following medical professionals in
these medical journals: Khuder SA, et al., “Age at Smoking Onset and its Effect on Smoking
Cessation,” Addictive Behavior 24(5):673-7, September-October 1999; D’Avanzo B, et al., “Age
at Starting Smoking and Number of Cigarettes Smoked,” Annals of Epidemiology 4(6):455-59,
November 1994; Chen, J & Millar, WJ, “Age of Smoking Initiation: Implications for Quitting,”
Health Reports 9(4):39-46, Spring 1998; Everett SA, et al., “Initiation of Cigarette Smoking and
Subsequent Smoking Behavior Among U.S. High School Students,” Preventive Medicine,
29(5):327-33, November 1999, copies of which are adopted by reference.
512.02: DEFINITIONS: Except as may otherwise be provided or clearly implied by
context, all terms shall be given their commonly accepted definitions. For the purpose of this
chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

those authorized to sell tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, and electronic

513.04: Hours of Operation
513.05: Additional Conditions for Adult Cabarets
513.06: License Required
513.01: FINDINGS: Subdivision 1. Studies conducted by the Minnesota attorney general,
the American Planning Association and cities such as St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana;
Alexandria, Minnesota; Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles, California; Seattle,
Washington; St. Croix County, Wisconsin; have studied the impacts that adult establishments have
in those communities. These studies have concluded that adult establishments have adverse
impact on the surrounding neighborhoods. Those impacts include increased crime rates, lower
property values, increased transiency, neighborhood blight and potential health risks. Based on
these studies and findings, the city council concludes: (Amended, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)
a. Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set forth above.
b. The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish if adult
establishments are governed by locational requirements, licensing requirements and health
requirements.
c. It is not the intent of the city council to prohibit adult establishments from having a
reasonable opportunity to locate in the city.
d. Minnesota Statutes, Section 462.357, allows the city to adopt regulations to promote
the public health, safety, morals and general welfare.
e. The public health, safety, morals and general welfare will be promoted by the city
adopting regulations governing adult establishments.
f. Adult establishments can contribute to an increase in criminal activity in the area in
which such businesses are located, taxing City crime-prevention programs and law
enforcement services. (Amended, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)
City of Mounds View
513.01 513.01 (Rev. 4/04)
g. Adult establishments can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity.
The experience of other cities indicates that the proper management and operation of such
businesses can, however, minimize this risk, provided the owners and operators of such
facilities are regulated by licensing or other procedures. (Added, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)
h. Adult establishments can increase the risk of exposure to communicable diseases
including but not limited to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) for which
currently there is no cure. Experiences of other cities indicate that such businesses can
facilitate the spread of communicable diseases by virtue of the design and use of the
premises, thereby endangering not only the patrons of such establishments but also the
general public. (Added, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)
i. Adult establishments can cause or contribute to public health problems by the
presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with food and/or drink on the same
premises. (Added, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)
j. The risk of criminal activity and/or public health problems can be minimized through
a licensing and regulatory scheme as prescribed herein. (Added, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)
Subd. 2. Purpose: It is the purpose of this Section to regulate adult establishments to promote
the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City and to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations to: (Added, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)
a. Prevent additional criminal activity within the City; (Added, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)
b. Prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequent adverse effect on real
estate values of properties within the neighborhood; (Added, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)
c. Locate adult establishments away from residential areas, schools, churches, libraries,
parks and playgrounds; and (Added, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)
d. Prevent concentration of adult establishments within certain areas of the City.
(Added, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)
Subd. 3. Content-Neutral Regulation: The provisions of this Section have neither the purpose
nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including adult oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of
this Section to restrict or deny access by adults to adult-oriented materials protected by the
First Amendment or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented
entertainment to their intended market. (Added, Ord. 734, 4-26-04)

regulation is appropriate because such activities provide an opportunity for the commission of
crimes and their concealment because such businesses have the ability to receive and transfer

regulation of such activities is warranted because customers of such businesses frequently seek
their services during times of desperate financial circumstances.
To help the City of Mounds View to better regulate current and future pawn businesses, decrease
and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the pawn industry, and increase identification
of criminal activities in the pawn industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn
transaction information, this Chapter also implements and establishes the required use of the

607.07: VEHICLES CONSTITUTING A PUBLIC NUISANCE: (Ord. 694, 3-11-02)
Subd. 1. Findings and Purpose: (Ord. 694, 3-11-02)
a. Abandoned, junk, and unsafe vehicles constitute a hazard to the health and welfare
of the citizens of the City of Mounds View in that such vehicles can harbor noxious
diseases, furnish shelter and breeding places for vermin, present physical dangers to the
safety and well-being of children and other citizens, invite plundering, and create fire
hazards. Motor vehicles contain fluids that if released into the environment can and do
cause significant health risks to the citizens of Mounds View. The condition of vehicles
that are abandoned, junk, or unsafe significantly increase the likelihood that these
dangerous fluids might be so released. Abandoned, junk, or unsafe vehicles and other
scrap metals also constitute a blight on the landscape of the City and therefore a
detriment to the environment. The abandonment and retirement of vehicles and other
scrap metals constitutes a waste of a valuable source of useful metal. It is therefore in the
public interest that the present accumulation of abandoned and junk vehicles and other
scrap metals be eliminated, that future abandonment of vehicles and other scrap metals be
prevented, that the expansion of existing scrap recycling facilities be developed and that
other acceptable and economically useful methods for the disposal of abandoned and junk
vehicles and other forms of scrap metal be developed. (Ord. 694, 3-11-02)
Subd. 2. Abandoned, Junk, and Unsafe Vehicles:
a. Abandoned, junk, and unsafe vehicles are declared to be a public nuisance creating
a hazard to the health and safety of the public because they invite plundering, create fire
hazards, attract vermin, and present physical dangers to the safety and well-being of
children and other citizens. The accumulation and outside storage of such vehicles is in
the nature of rubbish, litter, and unsightly debris and is a blight on the landscape and
detriment to the environment. No person in charge or control of any property within the
City, whether as owner, tenant, occupant, lessee, or otherwise shall store or keep
abandoned, junk, and unsafe motor vehicles on private or public property.
(Ord. 694, 3-11-02)
b. Vehicles Stopped or Standing: Any vehicle, whether occupied or not, that is found
stopped, standing or parked in violation of any ordinance or State statute; or that is
reported stolen; or that is found impeding firefighting, show removal or plowing or the
orderly flow of traffic, is declared to be a public nuisance. (Ord. 694, 3-11-02)
c. Vehicles Blocking Access: Any vehicle which is impeding public road or utility
repair, construction or maintenance activities after reasonable notice of the improper
activities has been given to the vehicle owner or user at least twelve (12) hours in
advance, is declared to be a public nuisance. (Ord. 694, 3-11-02)

608.04: Public Health Regulations
608.05: Exceptions
608.06: Health Enforcement Powers
608.07: Criminal Penalties
608.01: PURPOSE: The purpose of this section of the City Code is to prescribe
regulations governing commercial premises, buildings, and structures that are conducive, by
virtue of design and use, to high-risk sexual conduct which can result in the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases to persons frequenting such premises, buildings, and structures.
City of Mounds View
608.02 608.02
608.02: FINDINGS OF THE CITY COUNCIL: The City Council of the City of
Mounds View makes the following findings regarding the need to regulate commercial premises,
buildings, and structures that are conducive to the spread of communicable disease of danger to
persons in order to further the substantial interest of public health:
a. The experience of other cities establishes that certain commercial premises,
buildings, and structures, or parts thereof, by reason of the design and use of such
premises, buildings, or structures are conducive to the spread of communicable disease of
danger to persons frequenting such premises, buildings, or structures, as well as to the
general public, and that the risk of spreading infectious and contagious diseases can be
minimized by regulating such commercial premises, buildings, and structures.
b. The experience of other cities where such commercial premises, buildings, and
structures are present indicates that the risk of spreading the sexually transmittable
disease of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is increased by the presence
of such premises, buildings, and structures, because the design or use of such premises,
buildings, and structures, or parts thereof can facilitate high-risk sexual conduct.
c. Medical publications of the Center for Disease Control of the United States
Department of Health and Human Services indicate that the sexually transmittable
disease of AIDS is currently irreversible and uniformly fatal. Medical research has
further established that the risk factors for obtaining or spreading AIDS are associated
with high risk sexual conduct.

a. Authorization: The Metropolitan Waste Control Commission, a metropolitan commission
organized and existing under the laws of the State (the “Commission”)3, in order to receive and
retain grants in compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972
and regulations thereunder (the “Act”), has determined to impose an industrial user sewer
strength charge upon users of the Metropolitan Disposal System (as defined in Minnesota
Statutes, Section 473.121, Subdivision 24, to recover operation and maintenance costs of
treatment works attributable to the strength of the discharge of industrial waste, such sewer
strength charge being in addition to the charge based upon the volume of discharge. In order for
the City to pay such costs based upon strength of industrial discharge and allocated to it each year
by the Commission, it is hereby found, determined and declared to be necessary to establish
sewer strength charges and a formula for the computation thereof for all industrial users receiving
waste treatment services within or served by the City. Furthermore, Minnesota Statutes, Section
444.075, Subdivision 3, empowers the City to make such sewer charge a charge against the
owner, lessee, occupant or all of them and certify unpaid charges to the County Auditor as a tax
lien against the property served.
b. Strength Charges: For the purpose of paying the costs allocated to the City each year by
the Commission that are based upon the strength of discharge of all industrial users receiving
waste treatment services within or served by the City, there is hereby approved, adopted and
established, in addition to the sewer charge based upon the volume of discharge, a sewer charge
upon each person receiving waste treatment services within or served by the City, based upon
strength of industrial waste discharged into the sewer system of the City (the “strength charge”).

c. Strength Charge Formula: For the purpose of computation of the strength charge
established by subdivision 3b above, there is hereby established, approved and adopted in
compliance with the Act the same strength charge formula designated in Resolution 76-172 of the
Commission, dated June 15, 1976, adopted by the governing body, a copy of said resolution on
file in the office of the City Administrator, such formula being based upon pollution qualities and
difficulty of disposal of the sewage produced through an evaluation of pollution qualities and
quantities in excess of an annual average based on the proportionate costs of operation and
maintenance of waste treatment services provided by the Commission. (Amended,
Ord. 844, 5-20-10)
d. Strength Charge Payment: It is hereby approved, adopted and established that the strength
charge established by Subdivision 3b above shall be paid by each industrial user receiving waste
treatment services and subject thereto before twenty (20) days next succeeding the date of billing
thereof to such user by or on behalf of the City, and such payment thereof shall be deemed to be
delinquent if not so paid to the billing entity before such date. Furthermore, it is hereby
established, approved and adopted that if such payment is not paid before such date, an industrial
user shall pay an interest charge as determined by the Metropolitan Waste Commission.
e. Tax Lien: As provided by Minnesota Statutes, Section 444.075, Subdivision 3, it is hereby
approved, adopted and established that if payment of the strength charge established by
Subdivision 3b above is not paid before the sixty (60) days next succeeding the date of billing
thereof to the industrial user by or on behalf of the City, said delinquent sewer strength charge,
plus accrued interest established pursuant to Subdivision 3d above shall be deemed to be a charge
against the owner, lessee and occupant of the property served, and the City or its agent shall
certify such unpaid delinquent balance to the County Auditor with taxes against the property
served for collection as other taxes are collected; provided, however, that such certification shall
not preclude the City or its agent from recovery of such delinquent sewer strength charge and
interest thereon under any other available remedy. (1988 Code §71.11; 1993 Code)
907.15: VIOLATION OF PROVISIONS: Any person who shall do or commit any act that is
forbidden by the provisions of this Chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. (1988 Code §71.13)

SURFACE WATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY
SECTION:

908.09: Use of Revenues
908.10: Penalties and Remedies for Delinquency or Default in Paying Bills
908.01: GENERAL OPERATION:
Subd. 1. Title: The Municipal surface water system shall be operated as a public utility (hereinafter
called the Surface Water Management Utility), pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 444.075,
from which revenues will be derived subject to the provisions of this Chapter and Minnesota
Statutes. The Mounds View Municipal Code is amended by adding Chapter 908 to be entitled,
“Surface Water Management Utility”.
City of Mounds View
908.01 908.02
Subd. 2. Findings and Determinations: In providing for such charges, the findings and
determinations are as follows:
a. In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health,
safety, convenience and general welfare, the City has constructed, operated and maintained
a surface water system (“the system”). This Section is adopted in the further exercise and
authority and for the same purpose.
b. The system, as constructed, heretofore has been financed and paid for through the
ad valorem taxes and assessments. Such financing methods were appropriate to the
circumstances at the time they were used. It is now necessary and desirable to provide an
alternative method of recovering some or all of the future costs of improving, maintaining and
operating the system through the imposition of user charges.
c. In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them
just and equitable. Taking into account the status of completion of the system, past methods of
recovering system costs, the topography of the City and other relevant factors, it is determined
that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of
operating, maintaining and improving the system on the basis of the expected storm water runoff
from the various parcels of land within the City during a standard one-year rainfall event.
d. Assigning costs and making charges based upon typical storm water runoff cannot be done
with mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits.
The provisions of this Section undertake to establish a reasonable and practical methodology for
making such charges. (Ord. 529, 8-23-93)
908.02: DEFINITIONS:
Subd. 1. QUARTERLY SURFACE WATER MANAGEMENT REVENUE REQUIREMENT: The
estimated quarterly expenditures for planning and inventories, capital expenditures, personnel,
equipment and operation of the surface water utility, in accordance with established City policy.
The quarterly surface water management revenue requirement and resulting surface water
management fees shall be established for a period of time as set by City Council resolution.
Subd. 2. SURFACE WATER MANAGEMENT FEE: The quarterly charge developed for each
parcel of land pursuant to this Chapter.
Subd. 3. UTILITY FACTOR: The utility factor is defined as the ratio of runoff volume, in inches,
for a particular land use, to the runoff volume, in inches for an average single-family residential
lot, assuming a two inch (2”) rainfall and Soil Conservation Service (SCS) “Type B” soil
conditions. (Ord. 529, 8-23-93)
City of Mounds View
908.03 908.03
908.03: SURFACE WATER MANAGEMENT FEE:
Subd. 1. Determination: The surface water management fee shall be determined by first
determining the percentage of total runoff in the City which is attributed to residential property.
The total fee for all residential property in the City is computed by multiplying the runoff
percentage by one-quarter (1/4) of the annual surface water management revenue requirement.
The residential surface water management fee, per acre, is determined by dividing the total
residential fee by the estimated total acres of residential land use in the City.
Subd. 2. Total Fee: The surface water management fee for residential, town-homes/condominiums,
apartments and mobile home parks will be determined on a per-household basis rather than a per
acre basis. The fee per household is determined by first determining the total fee for each land
use. The total fee for each land use is determined by multiplying the total fee for all residential
property by the appropriate utility factor based on land use. The total fee is then divided by the
total number of households for the particular land use, resulting in cost per household.
City of Mounds View
908.03 908.03
Subd. 3. Individual Parcels, Excluding Residential: The surface water management fee for all
individual parcels, excluding residential, shall be defined as the product of 1) the residential
surface water management fee (per acre); 2) the appropriate utility factor based on land use, and
3) the total acreage of the parcel.
a. Credits: The Council may adopt policies, by resolution, for adjustment of the surface water
management fees. Information to justify a fee adjustment must be supplied by the property
owner. Such adjustments of fees shall not be retroactive unless provided within said resolution.
Credits will be reviewed regularly by a staff committee.
b. Surface Water Management Utility Factors: The utility factors for various land uses are as
follows:
Classification Land Use Utility Factor
R1, R2 Single and Two-Family Residential 1.0
R-3 Medium Density Residential 2.68
R-4, R-5, R-0 High Density Residential, Mobile Homes, 3.26
Residential Office

1-1 Industrial 3.26
PF Public Facilities 1.28
PUD Planned Unit Development 3.69
CRP Conservancy, Recreation and Presentation 0.46
School/Church Public/Private 1.5
c. Other Land Uses: Other land uses not listed in the foregoing table shall be classified by the
City Administrator by assigning them to the classes most nearly like the listed uses, from the
standpoint of probable hydrologic response. Appeals from the City Administrator’s
determination of the proper classifications may be made to the City Council in the same manner
as other appeals from administrative determinations. (Ord. 529, 8-23-93)
City of Mounds View
908.04 908.10
908.04: ADJUSTMENTS OF MANAGEMENT FEES: The City Council may by resolution,
from time to time, adopt policies providing for the adjustment of management fees for parcels or groups
of parcels, based upon hydrologic data supplied by affected property owners, demonstrating an actual
hydrologic response substantially different from the utility factor being used for the parcel or parcels.
(Ord. 529, 8-23-93)
908.05: EXCLUDED LANDS: No management fee for system availability or service shall be
made against land which is public street right of way. (Ord. 529, 8-23-93)
908.06: SUPPLYING INFORMATION: The owner, occupant or person in charge of any
premises shall supply the City with such information as the City may reasonably request related to the
use, development and area of the premises. Willful failure to provide such information or to falsify it is a
violation of this Section. (Ord. 529, 8-23-93)
908.07: ESTIMATED CHARGES: If the owner, occupant or person in charge of any premises
fails or refuses to provide information requested under Section 908.06 of this Chapter, the management
fee for such premises shall be estimated and billed in accordance with such estimate, based upon
information then available to the City. (Ord. 529, 8-23-93)
908.08: BILLINGS AND COLLECTIONS: Bills for surface water management fees for the use
and availability of the system shall be rendered by the Finance Department in accordance with usual and
customary practice in rendering of water and sanitary sewer service bills. Bills shall be rendered
quarterly, shall be payable at the office of the City Finance Department and may be rendered in
conjunction with billings for water or sanitary sewer service, or both. (Ord. 529, 8-23-93)
908.09: USE OF REVENUES: Revenues received from charges shall be placed in the surface
water management utility account and shall be used to finance operational costs and improvements to and
betterment of the system. (Ord. 529, 8-23-93)

Subd. 1. The City may adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices for any activity,
operation, or facility that may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water,
the storm drainage system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of such activity,

discharge of prohibited materials, or other wastes into the storm drainage system or watercourses
using these structural and nonstructural BMPs.

an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance
with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water
associated with industrial activity, to the maximum extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant

contributed to an actual or threatened illicit discharge to the MS4 or waters of the state, which
reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the City may issue an order to the violator directing it to
immediately cease and desist all such violations.
Subd. 3. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in
violation of this Chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. Such suspension may also be imposed if it is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened illicit discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger.
Subd. 4. Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement processes and
penalties provided in this Chapter, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any
of the provision of this Chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a public nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator’s
expense; and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance
may be taken by the City.
Subd. 5. Assessments. All costs and expenses, including attorney and consultant fees, incurred by
the City in abating any public nuisance under this Chapter may be assessed against the premises
at which the violation exists as a special assessment or a charge under Minnesota Statutes,
Municipal Code, or City Charter.

Subd. 2. Section 101.2 Legislative Findings: The City Council finds that the existence of
dwellings which are substandard in one (1) or more important features of structure,

standards for basic equipment and facilities; for light, ventilation and heating; for safety
from fire; for space, use and location; for safe and sanitary maintenance of all dwellings;
(b) determines the responsibilities of owners, operators and occupants of dwellings;

certain dwellings; and (d) provides for administration and enforcement.

referenced in this Code shall be those listed in Chapter 8, and shall be considered part of

cause the abatement of everything existing in violation thereof and cause the premises to

City of Mounds View
1008.01 1008.01 (Rev. 1/09)
1008.01: PURPOSE: This Chapter is intended to establish a comprehensive and balanced
system of sign control that accommodates the need for a well-maintained, safe, and attractive
community, and the need for effective communications including business identification. The
City of Mounds View finds it is necessary for the promotion and preservation of the public
health, safety, welfare, image and aesthetics of the community that the construction, location,
size and maintenance of signs be controlled. Further, the City finds that: (Ord. 679, 5-29-01;
Ord. 816, 1-22-09)
a. Permanent and temporary signs have a direct impact on and relationship to the
image and aesthetics of the City; (Ord. 679, 5-29-01; Ord. 816, 1-22-09)
b. The manner of installation, location and maintenance of signs affects the public
health, safety, welfare and aesthetics of the City; (Ord. 679, 5-29-01; Ord. 816, 1-22-09)
c. an opportunity for viable identification of residences, businesses and institutions in
the City must be established; (Ord. 679, 5-29-01; Ord. 816, 1-22-09)
d. the safety of motorists, cyclists, pedestrians and other users of public streets and
property is affected by the number, size, location and appearance of signs that create
hazards for drivers and unduly divert the attention of drivers; (Ord. 679, 5-29-01;
Ord. 816, 1-22-09)
e. installation of signs suspended from, projecting over, or placed on the tops of
buildings, walks or other structures may constitute a hazard during periods of high winds
and an obstacle to effective fire-fighting and other emergency service;
(Ord. 679, 5-29-01)
f. uncontrolled and unlimited signs and sign types, particularly moving signs and
signs with dynamic displays, adversely impact the image and aesthetic attractiveness of
the City and thereby undermine economic value and growth; (Ord. 679, 5-29-01;
Ord. 816, 1-22-09)
g. uncontrolled and unlimited signs, particularly temporary signs which are commonly
located within or adjacent to public right-of-way or are located at driveway/street
intersections, result in roadside clutter and obstruction of views of oncoming traffic.
This creates a hazard to drivers and pedestrians and also adversely impacts a logical flow
of information; (Ord. 679, 5-29-01)
h. signs are generally incompatible with residential uses and should be strictly limited
in residential zoning districts; and (Ord. 679, 5-29-01; Ord. 769, 5-8-06)
City of Mounds View
1008.01 1008.13 (Rev. 1/09)
i. the right to express opinions in any zoning district must be protected, subject to
reasonable restrictions on size, height, location and number. (Ord. 679, 5-29-01;
Ord. 5-8-06)
j. the City does not intend to nor does it propose to regulate the message on any sign.
(Added, Ord. 816, 1-22-09)
k. the City intends to protect the public from the dangers of unsafe signs. (Added,
Ord. 816, 1-22-09)
1008.011: SCOPE OF REGULATIONS: The sign regulations established in this Chapter
shall apply to all structures and all land uses. This Chapter describes the sign standards for all
the zoning districts of the City. The City establishes specific additional regulations for signs that
are unique in purpose and not easily addressed by district regulations. No person, property
owner or lessee shall place, erect, alter, modify, enhance or change a sign in any way that does
not meet the requirements of this Chapter and other applicable regulations. (Added,
Ord. 816, 1-22-09)
1008.012: SEVERABILITY: If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or other
part of this Chapter is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the rest of this Chapter. The City Council hereby declares that it would have
adopted the Chapter in each section, subsection, sentence or phrase thereof, irrespective of the
fact that any one (1) or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases are declared
invalid. (Added, Ord. 816, 1-22-09)
1008.013: SUBSTITUTION PROVISION: The owner or operator of any sign that this
Chapter would otherwise allow may substitute a non-commercial sign in lieu of any other
commercial or non-commercial sign. The owner may make this substitution without any
additional City approval or permit. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent
favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial speech, or the favoring of any particular
non-commercial message over any other non-commercial message. This provision shall prevail
over any more specific provision to the contrary. (Added, Ord. 816, 1-22-09)

1008.13 NONCONFORMING SIGNS: It is the intent of the City with this Chapter that
nonconforming signs shall not be enlarged or expanded, nor should a person use this Chapter as
grounds for adding other signs or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. It is further the
intent of the City with this Chapter to permit legal nonconforming signs to remain if such signs
are safe, maintained in good condition and if such signs have not been abandoned, moved or
removed. Any sign, including a billboard, legally existing at the time of the passage of this
Ordinance that does not conform to the provisions of this ordinance shall be considered a legal
nonconforming sign and may be continued including through repair, replacement of graphic
panels, restoration, maintenance, or improvement but not including the moving, enlargement or

(180) days of the date of destruction. The City’s Building Official shall be responsible
for making the determination whether a nonconforming sign has been destroyed greater
than fifty percent (50%) of its market value at the time of destruction. In making this
determination, the Building Official shall consider the market value of the entire sign at
the time prior to the destruction and the replacement value of the existing sign. In the
event a building permit is applied for within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date of
the damage or destruction and the sign did not withstand damage greater than fifty
percent (50%) of its market value at the time of destruction, the City may impose
reasonable conditions upon the building permit in order to mitigate any newly created
impact on adjacent properties.
Subd. 4. A lawful nonconforming sign shall not be changed to a similar nonconforming sign
or to a more restrictive nonconforming sign.

City of Mounds View
1010.02 1010.02
1010.02: FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE:
Subd. 1. Findings:
a. The Council finds that wetlands within the City, as part of the ecosystem, are
critical to the present and future health, safety and general welfare of the land, animals
and people within the City, as well as within the Rice Creek Watershed District, that
existing and potential development within the City and Rice Creek Watershed possess
increasing ecological and economic problems and demands, having the effect of
potentially despoiling, polluting, accelerating the aging, eliminating or negatively and
irretrievably altering both the wetlands and their functions (and the processes associated
therewith) which, if managed, will constitute important physical, educational, ecological,
aesthetic, recreational and economic assets for existing and future residents of the
community and the Rice Creek Watershed District. The City Council has in mind its
statutory obligation to comply with Chapters 104, 105 and 112 of Minnesota State Law,
the regulations of Rice Creek Watershed District, Regulations of the Department of
Natural Resources, including provisions for protected waters, Public Law 92.500 (Federal
Water Pollution Control Act), open space policies of the Metropolitan Council and its
guidelines encouraging protection and enhancement of marshes, wetlands in the flood
plain area and the public interest in preventing irreparable destruction or deterioration of
valuable natural resources.
b. The public interest necessitates sound land use development, as land is a limited
and irreplaceable resource, and the land within the Municipality is a resource to be
developed in a manner which will result in minimum damage to the quality of life,
property, threat to health and reduction of private/public economic loss caused by
drainage problems.
City of Mounds View
1010.02 1010.02
Subd. 2. Purposes: Therefore, recognizing the obligation to protect these assets and natural
resource gifts from destruction or deterioration and pollution of all kinds, the purposes of this
Chapter are:
a. To preserve wetlands in as natural a state as possible;
b. To serve as natural retention and detention areas for surface waters;
c. To regulate the use of areas adjacent to the wetlands in order to protect and enhance
the natural function of the wetlands;
d. To provide for the protection, preservation, proper maintenance, use and
enhancement of wetland zoning districts;
e. To minimize the disturbance to them and to prevent or minimize damage from
excessive sedimentation, eutrophication or pollution;
f. To prevent loss of aquatic organisms, wildlife and vegetation or the habitats of the
same;
g. To provide for the protection of surface and ground water supplies from the danger
of drought, overdraft, pollution or mismanagement;
h. To secure safety from floods;
i. To reduce the financial burdens imposed upon the community through rescue and
relief efforts occasioned by the occupancy or use of areas subject to periodic flooding;
j. To prevent loss of life, property damage and the losses and risks associated with
flood conditions;
k. To reduce erosion problems;
l. To enhance and preserve quality; and
m. To enhance and preserve the natural drainageways. (Ord. 505, 4-27-92)

districts established pursuant to Title 1100 of this Code so that any parcel of land lying in a
wetland zoning district shall also lie in one or more of the established zoning districts. Lands
lying within a wetland zoning district shall be subject to the requirements established by other
applicable ordinances and regulations of the City. Within each wetland zoning district, all uses
shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations for the underlying zoning district; provided,
however, that such uses must also satisfy the additional requirements established in this Chapter.
(Ord. 505, 4-27-92)
1010.04: PLAN OF EXECUTION: It is the intent of the City to effectuate the purposes of
this Chapter through the following means:
Subd. 1. Adopt a map designating the wetlands protected by this Chapter.
Subd. 2. Promote community education about the importance, function, limitations and
impact of urbanization upon the water resources of the community.
Subd. 3. To preserve and enhance of wetlands within the community through
implementation of development regulations that will ensure the design and construction
of adequate on-site storm water, sedimentation and retention and detention basins, flow
control devices and implementation of effective erosion control techniques.
Subd. 4. To apply techniques such as density transfers to development proposals in order to
minimize ratios of impermeable surface to open space.
Subd. 5. To establish means by which certain wetlands may be placed in the public domain
for purposes of enhancement, preservation, protection and maintenance.
Subd. 6. To provide means by which an applicant and the City will routinely obtain advice
and input from various governmental agencies and professionals in the field of fresh
water biology, hydrology and civil engineering.
Subd. 7. To establish a system of permits and enforcement to effectuate the intent of this
Chapter. (Ord. 505, 4-27-92)

a. Minimum Alteration in Ecological and Hydrological Characteristics: A minimum
alteration of a wetland may be allowed when necessary for the use of property but only
when it will not have a substantially or significantly adverse effect, as determined by the
City, upon the ecological and hydrological characteristics of the wetland. However, in no
case shall the restrictions set out below in Section 1010.08, subdivision 3a(1) - (6) be
exceeded. Since the extent of alteration which can be permitted is limited, the City, when
considering a permit application, shall consider equal apportionment of alteration
opportunity. The alteration opportunity within the wetland shall be allocated among
property owners in proportion to the area of wetland located within each property.
(Ord. 602, 8-25-97)
(1) Any alteration shall not cause a reduction in the flood storage capacity of the
wetland. Flood storage capacity shall be determined by analysis of the runoff from
the entire developed wetland drainage district resulting from both the two (2) year
and one hundred (100) year frequency, twenty four (24)hour SCS Type I
distribution storms.
(2) An alteration shall not reduce the existing water quality enhancement value of a
wetland under conditions of ultimate development, during both the two (2) year and
one hundred (100) year frequency, twenty four (24) hour SCS Type I distribution
storms. Water quality enhancement value of a wetland shall be determined using
methods approved by the City.
(3) Any alteration shall not reduce the existing wildlife habitat value of a wetland
as measured using methods approved by the City.
(4) Alterations shall be carried out so as to minimize the impact on vegetation.
Removal of vegetation within a wetland zoning district shall be permitted only
when reasonably required for the placement of structures and use of property.
(Ord. 602, 8-25-97)
(5) Alterations shall not adversely affect the water flow characteristics within the
wetland as determined by the City.
City of Mounds View
1010.08 1010.08
(6) Storm water runoff from a development may be directed to the wetland when in
conformance with the Local Water Management Plan1 and only when substantially,
as determined by the Council, free of sediment, debris and chemical pollutants and
only at rates which will not substantially disturb vegetation or increase turbidity as
determined by the City.
(7) The proposed action shall not cause storm water runoff from the development
to take place at a rate which would exceed the rate or volume of runoff as
anticipated by the City’s Local Water Management Plan2.
(8) The quality of water infiltrated to the water table or aquifer shall remain
substantially, as determined by the City, unchanged by the alteration of the site.
(9) No part of any sewage disposal system requiring on-land or in-ground disposal
of waste shall be located closer than one hundred feet (100’) from the wetland. All
on-land or in-ground sewage disposal systems shall meet criteria set out in
Minnesota Rule 6, MCAR 4.8040, Individual Sewage Treatment System Standard.
(10) Waste which would normally be disposed of at a solid or hazardous waste
disposal site or which would normally be discharged into a sewage disposal system
or sewer shall not be, directly or indirectly, discharged to a wetland.
b. Soil Conditions; Control of Erosion:
(1) Construction erosion control measures and retention facilities shall be designed
to limit soil loss from the development site to not more than five (5) tons per acre
per year. Plans and supporting documentation for such measures and facilities shall
be developed and approved by the City prior to commencement of construction.
(2) The applicant for the wetland alteration permit shall be required to demonstrate
that, after the development is completed, the conditions on the site will be stabilized
such that the yearly soil loss from the site will not be greater than five-tenths (0.5)
ton per acre per year.
(3) Sediment and soil loss shall be determined utilizing the Universal Soil Loss
Equation as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation
Service Technical Field Guide, as amended from time to time, as provided for
Ramsey Soil and Water Conservation District.

the City, may be used.
(5) A building’s minimum elevation permitted in a wetland zoning district shall be
as defined in the Local Water Management Plan1.
(6) No alteration shall be allowed which will endanger the health, safety or welfare
of persons or which may result in unusual road maintenance costs or utility line
breakages due to soil limitations, including high frost action.
c. Scheduling of Work: Work in the wetland will not be performed during the
breeding season of water fowl or fish spawning season.
d. Size of Area: The size of the altered area shall be limited to the minimum required
for the proposed action.
Subd. 5. Standards for Denial of Permits: No wetland alteration or wetland buffer permit
may be granted which would allow any use that is prohibited in the zoning district in
which the property is located or which will: (Ord. 602, 8-25-97)
a. Result in incompatible land uses or which would be detrimental to surface and
ground water resources. Ord. 602, 8-25-97)
b. Increase the financial burdens imposed on the community through increasing floods
and overflow of water onto land areas within this City or onto land areas adjacent to Rice
Creek. (Ord. 602, 8-25-97)

will increase or cause danger to life or property. (Ord. 602, 8-25-97)
d. Be inconsistent with the objectives of encouraging land uses compatible with the
preservation of the natural land forms, vegetation and wetlands within the City. (Ord.
602, 8-25-97)
e. Include development of land and water areas essential to continue the temporary
withholding of rapid runoff of surface water which contributes to downstream flooding or
water pollution or development of land and water areas which provide ground water
recharge or development which diminishes the land or water which are necessary to carry
increased flows of storm water following periods of heavy precipitation.

uses upon the general welfare, public health and safety.

following findings where applicable:
(1) The use will not create an excessive burden on existing parks, schools,
streets and other public facilities and utilities which serve or are proposed to
serve the area.
(2) The use will be sufficiently compatible or separated by distance or
screening from adjacent residentially zoned or used land so that existing
homes will not be depreciated in value and there will be no deterrence to
development of vacant land.
(3) The structure and site shall have an appearance that will not have an
adverse effect upon adjacent residential properties.
(4) The use, in the opinion of the City Council, is reasonably related to the
overall needs of the City and to the existing land use.

conditions imposed by the City Council, time limits, review dates and such other
information as may be appropriate.
e. Reconsideration: Whenever an application for a conditional use permit has
been considered and denied by the City Council, a similar application for a
conditional use permit affecting substantially the same property shall not be
considered again by the Planning and Zoning Commission or City Council for at
least six (6) months from the date of its denial and a subsequent application
affecting substantially the same property shall likewise not be considered again by

for extension of time in which to complete the work has been granted by the City
Council. Such extension shall be requested, in writing, and filed with the City
Administrator at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the original
conditional use permit. There shall be no charge for the filing of such petition. The
request for extension shall state facts showing a good faith attempt to complete the
work permitted in the conditional use permit. Such petition shall be presented to
the Planning and Zoning Commission for a recommendation and to the City
Council for a decision. (Amended, Ord. 844, 5-20-10)

(1) Upon approval of a conditional use permit, the City shall be provided with
a surety bond, cash escrow, certificate of deposit, securities or cash deposit

improvements or development and a certificate of occupancy indicating
compliance with the conditional use permit and codes of the City has been
issued by the City Building Inspector.

Subd. 2. Criteria for Granting Variances: A variance to the provisions of the Zoning
Code may be issued by the Board of Adjustment and Appeals, or in the case of an
administrative variance, by the Director of Community Development as explained
in Section 1125.02, subdivision 6, to provide relief to the landowner in those cases
where the Code imposes practical difficulties to the property owner in the use of
property owner’s land. Practical difficulties include, but are not limited to,
inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. No variances shall be
granted that would allow any use that is not allowed in the zoning district in which
the subject property is located. A variance may be granted only in the event that all
of the following circumstances exist: (Amended, Ord. 725, 2-9-04, Ord. 861, 9-22-
11)
a. The variance is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this Title.

c. The applicant proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not
permitted by this Title or the City Code. (Amended, Ord. 861, 9-22-11)
d. Unique circumstances apply to the property which do not apply to other
properties in the same zone or vicinity and result from lot size or shape, topography
or other circumstances over which the owner of the property since the enactment of
this Title has had no control. The unique circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant. (Amended, Ord. 861, 9-22-11)
e. The variance does not alter the essential character of the neighborhood.
(Amended, Ord. 861, 9-22-11)
f. The variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the
practical difficulties. Economic conditions alone do not constitute practical
difficulties. (Amended, Ord. 861, 9-22-11)
g. The Board of Adjustment and Appeals may impose such conditions upon the
premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards
established by this Title or to reduce or minimize the effect of such variance upon
other properties in the neighborhood and to better carry out the intent of the
variance. The condition must be directly related to and must bear a rough
proportionality to the impact created by the variance. (Amended, Ord. 861, 9-22-11)

request for variance or an appeal, the Planning and Zoning Commission, serving as
the Board of Adjustment and Appeals, may set a date and hold a hearing on said
request. The Board shall hear such persons as wish to be heard, either in person or
by agent or attorney. Notice of any such hearing shall be mailed not less than ten
(10) days before the date of hearing to the person who filed the appeal or request, to
all owners of property, according to the City assessment records, within three
hundred fifty feet (350’) of the property to which the variance relates.

development or improvement of land within the jurisdiction of the City shall, in all
respects, comply with the requirements of this Chapter.

Subd. 1. Dedication Required:
a. In all subdivisions to be developed for residential, commercial, industrial or other

uses or any combination thereof, a subdivider shall dedicate a reasonable portion of the
buildable land of the proposed subdivision to the public or to be preserved for public use
as parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails or public open space. For purposes of
this Section, “buildable land” means the gross acreage of the subdivision excluding
designated wetlands and land set aside as open space in a manner approved by the City.
(Ord. 474, 9-25-89; Amended, Ord. 745, 7-26-04, Ord. 860, 10-6-11)
b. The City may, at its option, require a cash contribution in lieu of dedication or
require a portion of the required dedication be in land and a cash contribution in lieu for
the balance thereof. Cash payments received shall be placed in a special fund and used
only for the acquisition and development or improvement of parks, recreational facilities,
playgrounds, trails, wetlands, public open space, redevelopment or rehabilitation of
existing facilities or sites or debt retirement in connection with land previously acquired
or improvements thereto previously constructed for such public purpose. No funds shall
be used for ongoing operation or maintenance of existing parks or recreational facilities
or sites. (Amended Ord. 860, 10-6-11)

contribution, the City, must give due consideration to the open space, park, recreational
or common areas and facilities open to the public which the subdivider has reserved for
the subdivision; except, that storm water holding areas or ponds, whether required by the
City or any other regulatory body, will not be taken into consideration. (Amended,
Ord 745, 7-26-04, Ord. 860, 10-6-11)
Subd. 2. Determination of Dedication Procedure: Upon receipt of a qualifying subdivision,
the Council shall refer it to the Parks and Recreation Commission1. Said Commission
shall report to the Council its dedication recommendation. Upon receipt of the
recommendation, the Council shall call for either a land dedication, a cash payment or a
combination of the two, in size, location or amount, as it determines. The Council may
require a professional appraisal to determine market value for purposes of a cash
payment, the cost of which shall be paid by the subdivider. (Amended,
Ord. 860, 10-6-11)

Subd. 3. Credit for Existing Single-Family Dwelling: The subdivider of any parcel of land
shall receive a credit for an existing single-family dwelling unit by excluding the acreage
of the occupied parcel remaining after subdivision from the computation of dwelling
units per acre if the parcel of land is zoned for single-family residence and has located
thereon one single-family dwelling.
Subd. 4. Dedication Amount: A reasonable portion of the land of any proposed subdivision
or its equivalent in cash shall be dedicated by the subdivider for public use. Up to ten
percent (10%) of the buildable land of the proposed subdivision or its equivalent in cash
based on the fair market value shall constitute a reasonable portion for dedication
purposes under this section. The exact portion of land or its equivalent amount in cash
shall be established by the City based on the following factors: (Amended,
Ord. 860, 10-6-11)
• Type of the proposed subdivision land use: residential, industrial or commercial;
• The need for open space generated by the proposed subdivision;
• Existence of land dedicated for public use within the proposed subdivision,
excluding areas reserved as storm water holding ponds;
• Fair market value of the land;
• Other relevant factors unique to a particular subdivision supporting the need for
dedication of lands for public use.
If an equivalent amount in cash from the subdivider for part or the entire portion required
to be dedicated is to be paid by the subdivider, such amount is due no later than at the
time of final approval of the proposed subdivision. (Ord. 604, 1997; Amended,
Ord. 745, 7-26-04)
Subd. 5. Dedication for Re-Subdivision: For any subdivision of a parcel on which a cash
dedication for parks has previously been made but on which an additional cash dedication
is required due to re-subdivision, the amount of cash dedication required on the
re-subdivided parcel(s) shall be based on the market value of the buildable land at the
time of re-subdivision and the factors set forth in subdivision 4 of this Section less any
applicable credit for the prior cash dedication. (1988 Code §42.13) (Ord. 604, 1997;

subdivider may appeal the imposition of dedication fee to the district court within sixty
(60) days of the approval of the subdivision application. The subdivider must give
written notice to the City regarding a proposed fee dispute prior to the final decision on
the proposed subdivision. Upon receiving the notice, the City shall place the disputed fee
amount in an escrow and shall continue processing the subdivision application as if the
fee had been paid. The City must not condition the approval of any proposed subdivision
on the subdivider’s waiver of the right to challenge the dedication fee. If the subdivider
fails to appeal the dedication fee within sixty (60) days of the subdivision approval, or if
the subdivider does not prevail on the appeal, the funds paid into escrow will be
transferred to the City. (Added, Ord. 745, 7-26-04, Amended, Ord. 860, 10-6-11)

1205.01: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS: Exceptions, variances or modifications of
the strict application of this Chapter may be granted in case of planned unit developments;
provided, the Council, upon review and recommendation from the Planning and Zoning
Commission, shall find that the proposed development is fully consistent with the purpose and
intent of this Title. A planned unit development shall be considered any development which

1205.02: VARIANCES: The Council may grant a variance of these subdivision regulations
in any particular case where the subdivider can show that, by reason of unique circumstances
relating to a specific lot, the strict compliance with these regulations imposes unusual hardship to
the subdivider in the use of his or her land. Unusual hardship includes, but is not limited to,
inadequate access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems. A variance may be granted only if
the Council finds that all of the following circumstances exist: (1988 Code §42.15) (Amended,
Ord. 861, 9-22-11)
Subd. 1. The variance is in harmony with the general purposes and intent of these regulations.
Subd. 2. The variance is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
Subd. 3. The subdivider proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not permitted
by these regulations or the City Zoning Ordinance.
Subd. 4. Unique circumstances apply to the property which do not apply generally to other
properties in the same zone or vicinity and result from lot size or shape, topography or
other circumstances over which the owner of the property since the enactment of these
regulations has had no control. That the unique circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
Subd. 5. The variance does not alter the essential character of the neighborhood.
Subd. 6. That the variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the
unusual hardship. Economic conditions alone do not constitute unusual hardship.
Subd. 7. The Council may impose such conditions upon the premises benefited by the
variance, as may be necessary to comply with the standards established by this section or
to reduce or minimize the effect of such variance upon other properties in the
neighborhood, and to better carry out the intent of the variance. The condition must be
directly related to and must bear a rough proportionality to the impact created by the
variance. (Amended, Ord. 861, 9-22-11)

1301.01 1301.02
1301.01: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE:
Subd. 1. Statutory Authorization: The Legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in
Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter 462, delegated to local government units
the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the
Mounds View City Council does ordain as follows in this Chapter:
Subd. 2. Findings of Fact:
a. The flood hazard areas in the City are subject to periodic inundation that results in
potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
b. Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. The City bases this Chapter on a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards that is consistent with the standards set by
the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources “(DNR)”.
c. National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. The City adopts this Chapter to
meet the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified
as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the City’s
eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
Subd. 3. Statement of Purpose: It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare and to minimize the losses described above in
Section 1301.01, subdivision 2 a by the provisions contained herein.
1301.02: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
Subd. 1. Lands to Which this Chapter Applies: This Chapter shall apply to all lands in
Mounds View shown on the Official Zoning Map and/or the attachments thereto as being
within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe, or General Flood Plain Districts.
Subd. 2. Establishment of Official Zoning Map: The City hereby adopts by reference the
Official Zoning Map, together with all materials attached thereto, and declares the Zoning
Map to be a part of this Chapter. The attached materials shall include the Flood
Insurance Study for Ramsey County, Minnesota (All Jurisdictions) and Flood Insurance
Rate Map panels therein numbered 27123C0004G, 27123C0005G and 27123C0010G, all
dated June 4, 2010 as prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
The Official Zoning Map and attached materials shall be on file in the Offices of the City
Administrator and the Community Development Director.
City of Mounds View
1301.02 1301.02
Subd. 3. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The regulatory flood protection elevation
shall be an elevation no lower than one (1) foot above the elevation of the regional flood
plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that
result from designation of a floodway.
Subd. 4. Interpretation:
a. In their interpretation and application, the City and all users of this Chapter shall
hold the provisions of this Chapter to be the minimum requirements and shall liberally
construe the provisions in favor of the City or other regulating agency. In addition, no one
shall deem any of the provisions of this Chapter a limitation or repeal of any other powers
granted by State or Federal statutes.
b. The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on
the Official Flood Plain Zoning Map. The Planning Commission shall make
interpretations about exact location of the boundaries of a district as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the
Community Development Director. All decisions will be based on elevations on the
regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time
the City adopted its initial floodplain regulations or on the date of the first National Flood
Insurance Program map showing the area within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and
other available technical data. The City shall give persons contesting the location of the
district boundaries a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Planning
Commission and to submit technical evidence.
Subd. 5. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: The City does not intend by this Chapter to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
However, where this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Chapter
shall prevail. In all cases, the provisions of Chapter 1010, wetland zoning regulation and
the City surface water management plan (subject to subsequent revisions) shall be
considered more restrictive than this Chapter. The City hereby repeals all other
regulations or ordinances inconsistent with this Chapter to the extent of the inconsistency
only.
Subd. 6. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This Chapter does not imply that areas
outside the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free
from flooding or flood damages. This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the
City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that result from reliance on
this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
City of Mounds View
1301.02 1301.02
Subd. 7. Severability: If a court of competent jurisdiction decides that any section, clause,
provision, or portion of this Chapter is unconstitutional or invalid, then the decision shall
not affect the remainder of this Chapter.
Subd. 8. Definitions: For the purposes of this Chapter, the following terms, phrases, words
and their derivations shall have the meanings listed in this Chapter. When not
inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future, words in
the plural number include the singular number and words in the singular number include
the plural number. The word “shall” is always mandatory and is not discretionary.
a. Accessory Use or Structure: A use, building or structure on the same lot with, and
of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use, building or
structure.
b. Basement: Any area of a building or structure, including crawl spaces, having its
floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of
excavation below ground level.
c. Conditional Use: A specific type of structure or land use listed in the City Code
that the City Council may allow but only after an in-depth review and with conditions or
restrictions as provided in the City Code and upon a finding that:
(1) Certain conditions as detailed in the City Code exist; and
(2) The structure or land use conforms to the City’s Comprehensive Plan and if the
City decides the proposed use is compatible with nearby land uses and with the
existing neighborhood.
d. Equal Degree of Encroachment: A method of determining the location of floodway
boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream, creek or watercourse are
capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.
e. Flood: A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream, creek or watercourse
or in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.
f. Flood Frequency: The frequency that a person can expect that a specific flood stage
or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.
g. Flood Fringe: That part of the flood plain outside of the floodway. The term “flood
fringe” is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood Insurance
Study for Ramsey County, Minnesota (All Jurisdictions).
City of Mounds View
1301.02 1301.02

areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse that a regional flood has or hereafter may
cover.
i. Flood Proofing: A combination of structural provisions, changes, or adjustments to
properties and structures subject to flooding, primarily for the reduction or elimination of
flood damages.
j. Floodway: The bed of a wetland or lake and the channel of a watercourse and those
portions of the adjoining flood plain that is reasonably required to carry or store the
regional flood discharge.
k. Lowest Floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including a basement).
The City does not consider an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area as
the building’s lowest floor.
l. Manufactured Home: A structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, that is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed and constructed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured
home” does not include the term “recreational vehicle.”
m. Obstruction: Any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment,
projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile,
refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel,
watercourse, or regulatory flood plain that may impede, retard, or change the direction of
the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water.
n. Principal Use or Structure: The main or primary use of land or buildings that are
not subordinate accessory uses or structures.
o. Reach: A hydraulic engineering term used to describe a longitudinal segment of a
stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction. In an urban area, the
segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most
typically constitute a reach.
City of Mounds View
1301.02 1301.02
p. Recreational Vehicle: A vehicle that is: (1) built on a single chassis, (2) four
hundred (400) square feet or less of floor area when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck,

quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this
Chapter, the term “recreational vehicle” shall be synonymous with the term “travel
trailer/travel vehicle.”
q. Regional Flood: A flood that is representative of large floods known to have
occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what a person could
expect to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year recurrence
interval. The term “regional flood” is synonymous with the terms "base flood," “1-
percent annual chance” or “100-year flood elevation.”
r. Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: An elevation no lower than one (1) foot
above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by
encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a floodway.
s. Structure: Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground
or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached
garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption
criteria specified in Section 1301.09, subdivision 3, a of this Chapter and other similar
items.
t. Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost
of restoring the structure to the condition before the damage occurred would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
City of Mounds View
1301.02 1301.02
u. Substantial Improvement: Within any consecutive 365-day period, any
reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after
damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred
“substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not
include however, any:
(1) Project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or
local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by the
local code enforcement official or other City official and are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
(2) Alteration of an “historic structure,” if the alteration would not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as an “historic structure.” For the purpose of this
Chapter, “historic structure” shall be as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations,
Part 59.1. (There are no known historic structures in Mounds View).
v. Variance: A modification of a permitted development standard required in the City
Code (including this Chapter) to allow an alternative development standard not stated as
acceptable in the City Code, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of
alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined in the City
Code.
Subd. 9. Annexations: The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference in
Section 1301.02, subdivision 2 of this Chapter may include floodplain areas that lie
outside of the corporate boundaries of Mounds View at the time the City adopts this
Chapter. If the City annexes any of these floodplain land areas into the City after the date
it adopts this Chapter, the newly annexed floodplain lands shall be subject to the
provisions of this Chapter immediately upon the date of annexation into the City of
Mounds View.
City of Mounds View
1301.03 1301.03
1301.03: ESTABLISHMENT OF OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS:
Subd. 1. Districts: The City establishes the following overlay zoning classifications within
the City:
a. Floodway District. The Floodway District shall include those areas designated as
“Zone AE”, “Zone AH” and “Zone A” on the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted
in Section 1301.02, subdivision 2 of this Chapter that are below the ordinary high water
level as defined in Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.005, subdivision 14.
b. Flood Fringe District. The Flood Fringe District shall include those areas
designated as “Zone AE”, “Zone AH” and “Zone A” on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
panels adopted in Section 1301.02, subdivision 2 of this Chapter that are below the one
percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation) but above the
ordinary high water level as defined in Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.005,
subdivision 14. (See Section 1301.06 of this Chapter for the procedures to determine the
one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation)).
Subd. 2. Compliance: No person shall use a new structure or land and no person shall
construct, locate, extend, convert or structurally alter a structure without meeting the
terms of this Chapter and all other applicable rules and regulations. Within the
Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Flood Plain Districts, the City prohibits all uses not
listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in Sections 1301.04 and 1301.05 that follow,
respectively. In addition, the following provisions shall apply:
a. New manufactured homes, replacement manufactured homes and certain travel
trailers and travel vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this Chapter and to the
standards in Section 1301.09 of this Chapter.
b. Modifications, additions, structural alterations, normal maintenance and repair, or
repair after damage to existing nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of
structures or land are regulated by the general provisions of this Chapter and to the
standards in Section 1301.11 of this Chapter.
c. As-built elevations for elevated or flood-proofed structures must be certified by
ground surveys. A licensed professional engineer or architect must design and certify
flood-proofing techniques as specified in the general provisions of this Chapter and as
stated in Section 1301.10 of this Chapter.
City of Mounds View
1301.04 1301.04
1301.04: FLOODWAY DISTRICT (FW): The permitted and conditional uses listed below
are only allowable in the Floodway District if not prohibited by any other underlying zoning
district classifications of the City and if not prohibited by any applicable state or federal law.
The City does not allow community-wide structural works or projects in the Floodway District
for flood controls that are intended to remove areas from the regulatory flood plain.
Subd. 1. Permitted Uses:
a. General farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, and wild
crop harvesting.
b. Boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, and
fishing areas.
c. Residential uses such as lawns, gardens, parking areas and play areas.
Subd. 2. Standards for Floodway District Permitted Uses:
a. The use shall have low flood damage potential.
b. The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district.
c. The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and shall not
involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of materials or equipment.
Subd. 3. Conditional Uses: The conditional uses listed below are only allowable in
Floodway District if not prohibited by any other underlying zoning district classification
of the City and if not prohibited by applicable state or federal law. The City requires a
conditional use permit approved by the City Council for each use. The City or the
property owner must record the conditional use permit against the title of the property in
the Ramsey County Recorder’s office.
a. The extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials.
b. Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water control structures.
c. Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines, and pipelines.
d. The placement of fill.
City of Mounds View
1301.04 1301.04 (Rev. 5/10)
Subd. 4. Standards for Floodway District Conditional Uses:
a. All Uses. The City will not allow fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposits,
obstructions, or other similar uses as a conditional use that would cause any increase in
the stage of a 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damage in the
reach or reaches affected.
b. All conditional uses in the Floodway District shall be subject to the procedures and
standards set forth in Section 1301.10 subdivision 4 of this Chapter.
c. The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying City zoning district.
d. Fill, subject to the following standards:
(1) The property owner or contractor shall protect fill, dredge spoil, and all other
similar materials that they deposit or store in the flood plain from erosion by
vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other method acceptable to the City.
(2) The City does not allow dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations in the
Floodway District unless the owner or operator submits a long-term site
development plan to the City that includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention
element to the plan.
(3) As an alternative, and consistent with Subsection (2) above, dredge spoil
disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill
or other materials that would have caused an increase to the stage of 100-year or
regional flood. The City will only allow such storage only if City has received a
plan that assures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the
available time after a flood warning. The City or the property owner must record
the conditional use permit against the title of the property in the Ramsey County
Recorder's Office.
e. Storage of Materials and Equipment. The City may allow the storage of other
materials or equipment if readily removable from the area in the time available after a
flood warning and according to a plan approved by the City. The City prohibits the
storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or
potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life.
City of Mounds View
1301.05 1301.05
1301.05: FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF):
Subd. 1. Permitted Uses: The permitted uses in the flood fringe district are all those uses of
land or structures listed in Title 1100 of the City Code as permitted uses in the underlying
zoning district(s). All permitted uses must meet the standards for Flood Fringe District
“Permitted Uses” listed in Section 1301.05, subdivision 2 set forth below and the
"Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses" listed in Section 1301.05, subdivision 5 of this
Chapter.
Subd. 2. Standards for Flood Fringe District Permitted Uses:
a. All structures in the Flood Fringe district, including accessory structures, must be
elevated on fill so that the lowest floor (including the basement floor) is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no
lower than one (1) foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation. The fill shall
extend at such elevations at least fifteen (15) feet beyond the outside limits of the
structure on the property.
City of Mounds View
1301.05 1301.05
b. As an alternative to elevation on fill, owners of accessory structures in the flood
fringe that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed five hundred (500)
square feet in area may flood proof such structures according to the following standards:
(1) Owners shall not intend, design, nor construct accessory structures for human
habitation.
(2) Accessory structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry flood proofed
according to the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classifications in the Minnesota State
Building Code. As an alternative, an owner may flood proof an accessory structure
to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing classification in the Minnesota State Building
Code. For a detached garage, the owner must use the detached garage solely for
parking of vehicles and limited storage. All flood proofed accessory structures
must meet the following additional standards:
(a) Accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed and
constructed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;
(b) All mechanical and utility equipment in the accessory structure must
be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or
properly flood proofed; and
(c) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a
minimum of two (2) “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the
accessory structure having a total net area of not less than one (1) square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There
must be openings on at least two (2) sides of the structure and the bottom
of all openings must be no higher than one (1) foot above the lowest
adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a
garage door before flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic
openings.
c. The cumulative placement of fill on a parcel where at any one time is in excess of
one thousand (1,000) cubic yards shall be allowed only as a conditional use, unless said
fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure to meet the requirements of
Section 1301.05, subdivision 2 of this Chapter.
d. Property owners and users shall store or park any materials or equipment on fill to
an elevation at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation.
e. The provisions of Section 1301.05, subdivision 5 of this Chapter shall apply.
City of Mounds View
1301.05 1301.05
Subd. 3. Conditional Uses: The City shall only allow structures that are not elevated on fill
or flood proofed according to Sections 1301.05, subdivision 2a and 2b of this Chapter
and or any use of land that does not meet the standards in Sections 1301.05,
subdivision 2c and 2d as a conditional use. An application for a conditional use permit
shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in
Sections 1301.05, subdivision 4 and subdivision 5 and 1 in 1301.10, subdivision 4 of this
Chapter, those standards and procedures set forth in Title 1100 of the City Code and
elsewhere in the City Code.
City of Mounds View
1301.05 1301.05
Subd. 4. Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:
a. An owner may use alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill to
elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These
alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or abovegrade,
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The City shall consider
the base or floor of an enclosed area above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest
floor if: 1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one (1) side of the structure; 2) it
is designed and constructed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant
materials; and 3) the owner uses it solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following
additional standards:
(1) Design and Certification: A licensed professional engineer or architect must
certify that the structure's design and as-built condition meets the general design
standards of the Minnesota State Building Code. Specifically, all electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service
facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be
designed and constructed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating in
these components during times of flooding.
(2) Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas: Owners and contractors
shall design and construct above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or
tuck under garages to internally flood with design and construction plans that
stipulate:
(a) A minimum area of automatic openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a
minimum of two (2) openings on at least two sides of the structure and the
bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade.
The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than
one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding unless a licensed professional engineer or architect certifies that a
smaller net area would suffice. The owner or contractor may equip the
automatic openings with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or
devices if such devices permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters
without any form of human intervention; and
(b) That the enclosed area will be designed and constructed of flood
resistant materials in accordance with the standards of the FP-3 or FP-4
classifications in the Minnesota State Building Code and that the owner or
occupants shall only use such areas for building access, vehicle parking or
storage.
City of Mounds View
1301.05 1301.05
b. Basements, as defined by Section 1301.02, subdivision 8, b. of this Chapter, shall
be subject to the following requirements:
(1) The City does not permit residential basement construction below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
(2) The City may permit non-residential basements below the regulatory flood
protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood proofed
according to the standards listed in Section 1301.05, subdivision 4 c (below) of this
Chapter.
c. All areas of non-residential structures (including basements) that would be below
the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood proofed to meet the structurally
dry flood proofing classifications in the Minnesota State Building Code. Structurally dry
flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classification in the Minnesota
State Building Code. This flood proofing shall require making the structure watertight
with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
the effects of buoyancy. The City does not allow structures in the flood fringe that the
owners have flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification in the Minnesota State
Building Code. The City does not allow residential structures in the flood fringe that the
owners have dry-flood proofed to the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classification in the
Minnesota State Building Code.
d. When at any one time a property owner or contractor wants to locate more than one
thousand (1,000) cubic yards of fill or other similar material on a parcel for activities
such as on-site storage, landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge
spoil disposal or construction of flood control works, the owner or contractor shall submit
an erosion/sedimentation control plan to the City for approval. The plan must clearly
specify methods that an owner or contractor shall use to stabilize the fill on site for a
flood event at a minimum of the 100-year or regional flood event. A registered
professional engineer must prepare the plan. The plan may incorporate alternative
procedures for removal of the material from the flood plain if adequate flood warning
time exists.
e. Storage of Materials and Equipment:
(1) The City prohibits the storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant
life.
(2) The City may allow the storage of other materials or equipment if they would
be readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning

f. The provisions of Section 1301.05, subdivision 5 (below) of this Chapter also shall
apply.
Subd. 5. Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses:
a. All new principal structures in the flood fringe district must have vehicular access at
or above an elevation not more than two (2) feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If the City approves a variance from this requirement, the City must specify
limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding. In
order to approve a variance from this requirement, the City must determine that adequate
flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
b. Commercial Uses: Accessory commercial land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks,
and parking lots (if allowed by the underlying City zoning designation) may be at
elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, the City shall
not approve a permit for such facilities for use by employees or by the general public in
the absence of a flood warning system. Such a flood warning system shall provide
adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such
that when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product
number exceeds four (4) upon occurrence of the regional flood.
c. Manufacturing and Industrial Uses: Owners and operators of manufacturing and
industrial uses shall take measures to minimize the interference of normal plant
operations from flooding, especially those sites along streams or creeks that have
protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots
may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in Section 1301.05,
subdivision 5 b above. In considering development or permit applications for
manufacturing or industrial uses, the City shall give due consideration to the needs of an
industry whose business requires that it be located in flood plain areas.
d. Contractors shall properly compact fill and properly protect the slopes by using
riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable methods. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood
hazard area designation for structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood
elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope
protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. The owner or
contractor should investigate these standards before starting the site preparation if
requesting a change of special flood hazard area designation.
e. Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the
channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where
the City has not specified a floodway or other encroachment limit on the Official Zoning
Map.

f. Section 1301.09, subdivision 3 of this Chapter lists the standards for the placement
and use of recreational vehicles in the Flood Fringe District.
g. Owners and contractors shall securely anchor all manufactured homes to an
adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of overthe-
top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable
state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
1301.06: PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING ONE PERCENT ANNUAL CHANCE
FLOOD ELEVATIONS (100-YEAR FLOOD ELEVATIONS) IN AREAS LOCATED IN
ZONE A OF THE FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP PANELS:
Subd. 1. Reserved for Future Use.
Subd. 2. Procedures for determining one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevations
(100-year flood elevations) in Zone A.
a. Upon receiving an application for a permit or other approval for a parcel located
within Zone A of the Flood Insurance Rate Maps, the Community Development Director
or City Engineer will use the one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation for that
basin that has previously been determined according to approved FEMA methods, if
available. If the one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation has not been previously
determined, the applicant shall be required to furnish all necessary information as deemed
necessary by the Community Development Director or the City for the determination for
the one percent annual chance flood elevation according to approved FEMA methods.
b. The applicant shall be responsible to submit one (1) copy of the above information
to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in
determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District and to
determine the one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation).
The owner, engineer and contractor shall follow the procedures consistent with
Minnesota Rules, Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part
65 in this expert evaluation. The City encourages the designated engineer or expert to
discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the Minnesota Department
of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist before starting the analysis.
c. Once the one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation)
has been determined, the Community Development Director or the City Engineer shall
process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of Sections
1301.04 and 1301.05 of this Chapter.

1301.07: SUBDIVISIONS:
Subd. 1. Review Criteria: No person or owner shall subdivide land that the City decides is
unsuitable for building or is unsuitable for new construction because of flooding,
inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. The City shall approve
all subdivision requests (subject to the requirements in Title 1100 (zoning) and Title 1200
(subdivisions)) to ensure that all lots within the flood plain districts would have a
building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation. All subdivisions shall have access to public water and to the City sanitary
sewer system and facilities that meet the provisions of this Chapter. All subdivisions
shall have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no
lower than two (2) feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all
subdivisions in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District boundaries, the applicant, owner or
project engineer shall clearly label the regulatory flood protection elevation and the
required elevation of all access roads on all subdivision drawings and platting documents.
Subd. 2. Procedures for determining one percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation
(100-year flood elevation) in Zone A: In a designated Zone-A area, applicants shall
provide the information required in Section 1301.06, subdivision 2 of this Chapter to
determine the 100-year flood elevation and the regulatory flood protection elevation for
the subdivision site.
Subd. 3. Removal of Special Flood Hazard Area Designation: The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood
hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the one
percent (1%) annual chance flood elevation (100-year flood elevation). FEMA's
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for
multi-structure or multi-lot developments. The applicant, owner or contractor should
investigate these standards before starting site preparation if requesting a change of
special flood hazard area designation.

have the property owner or responsible party correct the violation to the degree possible.
c. The Community Development Director shall notify the suspected responsible party
or property owner of the requirements of this Chapter and all other official controls and
the nature and extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure or use is
under construction or development, the Community Development Director may order the
owner or contractor to stop immediately all construction or development activities until
the City grants a permit or approval for the proposed construction or development. If the
owner, contractor or developer has already completed the construction or development,
then the City or the Community Development Director may either:
(1) Issue an order identifying the corrective actions that the owner or responsible
party must make within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into
compliance with the official controls; or
(2) Notify the responsible party to apply to the City for an after-the-fact
permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed
thirty (30) days.

1301.12 1301.13
d. If the responsible party does not respond to the City or to the Community
Development Director within the specified period of time, each additional day that lapses
shall constitute an additional violation of this Chapter and the City shall prosecute the
responsible party accordingly. Upon the lapse of the specified response period, the City
or the Community development Director shall notify the responsible party or landowner
to restore the land or structure to the condition that existed before the violation of this
Chapter.
1301.13: AMENDMENTS:
Subd. 1. The flood plain designation on the City Flood Plain Zoning Map shall not be
removed from flood plain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or
that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the regulatory flood protection
elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the flood plain. The Commissioner of the
Department of Natural Resources may approve special exceptions to this requirement if
the Commissioner determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately
protected for the intended use.

SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE MANAGEMENT
AND DEVELOPMENT CONTROL1
SECTION:
1302.01: Findings of Fact
1302.02: Purpose and Applicability of Provisions
1302.03: Definitions
1302.04: Local Water Management Plan

1302.07: Variances and Appeals
1302.08: Responsibility
1302.09: Violations and Penalty
1302.01: FINDINGS OF FACT:
Subd. 1. The public interest necessitates sound land use development as land is a limited and
irreplaceable resource and the land within the Municipality is a resource to be developed
in a manner which will result in minimum damage to the quality of life and to property
and threat to health and reductions of private and public economic loss caused by
drainage problems.
Subd. 2. The existing drainage system in Mounds View, in general, adequately meets the
needs of the City. However, the storm drainage system will not, in the future, provide
adequate or proper drainage in those areas of the City subject to substantial residential,
commercial or industrial development unless the large increase in storm water runoff that
is known to result from such development is properly controlled and regulated. The
consequence of not restricting such increase in runoff would be to subject a major portion
of the lands of the City to high water tables, drainage problems, storm water flooding by
heavy rains, inadequate drainage facilities, causing erosion, damage to property,
disruption of residential, commercial and governmental services, unsanitary conditions
and interruptions of transportation, all of which would be detrimental to the health,
safety, welfare and property of affected residents of the City. (Ord. 507, 4-27-92)

1302.02: PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY OF PROVISIONS:
Subd. 1. Purposes:
a. The efforts of the City's water management programs are to prevent flooding and
improve water quality through the best possible utilization of wetlands and artificial
detention areas. Wetland management, as opposed to preservation, will allow the City to
maintain the integrity of its wetlands while improving water quality and reducing the City
maintenance efforts.
b. To guide and control new development of lands within the City in ways that will be
consistent with the zoning laws2 and Comprehensive Development Plan in force at the
time of the development, consistent with the requirements of Rice Creek Watershed
District, Municipal Code, Minnesota Statutes and other regulatory agencies and
consistent with sound economic policies as such policies affect property owners and the
proponents of new developments and to require proponents of new developments to
adopt sound development plans and proposals that will cause no economic burden both as
to storm waters or drainage on the owners of abutting or adjoining properties or affected
properties or on the property owners of the City at large.
Subd. 2. Applicability:
a. The requirements adopted herein shall apply to all development proposals that are
subject to the provisions of Section 1006.06 of this Code.

1302.05: REQUIRED FACILITIES:
Subd. 1. Facilities Required: The City may, as its sole discretion, require retention and/or
detention areas and associated water quality improvement structures for any development
proposal to meet conveyance systems.
Subd. 2. Performance Guarantee: Whenever privately owned and maintained drainage
improvements shall be required for a development by the City, the developer shall
provide a seven (7) year maintenance/performance guarantee to assure proper
maintenance and operation of such improvements. In such cases, the developer shall also
hold the City harmless for any defect in design, construction or operation.
Subd. 3. Financial Responsibility: Drainage facility improvements required for any
development proposal shall be the financial responsibility of the developer.
(Ord. 507, 4-27-92)
1302.06: DESIGN STANDARDS: Storm sewer system required for any development shall
be constructed to at least a five (5) year frequency storm design; retention basins shall be
constructed to retain at lease a 100-year storm while allowing, at a maximum, the amount of
runoff from the property that will occur in its undeveloped state resulting from a five (5) year
storm. (Ord. 507, 4-27-92)

1302.07 1302.09 (Rev. 4/92)
1302.07: VARIANCES AND APPEALS:
Subd. 1. Processing of Application: Any application for variances or appeals shall be
processed according to the procedures specified in Title 1100 of this Municipal Code3.
Subd. 2. Restrictions on Granting Variances: No variance may be granted which would
allow any use that is prohibited in the zoning district in which the property is located or
which would:
a. Result in incompatible land uses or which would be detrimental to the protection of
surface and ground water supplies.
b. Increase the financial burdens imposed on the community through increasing floods
and overflow of water onto land areas within this City or onto land areas adjacent to Rice
Creek.
c. Be not in keeping with land use plans and planning objectives for the City or which
would increase or cause danger to life or property.
d. Be inconsistent with the goals, policies and development guidelines of the Local
Water Management Plan dated February 12, 1990, subject to subsequent revisions.
Subd. 3. Required Supporting Data: No permit or variance shall be issued unless the
applicant, in support of the application, shall submit engineering data, surveys, site plans
and other information as the City may require in order to determine the effects of such
development on the affected land and water area. (Ord. 507, 4-27-92)
1302.08: RESPONSIBILITY: Neither the issuance of a permit nor compliance with the
conditions thereof nor the provisions of this Chapter shall relieve any person from any
responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damages to persons or property nor shall the
issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability on the Municipality or its officers
or employees for injury or damage to person or property. A permit issued pursuant to this
Chapter shall not relieve the permittee of the responsibility of complying with any other
requirements established by law, regulation or ordinance. (Ord. 507, 4-27-92)
1302.09: VIOLATIONS AND PENALTY: Any person who violates the provisions of this
Chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Each day during which said violation exists is a
separate offense. Any violation of this Chapter is a public nuisance and may be enjoined by civil
action. Costs of any civil enforcement shall be assessed against the party so enjoined. Any
person who, in violation of this Chapter, alters, changes or modifies any surface water drainage
facilities shall restore such facilities to their original condition within the time limit set by the
Council. (Ord. 507, 4-27-92)

permission shall be located, if possible, in the streets or portion of the streets and public
places as shall be approved by the City. The Company shall, upon completion of any
work requiring the opening of any street or public place, or during construction if ordered

a. Whenever the City shall grade, regrade or change the line of any street or public
place or construct or reconstruct any public utility system therein and shall, in the proper
exercise of its police power, and with due regard to seasonable working conditions, when
necessary order the Company to relocate its facilities at its own expense. The City shall
give the Company reasonable notice of plans to grade, regrade or change the line of any
street or public place or to construct or reconstruct any public utility system therein.
b. The Company shall be required to relocate its facilities at its own expense where
grade changes are made by the City for improved drainage or improved traffic conditions,
provided, however, if a subsequent relocation or relocations shall be ordered because of a
grade change within ten (10) years from and after the first relocation, the City shall
reimburse the Company for such nonbetterment relocation expense which the Company
may incur on a time and material basis. If subsequent relocations are required because of
the extension of public utilities to previously unserved areas, the Company may be
required to relocate at its own expense at any time.
c. Any relocation, removal, or arrangement of any Company facilities made necessary
because of the extension into or through the City of a federally aided highway project

and expense resulting therefrom are first paid to the Company.
d. Nothing contained herein shall relieve any person, persons or corporations from
liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring the
Company’s facilities while performing any work connected with grading, regrading or
changing the line of any street or public place or with the construction or reconstruction
of any public utility system.
e. Where the City orders the Company to relocate any of its facilities, the Company
shall proceed with such relocation. If such relocation is done without an agreement first
being made as to who shall pay for the relocation cost, such relocation of the facilities by
the Company shall not be construed as a waiver of its right to be reimbursed for the
relocation cost. If the Company claims that it should be reimbursed for such relocation
costs, it shall notify the City within ten (10) days after receipt of such order.
City of Mounds View
1401.01 1401.01
Subd. 8. Notice to Company of Street Improvements:
a. The City shall give the Company reasonable written notice of plans for street
improvements where paving or resurfacing of a permanent nature is involved, which
notice shall contain the nature and character of the improvements, the streets upon which
the improvements are to be made, the extent of the improvements and the time when the
City anticipates that it or its contractor is going to start the work and, if more than one
street is involved, the order in which this work is to proceed. Paving or resurfacing of a
permanent nature refers only to Portland Cement concrete or high type bituminous.
b. The notice shall be given to the Company a sufficient length of time, considering
seasonable working conditions, in advance of the actual commencement of the work to
permit the Company to make any additions, alterations or repairs to its facilities deemed
necessary by it and the Company assumes full responsibility for liability associated with
its maintenance and repair activities.
c. In cases where streets are at final width and grade, the City has installed
underground public utility mains and service connections to the property line abutting the
streets prior to a permanent paving or resurfacing of such streets, and the Company’s
main is located under such paved surface of the street, the Company shall be required to
install gas service connections and reasonable main extensions prior to such paving or
resurfacing, whenever it can reasonably be expected that gas service will be required
during the five years following the paving or resurfacing.
d. Once notice has been given by the City to the Company in accord with this
subdivision, the City may modify its plans. The Company shall make reasonable inquiry
to ascertain the status of previously announced City plans.
Subd. 9. Location of Facilities:
a. All mains, services, governors and other property and facilities shall be so located,
constructed, installed and maintained as not to endanger or unnecessarily interfere with
the usual and customary trade, traffic, travel upon and use of the streets and public places
of the City. The Company shall keep and maintain all of its property in good conditions,
order and repair so that the same shall not menace or endanger the life or property of any
person.
b. The Company shall provide field locations for all its underground facilities when
requested within a reasonable period of time. The period of time will be considered
reasonable if it compares favorably with the average time required by the cities in
Ramsey County to locate municipal underground facilities for the Company.
City of Mounds View
1401.01 1401.01
Subd. 10. Indemnification: The Company shall indemnity, keep and hold the City free and
harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property
occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair or operation of the Company’s
facilities located in, on, over, under or across the streets and public places of the City,
unless such injury or damage grows out of the negligence of the City, its employees, or
agents, or results from the performance in a proper manner of acts reasonably deemed
hazardous by the Company, but such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by
the City after notice of the Company’s determination. In the event the suit shall be
brought against the City under circumstances where the above agreement to indemnity
applies, the Company at its sole cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit if
written notice thereof is promptly given to the Company within a period wherein the
Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notices. If such notice is not reasonably given
as hereinbefore provided, the Company shall have no duty to indemnity nor defend. If
the Company is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have complete control
of such litigation, but the Company may not settle such litigation without the consent of
the City, which consent shall not be reasonably withheld.
Subd. 11. Franchise Fee: It is agreed by the City and Company that the City may at any time
during the term hereof impose on the Company, as full compensation for the rights
hereby granted, a franchise fee of not more than four percent (4%) of the Company’s
gross operating revenues, as hereinafter defined, such fee to be payable not later than
April 1 of each year and to be based upon the gross operating revenues of the Company
for the preceding calendar year or the part thereof after such fee becomes effective. Such
fee shall be imposed by ordinance duly adopted by a four-fifth’s (4/5) vote of the entire
Council, after a public hearing, pursuant to notice published in the official newspaper,
providing for at least ten (10) days’ notice prior to the hearing, and shall not become
effective until at least sixty (60) days after written notice thereof has been served upon
the Company by registered mail. The percent fee may be changed by the Council by
ordinance from time to time, however, each change shall meet the above notice, hearing,
and voting requirements and the percentage imposed must remain firm for at least one
year, and the total fee shall not exceed four percent (4%). Such ordinance shall not
prevent the Company from adjusting its charges in such manner as it deems appropriate
for the purpose or reimbursing the Company for the payments to be made to the City, and
the Company may indicate on its bills the customer’s portion of said fees. Such fee shall
not exceed any amount which the Company may legally recover prior to the payment to
the City by imposing a surcharge equivalent to such fee in its rates for gas service to
customers within the City. The term “gross operating revenues” means all sums,
excluding said surcharge, received by the Company from the sale of gas within the
corporate limits of the City. The foregoing time and manner of collecting said surcharge
is subject to the approval of the Minnesota Public Service Commission which the
Company agrees to use its best efforts to obtain.

Subd. 8. Relocating:
a. Whenever the City shall grade, regrade or change the line of any street or public
place or construct or reconstruct any public utility system therein and shall, in the proper
exercise of its police power, and with due regard to seasonable working conditions, when
necessary order the Company to relocate permanently its lines, services and other
property located in said street or public place, the Company shall relocate its facilities at
its own expense. The City shall give the Company, reasonable notice of plans to grade,
regrade or change the line of any street or public place or to construct or reconstruct any
public utility system therein.
b. The Company shall be required to relocate its facilities at its own expense where
grade changes are made by the City for improved drainage or improved traffic conditions,
provided, however, if a subsequent relocation or relocations shall be ordered because of a
grade change within ten (10) years from and after first relocation, the City shall
reimburse the Company for such non-betterment relocation expense which the Company
may incur on a time and material basis. If subsequent relocations are required because of
the extension of public utilities to previously unserved areas, the Company may be
required to relocate at its own expense at any time.
c. Any relocation, removal, or arrangement of any Company facilities made necessary
because of the extension into or through the City of a federally aided highway project
shall be governed by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Section 161.46 as
supplemented or amended; and further it is expressly understood that the right herein
granted to the Company is a valuable property right and the City shall not order the
Company to remove or relocate its facilities without compensation when a street or
public way is vacated, improved or re-aligned because of a renewal or a redevelopment
plan which is financially subsidized in whole or in part by the Federal government or any
agency thereof, unless the reasonable non-betterment costs of such relocations and the
loss and expense resulting therefrom are first paid to the Company.
d. Nothing contained herein shall relieve any person, persons or corporations from
liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring the
Company’s facilities while performing any work connected with grading, regrading or
changing the line of any street or public place or with the construction or reconstruction
of any public utility system.
e. Where the City orders the Company to relocate any of its facilities, the Company
shall proceed with such relocation. If such relocation is done without an agreement first
being made as to who shall pay for the relocation cost, such relocation of the facilities by
the Company shall not be construed as a waiver of its right to be reimbursed for the
relocation cost. If the Company claims that it should be reimbursed for such relocation
costs, it shall notify the City within ten (10) days after receipt of such order.
City of Mounds View
1402.01 1402.01
Subd. 9. Notice to Company of Street Improvements:
a. The City shall give the Company reasonable written notice of plans for street
improvements where paving or resurfacing of a permanent nature is involved, which
notice shall contain the nature and character of the improvements, the streets upon which
the improvements are to be made, the extent of the improvements and the time when the
City anticipates that it or its contractor is going to start the work and, if more than one
street is involved, the order in which this work is to proceed. Paving or resurfacing of a
permanent nature refers only to portland cement concrete or high type bituminous.
b. The notice shall be given to the Company a sufficient length of time, considering
seasonal working conditions, in advance of the actual commencement of the work to
benefit the Company to make any additions, alterations or repairs to its facilities deemed
necessary by it and the Company assumes full responsibility for liability associated with
its maintenance and repair activities.
c. In cases where streets are at final width and grade, the City has installed
underground public utility mains and service connections to the property line abutting the
streets prior to a permanent paving or resurfacing of such streets, and the Company’s
electric distribution feeder line is located under such paved surface of the street, the
Company shall be required to take such action as is necessary prior to such paving or
resurfacing of said electric distribution feeder line, whenever it can reasonably be
expected that electric service to new premises abutting such streets will be required
during the five years following the paving or resurfacing.
d. Once notice has been given by the City to the Company in accord with this section,
the City may modify its plans. The Company shall make reasonable inquiry to ascertain
the status of previously announced City plans.
Subd. 10. Location of Facilities:
a. All lines, services, transformers and other property and facilities shall be so located,
constructed, installed and maintained as not to endanger or unnecessarily interfere with
the usual and customary trade, traffic, travel upon and use of the streets and public places
of the City. The Company shall keep and maintain all of its property in good condition,
order and repair, so that the same shall not menace or endanger the life or property of any
person.
b. The Company shall provide field locations for all its underground facilities when
requested within a reasonable period of time. The period of time will be considered
reasonable if it compares favorably with the average time required by the cities in
Ramsey County to locate municipal underground facilities for the Company.
City of Mounds View
1402.01 1402.01
Subd. 11. Indemnification: The Company shall indemnity, keep and hold the City free and
harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property
occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair or operation of the Company’s
electric facilities located in, on, over, under, or across the streets and public places of the
City, unless such injury or damage grows out of the negligence of the City, its employees,
or agents, or results from the performance in a proper manner of acts reasonably deemed
hazardous by the Company, but such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by
the City after notice of the Company’s determination. In the event the suit shall be
brought against the City under circumstances where the above agreement to indemnity
applies, the Company, at its sole cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit if
written notice thereof is promptly given to the Company within a period wherein the
Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notices. If such notice is not reasonably given
as hereinbefore provided, the Company shall have no duty to indemnity nor defend. If
the Company is required to indemnity and defend, it will thereafter have complete control
of such litigation, but the Company may not settle such litigation without the consent of
the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Subd. 12. Franchise Fee: It is agreed by the City and Company that the City may at any time
during the term hereof impose on the Company, as full compensation for the rights
hereby granted, a franchise fee of not more than four percent (4%) of the Company’s
gross operating revenues, as hereinafter defined, such fee to be payable not later than
April 1 of each year and to be based upon the gross operating revenues of the Company
for the preceding calendar year or the part thereof after such fee becomes effective. Such
fee shall be imposed by ordinance duly adopted by a four-fifth’s (4/5) vote of the entire
Council, after a public hearing, pursuant to notice published in the official newspaper,
providing for at least ten (10) days’ notice prior to the hearing, and written notice thereof
has been served upon the Company by registered mail. The percent fee may be changed
by the Council by ordinance from time to time, however, each change shall meet the
above notice, hearing, and voting requirements add the percentage imposed must remain
in for at least one year, and the total fee shall not exceed four percent (4%). Such
ordinance shall not prevent the Company from adjusting its charges in such manner as it
deems appropriate for the purpose of reimbursing the Company for the payments to be
made to the City, and the Company may indicate on its bills the customers’ portion of
said fees. Such fee shall not exceed any amount which the Company may legally recover
prior to the payment to the City by imposing a surcharge equivalent to such fee in its
rates for electrical service to customers within the City. The term “gross operating
revenues” means all sums, excluding said surcharge, received by the Company from the
sale of electricity within the corporate limits of the City. The foregoing time and manner
of collecting said surcharge is subject to the approval of the Minnesota Public Service
Commission which the Company agrees to use its best efforts to obtain.

of the Company, succeed to all the rights and obligations of the City provided in this
franchise.
Subd. 14. Vacation of Public Ways: Except where required solely for a City improvement
project, the vacation of any street, alley, public way or public ground, after the
installation of electrical facilities, shall not operate to deprive the Company of its rights to
operate and maintain such electrical facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the
same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to the
Company.
Subd. 15. Written Acceptance: The Company shall, if it accepts this ordinance and the rights
and obligations hereby granted, file a written acceptance of the rights hereby granted with
the Clerk-Administrator within ninety (90) days after the passage of this ordinance.
