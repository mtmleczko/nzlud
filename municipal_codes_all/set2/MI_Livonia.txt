CODE OF ORDINANCES

A Codification of the General Ordinances 
of the City of Livonia, Michigan

PREFACE 
The Livonia Code of Ordinances, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1982, has been kept current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Mr. Harry C. Tatigian, city attorney. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 9.34.020 is Section .020, located in Chapter 9.34 of Title 9. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subject, and where they appear in the codification. 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the code up to date through Ordinance 2521, passed March 7, 2001.

PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete  (codification or recodification)  of the general and permanent ordinances of the  (City or Town)  of _______ . 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the _______ Code, as supplemented through _______, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the  (governing body)  . The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the _______ Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. [ATTORNEY CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING (New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5.) OR (New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers.)] Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: [ATTORNEY DELETE THE ONES THIS CODE WILL NEVER HAVE; LEAVE THE ONES THE CODE MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE.]

  (Index or Indexes)   
The   (index or indexes) (has or have)   been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the (index itself or indexes themselves) which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

PREFACE 
Numbering System 
Each section number in the Code consists of three component parts separated by periods. The first figure refers to the title number, the second figure refers to the chapter number, and the third figure refers to the posistion of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Title 4, Chapter 4.100 is numbered 4.100.010. Each code title may be subdivided into parts and each chapter may be divided into articles. When a title is divided into parts, the part number is reflected in the chapter numbers. For example, the first chapter of Division 2, Part 1 is numbered 2.110. When a chapter is divided into articles, the article number is reflected in the section numbers. For example, the first section of Title 2, Chapter 2.215, Article 1 is numbered 2.215.110. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.

2.04.010 - Title for citation. 
The ordinance codified in this chapter may be known and cited as "rules of the council." (Prior code § 2-101)  
2.04.020 - Purpose of chapter. 
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a fair, reasonable and efficient procedure for the conduct of such business as may properly come before the council; to ascertain and subserve the will of the council, rather than to restrain it; and facilitate, and not to obstruct, the expression of the council's deliberate sense. 
(Prior code § 2-102)  
2.04.030 - Construction of provisions. 
This chapter shall be construed liberally in such manner as to best effectuate its purpose. (Prior code § 2-103)  
2.04.040 - Meetings—Time—Adjournment. 
Regular and special meetings of the council shall be called and held as provided in Chapter IV of the City Charter. The council may adjourn any regular or special meeting to a later date certain, which adjournment shall not be beyond the time of the next regular meeting, and the adjourned meeting shall be considered as a continuation of the same regular or special meeting. Any postponement of a meeting for less than one (1) day shall be considered a recess. 
(Prior code § 2-104)

11.  Audience communications section; 
12.  Adjournment. 
B.  Items on the consent agenda shall be so designated at a study session of the council and shall be acted on collectively by one (1) roll-call vote rather than by a separate vote on each item. Such items shall be of a routine, noncontroversial nature but which require formal legal action by the council. There will be no discussion on consent-agenda items; however, any item may be removed from the consent agenda for a separate vote upon the request of any member of the council. Consent-agenda items shall be recorded in the official journal of the council individually and in full as if passed separately. 
C.  The following rules for addressing the city council at all meetings of council, including but not limited to regular meetings, study sessions and public hearings, shall govern such proceedings: 
1.  Members of the public at the meeting shall not speak until they are recognized by the chair; 
2.  Each person recognized by the chair to address the council shall identify himself/herself by name and, if appropriate, group affiliation; 
3.  A person addressing council on an item on the agenda shall be limited to two (2) minutes, unless the period of time is extended by a majority of the council present, and shall be recognized to speak prior to council's consideration of the item; 
4.  There will be an audience communications section of not more than thirty (30) minutes duration at the beginning of all council regular and study meetings where citizens may address the council. There will also be an audience communications section at the end of all regular and study council meetings where citizens may address council on any matter that is not on the agenda of that meeting. A person addressing council under the audience communications portion of the agenda will be limited to a total of three (3) minutes at each study or regular meeting unless the period of time is extended by a majority of the council present. Citizens who wish to expand upon their remarks will be asked to reduce the matter to writing and submit it to the city clerk, and such item may be placed on a future council study session for further consideration; 
5.  Persons addressing the council shall make responsible comments and shall refrain from making personal, impertinent, slanderous or profane remarks; 
6.  Any person causing a breach of the peace may be removed from the council meeting.

During the absence or disability of the vice-president, the council member who has served for the longest period of time shall have and exercise the powers and duties of the vice-president; provided, however, that if the longest time served is identical for more than one (1) member of the council, then of those members who have the same seniority that member who received the greatest number of votes at the last general election shall be determined at the time to succeed to the position of vice-president.

3.  "Seconded by Councilman _______," naming the particular member involved, means that "the last-mentioned motion was seconded" by said member. 
4.  "Adopted as follows:" means that a "roll call vote was duly taken on the question before the council and the ayes and nays votes of the members were recorded as follows:" and that "the president declared that the foregoing resolution or ordinance was adopted." 
5.  "A roll call vote was taken" means that a vote was taken as provided in Section 2.04.120. 
6.  "Adopted," when used immediately following the taking of a vote on a motion, means that said motion was duly passed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members who were named as present at the roll call of the meeting at which said motion was made, and that the president has declared that said motion was duly passed. 
7.  "Passed" means "adopted." 
8.  "Rejected" means that a motion, resolution or ordinance, as the case may be, failed to be adopted, a roll call vote on the same having been duly taken. 
9.  "Unanimously," when used immediately preceding the word "adopted" or the word "passed," means that the last-mentioned motion was passed by a roll call vote which resulted in the vote "aye" being duly received from each member named as present in the roll call at the opening of the meeting at which said motion was made and from each member who entered the meeting subsequent to such roll call and prior to the voting. 
10.  "Received and placed on file" means that the last-mentioned communication, report or petition was presented and read by the city clerk to the council, considered by the council, and ordered to be placed on file in the city clerk's office by an affirmative vote of the majority of the members then present. The decision of the council to place such communication, report or petition on file may be ascertained by roll call vote, on request of any member, or, in the absence of such request by the president announcing "In the absence of any objection, the communication, report or petition is received and placed on file." 
B.  The journal of each meeting shall show the full names of each councilman in the roll call at the opening of such meeting, but thereafter only the last name of the members need be used. The city clerk shall enter in the journal the exact time at which any member enters or leaves a meeting following such roll call. In the absence of any entry showing otherwise, it shall be conclusively presumed that each member named as present in the roll call remained continuously in the meeting until the same was duly adjourned. Any member of the council failing to vote on any matter upon which he may be required to vote shall be recorded as voting "aye" by the clerk. Whenever a vote is taken on any ordinance or on any resolution pertaining to the expenditure of money, appropriations or other financial matters, and in all instances at the request of any member, the "aye" or "nay" vote of each member shall be recorded.

Ordinary maintenance does not change the external appearance of the resource except through the elimination of the usual and expected effects of weathering. Ordinary maintenance does not constitute work for the purposes of this ordinance. 
23.  "Proposed historic district" means an area or group of areas, not necessarily having contiguous boundaries, that has delineated boundaries and that is under review by a committee or standing committee for the purpose of making a recommendation as to whether it should be established as a historic district or added to an established historic district.

27.  "Restoration" means the act or process of accurately recovering the form and details of a historic resource as it appeared at a particular period of time by means of the removal of later work or by the replacement of missing earlier work. 
28.  "Site" means a location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic, cultural, or archeological value regardless of the value of any existing structure. Some examples are: cemeteries, battlefields, petroglyphs, designed landscapes, and archaeological sites. 
29.  "Streetscape" means the distinguishing and pictorial character of a particular street as created by its width, degree or curvature and paving materials, design of the street furniture, significant vegetation, retaining walls, etc. 
30.  "Structure" is used to distinguish from buildings whose functional construction was usually for purposes other than creating human shelter. Some examples are: bridges, canals, dams, silos, windmills, power plants, boats and ships, and gazebos.

2.56.050 - Historic preservation commission—Creation and membership. 
Whenever the first historic district is established, a historic preservation commission shall be established. Such commission may consist of up to seven (7) members who reside in the city. Members shall be appointed by the mayor. Members shall be appointed for three-year terms. Members shall serve with compensation as recommended by the mayor and approved by the city council and shall be eligible for reappointment. In the event of a vacancy on the commission, interim appointments shall be made by the mayor to complete the unexpired term of such position. A commissioner may be terminated at the discretion of the mayor. A majority of the members shall have a clearly demonstrated interest in or knowledge of historic preservation. The commission may include one (1) or more of the following (if available): a graduate of a certified historic preservation program, a certified architectural historian, and/or a graduate of an accredited school of architecture who has two (2) years of architectural experience or who is an architect registered in Michigan. 
(Ord. 2828, § 1, 2009)  
2.56.060 - Commission—Powers and duties. 
A.  The commission shall review all permits for work on the exterior of historic resources and nonhistoric resources in a historic district. The owner of the resource, or any person, individual, firm or corporation authorized to act on behalf of the owner, shall make application for a permit which shall contain pertinent plans, samples of materials, photographs, site plans, etc. No permit or other authorization shall be granted until the commission issues a certificate of appropriateness or a notice to proceed. 
B.  The commission shall review and act only upon the exterior features of a resource and shall not review and act upon interior arrangements unless specifically authorized to do so by the city council or unless such interior work will cause visible change to the exterior of the resource. The commission shall not disapprove an application due to considerations not prescribed in subsections D. and E. 
C.  If an application is for work that will adversely affect the exterior of a historic resource or nonhistoric resource in a historic district the commission considers valuable to the city, state, or nation, and the commission determines that the alteration or loss of that resource will adversely affect the public purpose of the city, state, or nation, the commission shall attempt to establish with the owner of the resource an economically feasible plan for preservation of the resource. 
D.  In reviewing plans, the commission shall follow the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, as set forth in 36 C.F.R. part 67. Design review standards and guidelines that address special design characteristics of historic districts administered by the commission may be followed if they are equivalent in guidance to the Secretary of the Interior's standards and guidelines and are established or approved by the State Historic Preservation Office of the Michigan Historical Center. 
E.  In reviewing plans, the commission shall also give consideration to the following: 
1.  The historic or architectural value and significance of the historic resource and its relationship to the historic value of the surrounding area; 
2.  The relationship of any architectural features of such historic resource to the rest of the resource and to the surrounding area; 
3.  The general compatibility of the design, arrangement, texture and materials proposed to be used; 
4.  Any other factor, such as esthetic value, that the commission finds relevant. 
F.  After review of a permit using the criteria set forth in subsections D. and E. above, the commission will either issue: a certificate of appropriateness, a notice to proceed, or a denial of the permit. The commission will notify the building inspection department and the property owner or his/her representative in writing of its decision. All decisions will be kept on file by the commission. 
1.  A certificate of appropriateness is issued when the proposed work is appropriate and does not adversely affect a resource. 
2.  (a)  A notice to proceed is issued when the proposed work is inappropriate and adversely affects a resource, but the commission finds that the proposed work is necessary to substantially improve or correct one of four conditions listed in section 5(6) of 1992 PA 96 (MCL 399.205(6)): 
(i)  The resource is a hazard to public safety or the building's occupants. 
(ii)  The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of substantial benefit to the community and the applicant proposing the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning approvals, financing, and environmental clearances. 
(iii)  Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the owner when governmental action, an act of God, or other events beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner. 
(iv)  Retaining the resource is not in the best interest of the majority of the community. 
(b)  (i)  If the proposed work involves demolition of a historic resource, the commission shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of the application for a permit from the building inspection department to publicize the proposed demolition of the historic resource, and may make an effort to find a private or corporate purchaser interested in preserving the historic resource. Failing to find such a purchaser, the commission may then recommend that the city purchase the historic resource. At the discretion of the commission, the sixty-day waiting period may be waived. 
(ii)  Upon issuance of a notice to proceed, the commission shall notify the Livonia Historical Commission so that that body may consult with the owner about salvaging objects of historic significance from the historic resource. 
3.  A denial is issued when the proposed work is inappropriate. If a denial is issued, the specific reasons for the denial shall be given in writing to the director of building inspection and the applicant. Such denial is binding on the director of building inspection. 
G.  Upon the failure of the commission to act on the application within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of a complete application from the building inspection department, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the commission, the building inspection department shall proceed to process the application without regard to a certificate of appropriateness from the commission. 
H.  The commission may delegate the issuance of certificates of appropriateness for specific minor classes of work to its staff, to the building inspection department or to another delegated authority. The commission shall provide to the delegated authority specific written standards for issuing certificates of appropriateness under this subsection. On at least a quarterly basis, the commission shall review the certificates of appropriateness, if issued for work by its staff, the inspector, or another authority, to determine whether or not delegated responsibilities should be continued. 
I.  Upon a finding by the commission that a historic resource within a historic district or a proposed historic district subject to its review and approval is threatened with demolition by neglect, the commission may do either of the following: 
(1)  Require the owner of the resource to repair all conditions contributing to demolition by neglect. 
(2)  If the owner does not make repairs within a reasonable time, the commission or its agents may enter the property and make such repairs as are necessary to prevent demolition by neglect. The costs of the work shall be charged to the owner, and may be levied by the city as a special assessment against the property. The commission or its agents may enter the property for purposes of this section upon obtaining an order from the circuit court. 
J.  When work has been done upon a resource without a permit, and the commission finds that the work does not qualify for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission may require an owner to restore the resource to the condition the resource was in before the inappropriate work or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness. If the owner does not comply with the restoration or modification requirement within a reasonable time, the commission may seek an order from the circuit court to require the owner to restore the resource to its former condition or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness. If the owner does not comply or cannot comply with the order of the court, the commission or its agents may enter the property and conduct work necessary to restore the resource to its former condition or modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the court's order. The costs of the work shall be charged to the owner, and may be levied by the city as a special assessment against the property. When acting pursuant to an order of the circuit court, the commission or its agents may enter a property for purposes of this section. (Ord. 2595, 2003)  
2.56.070 - Other powers and duties of the commission. 
A.  The commission may recommend to the city council certain incentive programs to encourage preservation of historic resources and/or historic districts in the city. 
B.  The commission may accept, with the approval of city council, any grant, loan or aid of any character from federal, state or private sources, to be expended for the purposes contemplated by this chapter, including, but not limited to, the making of surveys of historic resources and/or sites, and the acquisition, restoration and possible resale of properties of historic or architectural significance. Such funds shall be administered in accordance with the Charter of the city, but a separate accounting shall be made of them and a copy of such accounting given to the council at least annually. 
C.  There may be appropriated in the annual budget of the city a sum of money which may be expended and accounted for by the commission in accordance with the City Charter and the Uniform Accounting Act of the State of Michigan. 
D.  The commission shall maintain a roster of historic resources, as designated by the city council, which shall include a description of the characteristics and location of the historic resources. (Ord. 2595, 2003)

The secretary shall keep an accurate record of the proceedings of the commission. 
B.  The commission may meet once every three (3) months. the chair of the commission may call a special meeting with the approval of the director of the department of community resources ("director") or the director's designee. 
C.  A majority of the members appointed to the commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of its business. The concurring affirmative vote of a quorum of the members shall constitute approval of plans before it for review, or for the adoption of any resolution, motion or other action of the commission. The commission shall annually draft goals and objectives it seeks to accomplish which shall be submitted to the mayor by March 31 of each year. The commission shall submit an annual written report of its activities to the mayor and city council by December 31 of each year. 
D.  The business that the commission may perform shall be conducted at a public meeting of the commission held in compliance with the Open Meetings Act, 1976 PA 267 (MCL 15.261 to 15.275). Public notice of the time, date, and place of the meeting shall be given in the manner required by the Open Meetings Act, 1976 PA 267 (MCL 15.261 to 15.275). A meeting agenda shall be part of the notice and shall include a listing of each permit application to be reviewed or considered by the commission. Any person or his/her duly constituted representative shall be entitled to appear and be heard on any matter before the commission before it reaches its decision. 
E.  The commission shall keep a record of its resolutions, proceedings, and actions. A writing prepared, owned, used, in the possession of, or retained by the commission in the performance of an official function shall be made available to the public in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act, 1976 PA 442 (MCL 15.231 to 15.246).

The city council may at any time establish by ordinance additional historic resources or historic districts, including proposed districts previously considered and rejected; may modify boundaries of an existing historic resource or district; or may eliminate an existing historic resource or district. Before establishing, modifying, or eliminating existing resources or districts, the city council shall establish a study or standing committee which shall, except as provided in subsection B., comply with the procedures set forth in section 2.56.100 and shall consider any previously written committee reports pertinent to the proposed action. To conduct these activities, the city council may establish a standing committee or establish a committee to consider only specific proposed districts or resources and then be dissolved. In addition, the city council may hire accredited consultants to conduct research in accordance with the State Historic Preservation Office's Manual of Historic and Architectural Surveys in Michigan and which meet the qualifications of 36 C.F.R. 67 for historian and architectural historian of the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation. Consideration shall also be given to whether the proposed consultant: (1) has experience and expertise in planning and implementing surveys of historic and cultural resources; (2) has experience and expertise in writing national register nominations for individual resources and historic districts; and (3) possesses the experience and expertise to comply with all city, state and federal regulations and restrictions. 
B.  If considering elimination of a historic district or resource, a committee shall follow the procedures set forth in section 2.56.100 for issuing a preliminary report, holding a public hearing, and issuing a final report but with the intent of showing one or more of the following: 
1.  The historic district or resource has lost those physical characteristics that enabled establishment of the district. 
2.  The historic district or resource was not significant in the way previously defined. 
3.  The historic district or resource was established pursuant to defective procedures. 
C.  Upon receipt of substantial evidence showing the presence of historic, architectural, archaeological, engineering, or cultural significance of a proposed historic district, the city council may, at its discretion, adopt a resolution requiring that all applications for permits within the proposed historic district be referred to the historic preservation commission and the commission shall review the permit applications with the same powers that would apply if the proposed historic resource/district was designated as such. The review may continue for not more than one (1) year, or until such time as the city council approves or rejects the establishment of the historic resource/district by ordinance, whichever occurs first. 
D.  If the city council, in consultation with the commission, determines that pending work will cause irreparable harm to resources located within an established historic district or a proposed historic district, the city council may by resolution declare an emergency moratorium of all such work for a period not to exceed six (6) months. The city council may extend the emergency moratorium for an additional period not to exceed six (6) months upon finding that the threat of irreparable harm to resources is still present. Any pending permit application concerning a resource subject to an emergency moratorium may be summarily denied. (Ord. 2595, 2003)

(Ord. 2595, 2003)  
2.56.130 - Historic resources—Variances for yards. 
Due to peculiar conditions of design and construction in historic districts where historic resources were often built close to the lot lines, and if it is in the public interest to retain the district's appearance by making variances to normal yard requirements, and where it is deemed that such variances will not adversely affect neighboring properties, the commission may recommend to the zoning board of appeals that such variance to standard yard requirements be granted. (Ord. 2595, 2003)  
2.56.140 - Exceptions to chapter applicability. 
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance, repair or sale of any historic resource within a historic district; nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to prevent the construction, alteration, repair, moving or demolition of any historic resource under a permit issued by the director of building inspection prior to the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter [Ord. 2595]. Nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to alter, amend or delete provisions of other city ordinances, or the City Charter pertaining to the administration, control or ownership of property owned by the city.

2.56.150 - Violation of ordinance; penalties.

As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meaning unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning or requires otherwise. 
1.  "Accumulated contributions" means the sum of all amounts deducted from the compensations of a member and credited to the member's individual account in the pension savings fund, together with regular interest thereon. 
2.  "Age" means for the purpose of determining voluntary retirement age, the chronological age of a person. Otherwise, age means age at nearest birthday. 
3.  "Average final compensation," effective December 1, 1970, means the average of the annual compensation received by a member during the best compensated three (3) years of service contained within the member's ten (10) years of service immediately preceding the member's retirement; provided, however, that with respect to members of the City Council, "average final compensation" means the average of the annual compensation received by a member during the best compensated three (3) years served prior to July 1, 1986 (to be known as figure 1), and the average annual compensation received by a member during the best compensated three (3) years served after July 1, 1986 (to be known as figure 2). 
In the event the member has less than three (3) years of total service, the member's average final compensation shall be the average of the annual compensation for the member's total years of service. Retirement benefits of members who retire on or after December 1, 1970, shall be based upon and computed according to the definition contained in this subsection and based upon the definition of "compensation" as defined in subsection 11 of this section or, in the alternative, shall be based upon and computed according to the definition of average final compensation and compensation in effect through November 30, 1970, whichever of the two (2) methods of compensation will result in a greater retirement benefit for the member. 
In those cases where an employee has worked less than one (1) year, and average final compensation must be computed for purposes of determining retirement benefits, it shall be computed by projecting earnings for the balance of the first year of employment at the same rate as earned from the date of initial employment to the date of the employee's last day actually worked. 
4.  "Anniversary Date" for the Defined Benefit Plan means November 30. 
5.  "Beneficiary" means any individual who has an insurable interest in the life of a member and who is being paid or is entitled to the future payment of benefits for reason other than the individual's membership in the retirement plan. 
6.  "Board" means the Board of Trustees provided for in this chapter. 
7.  "City" or "Employer" means City of Livonia, State of Michigan, and its various offices, boards and departments, including the Livonia City Council and Retirement Board. 
8.  "Civil Service Commission" means the Civil Service Commission of the City. 
9.  "Civil service position" means any position in City employment or classified service that comes under the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission. 
10.  "Code" or "IRC" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as now or hereafter amended, or as superseded by laws of similar effect. 
11.  "Compensation" means the compensation received from the City by a person for service rendered to the City. Effective December 1, 1970, for the purpose of computing average final compensation, compensation shall be defined as including base salary or wages, longevity payments, shift-differential payments, paid time off, holiday pay, payment of accumulated vacation time up to the limits established by the respective collective bargaining agreement or as authorized by the Civil Service Commission and City Council, merit pay (Police), Paramedic/EMT pay (Fire), Education Premium/Incentive, Worker's Compensation wage loss benefits with supplemental pay not to exceed regular base wages, bonus in lieu of promotion (Fire), and any other financial compensation from which pension contributions are withheld.

1.  An amount which, if paid annually by the City during the prospective service of members, will be sufficient, together with the expected net future contributions of members, to cover the actuarial present value of pensions allocated to service rendered after the beginning of the fiscal year; and 
2.  An amount which, if paid annually by the City over a period selected by the Board but not more than thirty (30) years, will be sufficient, together with present fund balances, to cover the actuarial present value of pensions allocated to service rendered before the beginning of the fiscal year. 
C.  The City Council shall appropriate each year such amounts of contributions as determined in subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection (B) of this section, and the City shall pay such amounts into the pension accumulation fund during the ensuing fiscal year, which payments shall be made quarterly during said fiscal year.

Each monthly retiree payroll shall be confirmed at regular meetings of the Board of Trustees. Any changes in the retiree's pension [except for the change occurring at age sixty-five (65)] resulting from amendments to the retirement system or for any other reason shall necessitate an additional authorization by three (3) members of the Board of Trustees in the first instance only, and thereafter said authorization may be made upon the signature of the chairperson or the chairperson pro-tem.

D.  Refunds of accumulated contributions provided for herein may be made according to such rules and regulations as the Board shall from time to time adopt; provided, however, that in any case refunds of accumulated contributions shall be made in full within forty-five (45) calendar days of the date of termination of the employee.

If the member or retiree's entire interest is to be distributed in other than a lump sum, then the amount to be distributed each year must be at least an amount equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the member or retiree's entire interest by the life expectancy of the member or retiree or joint and last survivor expectancy of the member or retiree and the designated beneficiary. Life expectancy and joint and last survivor expectancy are computed by the use of the return multiples contained in Section 1.72-9 of the Income Tax Regulations. For purposes of this computation, a member or retiree's life expectancy may be recalculated no more frequently than annually; however, the life expectancy of a non-spouse beneficiary may not be recalculated. If the member or retiree's spouse is not the designated beneficiary, the method of distribution selected must assume that at least 50 percent of the present value of the amount available for distribution is paid within the life expectancy of the member or retiree. 
2.  Distributions to all members or retirees must commence no later than the first day of April following the calendar year in which the later of termination of employment or age 70 ½ occurs. 
C.  Death distribution provisions. Upon the death of the member or retiree, the following distribution provision shall take effect: 
1.  If the member or retiree dies after distribution of his or her interest has commenced, the remaining portion of such interest will continue to be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used prior to the member or retiree's death. 
2.  If the member or retiree dies before distribution of his or her interest commences, the member or retiree's entire interest will be distributed no later than five (5) years after the member or retiree's death, except as follows: 
a.  If any portion of the member or retiree's interest is payable to a designated beneficiary, distribution may be made in substantially equal installments over the life or the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, or over a shorter period of time as provided in this chapter, commencing no later than one (1) year after the member or retiree's death; 
b.  If the designated beneficiary is the member or retiree's surviving spouse, the date distributions are required to begin in accordance with (2)(a) above shall not be earlier than the day on which the member or retiree would have attained age 70 ½, and if the spouse dies before payments begin, subsequent distribution shall be made as if the spouse had been the member or retiree. 
3.  For purposes of subsection (C)(2) above, payments will be calculated by the use of return multiples specified in Section 1.72-9 of the Income Tax Regulations. Life expectancy of a surviving spouse may be recalculated annually; however, in the case of any other designated beneficiary, such life expectancy will be calculated at the time payment first commences without further recalculation. 
D.  With respect to distributions under the plan made for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, the plan will apply the minimum distribution requirements of IRC Section 401(a)(9) in accordance with the regulations under IRC Section 401(a)(9) that were proposed in January 2001, notwithstanding any provision in the plan to the contrary. This amendment shall continue in effect until the end of the last calendar year beginning before the effective date of final regulations under Section 401(a)(9) or such other date as may be specified in guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service. (Ord. 2583, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.96.409 - Benefit limits. 
Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, any benefit payable under this system shall not exceed the limits set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 415 and Regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference. (Ord. 2583, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.96.410 - Errors and adjustments. 
Should any change in the records result in any member, beneficiary or retiree receiving from the retirement system more or less than ordinarily would have been received had the records been correct, the Board shall correct such error, and as far as practicable, shall adjust the payment in such manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, beneficiary or retiree was correctly entitled shall be paid. (Ord. 2583, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.96.411 - Eligible rollover distributions. 
This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee as a direct rollover. The following definitions shall apply with regard to this section: 
A.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more, and any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under IRC Section 401(a)(9). For purposes of the direct rollover provision, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in IRC Section 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified plan described in IRC Section 401(a) or 403(b) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
B.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in IRC Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in IRC Section 408(a), annuity plan described in IRC Section 403(a), an annuity contract described in IRC Section 403(b), an eligible plan under IRC Section 457 which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan, or a qualified trust described in IRC Section 401(a), that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relations order. 
C.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the surviving spouse. 
D.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the retirement system to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. (Ord. 2583, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.96.412 - Maximum annual earnings. 
For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, and before July 1, 1996, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account for determining all benefits provided under the plan for any determination period shall not include any amounts in excess of the annual compensation limit (originally $200,000.00) provided for in IRC Section 401(a)(17) prior to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA '93") and adjusted for inflation in the manner provided by IRC Section 401(a)(17). For plan years beginning on or after July 1, 1996, the annual compensation of each employee taken into account shall not exceed the annual compensation limit provided for in IRC Section 401(a)(17), as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA '93") ($200,000.00 in 2002). This limit may be adjusted as required by federal law for qualified government plans and shall be further adjusted for inflation in the manner provided by IRC Section 401(a)(17). Annual compensation means compensation during the plan year or such other consecutive 12-month period over which compensation is otherwise determined under the plan. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. (Ord. 2583, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.96.413 - Military service. 
Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with IRC Section 414(u) and regulations. (Ord. 2583, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.96.414 - Vesting. 
Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary, a member shall be 100 percent vested in his/her accrued benefit when he or she attains normal retirement age. (Ord. 2583, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.96.420 - Assignment of pension or other benefits prohibited. 
The right of a person to a pension, to the return of accumulated contributions, the pension itself, any optional benefit, any other right accrued or accruing to any member, retiree or beneficiary under the provisions of this chapter, and the moneys belonging to the retirement system, shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any other process of law, and shall be unassignable, except as is specifically provided in this chapter or pursuant to a support order in accordance with Act No. 295 of the Public Acts of 1982 (MCLA 552.601, et seq.); provided, that the City shall have the right to set off for any claim arising from embezzlement by or fraud of a member. (Ord. 2583, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.96.430 - Amendment of chapter provisions—Retroactivity limitation. 
No amendments to this chapter unless otherwise provided, shall serve to increase any pensions which are being paid as of the date of any such amendment to any retiree or beneficiary. (Ord. 2583, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.96.440 - Cost-of-living allowance. 
An additional cost-of-living allowance will be paid to all retirees. The monthly amount is determined as follows: 
A.  General employee members retiring on or after December 1, 1986; police employee members retiring on or after December 1, 1991; and fire employee members retiring on or after December 1, 1993: 
1.  $20.00 per month for one (1) year period commencing one (1) year after retirement.

If the cause of death was not duty related, the beneficiary shall be paid the vested percent of the member's fixed account, and if not vested, then all of the member's contributions plus accumulated earnings thereon.

2.97.180 - Retirement Board—Authority and responsibility. 
The administration, management and responsibility for the proper operation of the DC Plan, and for interpreting and making effective the provisions of the Retirement Ordinance are vested in the Retirement Board. The Retirement Board shall have power to construe this chapter, and any such construction made in good faith shall be final and conclusive.

The sum of such contributions for all years of service are subject to the Code Section 415 limits. Investment of the voluntary contributions shall be directed by the member. Any contributions made by a member shall, in all events, be the independent voluntary act of such member and shall not be dependent upon or alter or affect the obligations of or contributions by the City except as otherwise provided herein. 
B.  Method of contribution. Each member may make such voluntary contributions only by periodic payroll withholdings. The member shall deliver written instructions to the Finance Director expressing such intent. Same shall indicate the specific amount per payroll period to be voluntarily contributed.

C.  Administration of Voluntary Employee Contributions. Upon the Plan Administrator's receipt of such voluntary contributions, the Plan Administrator shall establish a voluntary contribution account for such member. Same shall have periodic memorandum credits and debits made to it to reflect the amounts of voluntary contributions and the allocation of net earnings or losses from investments. This adjustment shall be for earnings and re-evaluation of assets in the same manner as City contributions. The adjusted voluntary contribution accounts shall at all times be fully vested and nonforfeitable. The withdrawal of part of such amounts from the trust shall be permitted once during the plan year. All withdrawals of such amounts from the trust must consist of a pro rata portion of voluntary contributions and net earnings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, while the member is employed by the City, withdrawals from the voluntary contribution account shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate of voluntary contributions made by the members. No forfeiture shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of such withdrawal. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.230 - Assignments prohibited. 
A.  The right of an individual to a pension, to a refund of accumulated member contributions, the pension itself, or any other right accrued or accruing to any individual, and the moneys and assets of the DC Plan, shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law, or other process of law, except as specifically required by State of Michigan or federal law and shall be unassignable except as provided in subsection (B) or (C) of this section, or as required by state or federal law. 
B.  If an individual is covered under a group health insurance or prepayment plan participated in by the City, and makes a permitted election to continue such coverage as a retired member or as a beneficiary, the individual may authorize the Plan Administrator to deduct from the individual's payments such amount as required to continue coverage under such group health insurance or prepayment plan and in the event said member or beneficiary fails to pay a required premium for a group health insurance plan, the premium due shall be deducted by the Plan Administrator at the direction of the Retirement Board from the member's DC account. 
C.  The prohibition of subsection (A) shall not apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable to a member pursuant to a domestic relations order, provided such order is determined by the Retirement Board to be in accordance with the Eligible Domestic Relations Order Act, MCL 38.1701, June 27, 1991 ("EDRO Act"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Retirement Board determines such order is an "Eligible Domestic Relations Order" ("EDRO") and if the Retirement Board determines that the EDRO applies to a member in the DC Plan and requires payment before the member would have otherwise been entitled to payment, the Retirement Board shall make distribution to the "alternate payee" identified in the EDRO from the DC Plan only effective as of the first day of the month following the month that the domestic relations order was determined to be an EDRO, or the first day of the month following the month that a benefit is payable under the later of the date set out in the EDRO or the EDRO Act.

(Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.240 - Correction of errors—Power to amend. 
A.  The Plan Administrator shall correct errors in the records of the DC Plan upon direction from the Retirement Board. The Retirement Board shall seek to recover overpayments and shall make up underpayments from funds specifically designated for the DC Plan. Recovery of overpayments may be accomplished by reducing the amount of future payments so that the actuarial present value of actual payments to the recipient is equal to the actuarial present value of the payments to which the recipient was correctly entitled. 
B.  Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code, at no time can moneys designated for the DB Plan be commingled or used to offset liabilities of the DC Plan. Likewise, at no time can moneys designated for the DC Plan be commingled or used to offset liabilities of the DB Plan. 
C.  The City Council, with approval of the Civil Service Commission, reserves the right to amend this chapter. The City Council, with approval of the Civil Service Commission, specifically reserves the right to amend the DC Plan retroactively in order to comply with Code Section 401(a). No reason is necessary for the amendment, regardless of whether: (1) for reasons of business necessity; or (2) for the purpose of causing the DC Plan and trust to qualify, and continue to qualify under the Code as set forth in the recitals. No such amendment, except upon written consent, shall increase the duties or liabilities of the Retirement Board, or deprive any member or beneficiary of any then vested equitable interest in the DC Plan. A decision of the City Council and Civil Service Commission shall, except in the absence of good faith, be binding upon the members, beneficiaries, and all other persons interested, as to whether or not any amendment does deprive a member or any other person of any vested interest already existing or does adversely affect such interest. In no event shall any amendment have the effect of vesting in the City any right, title or interest to any assets held as part of the trust. Any amendment shall be effective when published as required by ordinance enactment provisions. If the City Council and Civil Service Commission amends or has amended the vesting schedule, the percentage then nonforfeitable or vested shall not be reduced as a result of such amendment. Any general employee member hired before March 17, 1997, and any general employee member hired on or after March 17, 1997, with four (4) years of service determined at the end of the election period or any police employee member hired before November 24, 1998 and any police employee member hired after November 24, 1998, with four years service determined at the end of the election period or any fire employee member hired before July 1, 1998 and any fire employee member hired after July 1, 1998, with four (4) years service at the end of the election period or any police lieutenant/sergeant or police command employee member promoted or hired before October 2, 1999, and any police lieutenant/sergeant or police command employee promoted or hired after October 2, 1999, with four (4) years service at the end of the election period shall have an irrevocable election to have the nonforfeitable percentage of the accrued benefit derived from City contributions. Such election shall commence on the date the amendment was adopted and shall terminate no later than sixty (60) days after the later of: (i) the effective date of the amendment; (ii) the date of adoption of the amendment to the vesting schedule; or (iii) the date each member who is eligible to make such election receives written notice of the amended vesting schedule becoming operational. 
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, a member's provisional account may be reduced to the extent permitted under Code Section 412(c)(8). For purposes of this paragraph, a plan amendment which has the effect of decreasing a member's provisional account or eliminating an optional form of benefit, with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing an accrued benefit. Further, no amendment to the DC Plan shall have the effect of decreasing a member's vested interest determined without regard to such amendment as of the later of the date such amendment is adopted or the date it becomes effective. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.250 - Internal Revenue Code qualification. 
A.  The City intends the DC Plan to be a qualified pension plan under Code Section 401, and that the trust be an exempt organization under Code Section 501. The City Council and Civil Service Commission may adopt such additional provisions to the DC Plan as are necessary to fulfill this intent. 
The City shall not be entitled to receive or recover any part of its contributions to the trust or the earnings thereof unless the Retirement Board determines that an overpayment was made to the trust. 
B.  Retirement benefits provided under this ordinance shall not exceed the governmental plan limits set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 415 and the regulations thereunder. 
C.  The corpus of income of the trust may not be diverted to or used for other than the exclusive benefit of the members or their beneficiaries. 
D.  The required beginning date of distributions to a member shall be the later of April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the member attains age 70 ½ or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee retires from employment with the City, the State of Michigan or any of its political subdivisions. With respect to distributions under the Plan made for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, the Plan will apply the minimum distribution requirements of IRC Section 401(a)(9) in accordance with the regulations under IRC Section 401(a)(9) that were proposed in January 2001, notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary. This amendment shall continue in effect until the end of the last calendar year beginning before the effective date of final regulations under Section 401(a)(9) or such other date as may be specified in guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service. 
E.  In the event of termination or partial termination of this DC Plan, the rights of all affected employees to benefits accrued to the date of such termination or partial termination (to the extent funded as of such date) shall be nonforfeitable. 
F.  For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, and before July 1, 1996, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account for determining all benefits provided under the Plan for any determination period shall not include any amounts in excess of the annual compensation limit (originally $200,000.00) provided for in IRC Section 401(a)(17) prior to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA '93") and adjusted for inflation in the manner provided by IRC Section 401(a)(17). For plan years beginning on or after July 1, 1996, the annual compensation of each employee taken into account shall not exceed the annual compensation limit provided for in IRC Section 401(a)(17), as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA '93") ($200,000.00 in 2002). This limit may be adjusted as required by federal law for qualified government plans and shall be further adjusted for inflation in the manner provided by IRC Section 401(a)(17). Annual compensation means compensation during the plan year or such other consecutive twelve (12) month period over which compensation is otherwise determined under the Plan. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. 
G.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with IRC Section 414(u) and regulations. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.260 - Severability. 
This chapter shall be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan. Wherever necessary, pronouns of any gender shall be deemed synonymous, as shall singular and plural pronouns. The table of contents and the headings of sections and paragraphs are included solely for convenience and shall not affect, or be used in connection with, the interpretation of this chapter.

2.97.280 - Eligible rollover distributions. 
A.  This section applies to distributions made on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Notwithstanding any provision of the DC Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Finance Director and the Retirement Board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
B.  Definitions. 
1.  "Eligible rollover distribution" means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; and any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under IRC 401(a)(9). For purposes of the direct rollover provision, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in IRC Section 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified plan described in IRC Section 401(a) or 403(b) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
2.  "Eligible retirement plan" means an individual retirement account described in IRC Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in IRC Section 408(a), an annuity plan described in IRC Section 403(a), an annuity contract described in IRC Section 403(b), an eligible plan under IRC Section 457 which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan, or a qualified trust described in IRC Section 401(a), that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relations order. 
3.  "Distributee" means and includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under an eligible qualified domestic relations order, as defined in MCL 38.1701, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.

A member who continues in the employ of the City past voluntary retirement age shall remain a member in the DC Plan for all purposes, and shall be fully vested in the account balance and in any subsequent additions upon attaining voluntary retirement age but no retirement benefits shall be payable to the member until actual retirement. At the time of the member's actual retirement, benefits shall be paid to the member as if the member had retired on the voluntary retirement date except that the member's actual retirement date shall be substituted for any reference to the voluntary retirement date. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.380 - Termination of employment. 
A.  The Retirement Board shall determine the nonforfeitable interest of a member who terminates employment for reasons other than death, disability, or attainment of voluntary retirement age. Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as allowing the forfeiture of a member's otherwise nonforfeitable benefits for cause. 
B.  That part of a member's account that the person is not entitled to under subsection (A) shall be allocated as a forfeiture as soon as administratively feasible after the distribution date but as of the valuation date immediately preceding the distribution date. 
In the event the terminated member dies before receiving his/her nonforfeitable fixed account, same shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.97.360. If any former member who is re-employed by the City and such former member received, or was deemed to have received, a distribution of the entire vested interest before re-employment, the forfeited account shall be reinstated only if the person repays the full amount distributed before the earlier of five (5) years after the first date on which the member is subsequently re-employed by the City or in the event of a deemed distribution, upon the re-employment of such former member. In the event the former member does repay the full amount distributed, or in the event of a deemed distribution, the undistributed part of the member's account must be restored in full, unadjusted by any gains or losses occurring subsequent to the anniversary date or other valuation date coinciding with or preceding the member's termination. The source for such reinstatement shall first be any forfeitures occurring during the plan year. If such source is insufficient, then the City shall contribute an amount necessary to restore any such forfeited accounts. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.390 - Death. 
If a member dies after termination of employment, but before distribution of the member's fixed account, the fixed account shall be distributed to the member's designated beneficiary. The amount shall be 100 percent of the member's account balance. Distributions shall be made within sixty (60) days after the member died unless the Plan Administrator receives conflicting claims, in which case distributions shall be made only upon receipt of a court order or upon agreement of the claimants. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.400 - Investment options. 
Each member shall advise the Plan Administrator how the member wants the City contribution account invested. If a member fails to notify the Plan Administrator, it shall be presumed that said member has elected that the City contribution account be invested at the direction of the Plan Administrator. If a member wishes to utilize more than one fund, the member shall notify the Plan Administrator of the percentage of the City contribution account to be invested in each fund, and, except as provided in the last paragraph of this section, such percentage must either be in exact multiples of 1 percent or whole dollar amounts or such other multiples determined by the Plan Administrator maintaining the records of each member's accounts. 
A member of the DC Plan may change the election of investment funds, subject to rules of the Plan Administrator as to frequency, provided that all members are treated uniformly. 
The City Council shall adopt such rules and procedures as it deems advisable as to all matters relating to the selection and use of the investment funds. If there is any inconsistency between such rules and any provisions above, the above provisions shall be disregarded.  
2.97.410 - Duration—Termination—Assumption. 
A.  Duration. This DC Plan shall continue until its assets have been paid out and distributed. 
B.  Termination—Assumption. It is the City's present intention to permanently maintain the DC Plan and continue to make contributions provided, however, that: 
1.  The DC Plan shall automatically terminate upon the City's legal dissolution, or upon its adjudication as bankrupt or insolvent, or upon its making a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or upon a receiver being appointed for its assets. 
2.  In the event of any termination, partial termination, or complete discontinuance of contributions, the City and the Plan Administrator shall give prompt notice thereof to the commissioner of Internal Revenue; and, subject to subsection (C) below, each member's account shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable. In the case of a partial termination, this paragraph shall apply only to that portion of the DC Plan terminated. 
C.  Liquidation of Retirement System. In the event of the DC Plan's termination, the Plan Administrator shall liquidate all investments and determine the value of each member's account under Section 2.97.350, Fixed Accounts, as of the date of termination as follows: 
1.  Adjustment shall be made to each account to cover any expenses of distribution and final liquidation. The Plan Administrator shall pay the balance of each member's account as described in Section 2.97.360. 
2.  Before making any payments, distributions or assignments, however, the Plan Administrator and its legal counsel, shall first be paid their expenses and charges incident to the operation of the trust and the termination thereof, by the City. If the City does not pay such expenses and charges, the Plan Administrator shall have a lien on the cash or other property remaining in its hands, the assets distributable to the members being liable for a pro rata share thereof until the Plan Administrator and their counsel have been paid, provided that said expenses and charges shall be subject to approval by the City Council. 
3.  In any event, the Plan Administrator shall not be required to make any distributions until written evidence of approval by the commissioner of Internal Revenue of such termination and distribution has been submitted to the Plan Administrator. 
D.  Termination of DC Plan. Notwithstanding termination of the DC Plan, the trust shall terminate when and if, but not until, the trust fund has been entirely paid out and distributed in accordance with this chapter. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.420 - Execution of instruments. 
A.  Any instrument or document to be provided by the City shall be properly executed if executed in the name of the City by any officer or officers thereof, or where provided by the Retirement Board, if executed as follows: 
1.  If executed in the Retirement Board's name by either the treasurer or secretary of the Retirement Board; and 
2.  In the case of any corporate trustee (whether or not the sole trustee), if executed as trustee in the name of the corporation under its corporate name by any officer or officers thereof, provided further, that any interested parties shall be fully protected in relying upon any instrument or document so executed and, such execution shall be conclusive proof that any signature is duly authorized and that any such information is true and correct. 
B.  City actions. Whenever the City is permitted or required to do or perform any act or execute any document, it shall be done, performed or executed by or at the direction of the City Council or by officers or authorized agents of the City, and may be evidenced by resolutions certified by the City Clerk. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.430 - Service in multiple capacities. 
Any person or group of persons may serve in more than one (1) fiduciary capacity as to this retirement system, specifically including service both as a trustee and as Plan Administrator. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.440 - Limitations on fiduciary liability. 
Nothing in this retirement system shall prevent a fiduciary from receiving any benefit that the person is otherwise entitled to as a member or beneficiary. However, the benefit must be computed and paid consistent with the terms of this retirement system as applied to all other members and beneficiaries. A fiduciary is also entitled to serve in this capacity in addition to being an officer, employee, agent, or other representative of any party-in-interest. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.450 Plan Administrator. 
When a Plan Administrator has been appointed by the City Council, the Plan Administrator is required to acknowledge in writing fiduciary responsibility with respect to the retirement system. 
In order to serve as a Plan Administrator an individual, partnership, company or corporation must qualify as: 
A.  A registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisor Act of 1940; or 
B.  A bank, as defined in that Act; or 
C.  An insurance company duly authorized to perform such services under the laws of more than one (1) state; or 
D.  Be an individual or business entity, whether a corporation, partnership or limited liability company whose primary profession is acting as an investment counselor and advisor. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.460 - Loans to members. 
A.  Availability of Loans to Members. 
1.  A member may apply for a loan from the Plan Administrator subject to the limitations and other provisions of this section. 
2.  The Finance Director shall establish written guidelines governing the granting of loans, provided that such guidelines are approved by the Retirement Board and are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, and that loans are made available to all members on a reasonably equivalent basis (as a percent of account balance). 
B.  Terms and Conditions of Loans to Members. Any loan by the DC Plan to a member under subsection (A) of this section shall satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  Availability. Loans shall be made available to all members on a reasonably equivalent basis. 
2.  Nondiscrimination. Loans shall not be made to highly compensated employees in an amount greater than the amount made available to other employees (as a percent of account balance). 
3.  Security and Interest Rate. Loans must be adequately secured and bear a reasonable interest rate. 
4.  Loan limit. No member loan shall exceed 50 percent of the member's vested account balance. 
5.  Foreclosure. In the event of default, acceleration of the note and attachment of security will not occur until a distributable event occurs in the DC Plan. 
6.  Reduction of Account. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the part of the member's vested account balance used as security held by the retirement system by reason of a loan outstanding to the member shall be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount of the account balance payable at the time of death or distribution. If less than 100 percent of the member's nonforfeitable account balance (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) is payable to the surviving spouse, then the account balance shall be adjusted by first reducing the nonforfeitable account balance by the amount of the security used as repayment of the loan, and then determining the benefit payable to the surviving spouse and other beneficiaries. 
7.  Amount of Loan. At the time the loan is made, the principal amount of the loan plus the outstanding balance (principal plus accrued interest) due on any other outstanding loans to the member by the retirement system shall be at least $1,000.00 and shall not exceed the least of: 
a.  Fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), reduced by the excess (if any) of: 
i.  The highest outstanding balance of loans from the retirement system during the twelve (12) month period ending on the day before the date that the loan is made, over 
ii.  The outstanding balance of loans from the retirement system on the date that such loan is made; or 
b.  The greater of: 
i.  Ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), or 
ii.  One-half of the value of the member's nonforfeitable interest in all accounts under this retirement system. 
For the purpose of the above limitation, all loans from all plans of the City and other members of a group of employers described in Code Sections 414(b), 414(c) and 414(m) and (o) are aggregated. 
8.  Application for Loan. The member must give the retirement system adequate written notice, as determined by the Retirement Board, of the amount and desired time for receiving a loan. No more than one (1) loan may be made by the Plan Administrator to a member in any calendar year. No loan shall be approved if an existing loan from the DC Plan to the member is in default to any extent. 
9.  Length of Loan. The terms of any loan shall require the member to repay the loan in substantially equal installments of principal and interest, at least monthly, over a period that does not exceed five (5) years from the date of the loan; provided, however, that if the proceeds of the loan are applied by the member to acquire any dwelling unit that is to be used within a reasonable time after the loan is made as the principal residence of the member, the five (5) year limit shall not apply. In this event, the period of repayment shall not exceed a reasonable period determined by the Plan Administrator. Principal installments and interest payments otherwise due may be suspended during an authorized leave of absence, if the promissory note so provides, but not beyond the original term permitted under this subsection, with a revised payment schedule (within such term) instituted at the end of such period of suspension. 
10.  Prepayment. The member shall be permitted to repay the loan in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity, without penalty. 
11.  Note. The loan shall be evidenced by a promissory note executed by the member and delivered to the Plan Administrator and shall bear interest at a reasonable rate determined by the Retirement Board. 
12.  Security. The loan shall be secured by an assignment of that part of the member's right, title and interest in and to the vested account. 
13.  Assignment or Pledge. Assignment or pledge of any part of the member's interest in the DC Plan shall be treated as a loan. 
14.  Other Terms and Conditions. The Plan Administrator shall fix such other terms and conditions of the loan as it deems necessary to comply with legal requirements, to maintain tax qualification of the retirement system under Code Section 401(a), or to prevent the treatment of the loan for tax purposes as a distribution to the member. The Retirement Board, in its discretion for any reason, may fix other terms and conditions of the loan, not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, in the event there is a dispute regarding a loan between the member and Plan Administrator, which terms and conditions shall be binding on both the member and Plan Administrator. 
15.  Member Loan Accounts. 
a.  Upon approval of a loan to a member by the Plan Administrator, an amount not in excess of the loan shall be transferred from the member's other investment fund(s) to the member's loan account as of the valuation date immediately preceding the agreed upon date that the loan is to be made. 
b.  The assets of a member's loan account may be invested and reinvested only in notes received by the Plan Administrator from the member as consideration for a loan permitted by this section or in cash. Uninvested cash balances in a member's loan account shall not bear interest. No person who is otherwise a fiduciary of the retirement system shall be liable for any loss, or by reason of any breach, that results from the member's exercise of such control. 
c.  Repayment of principal and payment of interest shall be made by payroll deduction or, where repayment cannot be made by payroll deduction, by check, and shall be invested in one (1) or more other investment funds, as of the next valuation date after payment thereof to the retirement system. The amount so invested shall be deducted from the member's loan account. 
d.  The Retirement Board shall have the authority to establish other reasonable rules, not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, governing the establishment and maintenance of member loan accounts. 
16.  Number of Loans. There shall be only one (1) outstanding loan for each member, and the loan may be refinanced by said member subject to the requirements of subsections (B)(1) through (15) of this section. (Ord. 2584, § 1 (part), 2002)  
2.97.470 - Disability plan. 
Participants in the Defined Contribution Plan shall also participate in a disability plan equivalent to the defined benefit disability plan as set forth in the Defined Benefit Retirement Plan Ordinance. The City's liability for the disability benefit shall be offset (1) by any amount which may be payable pursuant to the Worker's Disability Compensation Act, if applicable, and (2) by the lifetime annuity value of the employee's 401(a) Defined Contribution Retirement Account, determined as of the effective date of the employee's disability-related separation from service. The lifetime annuity value shall be determined by soliciting three quotations for straight life lifetime annuities from insurance companies rated A+ or better by A.M. Best Company, Inc. The quotation providing the largest annuity value will be selected for purposes of this calculation. Defined contributions shall include all contributions and income accumulated in the plan account whether derived by the contributions made by the employee or employer, including any amounts transferred into the Plan, but excluding voluntary employee contributions. The defined contribution will also include any amounts withdrawn from the 401(a) Plan or leveraged or levied by the employee for any reason, regardless of whether it was by court order or voluntary decision. The value of any withdrawn amounts shall be calculated as though they remained in the Plan and accrued income or value at the applicable rate of the remainder of the employee's assets in the Plan.

2.200.010 - Preamble. 
A.  Public office and employment are public trusts. The vitality and stability of Livonia city government depends upon maintaining public confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed officers and employees. Whenever conduct undermining that integrity occurs, either actual or perceived, public confidence is jeopardized. 
B.  In furtherance of maintaining public confidence in the integrity of its elected and appointed officers and employees, the government of the City of Livonia has a duty to pronounce standards of ethical conduct which: 
1.  Insure public duties are forthrightly and ethically performed; and 
2.  Inform city officials and employees of the standards which the citizenry expects them to observe. 
C.  The purpose of this chapter is to publish standards of ethical conduct that are clearly established and uniformly applied. These standards will provide the public and city officials and employees with guidance and information about ethical expectations. (Ord. 2406, § 1(part), 1997)  
2.200.020 - Title. 
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "City of Livonia code of ethics." (Ord. 2406, § 1(part), 1997)  
2.200.030 - Policy. 
It is the public policy of this city that all elected and appointed officials and employees shall construe and implement ethical standards and guidelines with sincerity, integrity and commitment so as to advance the spirit of this ordinance in accordance with the following guiding principles: 
A. Public Interest. City officials and employees are delegated power from the public and are obliged to exercise that power as trustees of the public. The power and resources of government service therefore shall be used only to advance the public interest. 
B.  Objective Judgment. Loyalty to the public interest requires that all matters shall be decided with independent, objective judgment, free from avoidable conflicts of interest, improper influences, and competing loyalties. 
C.  Accountability. Government affairs shall be conducted in an open, efficient, fair and honorable manner, which enables citizens to make informed judgments and to hold officials accountable. 
D.  Democratic Leadership. All city officials shall honor and respect the spirit and principles of representative democracy and will scrupulously observe the spirit as well as the letter of the law. 
E.  Respectfulness. All city officials and employees shall safeguard public confidence by being honest, fair and respectful of all persons and property with whom they have contact, by maintaining nonpartisanship in all official acts, and by avoiding conduct which may tend to undermine respect for city officials and employees and for the city as an institution. (Ord. 2406, § 1(part), 1997)  
2.200.040 - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter: 
A.  "City official or employee" is a person elected, appointed or otherwise serving in any capacity involving the exercise of a public power, trust or duty. 
B.  "Compensation" is any money, property, thing of value or benefit received by any person in return for services rendered. 
C.  "Conflict of interest" is either a personal interest or a duty or loyalty to a third party that competes with or is adverse to a city official's or employee's duty to the public interest in the exercise of official duties or official actions. 
D.  "Gift" is any thing of value, money, loan of money, goods, or services given without due consideration. "Gift" does not include: 
1.  Information-gathering trips paid for by a person or entity seeking approval of a proposal from a decision-making body of the city, provided that the decision-making body, prior to the trip, makes all of the following determinations:

c.  The decision-making body designates the official(s) and/or employee(s) who will participate. 
2.  Small perishable or consumable gifts of a nominal value, and any reportable campaign contributions pursuant to state law. 
E.  "Immediate family" is a spouse, child, parent, sister or brother wherever residing, or any relative sharing the same household. 
F.  "Official duties" or "official actions" are decisions, recommendations, approvals, disapprovals or other actions which involve the use of discretionary authority. (Ord. 2406, § 1(part), 1997)  
2.200.050 - Prohibited conduct.

A city official or employee who acquires information in the course of his or her official duties, which by law or policy is confidential, shall not prematurely divulge that information to an unauthorized person nor use the information to further the private interest of the city official or employee or any third party. Information which is deemed exempt from disclosure under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, Act 442, Public Acts of Michigan, 1976, or which is the subject of a duly called closed meeting held in accordance with the Michigan Open Meetings Act, Act 267, Public Acts of Michigan, 1976, is confidential. A city official or employee shall not suppress or refuse to provide city reports or other information which is publicly available.

For purposes of this subdivision, "financial benefit" means only a financial benefit which accrues to a greater extent than any benefit which could reasonably be expected to accrue from the proposed action to the general public or to the general business, occupation or profession taken as a group. 
d.  Except as otherwise provided by law, no city elected official shall serve with compensation as an officer or as a member of a managing or executive board with the right to vote in any corporation, business, or entity which engages or seeks to engage in any business, transaction or activity with the city. The foregoing shall not apply to entities which are advisory only, or which have no legal standing, or which are substantially affiliated with or controlled by the city or 501C(3) not-for-profit organizations; or to membership on a managing or executive board on an ex officio basis without vote.

No political activity shall interfere with the performance of the usual duties of any city official or employee. 
G.  Nepotism. No city official or employee shall cause the employment or any favorable employment action of an immediate family member. No employee shall participate in any employment decision about that family member. This section shall not prevent a city official or employee from preparing or approving a budget which includes compensation for an immediate family member, so long as that immediate family member receives the same treatment as others in his/her classification. 
H.  Retaliation. No person making a complaint or requesting an advisory opinion, or participating in any proceeding of the board of ethics, shall be retaliated against in any manner for such action or participation.

2.  Where the interest on the payment obligation under the contract is to be exempt from general federal income taxation (as opposed to alternative minimum or other indirect taxation) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"), to take all actions within his/her control which are necessary to obtain and maintain such exemption, including but not limited to actions relating to the rebate of arbitrage earnings and the expenditure and investment of moneys deemed to be proceeds of the contract;

(Ord. No. 3017, § 1, 9-19-2016)  
3.04.140 - Bids—Required when—Procedures—Council authority. 
A.  Where the obligation of the city under a contract is one thousand five hundred ($1,500.00) dollars or less, no bids shall be required prior to the making of such contract. Prior to the making of any contract imposing an obligation on the city of an amount greater than one thousand five hundred ($1,500.00) dollars, but less than fifteen thousand ($15,000.00) dollars, the director or department head of the particular department involved, or the purchasing agent, if there is one, shall procure at least three (3) quotes in writing; provided, however, that less than three (3) quotes may be procured where the director, department head or purchasing agent certifies in writing the reasons why three (3) quotes cannot be procured. 
B.  In determining whether or not the amount of any purchase requires the taking of quotes or bids for materials or services, the total estimated expenditures for the next succeeding twelve (12) months shall govern. 
C.  The council, at its discretion, shall have the right to reject any and all bids, including, but not limited to, the reason that there is a lack of sufficient American manufactured content. Except as otherwise set forth in this chapter, no contract shall be awarded other than to the lowest bidder except by authority of the council. Where the obligation of the city under a proposed contract is fifteen thousand ($15,000.00) dollars or more, sealed bids shall be solicited by advertisement in the official newspaper, or via the Internet or other electronic media, if allowed by state law, by the director or head of the department. Such advertisement shall reasonably state pertinent information concerning the proposed contract and fix a period of at least seven (7) days following the date of publication within which bids shall be received. Wherever possible, the plans and specifications for the items to be bid upon shall be drafted so as to allow at least two (2) bids to be received. Where drafting of the plans and specifications in such manner is not possible, the director or head of the department shall submit proper documentation establishing that such is the case to the city council. All advertisements for bids shall be approved as to form by the city attorney, by the budget officer as to an existing sufficient appropriation, shall require that bids when submitted be identified and marked "sealed bids" and shall be addressed to the city. All bids requiring advertisement shall be presented publicly, unopened, to a bid committee consisting of the city clerk and the budget officer, or their representatives, and the representative of the requisitioning authority at a time and place set forth in the advertisement. Council members shall receive electronic notice of bid committee meetings. The bids shall then be referred by the bid committee to the requisitioning authority for report and recommendation to the city council. All advertisements for bids shall also provide that bids may be received prior to the specified time of the public opening of such bids. 
D.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, no bids shall be required prior to the making of a contract in the following instances: 
1.  In the case of an emergency which is fully explained in a written memorandum, approved by the mayor, filed with the city clerk, and transmitted to the council; and 
2.  In connection with contracts for engineering, legal, accounting, architectural, insurance or other professional services provided that: 
a.  The council approves the contract and sets forth the reasons for not taking bids in an authorizing resolution; or 
b.  The council has previously adopted a resolution authorizing the administration or a city department to award a contract or contracts through a qualification-based selection ("QBS") process. For purposes of this section, QBS shall mean that the qualifications of the person, firm, company, corporation or entity to provide the professional services are the primary determining factors in the selection process; and 
3.  Where the subject of the contract is a product or material not competitive in nature and no advantage to the city would result from requiring competitive bidding, and the city council, upon written recommendation of the mayor, authorizes execution of a contract without competitive bidding. 
4.  When the city joins with other units of government in cooperative purchasing efforts that are deemed to be in the best interests of the city, such cooperative purchasing may include, but is not limited to, consortiums, joint or multiparty contracts between public procurement units, and open-ended county, state or federal public procurement contracts which are made available to the city. 
E.  Bids from City-Based Firms. 
1.  In comparing bids, the bid of any city-based firm may be deemed a better bid than the bid of any competing firm which is not city-based, whenever the bid of such competing firm shall be less than three percent (3%) lower than the bid of the city-based firm on any contract bid in an amount of one hundred thousand ($100,000.00) dollars or less, and less than one percent (1%) lower on any amount bid in excess thereof. The foregoing percentages shall each be deemed to apply to the city-based bid and, as the case may be, to the full and complete amount of the contract bid, e.g., the equalization credit of one percent (1%) would apply to the full contract amount bid, and not merely to the amount in excess of one hundred thousand ($100,000.00) dollars. The firm making the lowest bid thus evaluated shall be deemed the lowest bidder. No contract hereafter awarded by reason of an equalization percentage credit shall be sublet to any subcontractor which is not a city-based firm. Any bidder who claims entitlement to an equalization percentage credit shall agree to make available to the city the records necessary to establish eligibility. Section 3.04.140(E) shall not apply to contracts authorized pursuant to Section 3.04.140(D). 
2.  "City-based firm" means a firm which is located within the city and which has made payment of commercial, office, manufacturing or research and engineering property taxes on real or personal property for at least one (1) calendar year. 
F.  All bids, regardless of amount, shall constitute public records, and shall be preserved in the office of the city clerk for a period of six (6) years following the date of opening.

C.  The schedule of prevailing wage and fringe benefits for all classes of construction mechanics called for in any city contract shall be made a part of the specifications for the work to be performed and shall be printed on the bidding forms for each construction contract or project that will be subject to the prevailing wage requirement as provided in subsection B of this section. 
D.  Every contractor and subcontractor subject to the prevailing wage requirement as provided in subsection B of this section shall keep posted in a conspicuous place on the construction site a copy of all prevailing wage and fringe rates being paid on that project. Accurate records, showing name and occupation of and actual wages and benefits paid to each construction mechanic employed on the project, shall be made available on demand for inspection by the city. 
E.  The city, by written notice to the contractor, may terminate the contractor's right to proceed with any part of the contract for which less than the prevailing rates of wages and fringe benefits have been paid. The city may then proceed to complete the contract by separate agreement with the next lowest bidder who is in compliance with this section and who is able to perform with respect to the contract or project. The city may withhold payment of any monies owed to a contractor who is in violation of this section until all liabilities and excess costs to the city for rebidding or recontracting the project have been met. 
F.  Any person, firm or corporation, including the officers thereof, who fails to pay prevailing wages as provided in the contract with the city pursuant to subsection B of this section or who fails to comply with the posting and recordkeeping requirements set forth in subsection D of this section shall be directed to comply with this section and shall be subject to a civil fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a first violation and not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for a second or subsequent violation. 
G.  Section 3.04.145, in its entirety, shall be in force and effect for a three-year period and shall expire on May 24, 1996. (Ord. 2174, § 1, 1993; Ord. 2168, § 1, 1993)

The council, at its discretion, shall have the right to reject any and all bids. 
C.  If the highest bids are for the same amount, the finance director shall negotiate with the high bidders for an increased bid, and shall recommend the sale which appears to be to the advantage of the city.

If the council does not decide that it will accept the highest bid below the minimum sales price within thirty (30) days of the date on which the bids were considered and declared, all bids shall be considered rejected. 
E.  The successful bidder shall pay any documentary stamp tax and recording fee and shall deposit the full amount of the sale price with the city treasurer within thirty (30) days after the bid acceptance. If the above provisions are not met, the bidder forfeits his deposit.

B.  Prior to any public auction, notice of the date, time and place of the auction and a general description of the property to be sold, including a description of any money recovered or held, shall be published in an official newspaper and posted in the police headquarters and on the public bulletin board in the city hall at least seven (7) days prior to the specified date of the auction.

The claimant shall establish proof of ownership to the satisfaction of the chief of police, and pay the cost of any storage and publication expenses incurred by the city. The money (without interest) or other property shall then be turned over to the claimant and the auction shall be cancelled insofar as the claimed property is concerned. 
E.  The police department shall keep a book, permanently bound, in which shall be kept a list of all unclaimed personal property and money, the date taken into possession by the police department and the final disposition thereof, and if sold, the amount received, which shall be certified to by the chief of police. 
F.  Each public auction shall be under the direction of the chief of police, and the city clerk shall act as clerk at such auction. The unclaimed personal property shall be sold to the highest bidder, who shall then receive a bill of sale for the property purchased from the city. 
G.  All proceeds from such auctions, after deducting the expenses incurred in conducting the auction, and any other money recovered and held which was included in the notice provided for in subsection B, shall be turned over to the city treasurer to be deposited in the general fund. 
H.  The purchaser of any property sold at an auction conducted pursuant to this section shall own such property free of any claims by the previous owner.

The city's finance department or its designee shall, within ninety (90) days of receiving an itemized statement of expenses incurred for emergency response, submit a statement of charges for same by first class mail to any such person whose identity and address are known to the director of finance. Such a statement may also be transmitted via facsimile or other electronic means if such means are reasonably determined to provide actual notice to the intended recipient. Said statement shall require payment within forty-five (45) days. 
E.  Any person receiving such a statement shall have the opportunity to appeal all or any portion of the amount shown on such statement by filing a written request for same with the fire chief within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice from the city. The request must be accompanied by a written explanation as to why the amount appealed should not be charged to the appellant. Such appeals shall be heard by the assistant director of the inspection department, as hearing officer, or, in his absence, the director of the inspection department or his designee. If the hearing officer determines that the appellant is not properly responsible for any or all of the amount charged, the hearing officer may waive such charge against the appellant. The findings and decisions of the hearing officer shall be in writing and filed with the office of the fire chief. 
F.  If no written request for appeal is received within the specified time, the city may proceed by suit in a court of appropriate jurisdiction to collect any monies remaining unpaid at the expiration of forty-five (45) days from billing, or, if no bill is submitted, at any time subsequent to the emergency response in question. 
G.  In addition, the city shall have any other remedy available to the city by law. (Ord. 2546, § 1, 10-15-01)

3.08.010 - Title. 
The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known as the "special assessment procedure ordinance." (Prior code § 2-501)  
3.08.020 - Purpose of provisions. 
The purpose of this chapter is to prescribe by general ordinance, in accordance with Chapter VIII, Section 17 of the City Charter, a complete special assessment procedure concerning the initiation of projects, plans and specifications, estimates of cost, notice of hearings, the making and confirming of the assessment rolls and the correction of errors therein, the collection of special assessments, and any other matters concerning the making of improvements by the special assessment method. (Prior code § 2-502)  
3.08.030 - Definitions. 
The following terms, when used in this chapter shall have the respective meanings as set forth in the definitions given below: 
A.  "Cost," when referring to the cost of any improvement, means and includes the cost of surveys, plans, rights-of-ways, spreading of rolls, notices, advertising, financing and construction, and all other costs incident to the making of such improvement, the special assessments therefor and the financing thereof. 
B.  "Deficiency" means the sum by which the amount spread on the roll to be collected, without interest, is less than the actual cost of the improvement. 
C.  "Engineer" means the city engineer. 
D.  "Excess" means the sum by which the amount spread on the roll to be collected, without interest, is greater than the actual cost of the improvement. 
E.  "Improvement" means any public improvement, any part of the cost of which is to be assessed against one (1) or more lots or parcels of land to be especially benefitted thereby, in proportion to the benefit to be derived therefrom. 
F.  "Lot or parcel of land" means any subdivision lot or portion thereof as officially platted, or any unplatted parcel of land as may be described upon any official records. 
G.  "Owner" means the last recorded title holder of any lot or parcel of land, or the person whose name is last listed upon the city tax roll as owner of a certain lot or parcel of land. 
H.  "Sidewalk" means the portion of the street right-of-way designated and to be improved for pedestrian travel. (Ord. 1868 § 1, 1986: prior code § 2-503)  
3.08.040 - Council powers and procedures. 
The council shall have power to determine the necessity of any local or public improvement and to determine by resolution that the whole or any part of the cost expenses of any such improvement shall be defrayed by special assessment upon the property especially benefitted proportionate to the benefits derived or to be derived. (Prior code § 2-504)  
3.08.050 - Commencement of proceedings. 
The council, in order to ascertain whether or not a reasonable number of property owners to be assessed desire any particular improvement to be made, may request and receive a petition therefor, or may receive such a petition voluntarily presented; but in either event, such petition shall be advisory only and shall not be jurisdictional. (Prior code § 2-505)  
3.08.060 - Report of city engineer—Filing. 
Before determining to make any improvement, any part of the cost of which is to be defrayed by special assessment, the council shall require the engineer to ascertain the assessed valuation of all property affected by the proposed improvement, the number of parcels owned by public authorities, the number of parcels which are vacant, and to prepare or cause to be prepared preliminary plans, specifications and cost estimates for the proposed improvement, and to file the same with the city clerk, together with his recommendation as to what proportion of the cost should be paid by special assessment and what part, if any, should be a general obligation of the city, the number and installments in which assessments may be paid, and the lands which would be included in the proposed special assessment district. (Ord. 1868 § 2, 1986: prior code § 2-506)  
3.08.070 - First public hearing—Notice. 
After such filing, a public hearing shall be held before the council, which hearing shall be held not less than ten (10) days after notice of the time and place thereof has been published and sent by the city clerk by first class mail to all property owners in the proposed district as shown by the current tax roll of the city. At the time and place specified in such notices for the public hearing, the council shall meet and hear any person to be affected by the proposed public improvement.

D.  Determine the rate of interest to be charged on installments, not to exceed the maximum rate of interest as may be prescribed by state law; 
E.  Designate the district or land and premises upon which special assessments shall be levied; and

3.08.090 - Plan and cost information—Preparation of roll. 
The city engineer shall supply the city assessor with current estimated project cost information. Upon receipt of the foregoing information, the city assessor shall thereupon prepare or cause to be prepared a special assessment roll including all lots and parcels of land within the special assessment district designated by the council, and shall assess to each such lot or parcel of land such relative portion of the whole sum to be levied against all the lands in the special assessment district as the benefit to such lot or parcel of land bears to the total benefits to all lands in such district. There shall also be entered upon such roll the amount which has been assessed to the city at large. (Ord. 1868 § 5, 1986: Ord. 1387 § 1 (part), 1978: prior code § 2-509)  
3.08.100 - Filing of roll. 
When the city assessor has completed such assessment roll, he shall attach thereto, or endorse thereon, his certificate to the effect that he has prepared or caused to be prepared the roll pursuant to a resolution of the council adopted on a given date, and that in making the assessments therein he has, as near as may be, according to his best judgment, conformed in all respects to the directions contained in such resolution, and to the City Charter and the provisions of this chapter. Thereupon he shall file the special assessment roll with the city clerk, who shall present the same to the council. (Ord. 1868 § 6, 1986: prior code § 2-510)  
3.08.110 - Second public hearing on assessment roll—Notice. 
Upon receipt of such special assessment roll, the council shall order it filed in the office of the city clerk for public examination; shall fix the time and place when it will meet and review such roll, which meeting shall be held not less than ten (10) days after notice thereof has been sent by the city clerk by first class mail to all property owners in the proposed district as shown by the current assessment roll of the city. Such notice shall specify the time and place of such meeting. The council may, in its discretion, publish notice of such meetings not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the meeting. (Prior code § 2-511)  
3.08.120 - Objections to roll—Filing. 
Any person deeming himself aggrieved by the special assessment roll may file his objections thereto in writing with the city clerk prior to the close of such hearing, which written objections shall specify in what respect he deems himself aggrieved. (Prior code § 2-512)  
3.08.130 - Confirmation of roll—Conditions—Council authority. 
The council shall meet and review the special assessment roll at the time and place appointed, or at an adjourned date therefor, and shall consider any written objections thereto. The council may correct the roll as to any assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land, or other errors appearing therein. Any changes made in such roll shall be noted in the council's minutes. After such hearing and review, the council may conform the special assessment roll with such corrections as it may have made, if any, or may refer it back to the city assessor for revision, or may annul it and any proceedings in connection therewith. No original special assessment roll shall be finally confirmed except by the affirmative vote of six (6) of the members of the council if, prior to such confirmation, written objections to the proposed improvement have been filed by the owners of property which will be required to bear more than fifty percent (50%) of the amount of such special assessment. The city clerk shall endorse the date of confirmation upon each special assessment roll. Such roll shall, upon confirmation, be final and conclusive. (Prior code § 2-513)  
3.08.140 - Assessment district for street lighting and similar services. 
All improvements consisting of the construction, installation, maintenance and operation of systems, facilities and equipment for street lighting or other similar services shall be accomplished pursuant to the improvement procedure provisions provided under Sections 3.08.040 to 3.08.130, both inclusive, of this chapter, except and provided, however, that where such construction or installation is performed by the Detroit Edison Company, or some other public utility company, and the cost thereof is not charged to the city or the users of the service, then in such case: 
A.  The report and recommendation of the city engineer, which may be required under Section 3.08.060, shall omit all information as to cost of construction and shall include all other information required by said Section 3.08.060, together with such schedules of existing rates and service charges as may be submitted to the city by the Detroit Edison Company or other public utility; and the council, in acting on such report pursuant to Section 3.08.080, shall consider only such matters as are required by this subsection; 
B.  Neither the whole or any part of such cost of construction shall be assessed against any property within the proposed special assessment district; 
C.  The regular, approved rates for such service, as charged to the city, less the amount thereof constituting a general obligation of the city, shall be annually assessed upon the property especially benefitted, as provided in Sections 3.08.080, 3.08.090 and 3.08.130; 
D.  Prior to maturity, no interest shall be charged on assessments made pursuant to subsection B of this section, but thereafter interest and collection fees shall be charged as provided in Sections 3.08.080 and 3.08.230; 
E.  The provisions of Section 3.08.180 limiting annual installments to twenty (20), and the provisions of Section 3.08.200 and all other sections of this chapter which are inconsistent with or contrary to the intent of this section, are hereby made and declared to be inapplicable to all assessments made under this section; and 
F.  The department of engineering and building is hereby authorized to adopt reasonable rules and regulations governing the administration of this section. (Ord. 1868 § 7, 1986; prior code § 2-514)  
3.08.150 - Assessing single lots or premises. 
A.  When any expense has been incurred by the city for the construction, rebuilding or repair of sidewalks, or upon or in respect to any separate or single lot, parcel of land or lands, or premises, which expense is chargeable against the same and owner thereof under the provisions of the City Charter, the ordinances of the city, including the ordinance codified in this chapter, or the laws of the state, and which is not of that class required to be prorated among several lots and parcels of land in a special assessment district, an account of the labor, material or services for which such expense was incurred, verified by the city engineer, with a description of the lot and the name of the owner, if known, shall be reported to the city treasurer, who shall immediately charge and bill the owner of the property to be assessed and such bill shall notify the owner of the time of the meeting of the city council, not sooner than thirty (30) days thereafter, when the council will meet for the purpose of adopting a resolution placing a special assessment upon the property for such charges unless the same are paid prior to the date of such meeting. At such meeting, the city council shall adopt a special assessment resolution covering each lot or parcel of land for which such charges have not been theretofore paid in full. As many separate lots or parcels may be included in a single resolution as shall be convenient. Upon adoption of such resolution, the council may authorize installment payments, and if installment payments are authorized, shall determine the number of installments and the rate of interest to be charged thereon, but not to exceed six percent (6%) per year, or such other maximum rate of interest as may be prescribed by state law. Immediately after such resolution shall have become effective, the city clerk shall give notice of the several amounts so determined to the several persons chargeable therewith. Such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the last known addresses of such persons, as shown on the most current general assessment roll of the city, or by publication in the official newspaper and by posting upon the official public bulletin board of the city. Such notice shall state the basis of the assessment, and the amount thereof, and shall give a reasonable time, not less than thirty (30) days, within which payment shall be made to the city treasurer. In all cases where payment is not made within the specified time, the fact shall be reported by the city treasurer to the city assessor, who shall charge such amounts, together with a penalty of ten percent (10%) of such amounts, against the persons or real property chargeable therewith, on the next general tax roll. 
B.  Prior to construction of a sidewalk abutting any road which is maintained by the state or county, which sidewalk is proposed to be over one-half (½) mile in length and would abut more than ten (10) lots or premises, a public hearing shall be held before the council, which hearing shall be held not less than ten (10) days after notice of the time and place thereof has been published and sent by the city clerk by first class mail to the property owner as shown by the current tax roll of the city, and the state or county, as the case may be. At the time and place specified in such notices for the public hearing, the council shall meet and hear any person to be affected by the proposed public improvement. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time by the council. 
C.  Further provided, however, that when the council has authorized installment payments, the time specified as referred to in this chapter shall be the time the installment is due in accordance with the council resolution, and the penalty of ten percent (10%) provided for in the case where payment is not made within the specified time shall be charged only against the past-due installment or installments; and further, such installment or installments past due, together with the ten percent (10%) penalty as herein provided, shall be placed on the next general tax roll, after falling due. (Ord. 2608, § 1, 2003: Ord. 2283 § 1, 1995; Ord. 1868 § 8, 1986; Ord. 811 § 2, 1970: prior code § 2-515)  
3.08.160 - General improvement procedure inapplicable when. 
The special assessment resolution shall be treated as and shall constitute a special assessment roll, and the adoption of such resolution shall correspond to the confirmation of a special assessment roll. The provisions of the preceding sections of this chapter with reference to special assessments generally and the proceedings necessary to be had before making the improvements shall not apply to assessments contemplated under the above and preceding section. The following sections of this chapter, however, shall be applicable to single-lot assessments. (Prior code § 2-516)  
3.08.170 - Attachment of lien. 
All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including any part deferred as to payment, shall, from the date of confirmation of such roll, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels or land assessed, and until paid shall be a charge against the respective parcels of land assessed, and until paid shall be charged against the respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land and a debt to the city from the persons to whom they are assessed. Such lien shall be of the same character and effect as the lien created by the City Charter for city taxes and shall include accrued interest and penalties. No judgment or decree, nor any act of the council vacating a special assessment shall destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the premises assessed for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the same, or as by a regular mode of proceeding might be lawfully assessed thereon. (Prior code § 2-517)  
3.08.180 - Due date for payments. 
All special assessments shall become due upon confirmation of the special assessment roll or in annual installments not to exceed twenty (20) in number, as the council may determine at the time of confirmation, and, if in installments, the council shall also determine the due date of the first and subsequent installments on the special assessment roll. (Prior code § 2-518)  
3.08.190 - Division into installments—Notice by treasurer regarding payment. 
After confirmation of the assessment roll, the assessor shall divide such assessment roll into such number of equal installments as shall have been fixed by the council; provided that if such division operates to make any installment less than ten dollars ($10.00), then the assessor shall reduce the number of installments so that each installment shall be above and as near to ten dollars ($10.00) as possible. The assessment roll shall be transmitted by the city assessor to the treasurer for collection immediately after its confirmation. The treasurer shall give notice by one (1) publication in the official newspaper or any newspaper of general circulation within the city that said special assessment roll (identifying it) has been filed in his office and specifying when and where payments may be made thereon. He shall mail statements of the several assessments to the respective owners, as indicated by the records of the assessor, of the several lots and parcels of land assessed, stating the amount of the assessment and the manner in which it may be paid; provided, however, that failure to mail any such statement shall not invalidate the assessment or entitle the owner to an extension of time within which to pay the assessment; provided further, however, that the treasurer shall advise in said statement that the assessment shown therein is based upon bids and/or estimates of the project cost and is subject to possible adjustment based upon the final, actual cost as provided for in Sections 3.08.260 and 3.08.270 of this chapter. (Ord. 1387 § 1 (part), 1978: prior code § 2-519)  
3.08.200 - Payment without penalty—Time limit. 
The whole or any part of any such assessment may be paid during the period of sixty (60) days from the date of confirmation of the special assessment roll without interest or penalty. (Prior code § 2-520)  
3.08.210 - Spreading of assessment upon city tax roll—Billing and interest charges. 
The first installment shall be spread upon the city tax roll in a column headed "special assessments," together with interest upon all unpaid installments from the date of the confirmation of the roll to the first day of December of the year in which such tax roll is made; provided, that any fraction of a month shall be considered as a full month; provided further, that if the date of the confirmation of the roll is subsequent to the first day of August, the interest charged thereunder shall be billed the first day of December of next year following in which such tax roll is made. Thereafter, one (1) installment shall be spread upon each annual tax roll, together with one (1) year's interest upon all unpaid installments; provided, that when any annual installment shall have been prepaid as hereinafter provided, then there shall be spread upon the tax roll for such year only the interest upon all unpaid installments; provided, however, that the council may by resolution waive the requirements above set forth for the charging of interest until such time as the improvement has been commenced, installed or completed, or until such time as the council may determine the interest charge shall commence on the special assessment district. (Ord. 762 § 1, 1969: prior code § 2-521)  
3.08.220 - Advance payment of installments. 
After the expiration of the sixty-day period provided for in Section 3.08.200, any installment which has not been spread upon the tax rolls may be discharged by paying the face amount thereof plus interest thereon to date of payment. Any person desiring to pay such installment in advance shall first secure the proper statement from the assessor to permit the treasurer to compute the amount to be paid. The treasurer shall report to the assessor all advance payments on installments so that the assessor shall have such information before spreading installments in the next city tax roll. (Prior code § 2-523)  
3.08.230 - Overdue payments—Collection fee. 
After each installment has been placed on the tax rolls, the same shall be collected by the treasurer with the same rights and remedies, and the same penalties and interest, as provided in the Charter for the collection of taxes. On the first day of the third month following due date, the treasurer shall add to all assessments or installments paid on the first day of the third month and thereafter a collection fee of one percent (1%) of the amount of the assessment, and on the first day of each succeeding month he shall add an additional one-half (½) of one percent (1%) as a collection fee. All collection fees shall belong to the city and be collectible in the same manner as the collection fee on city taxes. (Prior code § 2-522)  
3.08.240 - Additional remedies to enforce collection. 
In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien therefor, any delinquent special assessment, together with interest and penalties, may be collected in an action in assumpsit in the name of the city against the person assessed, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If in any such action it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant or upon the premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the city which is a proper charge against the defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such premises. (Prior code § 2-524)  
3.08.250 - Completion of improvement—Certification of actual cost. 
Upon completion of the improvement, the city engineer shall certify to the council the total cost of the improvement, together with the amount of the assessment roll as previously confirmed by the council under Section 3.08.130 of this chapter. (Ord. 1868 § 9, 1986: Ord. 1387 § 1 (part), 1978: prior code § 2-525)  
3.08.260 - Funds in excess of actual cost—Disposition. 
The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than the actual cost of the improvement and expenses incidental thereto may be placed in the general fund of the city if such excess is five percent (5%) or less of the assessment as determined immediately after the completion of the improvement when actual total costs have been determined, but should the assessment prove larger than necessary by more than five percent (5%), the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro rata basis to the owners of the property assessed. Such refund shall be made by credit against future unpaid installments in the inverse order in which they are payable to the extent such installments then exist, and the balance of such refund shall be in cash. No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured in whole or part by such special assessment. (Prior code § 2-526)  
3.08.270 - Funds less than actual cost—Deficiency assessments. 
Should the assessments in any special assessment roll, including the amount assessed to the city at large, prove insufficient for any reason to pay the cost of the improvement for which they were made, then the council may make additional assessments against the city and the several lots and parcels of land in the same ratio as the original assessments, to supply the deficiency, but the total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement; provided, that except for street lighting special assessment districts, the additional prorata assessment shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the assessment as originally confirmed unless a meeting of the council be held to review such additional assessment for which meeting notices shall be mailed as provided in the case of review of the original special assessment roll. (Ord. 1868 § 10, 1986: Ord. 1387 § 1 (part), 1978: Ord. 921 § 1, 1971: prior code § 2-527)  
3.08.280 - Reassessment in event of illegality. 
Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the council, be invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal, the council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for the original assessment; and whenever the assessment, or any part thereof, levied upon any premises has been so set aside, if the same has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. (Prior code § 2-528)  
3.08.290 - Improvement costs—Cost of acquiring property added. 
Whenever any property is acquired by condemnation or otherwise for the purpose of any public improvement, the cost thereof and the proceedings required to acquire such property may be added to the cost of such improvement. (Prior code § 2-529)  
3.08.300 - Land acquired by condemnation for public improvements. 
Whenever it is necessary to condemn land or other property to be used as or as part of a public improvement, the proceedings to condemn such land or other property shall not be deemed to be either the determination to make or acquire the commencement of, or the making or acquiring of such improvement; provided, however, that in all cases where a verdict of necessity has been rendered and awards for damages made in condemnation proceedings and the verdict of the jury shall have been confirmed, the council may, if it believes that a portion of the city in the vicinity of the proposed improvement for which said private property has been condemned, will be especially benefitted by such improvement, at any time thereafter determine that the whole or any proportion of the compensation awarded by the jury, together with the expenses of the proceedings, shall be assessed upon the owners and occupants of real estate deemed to be thus benefitted, and may thereupon or thereafter proceed to determine the district benefitted to create a special assessment district thereof and specify the amount to be assessed upon the owners or occupants of the taxable real estate in such assessment district, all in accordance with the provisions of the City Charter and this chapter for the levying and the collection of a special assessment. (Prior code § 2-530)  
3.08.310 - Property owner may file waiver of notice and proceedings. 
The owner of record of any lot or premises may at any time execute in writing "Waiver of Notice and Proceedings" and file the same with the council waiving any or all notice of hearings and other proceedings required under this chapter, and authorize the council to make such special assessment as the council may determine against the owner and his property without further notice. The council may thereupon by resolution authorize the improvement. Any special assessment so made shall, upon confirmation of the assessment by the council, be considered the same as any other special assessment formally made hereunder, notwithstanding the omission of any notice of proceeding so waived. (Prior code § 2-531)  
3.08.320 - Failure to receive notice. 
Failure of any owner to receive any notice required to be sent under the provisions of this chapter shall not invalidate any special assessment or special assessment roll if notice as required under the provisions of this chapter shall have been given in the manner required by this chapter.

The annunciation panel shall indicate in which occupancy or section of the building the system was activated. (Ord. 1186 § 1 (part), 1975: prior code § 4-121(c))  
5.06.050 - Inspection and approval of system plans and equipment. 
A.  No alarm system shall be installed within the city unless the same as "Underwriters Laboratory Approved" or equivalent, is determined by the chief building inspector; and the installation of all alarm systems shall be subject to inspection and approval by the bureau of inspection.

Such permits shall be subject to revocation by the police chief or fire chief upon notification in writing stating the reasons therefor. (Ord. 1186 § 1 (part), 1975: prior code § 4-121(e))  
5.06.070 - False alarms—Fee required when—Interest—Collection—Appeals.

The city shall have the right to use any reasonable means to collect past due amounts or to deter recurring false alarms at the same address, including the institution of ordinance violation proceedings, use of a collection agency, revoking licenses, filing a civil action and/or the institution of civil proceedings for injunctive relief or court-ordered abatement of nuisances. 
D.  The owner or lessee of an alarm system shall have the opportunity to appeal any false alarm fees by filing a written request for same with the chief of police within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice from the city. The request to appeal any false alarm fees must be accompanied by a written explanation for activation of the alarm. The chief of police shall schedule the matter for review by an administrative board consisting of the chief of police or his designee, the finance director or his designee and one (1) representative selected by the mayor. If the board determines that the alarm was erroneously deemed a "false alarm" or was activated because of an emergency or by circumstances in which the false alarm was not avoidable by the use of due care, the board may waive the fee. If the board determines that the alarm was improperly installed or maintained or that the alarm equipment is defective, the fee shall not be waived. The findings and decisions of the board shall be in writing and filed with the office of the chief of police. No more than two (2) false fees per calendar year at the same address shall be waived.

The city shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in information being withheld. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and the request is denied, (1) where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will be returned to the operator; or (2) the cable operator may seek review within five (5) working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
B.  Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld as proprietary with the city.

It will then promptly notify the requesting entity and the cable operator that submitted the information as to the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or cable operator may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal. 
C.  The procedures set forth in this section shall be construed as analogous to and consistent with the rules of the FCC regarding requests for confidentiality including, without limitation, 47 CFR Section 0.459. (Ord. 2194 § 1 (part), 1993)

The city recognizes a compelling interest in establishing standards for the maintenance and occupancy of sanitary and safe rental dwellings within the city. Such standards are an important factor supportive of the general health, safety and welfare of all of its citizens. This chapter is designed to promote the continuing maintenance of quality and safe rental dwellings, and to maintain and enhance property values. To accomplish these goals, it is the intention of the city to exercise its full powers to protect the public health, safety and welfare, whether the powers exercised are derived from the constitution, state law or the city Charter.

There shall be imposed upon the owner a charge of the actual costs involved, plus ten percent (10%) of said costs for each time the city shall cause a violation to be corrected; and the owner of the premises shall be billed after same has been completed.

Such a lien may be reduced to judgment and enforced and collected as provided by law, together with interest at the legal rate and court costs. The remedies provided by this paragraph are not exclusive and the city and its Building Inspection Department may invoke such other remedies available under this chapter or other applicable codes, ordinances or statutes, including where appropriate, condemnation proceedings or declaration of premises as unfit for habitation; or suspension, revocation, or non-renewal of the License issued hereunder.

All the tags shall bear the name of the department, the number of the kennel license, and shall be readily distinguishable from the individual license tags for the same year. 
B.  The department or animal control officer shall not issue a kennel license for a new kennel unless the applicant furnishes an inspection certificate signed by an animal control officer stating that the kennel to be covered by the license complies with the requirements of Sections 240 and 260. 
C.  The licensee of a kennel shall, at all times, keep one (1) of such tags attached to a collar on each dog four (4) months old or over kept by him under a kennel license. No dog bearing a kennel tag shall be permitted to stray or be taken anywhere outside the limits of the kennel.

Provided, however, that this section shall not be deemed to prevent the continuation of a kennel which was in existence prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinance even though it now constitutes a nonconforming use, where the owner of such kennel complies, or has complied, with the other applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance. (Prior code § 3-414)

There shall be a dwelling situated on the premises on which any kennel is located, in which dwelling there shall reside such person or persons as is or are responsible for the care, upkeep and control of dogs contained in such kennel.

In order to assure that a kennel is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, all kennels shall be subject to an annual inspection which shall be conducted by the animal control officer, or his designated representative, which inspection shall be made not more than thirty (30) days before filing the application for license. The fees charged for kennel inspections shall be set by a resolution of the city council. 
(Ord. 2973, § 6, 2014; Ord. 1800 § 1, 1985)

No dog shall be permitted to run at large if such dog is unlicensed and is required to be licensed under this chapter, and any such dog is hereby declared to be a public nuisance; provided, however, that the head of the department may, from time to time, order that no dogs, licensed or unlicensed, shall run at large for a specified period not in excess of six (6) months, if conditions and circumstances warrant, for the purpose of protecting the health, safety and welfare of the people or property within the city; provided further, that notice of such order shall be published in the official newspaper at least five (5) days prior to the commencement of any period specified in such order.

C.

All persons shall be liable for damages for any and all injuries to persons or property that may be caused by any dog owned by them, which damages may be determined and collected in appropriate civil proceedings therefor, in which proceedings the proof of the failure or refusal by such owner to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall constitute prima facie evidence of negligence on the part of such owners. (Prior code § 3-435)  
6.04.390 - Violation—Deemed nuisance when. 
Any keeping or harboring of any dog contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or any maintenance or operation of a kennel contrary to such provisions, is declared to be a nuisance per se. (Prior code § 3-441).

A.  An authorized enforcement officer shall have the authority to make a determination that an animal is potentially vicious, as defined in this Chapter, upon the complaint of any person that an animal is potentially vicious. After the authorized enforcement officer classifies any animal as a potentially vicious animal under this Chapter, the authorized enforcement officer shall notify the animal's owner of such classification. The notice to the owner shall meet the following: 
1.  The notice shall be in writing and mailed by certified mail to the owner's last known address. If an animal has more than one (1) owner, notice to one (1) owner shall be sufficient for purposes of this Chapter. 
2.  The notice shall include a summary of the authorized enforcement officer's findings that form the basis for the animal's classification as a potentially vicious animal. 
3.  The notice shall be dated and shall state that the owner has a right to request a hearing on the classification within fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice. 
4.  The notice shall state that the Animal Review Board shall conduct the hearing.

At the hearing, the owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and to present evidence. The Animal Review Board shall also receive such other evidence and hear such other testimony as it may find reasonably necessary to make a determination to sustain, modify or overrule the classification of the animal by the authorized enforcement officer. The Animal Review Board shall notify the owner in writing by certified mail of its determination on the matter. If the determination is made that the animal is a potentially vicious animal, the notice shall specify the date upon which that determination is effective. Unless the Board determines that a later date is appropriate in a particular case, the effective date of the determination shall be the date of the authorized enforcement officer's classification. 
C.  If the identity of the owner of an animal that the authorized enforcement officer has classified as a potentially vicious animal cannot be determined, the animal shall be immediately confiscated with notice of same and a description of the animal given to the Police Department and the local humane society.

(Ord. 1921 § 1 (part), 1987: prior code § 3-113 (part))  
8.32.050 - Enforcement. 
A.  If the director has reason to believe a noise from any source is in noncompliance with Sections 8.32.070 or 8.32.080, a violation notice may be issued to the owner or operator of the source in question. The director may grant up to ninety (90) days for compliance with this chapter. 
For further variance, the procedure set forth in Section 8.32.060 must be used. Provided, further, that upon observing any noise disturbance in noncompliance with Section 8.32.070 or 8.32.080, officers empowered to enforce this chapter may file a criminal complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction for violation of such section. If the alleged violation is of a continuing nature, as determined by the director, the charged party may seek administrative relief from such complaint pursuant to Section 8.32.050(B) through (D) and Section 8.32.060 and such criminal action may be accordingly continued or dismissed. 
B.  Any person who is issued a violation notice from the director in accordance with this section may, within fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of said notice, submit data to the director indicating reasons why there is no violation of Section 8.32.070 or 8.32.080. The director shall review the data submitted and within fifteen (15) days affirm or withdraw the violation notice by informing, in writing, the person receiving said notice of the decision to affirm or withdraw. If the director does not withdraw the violation notice, the person cited, within ten (10) days of receipt of the director's decision to affirm the violation notice (or within ten (10) days of a decision of the board of appeals should appeal be taken from the director's decision to affirm the violation notice), may ask that tests be performed to determine the noise levels from the operation which is the subject of a particular violation notice. If the tests indicate that the noise level exceeds the maximum allowable, the violation notice shall be considered substantiated. If the tests indicate that the noise level is equal to or less than the standard applicable to the operation of this chapter then the violation notice shall be considered void. If a violation notice has been substantiated, remains not acted upon by the person receiving the violation notice within the times prescribed, has not been nullified by the issuance of a variance, or if the conditions causing the violation have not been rectified or eliminated, the director may institute the necessary legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to assess penalties and/or obtain an injunction to secure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  If the noise tests conducted pursuant to Section 8.32.050(B) substantiate the violation notice issued, the person or persons liable for the violation shall be responsible for paying all attendant costs for conducting said tests. If said tests do not substantiate the violation notice issued, then the city shall be responsible for paying all attendant costs for conducting said tests. However, if the person liable elects to conduct his own tests, the person so electing shall pay for these tests irrespective of their outcome. 
D.  Where a preexisting source does not meet the requirements noted in Section 8.32.070 or 8.32.080 then a program to meet the noise limitations stipulated shall be developed and offered to the director by the owner of the equipment or premises causing the noise. This program shall be submitted upon the request of and within such time as shall be fixed by the director, and after said program has been approved by the director, the owner of the equipment or premises causing the noise shall not be in violation of this chapter so long as said program is observed. In evaluating such a program of improvement, the director shall take into consideration the following factors: 
1.  The time of day when the noise will occur; 
2.  The duration of the noise; 
3.  Its magnitude relative to the required levels of this chapter; 
4.  The technical feasibility of bringing the noise into conformity with this chapter, including the economic factors related to age and useful life of the facility or equipment in question; 
5.  The number of people affected by such noise; 
6.  Action taken to control noise disturbances prior to the effective date of this chapter; 
7.  The temporary interim control measures intended to minimize existing noise levels; 
8.  The degree of hardship involved if the relief is not granted; 
9.  Such other matters as can be reasonably related to the impact of noise on the health, safety, welfare, peace and quiet of the community. 
E.  Reports consisting of information required by the director indicating the progress of these programs shall be submitted annually to the director by the owner of the equipment or premises causing the noise in question. If progress of the program is deemed by the director to be unsatisfactory, the director may suspend the program and issue a violation notice. 
F.  In the event the person responsible for a noise source causing a noise disturbance and the director cannot evolve a mutually acceptable program of improvement, the person responsible for the noise source may appeal to the board of appeals for resolution and determination of an acceptable program, which shall be binding upon both the applicant and the director. 
G.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter or any other provision of law, if the director finds that any owner is causing or contributing to a noise disturbance and that such causing or contributing to a noise disturbance creates an emergency which requires immediate action to protect the public health or safety, the director shall order such owner to reduce or discontinue immediately the causing or contributing to the noise disturbance and such order shall be complied with immediately. Such order shall be deemed properly served if a copy thereof is delivered personally, or if the owner involved cannot be found, by mailing a copy thereof by certified mail to the owner involved at the premises involved or his business or residence address, if known, and by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place in or about the premises affected. 
H.  Any person violating any provision of this chapter or failing, neglecting or refusing to comply with an order of the director issued pursuant to Section 8.32.050 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). Each act of violation and every day upon which such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. (Ord. 1921 § 1 (part), 1987: prior code § 3-113(a))  
8.32.060 - Variances. 
A.  A person responsible for a noise source may apply to the board of appeals for a variance from this chapter when it is determined that compliance with said provisions would impose an arbitrary, unreasonable, or undue hardship or inconvenience, or when the social value clearly outweighs the need for the limitations contained herein. 
B.  In making their determination, the board of appeals shall take into consideration the factors noted in (D)(1) through (4) and shall grant such variance only to the extent necessary to ameliorate such arbitrary, unreasonable, or undue hardship or inconvenience, and with due regard for the adequate protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, and the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
C.  The board of appeals may condition such variance and the terms thereof on such factors as they deem appropriate, including a schedule of compliance specifying a definite time period within which full compliance with this chapter and the rules and regulations adopted hereunder shall be achieved. 
D.  Any person taking exception to any decision, ruling, regulation or order of the director or seeking a variance from this chapter may appeal to the board of appeals. Such appeal shall be taken within ten (10) days after the decision, ruling, regulation or order complained of, by filing with the director a notice of appeal directed to the board of appeals, specifying the grounds thereof and the relief sought. A filing fee in accordance with Ordinance 543, Section 21.09, shall be paid by the appellant at the time of filing of the appeal to cover the cost of the hearing. The director shall forthwith furnish to the board of appeals all papers relating to the decision, ruling, regulation or order which is appealed. The boards of appeals shall set a date for the hearing, and shall give notice thereof by mail to all interested parties. Such an appeal shall act as a stay of the decision, ruling, regulation or order in question until the decision of the board of appeals is rendered, unless the director certifies to the board of appeals, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with the director, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in the director's opinion cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by circuit court on application, on notice to such officer, and on due cause shown. The decision of the appeals board shall be binding on the director and the appellant unless reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction. The appellant may appear at the hearing in person and may be represented by an agent or an attorney. (Ord. 1921 § 1 (part), 1987: prior code § 3-113(b))

CHAPTER 8.60 - MERCURY THERMOMETERS 
Sections:

8.60.010 - Findings. 
The city council finds as follows: 
1.  Mercury is a persistent and toxic pollutant that bioaccumulates in the environment and in the food chain; 
2.  Combustion of medical, municipal and other solid waste, which contains whole or broken mercury thermometers, is a major source of atmospheric deposition of mercury resulting in mercury contamination of air and water; 
3.  Mercury from mercury thermometers can also enter the environment, including the watersheds, rivers and lakes in and around the city, directly through vaporization and/or spillage when a thermometer breaks during use, transportation or disposal; 
4.  The effect of mercury on the central nervous system includes tremors, impaired vision and hearing, paralysis, insomnia, emotional instability, developmental deficits during fetal development, attention deficit, and developmental delays during childhood; 
5.  Due to the bioaccumulation of mercury in fish, the Michigan Department of Community Health has issued fish consumption advisories for every inland lake in Michigan, including lakes in Wayne County. The advisories recommend that the general population of adults should eat no more than one meal per week of many types of sport fish from these lakes and that women of childbearing age and children under age fifteen (15) should not eat more than one meal per month of these fish; 
6.  Several states and cities around the world have demonstrated that removal of mercury-containing products, such as mercury thermometers, from the waste stream is an effective way to reduce mercury contamination. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the American Hospital Association and the American Public Health Association are currently implementing programs to eliminate mercury waste; 
7.  Mercury thermometers are not currently used or dispensed at St. Mary's Hospital; and 
8.  There are accurate and safe alternatives to mercury thermometers that are readily available and comparable in cost. (Ord. No. 2542, § 1, 10-15-01)  
8.60.020 - Definitions. 
For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

9.30.020 - Purpose of provisions. 
The underlying basis for the enactment of this chapter is the specific determination made by the city council that within the city a local problem exists which requires the exercise of the local government function as expressed in this chapter. The local problem referred to is identified as the prevalent misuse of those substances defined hereafter being confronted by the citizens of this community and particularly college, high school, junior high school students and other youthful persons. This local problem and the need for this chapter is especially evident for the following reasons: 
A.  The city is located in a highly urbanized and densely populated area which includes two (2) school districts, and where on a regular daily basis thousands of people who are not residents come into its environs due to the location within this community of numerous industrial complexes, large commercial shopping centers, a community college and a private university. 
B.  Because of the concentration of the aforesaid facilities and the daily ingress and egress of people attending, congregating or otherwise gathering in connection therewith, the citizens of this city are exposed and placed in greater than normal danger to the introduction and influx of such substances in their neighborhood and community. 
C.  The city council, in enacting this chapter, does so specifically in order to provide just and equitable legal treatment for all persons in this community, and in particular youthful persons, and also to preserve the respect of such persons for the law and its processes. (Ord. No. 3078, § 1, 12-3-2018; Ord. 962 § 1 (part), 1972: prior code § 8-302)  
9.30.030 - Possession and use of certain substances and prescription forms prohibited. 
A.  It is unlawful for any person to use, or knowingly or intentionally to possess any controlled substances as defined in Article 7 of Act 368 of the Public Acts of 1978 of the state, as amended, and as may be amended in the future, unless the substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid prescription or order of a practitioner ("practitioner" being defined as in said Article 7 of the Public Health Code), while acting in the course of his professional practice, or except as otherwise authorized by this chapter. 
B.  It is unlawful for any person to manufacture, create, deliver, or possess with the intent to manufacture, create or deliver any controlled substances as defined in Article 7 of the Public Health Code, unless the substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid prescription or order of a practitioner, while acting in the course of his professional practice, or except as otherwise authorized by this chapter. 
C.  A person shall not fraudulently obtain or attempt to obtain a controlled substance or a prescription for a controlled substance from a practitioner. 
D.  A person shall not knowingly or intentionally use or possess a prescription form unless the prescription form was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid prescription or order of a practitioner while acting in the course of the practitioner's professional practice, or except as otherwise authorized by this chapter. 
E.  Sections 4.1 and 15 of Initiated Law 1 of 2018, the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, MCL 333.27951, et seq., are hereby adopted by reference, as said statutory sections may be amended from time to time. (Ord. No. 3078, § 2, 12-3-2018; Ord. 2956, § 1, 2014; Ord. 962 § 1 (part), 1972: prior code § 8-303)  
9.30.040 - Violation of Section 9.30.030—First offenders. 
When any person who has not previously been convicted under Section 9.30.030, or under any statute of the United States, or state law, or municipal ordinance relating to possession of use of the substances as defined in Section 9.30.030, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of violating Section 9.30.030A, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place him on probation upon certain terms and conditions, including therein such requirement that he attend courses of instruction or rehabilitation on the medical, psychological and social effects of the misuse of drugs and/or the substances defined in Section 9.30.030. Upon violation of a term or condition, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as the court determines. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against him. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt, and is not a conviction for the purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon the conviction of a crime. There may be only one (1) discharge and dismissal under this section with respect to any person. The records and identifications division of the police department shall retain a nonpublic record of an arrest and discharge or dismissal under this section. This record shall be furnished to any court or police agency upon request for the purpose of showing that a defendant in a criminal action involving possession or use of the substances as defined by Section 9.30.030 has already once availed himself of the provisions of this section.

It shall be the responsibility of both the owner of any residential property and the person in control of such property to maintain the property free of the parking of motor vehicles in violation of this section. It shall also be the responsibility of the owner of any motor vehicle to keep such motor vehicle from being parked on any residential property in violation of this section. 
Any person in violation of any provision of this chapter shall be deemed to have committed a civil infraction and shall be ordered to pay a civil fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), plus costs which fine shall be reduced to fifty dollars ($50.00) if it is paid within two (2) business days from issuance of the ticket.

A violation of this subsection shall be deemed to be a misdemeanor. 
C.  Any person whose vehicle has been towed in consequence of an alleged violation of subsection A. of this section may petition the 16th District Court for a reduction or refund of any fee collected in connection with such tow on the grounds that: 
1.  The petitioner did not, in fact, violate subsection A. of this section, or 
2.  If petitioner did commit such a violation, the facts surrounding the violation mitigated the violation itself. 
The petitioner must provide notice of such appeal to the recipient of such fee in accordance with the provisions of the Michigan Court Rules governing notice to defendants of the commencement of a civil action, and upon the provision of such notice, proceedings shall be had pursuant to the provisions of MCL Sections 257.252d, 257.252e and 257.252f, governing appeals of tow fees imposed by police agencies. The court may, on finding conditions set forth in subdivision 1. or 2. of this subsection, order the recipient of the tow fee to refund all or a portion of such fee.

No such vehicle may be parked between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. except when necessary to make emergency repairs at the premises; provided further, however, that this section does not apply to pick-up trucks and vans, utilized as family vehicles or pleasure vehicles, and which bear no commercial message, logo or any symbol relating to a commercial or business venture.

B.  Access roads to fire hydrants shall be constructed and maintained during construction. Such access roads shall be a minimum fifteen (15) feet wide, with no turning radius less than forty-five (45) feet. At least fifty percent (50%) of the perimeter of the building shall be accessible within twenty-five (25) feet of the building for fire emergencies. 
C.  The fire department shall make a final check of all plans for such buildings or alterations upon submission of same by the department of inspection.

13.04.020 - Use of city water—Permit required. 
No person shall, save for the purpose of extinguishing fires, open any fire hydrant or street reservoir or city cistern, or use any water from the same without first having procured the express permission in writing of the water and sewer division of the department of public works of the city.

13.04.030 - Using water from fire hydrants—Permit, cash deposit and other conditions. 
The water and sewer division is authorized to allow, by written permit, the withdrawal of water from fire hydrants by subdividers, builders or other persons upon written application therefor by such user accompanied by a cash deposit of one hundred dollars ($100.00), which is to be a security against damages to the hydrant, meters and hoses. Upon receipt of application and deposit, the department may issue a written permit with a definite time limit, which permit shall be nontransferable and shall apply only to a specified location. Before releasing said deposit to the permit holder, the water and sewer division shall inspect the hydrant for damage. If any damage has occurred, the cost thereof shall be deducted from the deposit. If the damage should exceed the amount of the deposit, the excess shall be billed to the user. Withdrawal of water for the purpose of flooding skating rinks in winter under the supervision of the parks and recreation department shall be exempt from the cash deposit and fee provisions of this section.

No person shall open or remove any part of a fire hydrant without proper authorization or tamper with, damage or destroy any part thereof. (Prior code § 5-401(d))  
13.04.060 - Permit constitutes agreement to comply. 
Application for a permit and acceptance thereof shall constitute an agreement by the holder of such permit that he will comply with all ordinances, rules and regulations of the city, and any violation thereof shall be deemed a breach of said agreement and shall constitute sufficient cause for the water and sewer division to revoke such permit. (Prior code § 5-401(e))  
13.04.070 - Leaks in public water pipes—Notice required. 
It shall be the duty of every person who, while excavating in any public street or alley or elsewhere, may discover a leak or defect in any of the public water pipes of the city or in any service pipe connected therewith, to give notice forthwith to the person in charge of such excavating whose duty it shall be forthwith to give notice to the water and sewer division.

B.  It is unlawful for any person to violate a water conservation measure or lawn-sprinkling restriction and/or prohibition promulgated pursuant to this section; provided, however, that prior to such measure, restriction and/or prohibition taking effect it shall first be published by the city clerk in at least one (1) issue of the official newspaper of the city. 
C.  Any person violating any provisions of this section; or any water conservation measure, or lawn-sprinkling restriction and/or prohibition shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) or by imprisonment not exceeding thirty (30) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court.

On request, the owner, lessees, or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the inspection agency any pertinent information regarding the piping system or systems on such property.

Where, through no fault of the consumer, the reading obtained from the outside reading device differs from the actual amount of water used, as measured by the water meter, with the result that the consumer has been underbilled by five hundred dollars ($500.00) or more for actual water usage, the meter and/or outside reading device shall be replaced, and if the consumer has not a) covered, obscured, or hindered city access to the meter, b) refused to allow or otherwise hindered the city from changing the meter, c) tampered with the meter or outside reading device, d) fallen into arrears on his/her/its water/sewer bills by more than one month, or e) defaulted on any other obligation to the city, the consumer may apply to the department of public works of the city for relief from make-up billing. If the department finds that the consumer qualifies for such relief, the consumer must forthwith pay five hundred dollars ($500.00), plus ten percent (10%) of the additional underbilling, up to a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), and the balance of the underbilling shall be paid out of amounts collected by the city to cover water/sewer revenue losses.

In addition to other remedies provided, the city shall have all rights provided by statute, including the right to shut off and discontinue the supply of water to any premises for the nonpayment of water bills when due. Water and sewer services so discontinued shall not be restored until all sums then due and owing shall be paid

The notification shall include the name of the caller, the location and time of discharge, the type of wastewater, the estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited pollutants and estimated volume, and the measures taken, or being taken, to abate the discharge into the sewage disposal system of the city. Within five (5) calendar days after the discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, cost of treatment, loss, damages or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the sewage disposal system of the city, or any other environmental impairment or any other damage to persons or property. 
C.  Any user discharging in violation of any of the provisions of this section, which produces a deposit or obstruction or causes damages to, necessitates cleaning of or otherwise impairs the sewage disposal system of the city, shall be liable to the city for any expense, loss, damage, penalty or fine incurred by the city because of said violation or discharge. Prior to assessing such costs, the department of public works shall notify the user of its determination that the user's discharge was the proximate cause of such damage, obstruction, or impairment, or necessitated cleaning of the sewage disposal system of the city and the department's intent to assess such costs to the user. Any such notice shall include written documentation which substantiates the determination of proximate cause and a breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this section.

1.  Fail to completely and/or accurately report the wastewater constituents and/or characteristics of the industrial user's discharge; 
2.  Fail to report significant changes in the industrial user's operations or wastewater constituents and/or characteristics within the time frames provided herein; 
3.  Refuse reasonable access to the industrial user's premises, waste discharge, or sample location for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; 
4.  Restrict, lockout or prevent, directly or indirectly, access to any monitoring facilities constructed on public or private property. The locking or securing of the monitoring facility shall not constitute a violation pursuant to this subsection, provided, that upon request reasonable access to the facility is promptly provided to the Department of Public Works; 
5.  Restrict, interfere, tamper with, or render inaccurate any of the Department's monitoring devices including, but not limited to, samplers; 
6.  Fail to comply with any condition or requirement of the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit; 
7.  Fail to comply with any limitation, prohibition, or requirement of this division including any rule, regulation, or order issued hereunder.

G.  Whenever the Department of Public Works has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, any requirement of this section, the Director of Public Works may commence a civil action to compel compliance in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the user from discharging, and/or to obtain appropriate relief to remedy the violations. The department prosecuting criminally any violation of this section may also seek additional legal and/or equitable relief. The commencement of suit neither constitutes an exclusive election of remedies nor prohibits the department or City from prosecuting criminally any violation of this section, or other applicable laws or requirements. In addition, the City may recover the reasonable attorney fees, court costs, court reporters' fees, and other unusual expenses related to enforcement activities or litigation against the person found to have violated this section, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder. 
H.  No provision of this section shall, however, be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any person whereby sewage or waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city. (Ord. 2862, § 1, 2011: prior code § 5-524)  
13.20.390 - Stormwater and other drainage waters—Discharge into system prohibited.

Upon notification of approval by the control authority, the adjustment shall be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are not effective until incorporated into an industrial user's permit. 
2.  Modification of National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The control authority may apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, whichever is appropriate, for authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and procedures in 40 CFR 403.7. Such authorization may only be granted when the POTW treatment plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for which a removal credit is being sought provided that any limitation on such pollutant(s) in the NPDES permit are neither being exceeded nor pose the prospect of being exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted. Where such authorization is given to the control authority, any industrial user desiring to obtain such credit shall make an application to the control authority, consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 403.7 and this chapter. Any credits which may be granted under this provision may be subject to modification or revocation as specified in 40 CFR 403.7 or as determined by the control authority. A prerequisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the industrial user pay a surcharge based on the amounts of such pollutants removed by the POTW, such surcharge being based on fees or rates which the board may establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits shall reflect or be modified to reflect any credit granted pursuant to this section. 
3.  New Sources. Industrial users who meet the new sources criteria shall install, maintain in operating condition, and "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not to exceed ninety (90) days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
4.  Concentration and Mass Limits. When limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the control authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 CFR 403.6(c)(4) and shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of 33 USC 1317(d) and of this chapter. Industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
5.  Reporting Requirements for Industrial Users upon Effective Date of Categorical Pretreatment Standards—Baseline Report. Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit to the control authority a report containing the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1)—(7). Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to the director or regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40 CFR 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to resubmit this information. At least ninety (90) days before commencement of any discharge, each new source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1)—(5). In such report, new sources shall include information concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the information requested in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(4) and (5). 
D.  Dilution Prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use of process water or, in any way, dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation or requirement imposed by this chapter. 
E.  Hauled-In Wastewater. Any waste material or wastewater which is hauled into or within the service region for discharge to the POTW is subject to the requirements of this division including, but not limited to, permits, inspection, monitoring and enforcement. Unloading liquid or solid waste from hauling vehicles, directly or indirectly, into the POTW, with or without the benefit of pretreatment, is prohibited unless the person proposing to unload such waste has applied for and received a permit from the department for unloading such waste in accordance with the board's rules pertaining thereto. The discharger shall be subject to applicable terms, conditions, surcharges, fees or rates as established by the board. Hauled-in wastewater shall only be discharged at points designated by the POTW after authorization or approval issued pursuant to the general permit requirements. The control authority may establish specific limitations for sludge from municipally owned or operated POTW treatment plants which are different than the specific limitations in this division. 
F.  Centralized Waste Treatment. It is unlawful for a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility to discharge any industrial waste or wastewater into the POTW without a wastewater discharge permit from the control authority. Any authorization granted, or permit issued, by the control authority to a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall specify the type of wastewater for which treatment is provided, and discharge approval is sought, from the POTW. Unless such industrial waste or wastewater is determined by the control authority to require further authorization, a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility that has submitted an application to, and received previous approval from, the control authority to discharge wastewater is not required to obtain further authorization from the control authority before discharging such wastewater. 
An industrial user that provides centralized waste treatment services and files an application for the treatment and discharge of such types of wastewater to the POTW shall provide the following minimum information in support thereof: 
1.  The general nature, source and process(es) generating the type of wastewater. Any wastewater which is generated from those processes and is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards as delineated in Appendix A of 40 CFR part 403 shall be so designated; 
2.  The identity of the toxic pollutants known or suspected to be present in the wastewater; 
3.  At least one (1) sample report showing the results of an analysis for the EPA priority pollutants for each type of wastewater for which application is made in subsection F.1. of this section; 
4.  A statement that is certified by a professional engineer which addresses the treatability and compatibility of the wastewater received or collected by the facility's treatment process(es); 
5.  The identity of the materials and/or pollutants whose transport or treatment are regulated by the EPA, by the state, or by any other governmental agency. Upon request, the centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall provide a copy of its permit and/or license to the control authority; and 
6.  Other information requested by the control authority including, but not limited to, information required by Section 13.21.070C.1.—18. of this chapter or by rules adopted by the board. The discharge from a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility will be deemed approved for those specific types of wastewater delineated in a permit and, upon issuance of such permit in accordance with the procedures contained in this chapter, will be deemed approved for discharge into the POTW. The centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall comply with all applicable provisions contained in Section 13.21.070 of this chapter regarding permits. In furtherance of its obligations as control authority, the control authority may include in the permit a requirement to report at selected intervals the information mandated in subsections F.1. through F.6 of this section. All users granted a permit under this section shall maintain records which, at a minimum, identify the source, volume, character, and constituents of the wastewater accepted for treatment and disposal. These records may be reviewed at any time by the control authority. 
G.  Groundwater Discharges. Unless authorization has been granted by the control authority, the discharge of any groundwater into the POTW is prohibited. The control authority may authorize the discharge of groundwater resulting from maintenance and related activities of gas, steam, or electrical utilities through the use of general permits. Subject to appropriate reporting requirements, the general permit shall authorize discharge in accordance with the terms of the permit. Utilities shall comply with this provision within one hundred eighty (180) days after its enactment. If a person who proposes to discharge groundwater resulting from purge, response activity, or UST projects has applied for and received a permit from the control authority, the control authority may authorize the discharge of such wastewater. Permits shall be issued in accordance with the procedures contained in this chapter, or in accordance with any rules adopted by the board. 
H.  Right of Revision. The City of Livonia reserves the right to establish different or more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW. 
I.  Accidental Discharges. 
1.  Each industrial user which does not currently have an approved spill prevention plan or slug control plan shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter, and all significant industrial users shall submit to the control authority detailed plans which show facilities and operating procedures to be implemented to provide protection against such accidental discharges. Facilities and measures to prevent and abate accidental discharges shall be implemented, provided, and maintained at the owner's or industrial user's cost or expense. New significant industrial users shall submit such a plan prior to the time they commence discharging. 
For purposes of this section, the information provided shall include the approximate average and maximum quantities of such prohibited materials or substances kept on the premises in the form of raw materials, chemicals and/or waste therefrom and the containment capacity for each. Only substances that are in a form which could readily be carried into the POTW and constitute a concentration of five percent (5%) or greater in the raw material, chemical solution, or waste material are required to be reported. Volumes of less than fifty-five (55) gallons, or the equivalent thereof, need not be reported unless lesser quantities could cause pass-through or cause interference with the POTW. 
The industrial user shall promptly notify the control authority of any significant changes or modifications to the plan including, but not limited to, a change in the contact person or substance inventory. 
2.  At least once every two (2) years, the control authority shall evaluate whether a significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges, as defined by 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v). Unless otherwise provided, all significant users shall complete, implement, and submit such a plan within thirty (30) days of notification by the control authority. 
J.  Notification requirements. Unless a different notice is provided by this chapter or applicable law, within one (1) hour of becoming aware of a discharge into the POTW which exceeds or does not conform with federal, state, control authority or City of Livonia laws, rules, regulations or permit requirements, or which could cause problems to the POTW, or which has the potential to cause the industrial user to implement its plan prepared in accordance with this section, the industrial user shall telephone the control authority at its control center and notify the control authority of the discharge. The notification shall include the name of the caller, the location and time of discharge, the type of wastewater, the estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited pollutants and estimated volume, and the measures taken, or being taken, to abate the discharge into the POTW. Within five (5) calendar days after the discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences and when required by the control authority, the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit may be modified to include additional measures to prevent such future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, cost of treatment, loss, damages or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other environmental impairment or any other damage to person or property. 
K.  Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to contact in the event of an actual or potential excessive or prohibited discharge. 
L.  Recovery of Costs. Any user discharging in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter which produces a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the POTW, or causes the City of Detroit to violate its NPDES permit, shall be liable for any expense, loss, damage, penalty or fine incurred because of said violation or discharge. Prior to assessing such costs, the control authority shall notify the user of its determination that the user's discharge was the proximate cause of such damage, obstruction, impairment, or violation of the City of Detroit's NPDES permit and the intent to assess such costs to the user. Any such notice shall include written documentation which substantiates the determination of proximate cause and a breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Such charge shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, any penalties or remedies provided under this chapter, other ordinances, statutes, regulations or at law or in equity. 
M.  Hazardous Waste Notification. All industrial users who discharge into the city collection system shall notify the control authority in writing of any discharge of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(p). 
N.  Authorized Representative. The authorized representative, as defined in Section 13.21.030B. of this chapter, may designate a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in Section 13.21.030B.1. of this chapter where: 
1.  The authorization is made in writing by the individual defined in Section 13.21.030B.1 or 2.; 
2.  The authorization specifies either an individual or a position having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility where the industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager, operator of a well or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and 
3.  The written authorization is submitted to the control authority. 
O.  Pollution Prevention. The control authority shall encourage and support industrial users to develop and implement pollution prevention programs which eliminate or reduce pollutant contributions beyond the levels required by this division. The control authority may require an industrial user to implement pollution prevention initiatives as part of an enforcement response, or as necessary to comply with its NPDES permit. 
(Ord. 2840, § 2, 2009: Ord. 2518 § 1 (part), 2001: Ord. 2030 § 1 (part), 1990)  
13.21.060 - Fees for industrial users. 
A.  It is the purpose of this section to provide for the recovery of costs from industrial users of the POTW. The applicable charges or fees shall be sufficient to meet the costs of the operation, maintenance, improvement or replacement of the system or as provided by law, contractual agreement or board action. 
B.  Charges and fees shall include but not be limited to: 
1.  Fees for reimbursement of costs of establishing, operating, maintaining or improving the control authority's industrial waste control and pretreatment programs; 
2.  User fees based on volume of waste and concentration or quantity of specific pollutants in the discharge and treatment costs including sludge handling and disposal; 
3.  Reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs for hearings, including, but not limited to, expenses regarding hearings officers, court reporters, and transcriptions; and

(Ord. No. 2840, § 3, 2009: Ord. 2030 § 1 (part), 1990)  
13.21.070 - Wastewater discharge permits. 
A.  Required. It shall be unlawful for users to discharge into the POTW any wastewater which will cause interference or pass-through, or otherwise not comply with the discharge prohibitions of this chapter. It shall be unlawful for a significant industrial user to discharge into the POTW without a wastewater discharge permit from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the control authority through permit, order, rule or regulation, any discharge must be in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
1.  All significant industrial users which are in existence on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Significant industrial users who are currently operating with a valid wastewater discharge permit are not subject to this provision. These applications are to include all information specified in the applicable provisions of this chapter and, where applicable, any additional information which may be needed to satisfy the federal baseline monitoring report requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b). 
2.  All new significant users shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit at least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of discharge. The application must include all information specified in this chapter and, where applicable, any additional information that may be needed to satisfy the federal BMR requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b). Until a permit is issued and finalized by the control authority, no discharge shall be made into the POTW. 
3.  Any user who proposes to discharge any wastewater other than sanitary or noncontact cooling water into the POTW shall request approval from the control authority for the discharge(s) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of the discharge. 
B.  Permit Application or Reapplication. The control authority may require any user to complete a questionnaire and/or a permit application and to submit the same to the control authority for determining whether the industrial user is a significant user, or to determine changes in the wastewater discharges from a user's facility. Within thirty (30) days of being so notified, a user shall comply with the control authority's request in the manner and form prescribed by the control authority. Failure of the control authority to so notify a user shall not relieve the user of the duty to obtain a permit as required by this chapter. 
1.  A user which becomes subject to a new or revised national categorical pretreatment standard shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within ninety (90) days after the promulgation of the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard, unless an earlier date is specified or required by 40 CFR 403.12(b).

18.  Any other information as may reasonably be required to prepare and process a wastewater discharge permit. 
D.  Permit Issuance. Upon receipt of an application, the control authority shall review the application, determine and so notify the industrial user of any of the following: 
1.  The industrial user is not required to have a wastewater discharge permit; 
2.  The industrial user does not meet the definition of a significant industrial user but is found by the control authority to have no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, and is not required to have a wastewater discharge permit. The control authority shall make such determination in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6); 
3.  The application is incomplete or the information only partially satisfies the information and data required by 40 CFR 403.12 or the control authority, and that additional information and data are required which shall be promptly furnished. Where appropriate, the industrial user is notified regarding specific information that is missing, or that the application is unacceptable; 
4.  The industrial user is required to have a wastewater discharge permit. The control authority may withhold issuance of a permit to a significant user which has not submitted an adequate or timely report to the control authority in accordance with the baseline reporting requirements of 40 CFR 403.12, or whose discharge is in violation of this chapter. If the control authority determines that an industrial user is required to have a wastewater discharge permit and has evaluated and accepted the data furnished, the industrial user will be notified accordingly by certified mail. The notification shall contain a copy of the proposed permit, so marked, for the industrial user's review. An industrial user has thirty (30) days from the date of mailing to file a response to the draft permit and, in accordance with the procedures contained in this chapter, twenty (20) days from the date of mailing to file an appeal regarding a permit issued as final. Upon disposition by the control authority of any contested terms or conditions, a permit shall be issued as final. Only one (1) facility location shall be included in each permit. 
E.  Permit Conditions. Wastewater discharge permits shall contain all requirements of 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(iii) and shall be deemed to incorporate all provisions of this chapter, other applicable laws, rules, regulations, user charges and fees established without repetition therein. 
1.  Permits may also contain the following: 
a.  Limits on the average and maximum wastewater constituents or characteristics which are equivalent, more restrictive than or supplemental to the numeric limits enumerated in Section 13.21.050 of this chapter or the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards; 
b.  Limits on average and maximum rate and time of discharge or requirements for flow regulation and equalization; 
c.  Requirements for installation, operation and maintenance of discharge sampling manholes and monitoring facilities by the industrial user; 
d.  Restrictions on which of the user's discharge wastestreams are to be allowed to be discharged at each point of connection to the POTW;

f.  Requirements for the prevention of accidental discharges and the containment of spills or slug discharges; 
g.  Restrictions based on the information furnished in the application; 
h.  Additional reporting requirements: 
(i)  All permittees shall submit a report on the form prescribed by the control authority, or on an alternative form approved by the control authority, indicating the status of compliance with all conditions enumerated or referred to in the wastewater discharge permit, or made applicable to the permit by this chapter. Unless required more frequently, the reports shall be submitted at six-month intervals on a schedule to be established by the control authority. Analytical data generated by the control authority may not be submitted in lieu of the facility's own monitoring data as required by the wastewater discharge permit. 
(ii)  Permittees not subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or requirements shall submit a report in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The report shall show the concentration of each substance for which there is a specific limitation in the permit, or which may be identified by the control authority in accordance with this chapter. 
(iii)  Permittees subject to national categorical pretreatment standards or requirements shall submit compliance reports at the times and intervals specified by federal regulations and by the control authority. A compliance report shall be submitted to the control authority no later than ninety (90) days following the final compliance date for a standard, or in the case of a new source, no later than ninety (90) days, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, and in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(d). A report on continued compliance shall be submitted at six-month intervals thereafter on the schedule established by the control authority and incorporated into the industrial user's discharge permit and in accordance with Section 13.21.070E.1.h.(iv) and (v) of this chapter. The reports shall be either on a form prescribed by the control authority or on an alternate form approved by the control authority, and shall indicate the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process which are limited by national categorical pretreatment standards, for which there is a specific limitation in the permit, or which may be identified by the control authority in accordance with this chapter. The report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the discharges regulated by the permit. The combined wastestream formula may be used for reporting purposes after the initial information has been furnished to the control authority, provided there have been no changes to the elements composing the combined wastestream. 
(iv)  Reports shall contain the results of representative sampling performed during the period covered by the report and of the discharge and analysis of pollutants contained therein, and, for significant industrial users subject to production based standards, shall be cross-referenced to the related flow or production and mass as required to determine compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed in the applicable general pretreatment regulations, being 40 CFR part 403, or by the control authority, but no less than is necessary to assess and assure compliance by the industrial user with the most stringent applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. All sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with applicable regulations contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed using validated analytical methods approved by the administrator. 
If an industrial user monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the control authority using the procedures as prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in such report. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance practices and/or pretreatment system improvements or changes are necessary to bring the industrial user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. 
(v)  This report, and those required under this chapter, shall include the following certification statement: "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision, in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of a fine and/or imprisonment for knowing violations." Said certification shall be signed by the facility's authorized representative, as defined in this chapter. If an authorization is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of the authorized representative definition must be submitted to the control authority prior to, or together with, any reports to be signed by an authorized representative. 
(vi)  If sampling performed by a permittee indicates a violation, the user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four (24) hours of the time said user becomes, or should have become, aware of the violation. In addition, the user shall repeat the sampling and analysis, and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within thirty (30) days after said user becomes, or should have become, aware of the violation. 
(vii)  In the event the director determines that an industrial user is discharging substances in quality, quantity or at locations which may cause problems to the POTW or the receiving stream, the control authority has the authority to develop and enforce effluent limits applicable to the user. To the extent the control authority seeks to impose restrictions in a permit which are more restrictive than established in this chapter, the control authority shall provide written documentation to explain the greater restriction for protection against pass-through, interference, or violation of the NPDES permit; 
(viii)  Requirement for pollution prevention initiatives; and 
(ix)  Other requirements reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter. 
F.  Permit Duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period. Except as deemed necessary by the control authority, or as otherwise provided for under this chapter, permits shall be issued for a specified period of not more than five (5) years nor less than one (1) year. The existing permit for significant industrial users who timely submit an application for permit reissuance to the control authority shall be automatically extended until a permit is issued as final. 
G.  Permit Modification. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the control authority during the term of the permit as limitations or pretreatment standards and requirements as identified in Section 13.21.050 are amended or other just cause exists. Just cause for a permit modification includes, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
1.  Material or substantial changes to an industrial user's facility or operation or changes in the characteristics of the industrial user's effluent. It shall be the industrial user's duty to request an application form and apply for a modification of the permit within thirty (30) calendar days of the change; 
2.  Change(s) in the City of Detroit's NPDES permit; 
3.  Embodiment of the provisions of a legal settlement or court order; 
4.  Any changes necessary to allow the City of Detroit to fulfill its role as control authority; 
5.  An industrial user's noncompliance with portions of an existing permit; 
6.  A change of conditions within the POTW; 
7.  A finding of interference or pass-through attributable to the industrial user; 
8.  Amendments to, or promulgation of, national categorical pretreatment standards or requirements, including 40 CFR part 403. Permittees shall request an application form and apply to the control authority for a modified permit within ninety (90) days after the promulgation of a new or revised national categorical pretreatment standard to which the industrial user shall be subject. Information submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall be confined to that information related to the newly promulgated or amended national categorical pretreatment standard or requirement. However, information previously submitted need not be duplicated, insofar as the previously submitted information continues to be current and applicable. In addition, the department may initiate this action; 
9.  Changes in the monitoring location; 
10.  Typographical errors or omissions in permits; 
11.  The control authority may modify the permit on its own initiative based on its findings or reasonable belief of the above; or 
12.  The user may request a modification of the permit. 
When initiated by the control authority, the industrial user shall be informed of any proposed change in its permit. The control authority will issue a draft permit and an industrial user has thirty (30) days to file a response to the draft modified permit. Thereafter, the control authority will issue a final permit and, unless appealed in accordance with the procedures contained in this chapter, the permit will become effective twenty (20) days after issuance. 
H.  Permit Custody and Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific person as defined herein for a specific discharge. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a different person, new owner, new industrial user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without the written approval of the control authority and providing a copy of the existing permit to the new owner or operator. It shall be the permit holder's duty to notify the control authority of any such change within thirty (30) days of the change. Wastewater discharge permits which do not receive the written approval of the control authority prior to the change shall be null and void regardless of reassignment, or transfer, or sale. The control authority may revoke a permit if it determines that an unreported change has occurred. The control authority may require the application for a new or modified permit if a change takes place. Any succeeding person shall comply with the terms and conditions of any existing permit which the control authority allows to be retained. 
I.  Permit Notification Requirements. All industrial users shall promptly notify the control authority in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous waste for which initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p) has been made, request a permit application form, and apply for a modification of the permit at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the change. Failure of the industrial user to so apply shall be considered a violation of this chapter. 
(Ord. 2840, § 4, 2009: Ord. 2518 § 1 (part), 2001: Ord. 2030 § 1 (part), 1990)  
13.21.080 - Monitoring facilities. 
Significant users shall provide, operate and maintain at their own expense a sampling manhole or special structure to facilitate monitoring, inspection, sampling and flow measurement of their discharge by the control authority and the industrial user and to enable the control authority to conduct such other monitoring and sampling as required for determining compliance with discharge requirements, limits and standards as provided by this chapter. In the event the control authority determines that the monitoring facility identified in the permit application is inadequate, a new monitoring facility must be identified, or provided, which shall allow for collection of a representative sample of the wastewater discharged from the facility. Unless otherwise determined at the discretion of the control authority, said facility shall be provided within ninety (90) days of receipt of notification by the control authority. The industrial user shall provide the control authority with a drawing showing all sewer connections and sampling manholes by the size, location, elevation, and points or places of discharges into the POTW; and a flow schematic showing: (i) which connections receive each national categorical process wastestream, (ii) which connections receive stormwater, sanitary water or cooling water, and (iii) which lines handle each combined wastestream. This report shall be certified by a professional engineer. If a significant industrial user fails to install the monitoring facilities within the prescribed time limits, then the control authority may install such structure or device and the significant user shall reimburse the control authority for any costs incurred therein. The sampling manhole should be situated on the industrial user's premises in a location readily accessible to the control authority. It shall be the responsibility of the industrial user to obtain any necessary approvals from the city of Livonia or other government entities which may be required by the location and construction of monitoring facilities in the public street or sidewalk area. Such construction shall only occur when another location would be impractical or cause undue hardship upon the industrial users. In no case shall the location be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling or monitoring manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility and any permanently installed sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the industrial user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the control authority's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. (Ord. 2518 § 1 (part), 2001: Ord. 2030 § 1 (part), 1990)  
13.21.090 - Inspection, sampling and recordkeeping. 
For purposes of administering and enforcing this chapter, the control authority may inspect the establishment, facility or other premises of the industrial user. The control authority shall have ready access to the industrial user's premises to engage in inspection, sampling, compliance monitoring and/or metering activities. Each such inspection activity shall be commenced and completed at reasonable times, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner. The control authority shall, upon arrival at the industrial user's premises, inform the industrial user or the industrial user's employees that sampling and/or inspection is commencing and that the industrial user has the right to observe the inspection and/or sampling. The control authority shall neither refrain from, nor be prevented or delayed from, carrying out its inspection or sampling duties due to the unavailability of the authorized representative of the facility to observe or participate in the inspection or sampling activity. While performing work on private properties, employees or authorized representatives of the control authority and the city of Livonia shall observe all reasonable safety, security and other reasonable rules applicable to the premises established by the industrial user. Duly authorized employees or representatives of the control authority and the city of Livonia shall bear proper credentials and identification and shall be accompanied by a representative of the industrial user, at the industrial user's option. Duly authorized representatives of the control authority and the city of Livonia shall not be restricted from viewing any of the facility site. The control authority may take photographs of facilities subject to this chapter; said photographs shall be maintained by the control authority as confidential in accordance with this chapter. Where an industrial user has security measures in force, the industrial user shall make prompt and necessary arrangements with the security personnel so that upon presentation of appropriate credentials, the control authority will be permitted to enter immediately for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Significant users shall sample and analyze their discharges in accordance with the provisions of their permits. The control authority may require such samples to be split for the control authority's independent analysis. Industrial users shall maintain records of all information from monitoring activities required by this chapter or by 40 CFR Section 403.12(n). Industrial users shall maintain the records for no less than three (3) years. This period of record retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the industrial user or the operation of the city of Detroit's industrial waste program or when requested by the control authority, EPA or the state. Industrial users shall, upon the request of the control authority, furnish information and records relating to discharges to the POTW. Industrial users shall make such records readily accessible at all reasonable times, and allow the control authority to copy such records. In the event the control authority obtains samples, and analyses are made of such samples, a copy of the results of such analyses shall be promptly furnished upon written request by the industrial user's authorized representative. When requested by the industrial user, the control authority shall leave with the user a portion of any sample of the user's discharge taken from any sampling point on or adjacent to the premises for the user's independent analysis. In cases of disputes arising over shared samples, the portion taken and analyzed by the control authority shall be controlling unless proven invalid. In addition to any other violation caused by the discharge described herein, in the event a single grab sample of the industrial user's discharge is obtained and analyzed by the control authority in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136, and found to contain concentrations of pollutants which are two (2) or more times greater than the numeric limitations for composite samples as listed in Section 13.21.050 B of this chapter or as contained in the facility's wastewater discharge permit, the industrial user shall be required to provide a written report within fourteen (14) days describing the cause of greater concentration and a description of the means by which future discharge concentrations may be held to values of less than two (2) times the composite sample concentration limitation in the future. (Ord. 2518 § 1 (part), 2001: Ord. 2030 § 1 (part), 1990)  
13.21.100 - Confidential information. 
A.  Information and data on an industrial user obtained from written reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the control authority that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user. All claimed confidential information must be clearly marked "confidential." When requested by the person furnishing the report, the portions of a report determined by the control authority to disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that information shall be treated as confidential by the governmental agency, until such time as the information has been determined to be nonconfidential by the governmental agency. Confidential information on industrial users, which the control authority releases pursuant to a request of another governmental agency, should be handled by the other governmental agency pursuant to its own confidentiality procedures. The control authority cannot control how another governmental agency handles such confidential information, and assumes no responsibility for the disposition of the information released to the governmental agency. The control authority will use sufficient care to inform the other governmental agency of the existence of the industrial user's confidentiality claim. 
The control authority shall determine whether the information requested to be treated as confidential, in fact, satisfies the requirements of confidential information as defined herein. The decision of the control authority shall be made in writing. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. 
B.  Except as otherwise determined by the control authority or provided for by applicable law, all information with respect to an industrial user on file with the control authority shall be made available upon request by that user or the user's authorized representative during normal business hours. (Ord. 2518 § 1 (part), 2001: Ord. 2030 § 1 (part), 1990)  
13.21.110 - Statutes, laws and regulations. 
The national categorical pretreatment standards defined in 40 CFR, Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, shall be and are incorporated by reference herein and made a part hereof. Unless otherwise provided, any reference in this chapter to a code, standard, rule, regulation, or law enacted, adopted, established, or promulgated by any private organization, or any element or organization of government other than the city of Livonia shall be construed to apply only to such code, standard, rule, regulation, or law in effect or existence upon the date of enactment of this chapter. (Ord. 2518 § 1 (part), 2001: Ord. 2030 § 1 (part), 1990)  
13.21.120 - Enforcement. 
A.  Violations. It shall be a violation of this chapter for any user to: 
1.  Fail to completely and/or accurately report the wastewater constituents and/or characteristics of the industrial user's discharge; 
2.  Fail to report significant changes in the industrial user's operations or wastewater constituents and/or characteristics within the time frames provided in this chapter; 
3.  Refuse reasonable access to the industrial user's premises or waste discharge for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; 
4.  Restrict, lockout or prevent, directly or indirectly, access to any monitoring facilities constructed on public or private property. The locking or securing of the monitoring facility shall not constitute a violation pursuant to this subsection, provided that, upon request, reasonable access to the facility is promptly provided to the control authority; 
5.  Restrict, interfere, tamper with, or render inaccurate any of the control authority's monitoring devices including, but not limited to, samplers; 
6.  Fail to comply with any condition or requirement of the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit; 
7.  Fail to comply with any limitation, prohibition or requirement of this chapter including any rule, regulation or order issued hereunder. Industrial users acting in full compliance with wastewater discharge permits issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter, and such permits shall remain in effect and be enforceable under this chapter until a superseding permit is effective. Industrial users shall comply with National Categorical Pretreatment Standards and requirements on the date specified in the federal regulations, regardless of compliance schedules. 
B.  Upsets. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with national categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (1) are met. 
1.  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the specific cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
c.  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the control authority, orally or in writing, within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
(i)  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(ii)  The period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
(iii)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
2.  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
3.  The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with this chapter upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
C.  Bypass. Bypasses are prohibited unless the bypass does not cause a violation of pretreatment standards or requirements and is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system. Bypasses meeting both of these criteria are not subject to the provisions of this subsection. Bypasses not meeting the foregoing criteria shall be subject to all of the following: 
1.  Notice of Anticipated Bypass. Industrial users anticipating a bypass shall submit notice to the control authority at least ten (10) days in advance. 
2.  Notice of Unanticipated Bypass. An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the industrial user becomes or should have become aware of the bypass. A written submission shall be provided within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes or should have become aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue, and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
3.  Prohibition of Bypass and Enforcement. Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user properly notified the control authority as described in subsection C.1. or 2. of this section. 
4.  Bypass Approval. Where it meets all conditions in subsection C.3. of this section, the control authority may approve an anticipated bypass. 
D.  Where one (1) or more of the measurements taken for any pollutant defined in Section 13.21.050B.2. of this chapter during a six-month period exceed by any magnitude the daily maximum non-detect limit for the same parameter, the industrial user may develop and implement pollution prevention initiatives, or a BMP, as part of its response. The department may, as part of an administrative order, also require development of a BMP as a part of the department's enforcement response. Upon approval of the department, these pollution prevention initiatives or BMPs shall be made an enforceable part of the wastewater discharge permit. Industrial users shall provide, at six (6) month intervals, analytical results and certification supporting their implementation of an approved pollution prevention initiative or BMP. Upon demonstration of compliance, the industrial user may request to be relieved of this implementation requirement. 
E.  Emergency Suspensions and Orders. The control authority may order suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit where such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the control authority, to stop any actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, interferes or may interfere with the POTW, or causes or may cause the City of Detroit to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Any person notified of a suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event the control authority provides informal notification under this section, written confirmation and an order shall be provided within twenty-four (24) hours. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with any suspension or revocation order, the control authority shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection or services, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or danger to any individual or the environment. In the event such steps are taken, the director shall notify the industrial user in writing within twenty-four (24) hours of such action and the specific recourse available. In any event, the control authority shall provide the industrial user with an opportunity for a hearing before the director or his designated representative within ten (10) days of such action. The control authority shall notify the City of Livonia of this action within ten (10) days of such action. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement to the control authority and the City of Livonia within fifteen (15) days of the occurrence describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. Upon proof of elimination of the non-complying discharge, the control authority shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the sewer or wastewater treatment service. 
F.  Notice of Violation. Except in the case of an actual or threatened discharge as specified in subparagraph E. of this section, whenever the control authority has reason to believe that any industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, the control authority shall serve upon such industrial user a written notice stating the nature of the violation. 
G.  Notice of Control Authority Action. The City of Livonia or designated department thereof shall be notified by the control authority of any enforcement activity taken within its boundaries. 
H.  Administrative Actions. Whenever the director has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, or a pretreatment standard or requirement or any prohibition of this chapter, the director, except in the case of emergency or flagrant violation, may initiate appropriate administrative enforcement action in order to compel the user to eliminate or to remedy such violation as soon as possible. 
1.  Conferences. 
a.  The control authority may order any person who violates this chapter to attend a conference wherein the control authority may endeavor to cause the user to eliminate or remedy the violation by establishing an enforceable compliance schedule. The notice of violation shall be served at least ten (10) days before the scheduled conference and shall set forth the date, time, and place thereof. The conference shall be conducted by a representative of the control authority. The industrial user shall present a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with this chapter. Nothing contained herein shall require the control authority to accept or agree to any proposed plan or schedule, or to prevent the control authority from proceeding with a show cause hearing as set forth in subsection H.2. of this section. If the attendees agree upon a compliance schedule, the user and the control authority's duly authorized representative may enter, by consent, into a compliance agreement or an administrative order setting forth the terms of such agreement. An industrial user must exhibit good faith and expeditious efforts to comply with this chapter and any procedures, requirements, and agreements hereunder. 
b.  Compliance Schedules. The user and the control authority may agree upon a schedule which sets forth the terms and conditions, and time periods or schedules for completion of actions to remedy or to eliminate the causes of violation. These schedules may be developed as part of a compliance agreement, or an administrative consent order. Schedules developed under this subsection shall adhere to the following conditions: 
(i)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of upgraded or additional pretreatment facilities, or to the implementation of additional operation and maintenance procedures required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment requirements and standards including, but not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, and completing construction; 
(ii)  No single increment referred to in subsection H.1.b.(i) of this section shall exceed nine (9) months; 
(iii)  Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the control authority including, at a minimum, whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason(s) for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule; and 
(iv)  Any deviations from the compliance schedule may result in the industrial user being found in violation of this chapter. 
c.  Administrative Orders. The control authority may order any industrial user, who violates or continues to violate this chapter or a duly issued permit, to install and to properly operate devices, treatment facilities, or other related appurtenances. In addition, orders may contain such other requirements as might reasonably be necessary and appropriate to address the violation including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices, implementation of a waste minimization assessment to identify and implement feasible source reduction, and recycling practices to reduce the generation or release of pollutants at the facility. An order may be either an administrative consent order, which is the result of an agreement, or a unilateral administrative order. 
2.  Show Cause Hearing. The control authority may order any industrial user who violates this chapter, or allows such violation to occur, to show cause before the control authority why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the industrial user specifying the time and place of a hearing before the control authority regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the industrial user to show cause before the control authority why any proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten (10) days before the hearing, with copies sent to the City of Livonia. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation or authorized representative. 
a.  Hearing Proceeding. A representative of the control authority shall conduct the show cause hearing and take the evidence, and may: 
(i)  Issue, in the name of the board, notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of the witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings; 
(ii)  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the director for action thereon. 
At any show cause hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony shall be recorded by a court reporter. 
3.  Actions. After a show cause hearing has been conducted, unless the hearing officer finds that the user has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that no violation of this chapter and/or the user's duly issued permit occurred, the hearings officer shall issue an order to the industrial user directing any of the following actions: 
a.  Immediate compliance with the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit or with any applicable limitation, condition, restriction or requirement of this chapter or applicable local, state or federal law or regulation; 
b.  Pretreatment of waste by installation of adequate treatment equipment or proper operation and maintenance of existing treatment equipment to be accomplished within a specified time period. Sewer or wastewater treatment service may be discontinued upon failure to comply; 
c.  Submission of compliance reports on effluent quality and quantity as determined by self-monitoring and analysis during a specified time period; 
d.  Submission of periodic reports on effluent quality and quantity as determined by self-monitoring and analysis throughout the final period set by a compliance date; 
e.  Control of discharge quantities; 
f.  Payment of costs for reasonable and necessary inspection, monitoring and administration of the industrial user's activities by the control authority during compliance efforts; and/or 
g.  Any such other orders as are appropriate, including, but not limited to, immediate termination of sewer or wastewater treatment services or revocation of a wastewater discharge permit or orders directing that following a specified time period, sewer or wastewater treatment service will be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or operation and maintenance practices have been employed. 
4.  Public Notification of Significant Noncompliance. The control authority shall publish in the largest daily newspaper, published in the municipality in which the POTW is located, a list of all industrial users which were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements at any time during the previous twelve (12) months. All industrial users identified in a proposed publication shall be provided a copy of that proposed notice at least thirty (30) days before publication and allowed an opportunity to comment as to its accuracy. 
I.  Legal Actions. 
1.  Criminal Action. Any user who violates any provision of this chapter, including the failure to pay any fees, charges, or surcharges imposed hereby, or any condition or limitation of a permit issued pursuant thereto or who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter or wastewater discharge permit or who tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device required under this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for each violation or by imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days or by both. The control authority is hereby authorized to seek, through its counsel, prosecution of criminal charges against any person violating any provision of this chapter. 
2.  Civil Action. Whenever the control authority has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, a pretreatment standard or requirement or any requirement of this chapter, the director may commence a civil action to compel compliance in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the user from discharging, and/or to obtain appropriate relief to remedy the violations. The control authority or board may also seek additional legal and/or equitable relief. The commencement of suit does not constitute an exclusive election of remedies and does not prohibit the control authority, director, board, City of Detroit or the City of Livonia from commencing action in federal court for discharges believed to be in violation of this chapter, state and federal requirements contained in the Clean Water Act, the City of Detroit's NPDES permit or other applicable laws or requirements. In addition, the City of Detroit and/or the City of Livonia may recover the reasonable attorney fees, court costs, court reporters' fees and other unusual expenses related to enforcement activities or litigation against the person found to have violated this chapter or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder. 
3.  All fines, costs, and penalties which are imposed by any court of competent jurisdiction shall be payable to the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and the City of Livonia where applicable.

Industrial waste pollutant strength surcharges are adopted herein, made effective with the first billing on and after July 1, 2019, for users of the wastewater system of the City of Livonia, and are to be computed as follows: 
Computation of Industrial Waste Pollutant 
Strength Surcharge 
The industrial waste pollutant strength surcharge shall be computed in accordance with the following formula: 
SC 	= 	0.0624 V [a (BOD-275) + b (TSS-350) + c (P-12) + d (FOG-100)] 
Where: 		
SC 	= 	Pollutant strength surcharge fee in dollars for the billing period. 
V 	= 	Volume of waste discharged in the billing period in Mcf (1,000 cubic feet). 
BOD 	= 	Five-day biochemical oxygen demand of the waste expressed in milligrams per liter (ppm). 
TSS 	= 	Total suspended solids in the waste expressed in milligrams per liter (ppm). 
P 	= 	Phosphorus in the waste expressed in milligrams per liter (ppm). 
FOG 	= 	Fats, oils, and grease in the waste expressed in milligrams per liter (ppm). 
a, b, c, d 	= 	Surcharge rates in dollars/pound for treating BOD, TSS, P and FOG, respectively. 
0.624 	= 	Factor which converts Mcf to MM lbs. 
a 	= 	dollars/pound for treating BOD = $ 0.491/pound greater than 275 mg/l. 
b 	= 	dollars/pound for treating TSS = $ 0.499/pound greater than 350 mg/l. 
c 	= 	dollars/pound for treating P = $ 7.354/pound greater than 12 mg/l. 
d 	= 	dollars/pound for treating FOG = $ 0.473/pound greater than 100 mg/l.

If a contractor has been hired to erect the fence or privacy screen, then such person, firm or corporation shall be responsible for obtaining the permit. In the event of a violation of this section, either the owner of the property or the contractor or both may be prosecuted for such violation. Where an owner desires to make minor repairs such as painting or staining, a permit will not be required. A permit is not required for a decorative fence used as a landscape treatment or hedge providing that its sole purpose is for an ornamental effect, and that it is erected or planted, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions cited for residential districts in this chapter. (Ord. 2676, § 2, 2004: Ord. 2176 § 1 (part), 1993; Ord. No. 2676, § 2, 2004)

A.  An application for a fence permit shall be made upon forms provided for this purpose by the department and shall include: 
1.  Plans and specifications showing the dimensions, materials and details of erecting the fence; 
2.  A plot plan of the premises on which the proposed fence is to be erected, showing the property lines, the location of any buildings on the lot, and the position of the fence in relation to adjoining streets, houses, buildings, structures and driveways, and also showing the precise location of the fence posts proposed to be used with reference to the lot lines and that the posts will be located on the inside of the fence, or centered, unless otherwise specified in a written agreement between the adjoining lot owners; 
3.  Written consent of the adjoining property owner(s) as to the erection of a privacy fence, as set forth in Section 15.44.090(B);

5.  Such other information as the department may require to show full compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
B.  A permit shall be issued by the department only after it has reviewed the completed application and has determined that the proposed fence or privacy screen complies with all city ordinances. (Ord. 2176 § 1 (part), 1993)  
15.44.070 - Prohibited fences. 
A.  Barbed Wire. It shall be unlawful for any person or his/her lessee or agent to either construct or maintain a barbed wire fence, partially or wholly, between or abutting any residential properties, or in or along any street or in front of any public place or space; provided, however, that in the case of manufacturing plants that do not abut residential property, or public utility installations in any zoning district, stranded barbed wire may be installed on the top of fences, on arms or cradles extending inward over the private property side of the owner of the fences at least six (6) feet above the adjacent grade. No coils of barbed wire, concertina wire or razor wire is permitted in any zoning district.

It shall be unlawful for any person or his/her lessee or agent to either construct or maintain a fence with sharp or pointed tops, broken glass, affixed spikes, projecting nails or other pointed instruments of any kind or description. Gates shall not be constructed to pose a hazard to the public so that when open or partially open they project a pointed member. 
C.  Electrical Fences. It shall be unlawful for any person or his/her lessee or agent to erect, build, construct or maintain any fence charged or connected with an electrical current that would conduct the current to persons, animals or things which may come in contact with the charged fence. This provision shall not be construed to apply to below-ground electric fences. 
D.  Material. Fences shall be constructed of new material only, unless such other material shall have first been examined by the inspection department and been found to be in sound and usable condition and suitable for fencing purposes. Plastic or other type of strips intertwined in chain link or other kinds of woven wire fencing shall be prohibited, as well as fences constructed of opaque fiberglass panels.

3.  Fences at the rear of double frontage lots shall have a setback from the rear lot line abutting the street, equal to the minimum required front yard of the property being fenced. 
4.  Fences on corner lots shall not be located within the corner side yard unless all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The proposed fence will not, in the opinion of the police department, block any portion of the view which drivers on either of the intersecting streets would have of traffic on the other street, or any driveway, if the fence had been built at the corner side yard line; 
b.  That portion of the proposed fence in the corner side yard which parallels the street 
i.  Aligns with any corresponding fence on an adjacent property; and

D.  All supporting posts, cross-members and protruding bolts, screws and/or hardware of all fences and privacy screens shall be inside the lot and face toward the interior of the lot of the person erecting the fence or privacy screen, except that the supporting posts of a privacy fence may be centered with the panels of the fence (i.e., board on board or good both sides). 
E.  Dog runs shall be permitted in the rear yard only, shall not be closer than ten (10) feet from a side or rear lot line, shall not exceed six (6) feet in height, and shall be subject to the area limitations for accessory buildings provided for in Section 18.24 of the Zoning Ordinance, as amended, and in no event shall exceed a maximum ground area of two hundred (200) square feet.

No fence or landscape treatment shall be located nearer than two (2) feet from a side lot line which is adjacent to a driveway on an abutting property. Cyclone or chain link fencing shall not be considered landscape treatment for the purpose of this section of the ordinance. (Ord. No. 3075, § 1, 9-17-2018; Ord. No. 3049, § 1, 4-23-2018; Ord. 2676, § 3, 2004: Ord. 2176 § 1 (part), 1993)  
15.44.100 - Industrial district regulations. 
A.  Subject to the provisions of this chapter, a suitable fence not to exceed eight (8) feet in height may be erected around an area zoned for industrial uses; provided, however, that no fence shall be erected in a front yard or extend toward the front of the lot nearer than the front building line or the minimum required front yard, whichever results in the greater setback. 
B.  Fences on corner lots shall not be located within the minimum required corner side yard of the property being fenced. 
C.  No fence shall be constructed whose gates or entrances may obstruct any street, alley, sidewalk or any other public passageway. (Ord. 2676, § 4, 2004: Ord. 2176 § 1 (part), 1993; Ord. No. 2676, § 4, 2004)  
15.44.110 - Parks, schools and public buildings. 
Fences which enclose municipal parks, public and parochial school grounds, public buildings or land used for golf courses or similar recreational facilities, shall not exceed eight (8) feet in height, measured from the surface of the ground, and shall be constructed of chain link or ornamental iron material. (Ord. 2176 § 1 (part), 1993)  
15.44.120 - Maintenance and repair. 
In all zoning districts, all fences and the ground adjacent thereto, shall be maintained in a neat and safe condition at all times so as not to endanger life or property or present an unsightly appearance. 
A.  Stability. A fence shall be stable and properly supported. Fence posts shall be at right angles to the horizon and not be raised above grade as a result of frost heave. All fences built or repaired shall have posts made of either iron pipe one and five eighths (1 5/8 ) inches outside diameter, or wood posts four (4) inches in diameter, or concrete posts four (4) inches across, or any other approved material of equal stability sunk in the soil at least three (3) feet and shall not be further than ten (10) feet apart. Metal terminal posts and gate posts shall not be less than two (2) inches outside diameter. 
B.  Protective Coatings. Wood fences shall be protected from deterioration with properly applied paint or other protective coating, with the exception of redwood and cedar fences or fences constructed with pressure-treated lumber. Metal fences or metal fence parts subject to corrosion shall be properly painted or coated to prevent deterioration. 
C.  Maintenance. Fences shall be maintained to retain their original shape and configuration. Elements of the fence that are missing, damaged, destroyed or affected by deterioration or neglect shall either be replaced or repaired to maintain conformity with the original fence design or the fence shall be removed completely. Any fence required by the Zoning Ordinance for a specific use, or to secure a swimming pool, shall be maintained in accordance with this section or replaced. 
1.  Any person who erects, builds or constructs or who contracts with another or causes another to erect, build or construct any fence or privacy screen upon property which such person owns or leases shall be responsible for the repair, upkeep and maintenance of the fence or privacy screen, and any area adjacent thereto. 
2.  Any person who owns property upon which a fence or privacy screen has been constructed by a previous owner shall be responsible for the care, upkeep and maintenance of the fence or privacy screen. If a previously constructed fence is located upon a lot line, each successive owner of the fence shall be responsible for its care, upkeep and maintenance. If ownership of the fence located upon a lot line is joint, or in the opinion of the inspection department, cannot reasonably be determined, the department shall have the authority to require any or all property owners abutting the fence to be responsible for the care, upkeep and maintenance of the fence facing his/her property. The department shall not be required to have a property survey performed to determine ownership in any case. For the purposes of this paragraph, the "owner of a fence" shall be deemed to be any person, persons or their successors who purchase or otherwise acquire the property from the person who originally erected or caused a fence to be erected thereon. 
3.  Existing fences may also be removed from lot lines upon written mutual consent of the adjoining lot owner(s). The cost and responsibility of erecting, maintaining or removing such fences may be shared, by written mutual consent of the owners of the adjoining lots, on such basis as may be agreed upon by the parties. The inspection department will not be responsible for enforcing any such agreement. 
D.  Workmanship. All work performed under the provisions of this chapter shall be constructed and performed in a sound and workmanlike manner. (Ord. 2176 § 1 (part), 1993)  
15.44.130 - Unsafe or dangerous fences—Failure to maintain. 
A.  No owner, occupant or agent in charge of property shall keep or maintain any fence which is unsafe or dangerous. Any fence which, through lack of repair, type of construction or otherwise, endangers life or property is hereby deemed a nuisance. A fence shall be deemed unsafe or dangerous whenever: 
1.  More than fifty percent (50%) of the fence area is in need of paint, stain or other minor repair; 
2.  Any portion has been damaged by wind, flood, fire or other cause in such a manner that structural strength or stability is appreciably less than it was previous to such event; 
3.  Any portion of any structural member of the fence is likely to fall, to become detached or dislodged or to collapse and thereby injure persons or damage property; 
4.  More than ten percent (10%) of the fence area is in need of major repair. 
B.  The building official may inspect any fence to determine whether it conforms with the provisions of this chapter. Any person who erects, constructs, builds or causes to be erected, built or constructed a fence, or has property upon which a fence is located shall permit the building official access to inspect said fence to determine whether it complies with the provisions of this chapter. When the building official finds upon inspection, or receives a complaint that a fence has not been constructed, maintained or repaired as required by the provisions of this chapter, the building official shall serve on the owner, agent or person in control of the property upon which such fence is located, a written notice describing the unsafe condition and specifying the required repairs or modifications to be made to render the fence safe or requiring the unsafe fence or any portion thereof to be removed, and shall provide a time limit for such repair, modification or removal. (Ord. 2176 § 1 (part), 1993)  
15.44.140 - Enforcement of chapter provisions. 
The enforcement of this chapter is hereby delegated to the building official. (Ord. 2176 § 1 (part), 1993)  
15.44.150 - Limitations on enforcement. 
Real property may be subject to building and use restrictions, covenants and conditions which run with the land and which may regulate fences and hedges. Such regulations are not enforceable by the city, but may be enforced by similarly regulated property owners through court action. The city of Livonia shall not be responsible for the enforcement of any agreement relative to mutual or separate payment for the cost of construction of fences, nor shall the city be responsible for the determination of the location of any fence to be erected, built or constructed on a lot line. (Ord. 2176 § 1 (part), 1993)  
15.44.160 - Appeals. 
Any person who has been refused a fence permit by the inspection department may appeal to the zoning board of appeals for a modification of any of the provisions of this chapter by filing an appeal in accordance with the procedures established in Article XXI of the Zoning Ordinance. 
A.  The concurring vote of a majority of the members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the building official, or to decide in favor of the applicant in order to grant a modification from the provisions of this chapter, and only upon a finding of all of the following: 
1.  The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the property do not generally apply to other properties in the city, would render compliance with the provisions of this chapter difficult, and would likely result in a particular hardship on the person erecting the fence as distinguished from inconvenience of the chapter requirements or a desire to increase financial gain or avoid the financial expense of compliance. A person seeking erection of a fence shall not be deemed to have suffered a particular hardship or practical difficulty by being unable to obtain the written consent of his or her adjoining property owner for the erection of such fence; 
2.  Strict enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would serve no useful purpose; 
3.  The type of fence and the location proposed would not pose a significant risk to the public health, safety and welfare. 
B.  The board may take into consideration recorded deed restrictions or covenants which regulate or prohibit fences on the subject property. 
C.  In granting a modification from the strict letter of the provisions of this chapter, the board may modify any fence proposal or place reasonable conditions or restrictions upon issuance of a permit. 
D.  The action of the board in granting a modification hereunder shall not in any manner whatsoever be construed as constituting a waiver or variation of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, as amended, of the city. (Ord. 2176 § 1 (part), 1993)

15.51.010 - Findings. 
The city council determines that the presence of vacant and abandoned structures creates blight. It is recognized that blight lowers property values, leads to deteriorating conditions, undermines the quality of life, affects the public health, safety and general welfare and also results in human injury and criminal activities. It is also determined that vacant and unoccupied structures demand an inordinate amount of city administrative and ordinance enforcement resources. As such, the city council finds the prolonged presence of vacant and abandoned structures to be unacceptable to the citizens of Livonia.

5.  The reference to "related companies" in Section 5-1805(p) of the Franchise [Most Favored Nations Clause] will be deemed to include, but will not be limited to, the partners of TWE-A/N, and any parent or subsidiary of TWE-A/N. Without limiting the foregoing, Section 5-1805(p) will apply to any cable systems in Michigan acquired by TWE-A/N, Time Warner, Inc., or their affiliates from Cablevision Industries. The term "affiliate" means any individual, partnership, association, joint venture, trust, corporation, or other person or entity who owns or controls, or is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with the entity in question. 
6.

8.

9.  TWE-A/N acknowledges and warrants that it has carefully read and fully comprehends the terms and conditions of the Franchise. 
10.  TWE-A/N acknowledges that Section 2.100.030(B)(2) of the Livonia Cable Television Regulatory Ordinance (No. 1651) is applicable to the process by which TWE-A/N has obtained the City's authorization for transfer of the Franchise. 
11.  Customer Service. TWE-A/N will provide at minimum substantially the same quality of customer service that MetroVision has provided in the past, but no less than the quality of service required by the Franchise or applicable FCC regulations. 
12.  Prior Defaults. TWE-A/N agrees that it will not contend directly or indirectly that any defaults or failures to comply with the Franchise or other matters set forth in 47 USC § 546(c)(1)(A) (Communications Act of 1934, Section 626(c)(1)(A)) (collectively "defaults") by MetroVision occurring prior to transfer of the Franchise to TWE-A/N are waived, including but not limited to the following:

c.  The ability of the City to enforce in the future any franchise terms which may not have been enforced in the past. 
13.  TWE-A/N acknowledges that it is the intent of both TWE-A/N and the City that the transfer of the Franchise, the consent process, the City's Resolution and Ordinance authorizing the transfer, and this Assumption Agreement do not provide any basis for increasing the amounts paid by subscribers through cost pass-throughs as so-called "external costs" or as new franchise requirements or in any other manner and cannot be used to offset any amounts due to the City, now or in the future, as franchise fees; provided further, that TWE-A/N shall not be determined to have waived any rights it may have to assert any other basis to pass through costs under applicable law or FCC rules and regulations. 
14.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Assumption Agreement and the Franchise, that provision which provides the greatest benefit to the City, in the opinion of the City, shall prevail. 
15.  TWE-A/N makes the following representations and warranties in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 5-1806(b) of the Franchise: 
a.  Neither TWE-A/N nor its partners, nor the officers, directors or persons having a legal or equitable interest of five percent (5%) or more in any of them:

(1)  If Franchisee contends it is permitted to provide any non-Cable Services it shall give written notice of same to Municipality pursuant to Section 5-2019.E at least thirty (30) days before offering any such services in Municipality. This Ordinance does not constitute a municipal grant of the permit which may be required by Michigan law for access to and the ongoing use of rights-of-way, easements, and public places by certain providers of telecommunications services. Any permit which may be required by Act No. 216 of the Public Acts of 1995 or other Michigan law must be obtained separately from Municipality. 
(2)  Cable Services shall conform to the following specifications: At least seventy (70) activated and programmed channels of programming. 
(3)  Municipality and Franchisee agree that as of the Effective Date, Cable Modem Service is included within "cable service" as such term is defined in the Federal Cable Act and should be treated as Cable Service under this Franchise, including with respect to the payment of franchise fees on revenues derived from the provision of Cable Modem Service. If based on subsequent developments Franchisee concludes that Cable Modem Service is not included within "cable service" as defined in the Federal Cable Act or other applicable law and should not be treated as such under this Franchise, including not paying franchise fees on revenues from Cable Modem Service, then Franchisee will give Municipality six (6) months written notice pursuant to Section 5-2019.E prior to the date on which it ceases to pay franchise fees on the revenues from such service. Similarly, if based on subsequent developments Municipality concludes that Cable Modem Service is not included within "cable services" as defined in the Federal Cable Act or other applicable law and that Franchisee should not have the authority under this Franchise to provide Cable Modem Service, then Municipality may revoke such authority under this Franchise by giving Franchisee six (6) months written notice of same pursuant to Section 5-2019.E. 
(4)  The franchise fee payable to Municipality on gross revenues from Cable Modem Service shall not exceed five percent (5%) of such revenues. If in the future Franchisee is required other than under this Franchise to pay a fee to Municipality on gross revenues from Cable Modem Service then the franchise fee on such revenues payable under this Franchise shall abate to the extent necessary to reduce the total of such fees paid Municipality to five percent (5%) of gross revenues from Cable Modem Service. 
B.  Additional Services. This Ordinance may be amended by mutual agreement to allow the provision of such additional services not already authorized by this Franchise or the Cable Ordinance as may be agreed to by Franchisee and Municipality, or permission for the provision of additional services may be granted by a separate document. 
C.  No Priority. This Ordinance does not establish any priority for the use of the streets and Public Rights-of-Way by Franchisee or by any present or future franchisees or other permit holders. In the event of any dispute as to the priority of use of the Public Rights-of-Way, the first priority shall be to the public generally, the second priority to Municipality, the third priority to the State of Michigan and its political subdivisions in the performance of their various functions, and thereafter, as between franchisees and other permit holders, as determined by Municipality in the exercise of its powers, including the police power and other powers reserved to and conferred on it by the State of Michigan. Such powers shall be exercised in a non-discriminatory manner and consistent with a policy of permitting maximum use of the rights-of-way and with a policy of not requiring parties to bear the costs of rearranging their facilities in order to accommodate the facilities of non-governmental entities. 
D.  Easements and Public Rights-of-Way. The parties acknowledge and agree that the purpose of the Franchise is to authorize Franchisee to construct, reconstruct, maintain and operate an Cable System and offer Cable Service in, along, among, upon, across, above, over or under the Public Rights-of-Way within Municipality. To the extent allowed by applicable state and federal law, this Ordinance authorizes the construction and reconstruction of the Cable System over Public Rights-of-Way, and through easements, within the Authorized Area and which have been dedicated for compatible uses, subject to the requirements in the balance of this Section and this Ordinance. In using all Public Rights-of-Way and easements Franchisee shall comply with all federal, state and, subject to Section 5-2019.D below, local laws and regulations of general applicability governing the construction, reconstruction, installation, operation and maintenance of a Cable System. 
E.  Authority Not Exclusive. The Franchise and the grant of authority for use of streets, sidewalks, easements and Public Rights-of-Way as conferred in this Section are nonexclusive. Franchisee shall respect the rights and property of Municipality and other authorized users of streets, sidewalks, easements and Public Rights-of-Way, and property owners. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, disputes between Franchisee and parties other than Municipality over the use, pursuant to this Franchise, of the streets, sidewalks, easements and other Public Rights-of-Way shall be submitted to Municipality for resolution. 
F.  Most Favored Nations. 
(1)  Municipality specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, one (1) or more additional franchises for a Cable System in accordance with state and federal law. In the event a future such franchise is granted on terms and conditions which, when considered as a whole, are more favorable or less burdensome than those contained herein, when also considered as a whole, then Franchisee shall proceed as set forth in subsection (3) below to obtain an amendment such that this Franchise considered as a whole is not more burdensome or less favorable than the other franchise (also considered as a whole). 
(2)  If after the Effective Date Franchisee or an Affiliate enters into a cable franchise or other agreement relating to Cable Services with any municipality in Wayne, Oakland, Macomb or Washtenaw Counties that contains terms that are more favorable to Municipality or its residents than the terms of this Franchise on (a) the non-video Cable Services that the Franchisee/Affiliate provides to subscribers, (b) the numbers or technological types (such as analog, digital or HDTV) of video channels the Franchisee/Affiliate provides to subscribers, (c) cable system upgrades or (d) customer service standards then, provided that there is an adequate time period under this Franchise for Franchisee to recover the costs of meeting any such requirement from the revenues generated thereby with respect to the terms (a), (b), or (c) or that there is an adequate time period under this Franchise so that the costs of meeting such requirement when recovered through subscriber rates do not cause a significant increase in subscriber rates with respect to term (d), Municipality shall proceed as set forth in subsection (3) below to obtain an amendment such that this Franchise contains the more favorable terms. 
(3)  Franchisee or Municipality, as the case may be, shall notify the other party in writing that it believes it is entitled to the matter or item in question, setting forth in detail its reasoning and the specific amendment it is requesting. The other party shall respond in writing within thirty (30) days, and the parties shall meet within thirty (30) thereafter, or such later time as they may mutually agree, to attempt to resolve the matter. Neither party may unilaterally implement any portion of the amendment requested, such as by "self help". Neither party may go to court on the matter in question until ninety (90) days have elapsed since the initial notification, but may do so after the ninetieth (90 th ) day if the matter is not resolved by then. 
G.  No Burden on Public Rights-of-Way: Franchisee shall not erect, install, construct, reconstruct, repair, replace or maintain its Cable System in such a fashion as to unduly burden the present or future use of the streets or Public Rights-of-Way. If Municipality in its reasonable judgment determines that any portion of the Cable System is an undue burden, Franchisee at its expense shall modify its Cable System or take such other actions as the Municipality may determine is in the public interest to remove or alleviate the burden, and Franchisee shall do so within the time period established by the Municipality. 
H.  Relocation of the Cable System: Franchisee shall, at its own cost and expense, protect, support, disconnect, relocate or remove from the streets or Public Rights-of-Way any portion of the Cable System when reasonably required to do so by Municipality due to street or other public excavation, construction, reconstruction, repair, grading, regarding; traffic conditions; the installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power or signal lines, trackways or tracks; municipally owned facilities; or the vacation, construction, reconstruction or relocation of streets or any other type of public structure; or other improvements by the Municipality or another public agency or any other type of improvement which the Municipality reasonably deems necessary for the public health, safety or welfare. Municipality may temporarily disconnect, remove or relocate any of the Franchisee's facilities which have not been disconnected, removed or relocated within a reasonable period of time after a request from Municipality and Franchisee shall reimburse Municipality its entire expense including a reasonable cost of overhead. 
I.  Weather: Underground installations are allowed upon Franchisee obtaining appropriate permits, including insuring that weather conditions allow proper restoration of disturbed areas in a timely manner. 
J.  Restoration of Property: Franchisee shall restore at its sole cost and expense, within ten (10) working days, or such reasonable additional time as specified by the Mayor, in accordance with the Municipal Code and ordinances and standards established by the Mayor, any portion of the Streets or Public Rights-of-Way that is in any way disturbed by the construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance or repair of the Cable System to as good or better condition than existed previously. In addition, Franchisee shall at its sole cost and expense restore and replace any other property, real or personal, disturbed, damaged or in any way injured by or on account of Franchisee or by its acts or omissions, to the same condition as such property was in immediately prior to the disturbance, damage or injury. In the event that Franchisee and its contractors and subcontractors fail to make such repair within the time specified by Municipality, Municipality shall be entitled to complete the repair and Franchisee shall pay the costs of Municipality for such repair. 
K.  Barriers: While any portion of the streets of Public Rights-of-Way are open, Franchisee shall maintain reasonable barriers, lights at night and other warnings to the users of the streets or Public Rights-of-Way in compliance with applicable government regulations requiring and pertaining to such barriers. 
L.  Traffic Control: For all work in the Public Rights-of-Way which may disturb the normal flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic, Franchisee shall employ roadway closure or partial closure practices, as delineated in the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the standards established by the Mayor. 
M.  Minimum Interference: The Cable System shall be erected and maintained by Franchisee so as to cause the minimum interference with the use of the Public Rights-of-Way and with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners. 
N.  Map Accuracy: The Municipality does not guarantee the accuracy of any maps showing the horizontal or vertical location of existing substructures. In Public Rights-of-Way, where necessary, the location shall be verified by excavation. 
O.  Tree Trimming: Franchisee may trim trees upon and overhanging the Public Rights-of-Way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with the Cable System. No trimming shall be performed in the Public Rights-of-Way without previously informing Municipality. Except in emergencies all trimming of trees on public property shall have the advance approval of Municipality and all trimming of trees on private property shall require notice to the property owner. 
P.  Trees and Landscaping: The following applies to trees or shrubs within the streets or Public Rights-of-Way. 
(1)  Trees or shrubs to be transplanted shall be transplanted by tree spade only and in accordance with Municipality's standards. All damaged trees or shrubs shall be replaced or restored in accordance with mutually acceptable tree maintenance standards. 
(2)  Laws and seeded areas will be restored as soon as seasonably practicable. Mulch will be removed and properly disposed of in a timely fashion. 
(3)  Where underground work will encroach under the branch spread of trees or shrubs, proposed structures and conduit shall be relocated outside of the tree or shrub drip line, or the facilities in question shall be installed by boring the distance of the branch spread unless this requires leaving the utility area of the easement, street or Public Right-of-Way. 
Q.  Soil Erosion: All construction and reconstruction shall be in accordance with Chapter 15.36 of the Livonia Code of Ordinances, the Grading and Soil Erosion Control Ordinance. Franchisee or Franchisee's contractor shall correct any violation at the direction of the Mayor. 
R.  General: Franchisee shall meet or exceed all the construction and reconstruction requirements set out in this Ordinance and those set out in the Municipal Code and ordinances. 
S.  Bond: 
(1)  Franchisee shall, prior to any reconstruction of the Cable System obtain and thereafter maintain, at its sole cost and expense, a corporate surety bond in the amount of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) issued by a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Michigan and acceptable to Municipality. Said bond shall assure Municipality of recovery of any and all damages, losses, costs and expenses sustained or suffered by Municipality as a result of the failure of Franchisee satisfactorily to reconstruct its Cable System pursuant to the provisions of this Franchise. 
(2)  Upon completion of any reconstruction of the Cable System, Franchisee shall give notice of same to Municipality. The notice shall comply with Section 5-2019.E(1) and affirmatively state on its face that unless Municipality objects within fifteen (15) business days of the provision of same that the bond need no longer be maintained. Unless Municipality objects to such notice within fifteen (15) business days of the provision of same, the bond need no longer be maintained. 
(3)  The bond shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by the surety, nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety, until thirty (30) days after receipt by the City of Livonia, by registered mail, of a written notice of such intent to cancel or not to renew." 
T.  Emergency Notification: Franchisee shall provide the Mayor with a twenty-four (24) hour emergency telephone number at which a named responsible adult representative of Franchisee (not voice mail or a recording) can be accessed in the event of an emergency. 
U.  Right of Inspection: Municipality shall have the right to inspect all construction, reconstruction or installation work and to make such tests as it deems necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the Franchise, Municipal Code and ordinances, or other pertinent provisions of law. 
V.  Notice of Construction-Residents: Franchisee shall provide advance notice, appropriate to the circumstances, prior to entry whenever desiring to enter or cross any property within Municipality or work in abutting Public Rights-of-Way. By way of example, Franchisee shall provide at least forty eight (48) hour advance notice during weekdays and seventy two (72) hour advance notice for holiday and weekends to affected property owners (such as by door hanger) prior to construction or reconstruction requiring entry on private property or work in the Public Rights-of-Way abutting such private property. During maintenance work, installation work, and outage repair, Franchisee shall attempt to notify affected residences (such as by knocking and, if no answer, leaving a door hanger) prior to entering private property. Work performed in an emergency in easements and Public Rights-of-Way to repair system outages is exempted from this section. 
W.  Utility Crowding: In areas of Municipality where the Mayor reasonably finds that the Public Rights-of-Way will not readily accommodate additional underground facilities and there is likely to be a need in the future for additional underground facilities, the Mayor may require that new conduits owned or installed by Franchisee be oversized, duplicated, or placed in multiple configurations. Municipality will use its best efforts to require new installations in such areas to use the preceding facilities of Franchisee. Municipality will use its best efforts to impose similar obligations on other users of the Public Rights-of-Way. 
X.  Removal of Obsolete Facilities/Cooperation: When Franchisee opens a trench, accesses a conduit or boring, or is working on aerial locations, it shall remove all Cable System facilities that are both obsolete and inactive from such locations. 
(1)  When Franchisee opens a trench it shall notify all other franchisees and permittees in advance of such work, so that they may remove their obsolete facilities from such locations or add new facilities. Franchisee shall cooperate with such persons in such activities. 
(2)  When Franchisee receives notification from another franchisee or permittee that it is opening a trench, Franchisee shall remove all of its obsolete facilities from such location while they are open. 
Y.  Joint Use by Municipality: Franchisee shall permit without charge the joint use of excess height, space and capacity in Franchisee-owned poles, and conduits located only in the Public Rights-of-Way by the Municipality, the County of Wayne, Wayne County Road Commission, School Systems and City of Detroit; provided that no such use shall be in competition with Franchisee. 
Z.  Easements: Any easements over or under private property necessary for the construction, reconstruction or operation of the Cable System shall be arranged for by Franchisee. Any easements over or under property owned by Municipality other than the Public Rights-of-Way shall be separately negotiated with Municipality. 
AA.  Other Permits: This Ordinance does not relieve Franchisee of the obligation to obtain permits, licenses and other approvals from Municipality or other units of government, which are required for the construction, reconstruction, repair or maintenance of the Cable System or provisions of Cable Services; or from compliance with generally applicable municipal code ordinances such as zoning and land use ordinances, pavement cut ordinances, subdivision and project improvement ordinances, curb cut permits, building permits and the like. 
BB.  Right of Condemnation Reserved: Nothing in this Ordinance shall limit any right the Municipality may have to acquire property by eminent domain. 
CC.  Poles: Franchisee shall not erect any utility poles without the advance written permission of Municipality for the pole(s) in question which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
DD.  Underground Street Crossing: Whenever Franchisee must place the Cable System or other facilities beneath the traveled or paved portion of the Public Rights-of-Way, Franchisee shall do so by directional boring and not by excavation of a trench in which to place cable conduit. Directional boring shall be done wherever possible so that the excavations necessary for it are not in the paved portion of the street of Public Rights-of-Way. 
EE.  Temporary Relocation: Upon 30 business days notice, Franchisee shall either temporarily raise or lower its wires or other equipment upon the request of any person, including without limitation, a person holding a building moving permit issued by Municipality. Franchisee may charge a reasonable rate for this service, not to exceed its actual costs with an advance deposit of the estimated cost. 
FF.  Pavement Cut Coordination/Additional Fees: Franchisee shall coordinate its construction program, reconstruction program and all other work in the Public Rights-of-Way with Municipality's program for street construction, rebuilding, resurfacing and repair (collectively, "Street Resurfacing"). Franchisee shall meet with the official of Municipality responsible for such program at least twice per year to this end. 
(1)  The goals of such coordination shall be to require Franchisee to conduct all work in the Public Rights-of-Way in conjunction with or immediately prior to any Street Resurfacing planned by Municipality, and to prevent to the extent practicable Public Rights-of-Way from being disturbed by Franchisee seven (7) years after it has been constructed, rebuilt, resurfaced, or repaired (collectively, "Resurfaced"). 
(2)  Franchisee shall not cut or otherwise breach or damage the surface of any paved Public Rights-of-Way within twenty four (24) months after such Public Right-of-Way has been resurfaced. Municipality shall promptly waive the preceding requirement where there is no feasible alternative for the restoration or provision of Cable Service. 
GG.  Vacated Streets: If a Public Right-of-way is vacated, eliminated, discontinued or closed, all rights of Franchisee under this Ordinance to use same shall terminate and Franchisee at its expense shall immediately remove the Cable System from such Public Right-of-Way unless Franchisee obtains any necessary easements from the affected property owners to use the former Public Right-of-Way. 
HH.  As-Builts/Location of Facilities: Franchisee shall keep accurate, complete and current maps and records of the Cable System and its facilities and shall provide copies to Municipality as set forth below.

Upon request by Municipality, Franchisee as soon as possible (but no more than one (1) business day from the request) shall inform Municipality of any changes from such maps and records previously supplied and shall mark up maps provided by Municipality so as to show the location of the Cable System. 
(2)  The "as built" maps shall include at a minimum all system and facility routings and the location of appurtenant structures, such as nodes, amplifiers, power supplies and system monitor test points, and shall be drawn to a scale and upon such media as required by the Mayor. 
(3)  Franchisee shall provide Municipality with a computer file which accurately displays Franchisee's "as built" Cable System. If changed, this file shall be updated at least quarterly, will be provided at no cost to Municipality and become the property of Municipality. Franchisee shall provide Municipality with reasonable information about Franchisee's computer program which generates the file and its implementation so as to aid Municipality in converting and incorporating the files into a layer in the Geographical Information System Municipality uses. 
II.  Miss Dig: Franchisee shall participate in and be a member of the "Miss Dig" utility notification program provided for by MCLA § 460.701ff or subsequent statute. 
JJ.  Discontinuance and Removal of the Cable System: Upon the revocation, termination, or expiration of the Franchise, absent renewal of the Franchise or any right thereto, Franchisee either (a)—by mutual agreement of Municipality and Franchisee, (b)—by Franchisee's acquiescence or failure to challenge same, or (c)—by a final order of a court which Franchisee either does not appeal or from which there is no further right of appeal then the following shall occur: Franchisee shall immediately discontinue the provision of Cable Services and all rights of Franchisee to use the Public Rights-of-Way shall cease. Franchisee, at the direction of Municipality, shall remove its Cable System, including all supporting structures, poles, transmission and distribution Cable System and other appurtenances, fixtures or property from the Public Rights-of-Way, in, over, under, along, or through which they are installed within six (6) months of the revocation, termination, or expiration except that (a) Franchisee may abandon its facilities in place with Municipality's consent, and (b) Franchisee cannot remove underground facilities without Municipality's consent in advance. Franchisee shall also restore any property, public or private, to the condition in which it existed prior the installation, erection, construction or reconstruction of its Cable System, including any improvements made to such property subsequent to the construction or reconstruction of its Cable System. Restoration of Municipal property, including, but not limited to, the Public Rights-of-Way, shall be in accordance with the reasonable directions and specifications of Municipality, and all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations, at Franchisee's sole expense. If such removal and restoration is not completed within six (6) months after the revocation, termination, or expiration, all of Franchisee's property remaining in the affected Public Rights-of-Way shall, at the option of Municipality, be deemed abandoned and shall, at the option of Municipality, become its property or Municipality may obtain a court order compelling Franchisee to remove same. In the event Franchisee fails or refuses to remove its Cable System or to satisfactorily restore all areas to the condition in which they existed prior to the original construction or reconstruction of the Cable System, Municipality, at its option, may perform such work and if such work is performed within twelve (12) months of the revocation, termination or expiration of this Franchisee collect the costs thereof from Franchisee. No surety on any performance bond shall be discharged until Municipality has certified to Franchisee in writing that the Cable System has been dismantled, removed, an all other property restored, to the reasonable satisfaction of Municipality. 
KK.  Failure to Discontinue Service: In the event that Franchisee fails to discontinue the provision of Cable Services pursuant to the terms set forth in Section 5-2001.JJ then Franchisee consents to Municipality obtaining court orders enforcing the terms of Section 5-2001.JJ. This obligation shall survive the revocation, termination, or expiration of the Franchise.

M.  Review of Limits. Once during each calendar year during the Term of the Franchise. Municipality may review the insurance coverages to be carried by Franchisee.

C.  Ownership, Encumbrances. Franchisee represents and warrants that its current ownership is as set forth on Exhibit I and that it will have full legal and equitable title to the Cable System. 
D.  Applications for Consent/Procedure. If Franchisee seeks to obtain the consent of Municipality to any transactions or matters described in Section 5-2011.A, B or C (collectively "transfer"), Franchisee shall submit an application for such consent to Municipality and shall submit or cause to be submitted to Municipality such additional documents and information as Municipality may reasonably request. 
(1)  Municipality shall have 120 days from the date of submission of an application (such as an FCC Form 394) to act upon any such application for consent.

(3)  Nothing in any approval by Municipality of an authorization of any transfer shall be construed to waive or release any rights of Municipality in and to the streets, Public Rights-of-Way, and public places of Municipality, or as a release of any of Municipality's police powers, or as an exercise of eminent domain. 
(4)  Municipality's granting of consent in any one (1) instance shall not require it to grant consent in other instances. 
(5)  Franchisee shall reimburse Municipality for all costs reasonably incurred by Municipality due to any proposed transfer.

(6)  If Franchisee files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy; is adjudicated insolvent; obtains an order for relief under Section 301 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. §301); files any petition or fails to contest any petition filed against it seeking any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief for itself under any laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other relief for debtors; seeks or consents to or acquiesces in the appointment of any bankruptcy trustee, receiver, master, custodian or liquidator of Franchisee, or any of Franchisee's property and/or Franchise and/or of any and all of the revenues, issues, earnings, profits or income thereof; makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or fails to pay Franchisee's debts generally as they become due.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default which can be cured by the immediate payment of money to Municipality or a third party, Franchisee shall have thirty (30) days from written notice from Municipality to Franchisee of an occurrence of such Event of Default to cure same before Municipality may exercise any of its rights or remedies provided for in Section 5-2014.

C.  Force Majeure. If by any reason of strike, acts of God, acts of public enemies, orders of any kind of a government of the United States of America or of the state or any of their departments, agencies, political subdivisions; riots; epidemics, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic activity, floods, washouts, droughts, civil disturbances, explosions, partial or entire failure of utilities, failures of suppliers or any other cause or event not reasonably within the control of the disabled party, any party, is unable in whole or in part to carry out its obligations hereunder, that party shall not be deemed to be in violation or default during the continuance of such inability provided that the party in questions has taken reasonable steps to minimize the consequences of the matters set forth above.  
5-2014. - Remedies 
A.  Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Uncured Event of Default as described in Section 5-2013, Municipality shall be entitled to exercise any and all of the following cumulative remedies: 
(1)  The commencement of an action against Franchisee at law for monetary damages. 
(2)  The commencement of an action in equity seeking injunctive relief or the specific performance of any of the provisions which, as a matter of equity, are specifically enforceable.

Municipality's right to forfeit and terminate the grant of the Franchise pursuant to this section is not a limitation on Municipality's right of revocation. 
B.  Remedies Not Exclusive. The rights and remedies of Municipality set forth in this Ordinance, or in the Cable Ordinance, shall be in addition to and not in limitation of, any other rights and remedies provided by law or in equity. Municipality and Franchisee understand and intend that such remedies shall be cumulative to the maximum extent permitted by law and the exercise of Municipality of any one (1) or more of such remedies shall not preclude the exercise by Municipality, at the same or different times, of any other such remedies for the same Uncured Event of Default. 
C.  Liquidated Damages. In addition to the other remedies provided for herein, liquidated damages in the amounts set forth below may be awarded Municipality (individually and on behalf of subscribers) from Franchisee. Franchisee agrees that such sums are reasonable given that the actual damages are difficult of precise ascertainment and that the actual damages are often incurred by Municipality and subscribers, and cumulatively are large, but are so small for each subscriber as to not be worth their while pursuing, and that without provisions such as this Franchisee would be unjustly enriched. Municipality and Franchisee agree that the total of all penalties for a violation unrelated to construction or reconstruction of the Cable System shall not exceed $25,000 per violation. 
(1)  For violations of Section 5-2011 hereof, liquidated damages in the amount of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) per day. 
(2)  For violations of Section 5-2003.A, liquidated damages in the amount of up to One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) per day.

D.  Liquidated Damages Procedure. Liquidated damages may be awarded in accordance with the following procedure.

If the hearing is delegated, then, upon request by Franchisee after the matter is returned to Council, Franchisee shall be afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard by Council prior to Council taking action on the matter. 
(4)  Such assessment by Municipality shall be subject to judicial review, shall be a monetary obligation of Franchisee to Municipality in the amount determined by Council; and shall be paid in full by Franchisee within thirty (30) business days of the date of assessment by Council, unless stayed by agreement or court order. 
(5)  The assessment may be appealed to court in which case the court review shall be on the record (except for new evidence not obtainable by the party offering it at the time of the hearing before Council).  
5-2015. - Revocation of Franchise 
A.  Major Breach of Franchise. When any event, act or omission on the part of Franchisee occurs which represents a substantial or repeated violation of a material provision of this Ordinance, then such event, act or omission may be considered a major breach of this Franchise. Under such circumstances, Municipality shall notify Franchisee in writing by certified mail of the specific breach and direct Franchisee to comply with all the provisions of this Ordinance for which the Franchisee is in violation. 
B.  Events of Default. The events, acts and omissions referred to in this Section are the following: (1) bankruptcy; (2) insolvency; (3) failure to pay taxes or franchise fees; (4) failure to receive written Municipality approval for assignment or transfer; or (5) a major breach of this Franchise (as noted in Section 5-2015.A above) that remains uncured for the 60-day cure period described in Section 5-2015.C below. They do not include events in the nature of force majeure. 
C.  Corrective Action. Where Franchisee corrects any of the enumerated conditions within 60 days from the receipt of notice from Municipality, then in no event shall the enumerated condition be weighed against Franchisee in any subsequent review of Franchise performance. 
D.  Public Hearing 
(1)  Scheduling and Procedures. No sooner than 75 days after such written notice if notice of the breach is sent by certified mail to Franchisee, Municipality may set a date for a public hearing on the matter. The hearing shall be before Council or its designee and shall afford full due process to Franchisee and shall be held on the record. Both Franchisee and Municipality shall be permitted to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. The public hearing may be canceled at any time, if Municipality is satisfied that Franchisee has corrected and/or cured the violation. 
(2)  Notice. Municipality shall provide written notice, by certified mail, to Franchisee of the time and place of said public hearing in a manner consistent with state law. 
(3)  Evidence Regarding Status of Alleged Violation. At the time of the hearing, Franchisee may present information on the current status of the alleged breach of the Franchise. If the situation has been resolved, or steps are being taken to resolve the situation, then Franchisee should present such information at the hearing. 
(4)  Effect of Failure to Attend. If Franchisee fails to attend the hearing, or submit a written response, or request a continuance of the hearing, then Franchisee shall be deemed to have waived its right to a further continuation of the matter, and may be declared in default of the Franchise. 
E.  Alternatives if Violation is Found. Municipality may (once it has held the public hearing) direct the Franchisee to take corrective action within a specified period of time, or may declare the Franchisee in default of the Franchise, and afterwards, revoke, terminate or cancel the Franchise. 
F.  Notice to Franchisee. If Municipality directs corrective action to take place within a specified time or declares the Franchisee in default of the Franchise, then that declaration shall be reduced to writing, and the notice of corrective action or default shall be mailed, by certified mail, or in the alternative may be hand-delivered, to Franchisee within 15 days of Municipality's action. 
G.  Revocation for Failure to Correct Violation. If, within 45 days after receipt of notice of Municipality's direction of corrective action as provided in this Section, Franchisee does not take significant action to rectify the breach, or submit a plan detailing how the Franchisee will eliminate the breach, then Municipality may revoke Franchisee's Franchise and shall notify Franchisee immediately; provided however, that such revocation shall not be effective any earlier than 30 days following the date of such notification.  
5-2016. - Continuity of Service. 
A.  Franchisee shall interrupt the provision of service only with good cause and for the shortest time possible and, except in emergency situations (or as otherwise provided herein), only after periodic cablecasting notice of service interruptions, including at the same time of day as the anticipated interruption. Service may be interrupted between 12 midnight and 6:00 am for routine testing, maintenance and repair, without notification, any night except Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, or the night preceding a holiday. 
B.  It shall be the right of all subscribers to receive all available services so long as their financial and other obligations to the Franchisee are honored. In the event the Franchisee elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify, surrender or sell the system, or Municipality terminates or revokes or fails to renew this franchise, or Municipality purchases the Cable System, the Franchisee shall make reasonable and best efforts to provide continued, uninterrupted service to subscribers for a period of up to six (6) months beyond the effective date of such revocation, termination, surrender, or non-renewal of the franchise, or longer by mutual agreement of Municipality and Franchisee; and the terms and conditions of the Franchise shall remain in effect for the duration of such period.  
5-2017. - Severability. 
If any provision of the Franchise or any related agreement is held by any court or by any federal, state or county agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any federal, state or county law, rule or regulation now or later on in effect, or is held by such court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, that provision shall be considered as a separate, distinct and independent part of the Franchise or such other agreement, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions of the Franchise or such other agreement. In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed so that the affected provision of the Franchise (or such other agreement) which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with the law, rules and regulations then in effect, that provision shall immediately return to full force and effect and shall afterwards be binding on the parties to the Franchise, provided that Municipality shall give Franchisee sixty (60) days' written notice of such change before requiring compliance with that provision.  
5-2018. - Relationship of This Franchise to Cable Ordinance and Federal Law 
A.  Cable Ordinance Generally Controls. Except as noted in Section 5-2018.B below, the Cable Ordinance in effect on the Effective Date of the Franchise shall control and prevail. 
B.  Franchisee to Abide by Local Cable Ordinance. Franchisee agrees to abide by the Cable Ordinance. Subject to Section 5-2019.D, amendment or modification of the Cable Ordinance or passage of a future ordinance by Municipality regulating multichannel video service providers or cable operators relating to practices or developments unforseen at the time of enactment of the Cable Ordinance will apply to Franchisee. Municipality shall provide Franchisee at least thirty (30) days' notice before adoption of such amendment, modification or ordinance, during which notice period Franchisee may provide written and oral comment with respect to the amendment, modification or ordinance. Notwithstanding the above, Franchisee will be expected to comply with, and abide by, any valid present or future ordinance (1) necessary to implement the cable rate regulation provisions of federal law, or (2) generally applicable to all businesses in the Authorized Area.  
5-2019. - Miscellaneous 
A.  Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Franchise, the documents that are referred to in this Franchise and the documents that are to be delivered pursuant to this Franchise constitute the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the subject matter of this Franchise, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions of the parties, whether oral or written, and there are no representations or other agreements among the parties in connection with the subject matter of this Franchise, except as specifically set forth in this Franchise. No amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or termination of this Franchise shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound by such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or termination. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Franchise shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision of this Franchise, whether or not similar, nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided in writing by the waiving party. 
(1)  Municipality may waive any obligation or requirement of performance on the part of Franchisee set forth in this Franchise, in whole or in part, at any time. Such waivers include but are not limited to instances of a claim or showing by Franchisee that the costs associated with the provision being waived would increase the rates Franchisee is legally allowed to charge subscribers, such as a claim that such costs are an "external cost" which allow Franchisee to increase its rates under the FCC rules. 
B.  No Inducement. Franchisee, by accepting this Franchise, acknowledges that it has not been induced to accept the Franchise by any promise, oral or written, by or on behalf of Municipality or by any third person regarding any term or condition of this Franchise not expressed herein. Franchisee further pledges that no promise or inducement, oral or written, has been made to any Municipal employee or official regarding receipt of a cable franchise, except as expressed in this Franchise. 
C.  Covenant Not to Sue/Claim. As a condition of this Franchise, Franchisee agrees to be bound by all the terms of it and of the Cable Ordinance. In consideration of the substantial benefits it receives from this Franchise, Franchisee covenants that it will not at any time sue or proceed against Municipality in any claim or proceeding challenging any term or provision of this Franchise or Cable Ordinance as unreasonable, unlawful or arbitrary at the time of adoption of this Franchise or that Municipality or Franchisee did not have the authority to impose or agree to such terms or conditions at the time of adoption of this Franchise. 
D.  Police Power/Reservation. Franchisee by accepting this Franchise does not concede that all municipal ordinance amendments after the Effective Date apply to Franchisee. Municipality agrees that by accepting the Franchise, Franchisee has not waived its right to object to the application of future municipal ordinances to Franchisee, including the right to object on the ground that future municipal ordinances may not supersede the terms of this Franchise. Municipality contends that future municipal ordinances may supersede the terms of this Franchise.

EXHIBIT A—CABLE SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
The Cable System shall meet the requirements set forth below. 
System Functional Requirements: The Cable System shall pass frequencies of at least 750 megahertz (MHz) cable bandwidth and be capable of providing (a) the continuous downstream, one-way transport without compression of at least 80 analog multicast video channels in 6 MHz NTSC Amplitude Modulation/Vestigial Side Band format ("NTSC") to all points and subscribers on the Cable System in Municipality, and (b) the continuous, upstream, one-way transport without compression of four (4) 6 MHz NTSC channels. The Cable System shall be designed, spaced and constructed for system operation to 750 MHz meeting all FCC standards at full channel loading. 
The Cable System shall be fully addressable from its inception to support applications such as pay-per-view and other selection oriented services. The upstream spectrum in the Cable System may be used to carry signals from the subscriber terminal to a central location which can analyze such signaling information for routing to the designated subscriber. 
The Cable System shall be capable of providing continuous, one-way downstream transport of digital multicast service. 
For both analog and digital multicast service the video signal delivered to the subscriber shall meet or exceed the FCC standards for signal quality set forth at 47 CFR §76.601 and following as such standards are in effect on the Effective Date. 
Cable System Architecture: Subscribers shall be grouped into nodes that are arranged geographically. Node sizing shall average no more than 1200 homes served. From each node, coaxial cable shall be used to deliver all information streams to and from subscribers; optical cable shall be used to carry upstream and downstream communication from Company's headend to the node and from the nodes to the Company's headend. 
All coaxial cable portions of the Cable System, and coaxial cable Drops and coaxial cable installed by Company on subscriber premises (to the outlets typically located on the subscriber's wall), shall allow the passage of 1 GHz of spectrum while meeting the FCC standards for signal quality described above so as to allow for channel expansion without replacement of such coaxial cable. 
The cable system shall use a hybrid fiber coax network with the following specifications. There will be no more than one (1) fiber node (optical to RF conversion) and five (5) system II amplifiers in the trunk and four (4) distribution amplifiers in the distribution system, including line extenders.

EXHIBIT E—
INDEMNITY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
Municipality and Franchisee agree that Franchisee's duty to defend and indemnify Indemnitees encompasses claims that Municipality (1) lacked authority under federal or state law, the Municipal Charter, Municipal Code and ordinances or Cable Ordinance (as amended in connection with the grant of the Franchise) in issuing the Franchise to Franchisee, (2) violated federal or state due process, equal protection or civil rights laws in awarding the Franchise to Franchisee, (3) acted in an illegally disparate or discriminatory manner against Municipality's incumbent cable operator in awarding the Franchise to Franchisee or (4) accepted terms or conditions in the Franchise awarded to Franchisee which violate federal or state laws, if any, regarding equal protection rights of competitors. 
Municipality and Franchisee agree that Franchisee's duty to defend and indemnify under Section 5-2008.B(3) shall not include any duty to defend or indemnify against claims which arise solely from events occurring after the grant of the Franchise, including, without limitation, any claims that Municipality has engaged in disparate or discriminatory regulatory enforcement activities under the Cable Ordinance after the grant of the Franchise. 
In addition, Franchisee's duty to defend and indemnify does not include any claims by Municipality's incumbent cable operator, regardless of when the claims arise, that any action by Municipality in granting a franchise to Franchisee violates any of the incumbent cable operator's contractual rights. 
Municipality and Franchisee agree that, if any action is commenced against Indemnitees which raises both claims that are covered by Franchisee's duty to defend under Section 5-2008 B(3) and claims that are not covered by Franchisee's duty to defend, Franchisee's duty to defend Municipality in that action shall extend only to the claims that are covered by Franchisee's duty to defend under Section 5-2008.B(3). 
EXHIBIT F—INDEMNIFICATION 
Assume an incident occurs for which Franchisee is 85% at fault and Indemnitees are 15% at fault. The total amount due and owing a third party from the resulting claim is $100,000.

Interest shall be payable to the registered owner of record as of the 15th day of the month next preceding any payment date for each interest payment. The date of determination of registered owner for purposes of payment of interest as provided in this paragraph may be changed by the City following notice mailed to the Transfer Agent and the holders of outstanding Bonds at their registered addresses to conform to market practice in the future. Both the principal of and interest on said Bonds will be payable as set forth in Section 22 hereof. 
The Series 1988 Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity as set forth in Section 22 hereof. 
The Series 1988 Bonds shall be signed with the facsimile signatures of the Mayor, City Clerk and Treasurer. The Series 1988 Bonds shall have the corporate seal of the City impressed or imprinted thereon. No Bond of this series shall be valid until authenticated by an authorized representative of the Transfer Agent. After execution, the Series 1988 Bonds shall be delivered to the purchaser thereof by the Treasurer or any deputy upon payment of the purchase price therefor. Executed blank bonds for registration of transfer shall simultaneously, and from time to time thereafter as necessary, be delivered to the Trustee for safekeeping. 
Any Bond may be transferred upon the books required to be kept pursuant to this section by the person in whose name it is registered, in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of the Bond for cancellation, accompanied by delivery of a duly executed written instrument of transfer in a form approved by the Transfer Agent. Whenever any Bond or Bonds shall be surrendered for transfer, the City shall execute and the Transfer Agent shall authenticate and deliver a new Bond or Bonds, for like aggregate principal amount. The Transfer Agent shall require the payment by the bondholder requesting the transfer of any tax or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to the transfer. 
The Transfer Agent shall keep or cause to be kept, at its principal office, sufficient books for the registration and transfer of the Bonds, which shall at all times be open to inspection by the City; and, upon presentation for such purpose, the Transfer Agent shall, under such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, transfer or cause to be transferred, on said books, Bonds as hereinbefore provided. 
If any Bond shall become mutilated, the City, at the expense of the holder of the Bond, shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like tenor in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Bond, upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the mutilated Bond. If any Bond issued under this Ordinance shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the Transfer Agent and, if this evidence is satisfactory to both and indemnity satisfactory to the Transfer Agent shall be given, the City, at the expense of the owner, shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like tenor and bearing the statement required by Act 354, Public Acts of Michigan, 1972, as amended, being Sections 129.131 to 129.135, inclusive, of the Michigan Compiled Laws, or any applicable law hereafter enacted in lieu of and in substitution for the Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen. If any such Bond shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute Bond the Transfer Agent may pay the same without surrender thereof. 
Section 6.   Payment of Bonds; Creation of Lien. The Bonds and the interest thereon shall be payable primarily from the Net Revenues and to secure such payment, there is hereby created a statutory lien upon the whole of the Net Revenues to continue until payment in full of the principal of and interest on the Bonds, or until sufficient cash or Sufficient Government Obligations have been deposited in trust for payment in full of all Bonds to be defeased which lien is a first lien on the Net Revenues subject only to the lien in favor of certain outstanding Water Revenue Bonds, Series A, Series B and Series D, for which sufficient Government Obligations have been purchased and pledged for the payment of such outstanding Bonds with Comerica Bank-Detroit, the paying agent for such outstanding Revenue Bonds. Upon deposit of cash or Sufficient Government Obligations, as provided in this paragraph with respect to the Series 1988 Bonds, the statutory lien shall be terminated with respect to the Series 1988 Bonds to be defeased, and the holders of such Series 1988 Bonds shall have no further rights under this Ordinance except for payment from the deposited funds, and such Bonds shall no longer be considered to be outstanding Bonds under this Ordinance. 
In addition, since more than 25% of the cost of the Project is being defrayed from the proceeds of grant funds, the City hereby pledges its limited tax full faith and credit for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Series 1988 Bonds. Should the Net Revenues of the System be at any time insufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Series 1988 Bonds as the same becomes due, then the City shall advance from any funds available therefor, or, if necessary, levy taxes on all taxable property in the City, subject to applicable constitutional, charter and statutory limitations, such sums as may be necessary to pay said principal and interest. Such funds shall be deposited directly into the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund established pursuant to Section 13(B) hereof, and the City shall be reimbursed for any such advance from the Net Revenues of the System subsequently received which are not otherwise pledged or encumbered by this Ordinance. 
Section 7.   Bondholders' Rights; Receiver. The holder or holders of the Bonds representing in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding may, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce the statutory lien upon the Net Revenues of the System, and may, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, enforce and compel performance of all duties of the officers of the City, including the fixing of sufficient rates, the collection of Revenue, the proper segregation of the Revenues of the System and the proper application thereof. The statutory lien upon the Net Revenues, however, shall not be construed as to compel the sale of the System or any part thereof. 
If there is a default in the payment of the principal of or interest upon the Bonds, any court having jurisdiction in any proper action may appoint a receiver to administer and operate the System on behalf of the City and under the direction of the court, and with the approval of the court to perform all of the duties of the officers of the City more particularly set forth herein and in Act 94. 
The holder or holders of the Bonds shall have all other rights and remedies given by Act 94 and law, for the payment and enforcement of the Bonds and the security therefor. 
Section 8.   Management. The operation, repair and management of the System and the acquiring of the Project shall be under the immediate supervision and control of the City Council. The City may employ such persons in such capacities as it deems advisable to carry on the efficient management and operation of the System. The City Council may make such rules, orders and regulations as it deems advisable and necessary to assure the efficient management and operation of the System. 
Section 9.   Charges and Enforcement. The rates to be charged for service furnished by the System and the methods of collection of the rates shall be those in effect on the date of adoption of this Ordinance. 
The charges for service of the System which are under the provisions of Section 21 of Act 94 made a lien on all premises served thereby, unless notice is given that a tenant is responsible, are hereby recognized to constitute such lien and whenever such charge against any piece of property shall be delinquent for six (6) months the City officials or officials in charge of the collection thereof shall certify annually, on March 1st and September 1st of each year, to the tax assessing officer of the City, the fact of such delinquency, whereupon such charge shall be by him entered upon the next tax roll as a charge against such premises and shall be collected and the lien thereof enforced in the same manner as general City taxes against such premises are collected, and the lien thereof enforced; provided, however, where notice is given that a tenant is responsible for such charges and service as provided by said Section 21 of Act 94 no further service shall be rendered such premises until a cash deposit in an amount specified from time to time by the City Council shall have been made as security for payment of such charges and service. 
In addition to other remedies provided, the City shall have the right to shut off and discontinue the supply of water or sewer service or both to any premises for the nonpayment of sewer charges when due. If such charges are not paid within thirty (30) days after the due date thereof, then the water or sewer service, or both, to such premises shall be discontinued. Sewer or water services so discontinued shall not be restored until all sums then due and owing shall be paid. 
Section 10.   No Free Service. No free service, or service at less than cost, shall be furnished by the System to any person, firm or corporation, public or private, or to any public agency or instrumentality. 
Section 11.   Fixing and Revising Rates; Rate Covenant. The rates charged pursuant to Section 9 of this Ordinance are estimated to be sufficient to provide for the payment of the expenses of administration and operation and such expenses for maintenance of the System as are necessary to preserve the System in good repair and working order, and when taken together with Net Revenues, to provide for (i) an amount equal to the annual principal and interest requirements on all of the Bonds as the same become due and payable, (ii) the creation and maintenance of the reserves therefor, and (iii) to provide for all other obligations, expenditures and funds for the System required by law and this Ordinance. The rates shall be fixed and revised from time to time as may be necessary to produce these amounts, and it is hereby covenanted and agreed to fix and maintain rates for services furnished by the System at all times sufficient to provide for the foregoing. 
Section 12.   Operating Year. The System shall be operated on the basis of an operating year which shall coincide with the City's fiscal year. 
Section 13.   Funds and Accounts; Flow of Funds. Commencing on December 1, 1988, all Revenues of the System shall be set aside as collected and credited to a fund to be designated WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER SYSTEM RECEIVING FUND (the "Receiving Fund"). The Revenues so credited are pledged for the purpose of the following funds and shall be transferred or debited from the Receiving Fund periodically in the manner and at the times and in the order of priority hereinafter specified: 
A.  OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FUND: 
Out of the Revenues credited to the Receiving Fund there shall be first set aside, in or credited to a fund designated OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FUND, monthly a sum sufficient to provide for the payment of the next month's expenses of administration and operation of the System and such current expenses for the maintenance thereof as may be necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order. 
The City, prior to the commencement of each operating year beginning with the operating year next commencing after the effective date of this Ordinance, shall adopt a budget covering the foregoing expenses for each year. No payments shall be made to the City from moneys credited to the Operation and Maintenance Fund except for services directly rendered to the System by the City or its personnel. 
B. BOND AND INTEREST REDEMPTION FUND: 
There shall be established and maintained a separate depository fund designated BOND AND INTEREST REDEMPTION FUND (the "Redemption Fund"), the moneys on deposit therein from time to time to be used solely for the purpose of paying the principal of, redemption premiums (if any) and interest on the Bonds. The moneys in the Redemption Fund (including the Bond Reserve Account) shall be kept on deposit with the Transfer Agent. 
Out of the Revenues remaining in the Receiving Fund, after provision for the Operation and Maintenance Fund, there shall be set aside monthly in the Redemption Fund a sum proportionately sufficient to provide for the payment when due of the current principal of and interest on the Bonds, less any amount in the Redemption Fund representing accrued interest on the Bonds. Commencing on December 1, 1988, the amount set aside each month for interest on the Bonds shall be 1/5 of the total amount of interest on the Bonds next coming due and commencing May 1, 1989, the amount set aside each month for interest on the Bonds shall be 1/6 of the total amount of interest on the Bonds next coming due. The amount set aside each month for principal commencing November 1, 1988, shall be 1/12 of the amount of principal next coming due by maturity or a Mandatory Redemption Requirement. If there is any deficiency in the amount previously set aside, that deficiency shall be added to the next succeeding months' requirements. 
There is established a separate account in the Redemption Fund to be known as the BOND RESERVE ACCOUNT. Into said Bond Reserve Account there shall be deposited from funds of the City legally available therefor an amount equal to the lesser of (a) 10% of the principal amount of the Series 1988 Bonds or (b) an amount equal to the largest annual debt service on the Series 1988 Bonds. Moneys, derived from the investment of the Bond Reserve Account shall be transferred to the Receiving Fund. 
Except as herein provided, the moneys credited to the Bond Reserve Account shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of, redemption premiums (if any) and interest on the Bonds as to which there would otherwise be a default. If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys credited to the Bond Reserve Account for such payment, then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the Net Revenues first received thereafter which are not required for current principal and interest requirements. Provided, the Bond Reserve Account shall be restored within two (2) years to the amount of the Bond Reserve Account at the time it was so used for such payment. If Additional Bonds are issued, each Ordinance authorizing the Additional Bonds shall provide for additional deposits to the Bond Reserve Account to be made from the proceeds of the Additional Bonds or from other lawful sources in an amount that will result in the Bond Reserve Account being equal to either (a) the maximum annual principal and interest requirements on the Bonds outstanding after issuance of the Additional Bonds or (b) an amount equal to 10% of the principal amount of the Bonds if the sum set forth in (a) above is not permitted by applicable federal law. 
For purposes of making deposits to the Redemption Fund and the Bond Reserve Account, the principal amount of Bonds becoming due by reason of a Mandatory Redemption Requirement shall be deemed to become due in the principal amount and on the due date of the Mandatory Redemption Requirement. Each Ordinance authorizing Additional Bonds shall state the amount of Bonds authorized which are term Bonds, if any. 
A Mandatory Redemption Requirement for the Bonds of a term maturity may be satisfied by the call of term Bonds of the same issue and maturity in the principal amount of the Mandatory Redemption Requirement at par and accrued interest or by the purchase and surrender to the paying agent of the Bonds of the same issue and maturity from moneys allocated therefor as provided herein, or purchased with other funds legally available therefor. The City shall elect the manner in which it intends to satisfy a Mandatory Redemption Requirement not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the due date of each Mandatory Redemption Requirement. 
The moneys set aside to satisfy the next Mandatory Redemption Requirement for the Bonds shall be used by redeeming said Bonds on the following November 1st or by purchasing Bonds of the same issue and maturity with respect to which the Mandatory Redemption Requirement applies and surrendering the same to the paying agent for cancellation on or prior to the required due date of the Mandatory Redemption Requirement. In the event that after any Mandatory Redemption Requirement date moneys remain in the Redemption Fund, as a result of the purchase of Bonds at less than par, the amount of such excess may be transferred to the Receiving Fund. If no Bonds of an issue are issued as term Bonds then there shall be no Mandatory Redemption Requirement with respect to those Bonds. 
C.  REPLACEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT FUND: 
Out of the remaining Revenues in the Receiving Fund, there may be next set aside in or credited to, monthly after meeting the requirements of the foregoing Funds, to a fund to be designated REPLACEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT FUND (the "Improvement Fund"), or from other available moneys such sums as the City Council may deem advisable to be used for repairs, replacements, improvements, enlargements or extensions to the System. 
D.  GENERAL OBLIGATION DEBT FUND: 
Out of the remaining Revenues in the Receiving Fund, there may be next set aside in or credited to, monthly after meeting the requirements of the foregoing Funds, to a Fund to be designated GENERAL OBLIGATION DEBT FUND (the "G.O. Fund"), or from other available moneys such sums as shall be necessary to pay debt service on presently existing or future general obligation bond issues of the City or general obligation contractual obligations of the City incurred or to be incurred for System purposes. 
E.  SURPLUS MONEYS: 
Thereafter, any Revenues in the Receiving Fund after satisfying all the foregoing requirements of this Section, may, at the option of the city council be used for any of the following purposes: 
1.  Transferred to the Replacement and Improvement Fund or the G.O. Fund. 
2.  Transferred to the Redemption Fund and used for the purchase of Bonds on the open market at not more than the fair market value thereof. 
3.  Transferred to the General Fund of the City and used for any lawful purpose of the City. 
Section 14.   Depositary and Funds on Hand. Moneys in the several funds and the accounts established pursuant to this Ordinance, except moneys in the Redemption Fund (including the Bond Reserve Account) which shall be deposited in accordance herewith and moneys derived from the proceeds of sale of the Bonds, may be kept in one (1) or more bank accounts at a bank or banks designated by resolution of the City Council, and if kept in one (1) bank account the moneys shall be allocated on the books and records of the City in the manner and at the times provided in this Ordinance. 
Section 15.   Priority of Funds. In the event the moneys in the Receiving Fund are insufficient to provide for the current requirements of the Operation and Maintenance Fund or of the Redemption Fund, any moneys or securities in other funds of the System, except the proceeds of sale of the Bonds, shall be credited or transferred, first, to the Operation and Maintenance Fund, and second, to the Redemption Fund, to the extent of any deficit therein. 
Section 16.   Investments. Moneys in the funds and account established herein and moneys derived from the proceeds of sale of the Bonds, may be invested by the City in direct obligations of the United States of America or obligations the principal and interest on which is fully guaranteed by the United States of America, or certificates of deposit of a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or such other investments as are or may be lawful for investment of such moneys. Investment of moneys in the Redemption Fund being accumulated for payment of the next maturing principal or interest payment on the Bonds shall be limited to obligations bearing maturity dates prior to the date of the next maturing principal or interest payment on the Bonds as the case may be. Investment of moneys in the Bond Reserve Account shall be limited to obligations bearing maturity dates or subject to redemption, at the option of the holder thereof, not later than 5 years from the date of the investment. In the event investments are made, any securities representing the same shall be kept on deposit with the bank or trust company having on deposit the fund or funds or account from which the purchase was made. Profit realized or interest income earned on investment of funds in the Receiving Fund, Operation and Maintenance Fund, Redemption Fund (exclusive of Bond Reserve Account), G.O. Fund, Improvement Fund, and the Bond Reserve Account shall be deposited in or credited to the Receiving Fund. 
Section 17.   Series 1988 Bond Proceeds. From the proceeds of sale of the Series 1988 Bonds there shall be immediately deposited in the Redemption Fund, an amount equal to the accrued interest and premium, if any, received on delivery of the Series 1988 Bonds. The balance of the proceeds of the sale of the Series 1988 Bonds shall be deposited in a bank or banks, qualified to act as depositary of the proceeds of sale under the provisions of Section 15 of Act 94, in an account designated WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION FUND (the "Construction Fund"). Moneys in the Construction Fund shall be applied solely in payment of the cost of the Project and any engineering, legal and other expenses incident thereto and to the financing thereof. A portion of the proceeds of sale of the Series 1988 Bonds equal to the cost of the SSES study shall be transferred to the Fund from which the funds were advanced for such study. The remaining portion of the proceeds of sale of the Series 1988 Bonds, after payment of the costs referred to in this Section, shall be placed on deposit with a bank or banks to be agreed upon with the County of Wayne and shall be disbursed to the County pursuant to agreements to be executed with the County of Wayne and said bank or banks. The investment of the remaining portion of Series 1988 Bond proceeds shall be limited as may be required by federal law. 
Any unexpected balance of the proceeds of sale of the Series 1988 Bonds remaining after completion of the Project in the Construction Fund may in the discretion of the City and to the extent of fifteen percent (15%) of the principal amount of the Series 1988 Bonds be used for further improvements, enlargements and extensions to the System if, at the time of such expenditure, such use is approved by the Municipal Finance Division of the Michigan Department of Treasury or any successor agency, if such permission is then required by law. Any remaining balance after such expenditure shall be paid into the Redemption Fund and may be used for the purpose of purchasing Bonds on the open market at not more than the fair market value thereof. 
Section 18.   Covenants. The City covenants and agrees with the holders of the Bonds that so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding and unpaid as to either principal or interest- 
(a) The City will maintain the System in good repair and working order and will operate the same efficiently and will faithfully and punctually perform all duties with reference to the System required by the Constitution and laws of the State of Michigan and this Ordinance. 
(b) The City will keep proper books of record and account separate from all other records and accounts of the City, in which shall be made full and correct entries of all transactions relating to the System. The City shall have an annual audit of the books of record and account of the System for the preceding operating year made each year by an independent certified public accountant, and a copy of the audit shall be mailed to the manager of each syndicate or account originally purchasing any issue of the Bonds. The auditor shall comment on the manner in which the City is complying with the requirements of the Ordinance with respect to setting aside and investing moneys and meeting the requirements for acquiring and maintaining insurance. The audit shall be completed and so made available not later than three (3) months after the close of each operating year. 
(c) The City will maintain and carry, for the benefit of the holders of the Bonds, insurance on all physical properties of the System and liability insurance, of the kinds and in the amounts normally carried by municipalities engaged in the operation of water supply and sewage disposal systems. All moneys received for losses under any such insurance policies shall be applied solely to the replacement and restoration of the property damaged or destroyed, and to the extent not so used, shall be used for the purpose of redeeming or purchasing Bonds. 
(d) The City will not sell, lease or dispose of the System, or any substantial part, until all of the Bonds have been paid in full, both as to principal and interest or provision made thereof as herein provided. The City will operate the System as economically as possible, will make all repairs and replacements necessary to keep the System in good repair and working order, and will not do or suffer to be done any act which would affect the System in such a way as to have a material adverse effect on the security for the Bonds. 
(e) The City will not grant any franchise or other rights to any person, firm or corporation to operate a sewage disposal system that will compete with the System and the City will not operate a water supply and sewage disposal system that will compete with the System. 
(f) The City will use its best efforts to cause the County of Wayne to acquire and construct the Project promptly and in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor. 
Section 19.   Additional Bonds. Except as hereinafter provided, the City shall not issue Additional Bonds of equal or prior standing with the Bonds. 
The right is reserved in accordance with the provisions of Act 94, to issue Additional Bonds payable from the Revenues of the System which shall be of equal standing and priority of lien on the Net Revenues of the System with the Bonds but only for the following purposes and under the following terms and conditions: 
(a)  For subsequent repairs, extensions, enlargements and improvements to the System or for the purpose of refunding part of any Bonds then outstanding and paying costs of issuing such Additional Bonds including deposits which may be required to be made to the Bond Reserve Account. Bonds for such purposes shall not be issued pursuant to this subparagraph (a) unless the average actual or augmented Net Revenues of the System for a period of any twelve (12) consecutive months during the immediately preceding eighteen (18) months or the actual or augmented Net Revenues for the last preceding twelve-month operating year, if said period has been audited, shall be equal to at least one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the average amount of principal and interest thereafter maturing in any operating year on the then outstanding Bonds and on the Additional Bonds then being issued. If the Additional Bonds are to be issued in whole or in part for refunding outstanding Bonds the average annual principal and interest requirements shall be determined by deducting from the principal and interest requirements for each operating year the annual principal and interest requirements of any Bonds to be refunded from the proceeds of the Additional Bonds. If the System rates, fees or charges shall be increased at or prior to the time of authorizing the Additional Bonds, the Net Revenues for a period of any twelve (12) consecutive months during the immediately preceding eighteen (18) months shall be augmented by an amount reflecting the effect of the increase had the System's billings during such operating years been at the increased rates. In addition, the actual Net Revenues for a period of any twelve (12) consecutive months during the immediately preceding eighteen (18) months may be augmented by the estimated increase in Net Revenues to accrue as a result of the acquisition of the repairs, extensions, enlargements and improvements to said System to be paid for in whole or in part from the proceeds of the Additional Bonds to be issued and resulting from those customers or the System serviced by said repairs, extensions, enlargements and improvements constructed to the System. In addition, the actual Net Revenues may be augmented by an amount equal to the investment income representing interest on investments estimated to be received each operating year from the addition to the Bond Reserve Account to be funded from the proceeds of the Additional Bonds being issued or by any additional security given pursuant to Act 94, provided said Bond Reserve Account shall be then funded at its maximum amount. Determination by the Council as to the existence of conditions permitting the issuance of Additional Bonds shall be conclusive. No Additional Bonds of equal standing as to the Net Revenues of the System shall be issued pursuant to the authorization contained in this subparagraph if the City shall then be in default in making its required payments to the Operation and Maintenance Fund or the Redemption Fund. 
(b)  For refunding a part of the outstanding Bonds and paying costs of issuing such Additional Bonds including deposits which may be required to be made to the Bond Reserve Account. No Additional Bonds shall be issued pursuant to this subsection unless the maximum amount of principal and interest maturing in any operating year after giving effect to the refunding shall be not greater than 105% of the maximum amount of principal and interest maturing in any operating year prior to giving effect to the refunding. 
Section 20.   Non-presentment of Bonds. In the event any Bond shall not be presented for payment when the principal thereof becomes due, either at maturity or at the date fixed for redemption thereof if funds sufficient to pay the principal and interest on such Bond shall have been made available to the Transfer Agent by the City for the benefit of the holder or holders thereof, all liability of the City to the holder thereof for the payment of such Bond or portion thereof, as the case may be, shall forthwith cease, terminate and be completely discharged, and thereupon it shall be the duty of the Transfer Agent to hold such fund or funds in the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund, subject to the law of escheat without liability to the holder of such Bond for interest thereon, for the benefit of the holder of such Bond, who shall thereafter be restricted exclusively to such fund or funds, for any claim of whatever nature on his part on, or with respect to, said Bond or portion thereof. 
Section 21.   Covenant Regarding Tax Exempt Status of the Bonds. The City hereby covenants it shall take all actions within its control necessary to maintain the exemption of the interest on the Bonds from general federal income taxation (as opposed to alternative minimum or other indirect taxation) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including but not limited to, actions relating to the rebate of arbitrage earnings and the expenditure and investment of Bond proceeds and moneys deemed to be Bond proceeds. Additionally, the Council hereby designates the Series 1988 Bonds as "qualified tax exempt obligations" for purposes of deduction of interest expense by financial institutions under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
Section 22.   Series 1988 Bond Form. The Series 1988 Bonds shall be in substantially the following form, subject to such changes as may be requested by the Transfer Agent, or by an issuer of municipal bond insurance:

The investment of the Bonds shall be limited as may be required by federal law. Any unexpended balance of the proceeds of sale of the Bonds remaining after completion of the Project may, in the discretion of the Council, be used for further improvements and extensions to the system: Provided, that, at the time of such expenditure, such use be approved by the Michigan Department of Treasury.

Section 5.   Registration and Transfer. Any Bond may be transferred upon the books required to be kept pursuant to this section by the person in whose name it is registered, in person or by the registered owner's duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of the Bond for cancellation, accompanied by delivery of a duly executed written instrument of transfer in a form approved by the transfer agent. Whenever any Bond or Bonds shall be surrendered for transfer, the Issuer shall execute and the transfer agent shall authenticate and deliver a new Bond or Bonds, for like aggregate principal amount. The Transfer Agent shall require payment by the bondholder requesting the transfer of any tax or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to the transfer. The Transfer Agent shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Bond during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the giving of a notice of redemption of Bonds selected for redemption as described in the form of Bonds contained in Section 16 of this Ordinance and ending at the close of business on the day of that giving of notice, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Bond so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of Bonds being redeemed in part. The Issuer shall give the Transfer Agent notice of call for redemption at least 20 days prior to the date notice of redemption is to be given. 
The Transfer Agent shall keep or cause to be kept, at its principal office, sufficient books for the registration and transfer of the Bonds, which shall at all times be open to inspection by the Issuer; and, upon presentation for such purpose, the Transfer Agent shall, under such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, transfer or cause to be transferred, on said books, Bonds as hereinbefore provided. 
If any Bond shall become mutilated, the Issuer, at the expense of the holder of the Bond, shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like tenor in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Bond, upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the mutilated Bond. If any Bond issued under this ordinance shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the Transfer Agent and, if this evidence is satisfactory to both and indemnity satisfactory to the Transfer Agent shall be given, and if all requirements of any applicable law including Act 354, Public Acts of Michigan, 1972, as amended ("Act 354"), being sections 129.131 to 129.135, inclusive, of the Michigan Compiled Laws have been met, the Issuer, at the expense of the owner, shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like tenor and bearing the statement required by Act 354, or any applicable law hereafter enacted, in lieu of and in substitution for the Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen. If any such Bond shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute Bond the Transfer Agent may pay the same without surrender thereof. 
Section 6.   Payment of Bonds. The Bonds and the interest thereon shall be payable primarily from the Net Revenues, and to secure such payment, there is hereby created a statutory lien upon the whole of the Net Revenues which shall be a first lien to continue until payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Bonds payable from the Net Revenues, or, until sufficient cash or Sufficient Government Obligations have been deposited in trust for payment in full of all Bonds of a series then outstanding, principal and interest on such Bonds to maturity, or, if called for redemption, to the date fixed for redemption together with the amount of the redemption premium, if any. The first lien referred to herein shall be equally shared and be a first priority with the City's Outstanding Bonds. Upon deposit of cash or Sufficient Government Obligations, as provided in the previous sentence, the statutory lien shall be terminated with respect to that series of Bonds, the holders of that series shall have no further rights under this Ordinance except for payment from the deposited funds, and the Bonds of that series shall no longer be considered to be outstanding under this Ordinance. 
In addition, since more than 25% of the cost of the Projects for which that portion of the Outstanding Bonds which are being refunded herein were issued were defrayed from the proceeds of grant funds, the City has previously pledged to that portion of the Outstanding Bonds which are being refunded herein and does hereby reaffirm its pledge to the Refunding Bonds its limited tax full faith and credit for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds. Should the Net Revenues of the System be at any time insufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds and/or the Outstanding Bonds, as the same becomes due, then the City shall advance from any funds available therefor; or, if necessary, levy taxes on all taxable property in the City, subject to applicable constitutional, charter and statutory limitations, such sums as may be necessary to pay said principal and interest. Such funds shall be deposited directly into the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund established pursuant to Section 13(B) of Ordinance No. 1958, and the City shall be reimbursed for any such advance from the Net Revenues of the System subsequently received which are not otherwise pledged or encumbered by the Outstanding Ordinances or this Ordinance. 
Section 7.   Bondholders' Rights; Receiver. The holder or holders of the Bonds representing in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding, may, by suit, action; mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce the statutory lien upon the Net Revenues of the System, and may, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, enforce and compel performance of all duties of the officers of the Issuer, including the fixing of sufficient rates, the collection of Revenues, the proper segregation of the Revenues of the System and the proper application thereof. The statutory lien upon the Net Revenues, however, shall not be construed as to compel the sale of the System or any part thereof. 
If there is a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on the Bonds, any court having jurisdiction in any proper action may appoint a receiver to administer and operate the System on behalf of the Issuer and under the direction of the court, and by and with the approval of the court to perform all of the duties of the officers of the Issuer more particularly set forth herein and in Act 94. 
The holder or holders of the Bonds shall have all other rights and remedies given by Act 94 and law, for the payment and enforcement of the Bonds and the security therefor. 
Section 8.   Rates and Charges. The rates and charges for service furnished by and the use of the System and the methods of collection and enforcement of the collection of the rates shall be those in effect on date even herewith, as the same may be increased from time to time. 
Section 9.   No Free Service or Use. No free service or use of the System, or service or use of the System at less than the reasonable cost and value thereof, shall be furnished by the System to any person, firm or corporation, public or private, or to any public agency or instrumentality, including the Issuer. 
Section 10.   Fixing and Revising Rates. The rates presently in effect in the City are estimated to be sufficient to provide for the payment of the expenses of administration and operation and such expenses for maintenance of the System as are necessary to preserve the System in good repair and working order, to provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds as the same become due and payable, and the maintenance of the reserve therefor and to provide for all other obligations, expenditures and funds for the System required by law and this Ordinance. The rates shall be reviewed not less than once a year and shall be fixed and revised from time to time as may be necessary to produce these amounts, and it is hereby covenanted and agreed to fix and maintain rates for services furnished by the System at all times sufficient to provide for the foregoing. 
Section 11.   Bond Reserve Fund. The Reserve Account in the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund, as established and supplemented by the Outstanding Ordinances shall be maintained in such amounts, so that said Bond Reserve Account shall total a sum equal to the lesser of (a) such amount as is equal to the largest annual debt service requirement on the Bonds or (b) 10% of the principal amount of the Bonds. In the event that the interest in said Reserve Account is greater than such largest annual debt service requirement, such excess amount shall be promptly transferred to the Receiving Fund. 
Section 12.   Bond Proceeds. From the proceeds of the sale of the Refunding Bonds there shall be immediately deposited in the Redemption Fund an amount equal to the accrued interest and premium, if any, received on the delivery of the Refunding Bonds. In addition, there shall be deposited to the Bond Reserve Account from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds, a sum, which taken together with moneys transferred from the Bond Reserve Account established and maintained, if any and/or sums transferred from System funds on hand and legally available for such use, if any, which will be sufficient to meet the requirements of Section 11 hereunder. Certain of the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds and, if deemed necessary or advisable by the Issuer, moneys on hand in the outstanding Bond Reserve Account, shall be deposited in an escrow fund or funds (the "Escrow Fund") consisting of cash and investments in direct obligations of or obligations of the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America or other obligations the principal of and interest on which are fully secured by the foregoing not redeemable at the option of the Issuer in amounts fully sufficient to pay the principal, interest and redemption premiums on all of the Refunded Bonds, which are to be refunded hereunder and shall be used only for such purposes. If deemed necessary or advisable by the Issuer, the Escrow Fund may consist of two (2) or more separate funds as provided in the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be held by NBD Bank, N.A., as the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agent") pursuant to an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") which shall irrevocably direct the Escrow Agent to take all necessary steps to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunded Bonds when due and to call the Refunded Bonds for redemption on the first call date, as specified by the Issuer. The amounts held in the Escrow Fund shall be such that the cash and investments and income received thereon will be sufficient without reinvestment to pay the principal, interest and redemption premiums on the Refunded Bonds when due at maturity or by call for redemption as required by the Sales Resolution. The remaining proceeds of the Bonds shall be used to pay the costs of issuance of the Bonds. Any proceeds in excess of the proceeds deposited in the Escrow Fund or required to pay costs of issuance shall be deposited in the Redemption Fund and used to pay interest on the Bonds on May 1, 1994. 
The City Clerk, the City Treasurer, the Chief Accountant and the Finance Director of the Issuer are each authorized to negotiate an Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Issuer.

The Bonds shall be designated WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER SYSTEM REVENUE BONDS, SERIES 2000, and shall be payable solely and only out of the Net Revenues of the System, and shall consist of fully registered bonds of the denomination of $5,000 or multiples thereof not exceeding for each maturity the aggregate principal amount of that maturity, dated as of October 1, 2000, numbered in direct order of maturity from 1 upwards, and payable serially on November 1st of each year as follows: 
$ 75,000 	2001; 
$125,000 	2002 to 2010, inclusive;

$425,000 	2013 to 2017, inclusive; 
$450,000 	2018, 2019 and 2020. 
 
The Bonds shall bear interest at a rate or rates to be determined on public sale thereof, but in any event not exceeding an average of 8% per annum, payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing May 1, 2001. The principal of the Bonds shall be payable as designated below as long as the Bonds are held in book-entry-only form and at the principal trust office of the Transfer Agent if the Bonds are no longer held in book-entry-form. Bank One Trust Company, National Association, Detroit, Michigan is hereby selected to act as registrar and Transfer Agent for this issue. The Bonds shall be sold at not less than 98 ¾% of their par value. The Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity as provided in Section 11 hereof. 
When issued, the Bonds will be registered in the name of the registered owner. So long as Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, is the registered owner of the Bonds, the transfer of interest in the Bonds shall be the sole responsibility of DTC Participants, the Indirect Participants and the Beneficial Owners as hereinafter defined and neither the City nor the Paying Agent shall have any responsibility with respect to such transfers. In such circumstances, payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds will be made by the Paying Agent to DTC as registered owner of the Bonds. In the event the Bonds ceased to be held in the book-entry-only system, the interest on the Bonds shall be payable when due by check or draft to the person or entity who or which is, as of the fifteenth (15th) day of the month preceding each interest payment date, the registered owner of record, at the owner's registered address. 
DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds. The ownership of one (1) fully registered Bond for each maturity, each in the aggregate principal amount of such a maturity, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of the New York Commercial Code and a "clearing agency" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. DTC was created to hold securities of its participants (the "DTC Participants") and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among DTC Participants, thereby eliminating the need of physical movement of securities certificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (the "Indirect Participants"). 
The DTC Participants shall receive a credit balance in the records of DTC. The ownership of each actual purchaser of each Bond (the "Beneficial Owners") will be recorded through the records of the DTC Participant. Beneficial Owners will receive a written confirmation of their purchase providing details of the Bonds acquired. Transfers of ownership in the Bonds will be accomplished by book entries made by DTC and, in turn, by the DTC Participants who act on behalf of the Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interest in the Bonds, except as specifically provided in this Ordinance. Interest and principal will be paid by the Paying Agent to DTC, or its nominee, and then paid by DTC to the DTC Participants and thereafter paid by the DTC Participants to the Beneficial Owners when due. Neither the Issuer nor the Paying Agent will have any responsibility for obligations to such DTC Participants or the persons for whom they act as nominees with respect to the payment to or the providing of notice for the DTC Participants, or the Indirect Participants, or Beneficial Owners. 
So long as Cede & Co. is the registered owner of the Bonds, as nominee of DTC, references herein to the bondholders or registered owners of the Bonds shall mean Cede & Co. and shall not mean the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds. 
For every transfer and exchange of the Bonds, the Beneficial Owners may be charged a sum sufficient to cover any tax, fee or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto. 
DTC may determine to discontinue providing its services with respect to the Bonds at any time by giving notice of the Issuer and the Paying Agent and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, bond certificates are required to be delivered as described in this Ordinance. The Beneficial Owners, upon registration of certificates held in the Beneficial Owner's name, will become the Bondholders. 
The City may determine that continuation of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository) is not in the best interest of the Beneficial Owners. In such event, bond certificates will be delivered in $5,000 denominations or multiples thereof, registered in the names of the registered owners of the Bonds as shown in the registration books held by DTC or the Paying Agent. Principal, redemption price, if any, and interest payments on the Bonds will be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede & Co., as registered owners of the Bonds. 
In the event that the book-entry-only system is discontinued, the following provisions will apply to the Bonds. The Paying Agent shall keep the registration books for the Bonds (the "Bond Register") at its corporate trust office. Subject to further conditions contained in this Ordinance, the Bonds may be transferred or exchanged for one (1) or more Bonds in different authorized denominations upon surrender thereof at the principal corporate trust office of the Payment Agent by the registered owners or their duly authorized attorneys; upon surrender of any Bonds to be transferred or exchanges, the Paying Agent shall record the transfer or exchange in the Bond Register and shall authenticate denominations; during the 15 days immediately preceding the date of mailing ("Record Date") of any notice of redemption or any time following the mailing of any notice of redemption, the Paying Agent shall not be required to effect or register any transfer or exchange of any Bond which has been selected for such redemption, except the Bonds properly surrendered for partial redemption may be exchanged for new Bonds in authorized denominations equal in the aggregate to the unredeemed portion; the Issuer and Paying Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered owners of the Bonds, as their names appear in the Bond Register as of the appropriate dates, as the owner of such Bonds for all purposes under this Ordinance. No transfer or exchange made other than as described above and in this Ordinance shall be valid or effective for any purposes under this Ordinance. 
So long as the book-entry-only system remains in effect, in the event of a partial redemption the Paying Agent will give notice to Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, only, and only Cede & Co. will be deemed to be a holder of the Bonds. 
Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner specified in the form of the Bonds contained in this Ordinance. 
The Bonds shall be executed in the name of the City with the facsimile signatures of the Mayor, City Clerk and City Treasurer and shall have the City's seal printed on them. No Bond shall be valid until authenticated by an authorized signer of the transfer agent. The Bonds shall be delivered to the transfer agent for authentication and be delivered by the transfer agent to the purchaser in accordance with instructions from the Finance Director of the City upon payment of the purchase price for the Bonds in accordance with the bid therefor when accepted. Executed blank bonds for registration and issuance to transferees shall simultaneously, and from time to time thereafter as necessary, be delivered to the transfer agent for safe-keeping. 
Registration and Transfer 
Section 7. The transfer agent shall keep or cause to be kept, at its principal office, sufficient books for the registration and transfer of the Bonds, which shall at all times be open to inspection by the City; and, upon presentation for such purpose, the transfer agent shall, under such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, transfer or cause to be transferred, on said books, Bonds as hereinbefore provided. 
If any Bond shall become mutilated, the City, at the expense of the holder of the Bond, shall execute, and the transfer agent shall authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like tenor in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Bond, upon surrender to the transfer agent of the mutilated Bond. If any Bond issued under this Ordinance shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the transfer agent and, if this evidence is satisfactory to both and indemnity satisfactory to the transfer agent shall be given, and if all requirements of any applicable law including Act 354, Public Acts of Michigan, 1972, as amended ("Act 354"), being sections 129.131 to 129.135, inclusive, of the Michigan Compiled Laws have been met, the City, at the expense of the owner, shall execute, and the transfer agent shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like tenor and bearing the statement required by Act 354, or any applicable law hereafter enacted, in lieu of and in substitution for the Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen. If any such Bond shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute Bond the transfer agent may pay the same without surrender thereof. 
Bond Reserve Account 
Section 8. The Reserve Account in the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund, as established by the Outstanding Ordinances, shall be increased, by an amount which, when added to the sums on account in the Reserve Account, shall be equal to the lesser of (a) the highest annual debt service requirements on the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds (b) 125% of the average annual debt service on the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds or (c) 10% of the principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds and the Bonds. To provide said additional funds for the Bond Reserve Account, there shall be deposited into said Account from funds on hand of the System legally available therefor, a sum of moneys sufficient to meet such requirements. All of the provisions relative to use of the Bond Reserve Account, its maintenance and other detail relative thereto shall remain as specifically set forth in the Outstanding Ordinances.

Moneys in the Construction Fund shall be applied solely in payment of the cost of the acquisition and construction of the Project, including any engineering, legal and other expenses incident thereto and to the financing thereof including bond insurance premiums. Any payments for construction, either on account or otherwise, shall not be made unless the registered engineer in charge of such work shall file with the City Council a signed statement to the effect that the work has been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor; that it was done pursuant to and in accordance with the contract therefor (including properly authorized change orders), that the work is satisfactory and that any such work has not been previously paid for. The investment of the Bonds shall be limited as may be required by federal law. Any unexpended balance of the proceeds of sale of the Bonds remaining after completion of the Project may, in the discretion of the City Council, be used for further improvements and extensions to the System: Provided, That, at the time of such expenditure, such use be approved by the Michigan Department of Treasury.

The Transfer Agent shall keep or cause to be kept, at its principal office, sufficient books for the registration and transfer of the Bonds, which shall at all times be open to inspection by the Issuer; and, upon presentation for such purpose, the Transfer Agent shall, under such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, transfer or cause to be transferred, on said books, Bonds as hereinbefore provided. 
If any Bond shall become mutilated, the Issuer, at the expense of the holder of the Bond, shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like tenor in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Bond, upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the mutilated Bond. If any Bond issued under this Ordinance shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the Transfer Agent and, if this evidence is satisfactory to both and indemnity satisfactory to the Transfer Agent shall be given, and if all requirements of any applicable law including Act 354, Public Acts of Michigan, 1972, as amended ("Act 354"), being sections 129.131 to 129.135, inclusive, of the Michigan Compiled Laws have been met, the Issuer, at the expense of the owner, shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like tenor and bearing the statement required by Act 354, or any applicable law hereafter enacted, in lieu of and in substitution for the Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen.

Section 6. Payment of Bonds. The Bonds and the interest thereon shall be payable solely and only from the Net Revenues, and to secure such payment, there is hereby recognized a statutory lien upon the whole of the Net Revenues which shall be a first lien to continue until payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Bonds payable from the Net Revenues, or, until sufficient cash or Sufficient Government Obligations have been deposited in trust for payment in full of all Bonds of a series then outstanding, principal and interest on such Bonds to maturity, or, if called for redemption, to the date fixed for redemption together with the amount of the redemption premium, if any. The statutory first lien referred to herein shall be of equal standing and priority with the Outstanding Bonds which are not being refunded with the Bonds. Upon deposit of cash or Sufficient Government Obligations, as provided in the previous sentence, the statutory lien shall be terminated with respect to that series of Bonds, the holders of that series shall have no further rights under this Ordinance or the Outstanding Ordinances except for payment from the deposited funds, and the Bonds of that series shall no longer be considered to be outstanding under this Ordinance or the Outstanding Ordinances. 
Section 7. Bondholders' Rights; Receiver. The holder or holders of the Bonds representing in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding, may, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce the statutory lien upon the Net Revenues of the System, and may, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, enforce and compel performance of all duties of the officers of the Issuer, including the fixing of sufficient rates, the collection of Revenues, the proper segregation of the Revenues of the System and the proper application thereof. The statutory lien upon the Net Revenues, however, shall not be construed as to compel the sale of the System or any part thereof. 
If there is a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on the Bonds, any court having jurisdiction in any proper action may appoint a receiver to administer and operate the System on behalf of the Issuer and under the direction of the court, and by and with the approval of the court to perform all of the duties of the officers of the Issuer more particularly set forth herein and in Act 94. 
The holder or holders of the Bonds shall have all other rights and remedies given by Act 94 and law, for the payment and enforcement of the Bonds and the security therefor. 
Section 8. Rates and Charges. The rates and charges for service furnished by and the use of the System and the methods of collection and enforcement of the collection of the rates shall be those in effect on date even herewith, as the same may be increased from time to time. 
Section 9. No Free Service or Use. No free service or use of the System, or service or use of the System at less than the reasonable cost and value thereof, shall be furnished by the System to any person, firm or corporation, public or private, or to any public agency or instrumentality, including the Issuer. 
Section 10. Fixing and Revising Rates. The rates presently in effect in the City are estimated to be sufficient to provide for the payment of the expenses of administration and operation and such expenses for maintenance of the System as are necessary to preserve the System in good repair and working order, to provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds as the same become due and payable, and the maintenance of the reserve therefor and to provide for all other obligations, expenditures and funds for the System required by law, this Ordinance, and the Outstanding Ordinances. The rates shall be reviewed not less than once a year and shall be fixed and revised from time to time as may be necessary to produce these amounts, and it is hereby covenanted and agreed to fix and maintain rates for services furnished by the System at all times sufficient to provide for the foregoing. 
Section 11. Bond Reserve Account. The Reserve Account in the Bond and Interest Redemption Fund, as established by the Outstanding Ordinances shall be adjusted in such amounts so that said Bond Reserve Account shall comprise a sum equal to the lesser of (a) the largest annual debt service requirement on the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds, (b) 10% of the principal amount of the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds, or (c) 125% of the average annual debt service on the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds. In the event that the amount in said Reserve Account is greater than the lesser of the above three tests, such excess amount shall be promptly transferred to the Receiving Fund at the end of each fiscal year. In addition, if deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with the issuance of the Bonds, moneys shall be transferred from the Bond Reserve Account to the Escrow Fund in an amount required by federal law. 
Section 12. Bond Proceeds. From the proceeds of the sale of the Refunding Bonds there shall be immediately deposited in the Redemption Fund an amount equal to the accrued interest and premium, if any, received on the delivery of the Refunding Bonds. Certain of the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds and, if deemed necessary or advisable by the Issuer, moneys on hand in the Bond Reserve Account and/or Bond and Interest Redemption Fund, shall be deposited in an escrow fund or funds (the "Escrow Fund") consisting of cash and investments in direct obligations of or obligations of the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America or other obligations the principal of and interest on which are fully secured by the foregoing not redeemable at the option of the Issuer in amounts fully sufficient to pay the principal, interest and redemption premiums on the Refunded Bonds, which are to be refunded hereunder and shall be used only for such purposes. The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") which shall irrevocably direct the Escrow Agent to take all necessary steps to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunded Bonds when due and to call the Refunded Bonds for redemption on the first call date, as specified by the Issuer. The amounts held in the Escrow Fund shall be such that the cash and investments and income received thereon will be sufficient without reinvestment to pay the principal, interest and redemption premiums on the Refunded Bonds when due at maturity or by call for redemption as required by the Sales Resolution. The remaining proceeds of the Bonds shall be used to pay the costs of issuance of the Bonds. Any proceeds in excess of the proceeds deposited in the Escrow Fund or required to pay costs of issuance shall be deposited in the Redemption Fund and used to pay interest on the Bonds on the next available interest payment date.

If any Bond issued under this Ordinance shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the Transfer Agent and, if this evidence is satisfactory to both and indemnity satisfactory to the Transfer Agent shall be given, and if all requirements of any applicable law including Act 354, Public Acts of Michigan, 1972, as amended ("Act 354"), being sections 129.131 to 129.135, inclusive, of the Michigan Compiled Laws have been met, the Issuer, at the expense of the owner, shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Bond of like tenor and bearing the statement required by Act 354, or any applicable law hereafter enacted, in lieu of and in substitution for the Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen. If any such Bond shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute Bond the Transfer Agent may pay the same without surrender thereof. 
The Bonds may be issued in book-entry-only form through the Depository Trust Company in New York, New York ("DTC") and any officer of the City is authorized to execute such custodial or other agreement with DTC as may be necessary to accomplish the issuance of the Bonds in book-entry-only form and to make such changes in the Bond form with the parameters of this resolution as may be required to accomplish the foregoing. 
Section 8. Payment of Bonds. The Bonds and the interest thereon shall be payable solely and only from the Net Revenues, and to secure such payment, there is hereby recognized a statutory lien upon the whole of the Net Revenues which shall be a first lien to continue until payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Bonds payable from the Net Revenues, or, until sufficient cash or Sufficient Government Obligations have been deposited in trust for payment in full of all Bonds of a series then outstanding, principal and interest on such Bonds to maturity, or, if called for redemption, to the date fixed for redemption together with the amount of the redemption premium, if any. The statutory first lien referred to herein shall be of equal standing and priority with the City's Outstanding Bonds which are not being refunded with the Bonds. Upon deposit of cash or Sufficient Government Obligations, as provided in the previous sentence, the statutory lien shall be terminated with respect to that series of Bonds, the holders of that series shall have no further rights under this Ordinance except for payment from the deposited funds, and the Bonds of that series shall no longer be considered to be outstanding under this Ordinance. 
Section 9. Bondholders' Rights; Receiver. The holder or holders of the Bonds representing in the aggregate not less than twenty percent (20%) of the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding, may, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce the statutory lien upon the Net Revenues of the System, and may, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, enforce and compel performance of all duties of the officers of the Issuer, including the fixing of sufficient rates, the collection of Revenues, the proper segregation of the Revenues of the System and the proper application thereof. The statutory lien upon the Net Revenues, however, shall not be construed as to compel the sale of the System or any part thereof. 
If there is a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on the Bonds, any court having jurisdiction in any proper action may appoint a receiver to administer and operate the System on behalf of the Issuer and under the direction of the court, and by and with the approval of the court to perform all of the duties of the officers of the Issuer more particularly set forth herein and in Act 94. 
The holder or holders of the Bonds shall have all other rights and remedies given by Act 94 and law, for the payment and enforcement of the Bonds and the security therefor. 
Section 10. Rates and Charges. The rates and charges for service furnished by and the use of the System and the methods of collection and enforcement of the collection of the rates shall be those in effect on date even herewith, as the same shall be increased from time to time. 
Section 11. No Free Service or Use. No free service or use of the System, or service or use of the System at less than the reasonable cost and value thereof, shall be furnished by the System to any person, firm or corporation, public or private, or to any public agency or instrumentality, including the Issuer. 
Section 12. Fixing and Revising Rates. The rates presently in effect in the City are estimated to be sufficient to provide for the payment of the expenses of administration and operation and such expenses for maintenance of the System as are necessary to preserve the System in good repair and working order, to provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds as the same become due and payable, and the maintenance of the reserve therefor and to provide for all other obligations, expenditures and funds for the System required by law and this Ordinance. The rates shall be reviewed not less than once a year and shall be fixed and revised from time to time as may be necessary to produce these amounts, and it is hereby covenanted and agreed to fix and maintain rates for services furnished by the System at all times sufficient to provide for the foregoing. 
Section 13. Series 2005 Bond Proceeds. There is hereby established in a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to be selected by the Finance Director, a separate depositary account to be designated "Water Supply and Sewage Disposal System Revenue Bonds Series 2005 Construction Fund", the moneys from time to time on deposit to be used solely to pay the cost of the Project and the incidental costs set forth in Section 4 of this Ordinance. The proceeds of sale of the Series 2005 Bonds shall be allocated and used as follows: 
First, any premium and accrued interest, if any, shall be deposited into the Bond and Interest Redemption Account established by the Outstanding Ordinances. 
Second, the amount of funds necessary to pay the costs of the Project, as set forth in the Sales Order, shall be deposited in the Construction Fund. Moneys in the Construction Fund shall be applied solely in payment of the cost of the acquisition and construction of the Project, including any engineering expenses incident thereto. Any payments for construction, either on account or otherwise, shall not be made unless the registered engineer in charge of such work shall file with the City Council a signed statement to the effect that the work has been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor; that it was done pursuant to and in accordance with the contract therefor (including properly authorized change orders), that the work is satisfactory and that any such work has not been previously paid for. The investment of the Bonds shall be limited as may be required by federal law. Any unexpended balance of the proceeds of sale of the Bonds in the Construction Fund remaining after completion of the Project may, in the discretion of the Issuer, be used for further improvements and extensions to the System: provided, that, at the time of such expenditure, such use be approved by the Michigan Department of Treasury, if necessary. Any remaining balance after such expenditure, or in the event no such expenditure is made, the entire unexpended balance shall be paid into the Bond and Interest Redemption Account and used for the redemption or purchase of callable bonds or for any other purpose permitted by Act 94. The proceeds of sale of said bonds may be invested in whole or in part in the manner provided by Act 94. 
Section 14. Series 2006 Bond Proceeds. There is hereby established with the Escrow Agent a fund to be designated as "City of Livonia Escrow Fund" (the "Escrow Fund"). Certain of the proceeds of the Series 2006 Bonds and, if deemed necessary or advisable by the Issuer, moneys on hand in the outstanding Bond Reserve Account, as set forth in the Sales Order, shall be deposited in the Escrow Fund consisting of cash and investments in direct obligations of or obligations of the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America or other obligations the principal of and interest on which are fully secured by the foregoing not redeemable at the option of the Issuer in amounts fully sufficient to pay the principal, interest and redemption premiums on all of the Refunded Bonds, which are to be refunded hereunder and shall be used only for such purposes together with all costs of issuance of the Series 2006 Bonds, including legal and other expenses incident thereto and to the financing thereof including bond insurance premiums. The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") which shall irrevocably direct the Escrow Agent to take all necessary steps to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunded Bonds when due and to call the Refunded Bonds for redemption on the first call date, as specified by the Issuer. The amounts held in the Escrow Fund shall be such that the cash and investments and income received thereon will be sufficient without reinvestment to pay the principal, interest and redemption premiums, if any, on the Refunded Bonds when due at maturity or by call for redemption as required by the Sales Order. Any proceeds in excess of the proceeds deposited in the Escrow Fund or required to pay costs of issuance shall be deposited in the Redemption Account and used to pay interest on the Bonds on the next available interest payment date. 
The Mayor, City Clerk and the Finance Director of the Issuer are each authorized to negotiate an Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Issuer. 
Section 15. Management; Fiscal Year. The operator, repair and management of the System and the acquiring of the Project shall be under the supervision and control of the City Council and the Fiscal Year for the System shall commence on December 1 of each year and shall end on the last day of November of the next year. The Issuer may employ such person or persons in such capacity or capacities as it deems advisable to carry on the efficient management and operation of the System. The City Council may make such rules and regulations as it deems advisable and necessary to assure the efficient management and operation of the System. 
Section 16. Funds and Accounts; Flow of Funds. Commencing as of December 1, 2005, all funds belonging to the System shall be transferred as herein indicated and all Revenues of the System shall be set aside as collected and credited to a fund to be designated WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER SYSTEM RECEIVING FUND (the "Receiving Fund"). In addition, on December 1, 2005 all Revenues in any accounts of the System shall be transferred to the Receiving Fund and credited to the funds and accounts as provided in this section. The Revenues credited to the Receiving Fund are pledged for the purpose of the following funds and shall be transferred or debited from the Receiving Fund periodically in the manner and at the times and in the order of priority hereinafter specified: 
A.  OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNT: 
Out of the Revenues credited to the Receiving Fund there shall be first set aside in, or credited to, a fund designated OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNT (the "Operation and Maintenance Account"), monthly a sum sufficient to provide for the payment of the next month's expenses of administration and operation of the System and such current expenses for the maintenance thereof as may be necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order. 
A budget, showing in detail the estimated costs of administration, operation and maintenance of the System for the next ensuing operating year, shall be prepared by the City Council at least 30 days prior to the commencement of each ensuing operating year. No payments shall be made to the Issuer from moneys credited to the Operation and Maintenance Account except for services directly rendered to the System by the Issuer or its personnel. 
B.  BOND AND INTEREST REDEMPTION ACCOUNT: 
There shall be established and maintained a separate depositary fund designated BOND AND INTEREST REDEMPTION ACCOUNT (the "Redemption Account"), the moneys on deposit therein from time to time to be used solely for the purpose of paying the principal of, redemption premiums (if any) and interest on the Bonds. The moneys in the Redemption Account (including the Bond Reserve Account) shall be kept on deposit with the bank or trust company where the principal of and interest on the Bonds, or any series thereof, are payable. 
Out of the Revenues remaining in the Receiving Fund, after provision for the Operation and Maintenance Account, there shall be set aside each month commencing December 1, 2005 in the Redemption Account an amount equal to 1/6 of the interest coming due on the Bonds on May 1, 2006, less any amount in the Redemption Account representing accrued interest on the Bonds or investment income on amounts on deposit in the Redemption Account. The amount of principal next coming due by maturity and the amount set aside each month for principal payment commencing December 1, 2005, shall be 1/12 of the amount of principal next coming due by maturity on November 1 of each year. If there is any deficiency in the amount previously set aside, that deficiency shall be added to the next succeeding monthly requirements. The amount to be set aside for the payment of principal and interest on any date shall not exceed the amount which, when added to the money on deposit in the Redemption Account, including investment income thereon is necessary to pay principal and interest due on the Bonds on the next succeeding principal payment date. 
There has been previously established by the Outstanding Ordinances a separate account in the Redemption Account known as the BOND RESERVE ACCOUNT (the "Bond Reserve Account"), the moneys in which Account shall be transferred to the Bond Reserve Account established herein. Upon delivery of the Series 2005 Bonds, there shall be deposited in the Bond Reserve Account from the proceeds of the Series 2005 Bonds, an amount so that the balance in the Bond Reserve Account shall be equal to the lesser of (1) the maximum annual debt service on the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds due in the current or any future year, (2) 125% of the average annual debt service on the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds, or (3) 10% of the principal amount of the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds (the "Reserve Amount"). Interest on the Bond Reserve Account must be transferred into the Redemption Account once the Reserve Amount has been reached. In addition, upon delivery of the Series 2006 Bonds, there shall be either added to the Bond Reserve Account a sum sufficient to meet the Bond Reserve Amount or to the extent that the Bond Reserve Amount is greater than required, then the excess moneys in the Bond Reserve Account shall be used to reduce the principal amount of the Series 2006 Bonds. 
Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the moneys credited to the Bond Reserve Account shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of, redemption premiums (if any) and interest on the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds as to which there would otherwise be a default. If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys credited to the Bond Reserve Account for such payment, then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the Net Revenues first received thereafter which are not required for current principal and interest requirements until the amount on deposit equals the Reserve Amount. If additional Bonds are issued, each Ordinance authorizing the additional Bonds shall provide for additional deposits to the Bond Reserve Account to be made from the proceeds of the additional Bonds or City funds on hand and legally available for such use in an amount that will result in the Bond Reserve Account being funded to the Bond Reserve Amount. If on any December 1st the amount in the Bond Reserve Account exceeds the Bond Reserve Amount, the excess may be transferred to the Redemption Account for payment of principal and interest on the Bonds due on that date. 
For purposes of making deposits to the Redemption Account and the Bond Reserve Account, the principal amount of Bonds becoming due by reason of a Mandatory Redemption Requirement shall be deemed to become due in the principal amount and on the due date of the Mandatory Redemption Requirements. Each Ordinance authorizing the sale of Additional Bonds shall state the amount of Bonds authorized which are term Bonds, if any. A Mandatory Redemption Requirement for the Bonds of a term maturity may be satisfied by the call of term Bonds of the same issue and maturity in the principal amount of the Mandatory Redemption Requirement at par and accrued interest or by the purchase and surrender to the transfer agent of the Bonds of the same issue and maturity from money allocated therefor as provided herein, or purchased with other funds legally available therefor. The Issuer shall elect the manner in which it intends to satisfy a Mandatory Redemption Requirement not less than forty-five days prior to the due date of each Mandatory Redemption Requirement. 
The money set aside to satisfy the next Mandatory Redemption Requirement for the Bonds shall be used by redeeming said Bonds on the following November 1st or by purchasing Bonds of the same issue and maturity with respect to which the Mandatory Redemption Requirement applies and surrendering the same to the paying agent for cancellation or on prior to the required due date of the Mandatory Redemption Requirement. In the event that after any Mandatory Redemption Requirement date moneys remain in the Redemption Account, as a result of the purchase of Bonds at less than par, the amount of such excess may be transferred to the Receiving Fund. If no Bonds of an issue are issued as term Bonds then there shall be no Mandatory Redemption Requirement with respect to those Bonds. 
C.  REPLACEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT FUND: 
There shall next be established and maintained a separate depositary account, designated REPLACEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACCOUNT (the "Replacement Account"), the money credited thereto to be used solely for the purpose of making repairs, replacements, improvements, enlargements or extensions to the System, including any buildings or structures related to said System. Out of the Revenues and moneys of the System remaining in the Receiving Fund and the end of each month after provision has been made for the deposit of moneys in the Operation and Maintenance Account and the Redemption Account including the Bond Reserve Account, there may be deposited in the Replacement Account such additional funds as the City may deem advisable. If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys in the Replacement Account for the purpose for which the Replacement Account was established, the moneys so used shall be replaced from any moneys in the Receiving Account which are not required by this Ordinance to be used for the Operation and Maintenance Account or the Redemption Account including the Bond Reserve Account. 
D.  GENERAL OBLIGATION DEBT ACCOUNT: 
Out of the remaining Revenues in the Receiving Fund, there may be next set aside in or credited to monthly after meeting the requirements of the foregoing Account, to an account designated General Obligation Debt Account (the "G.O. Account"), or from other available moneys such sums as shall be necessary to pay debt service on presently existing or future general obligation bond issues of the City or general obligations or contractual obligations of the City incurred or to be incurred for System purposes. 
E.  SURPLUS MONEYS: 
All moneys remaining in the Receiving Fund after satisfying all the foregoing requirements of this Section 16, may, at the option of the City Council, be used for any of the following purposes: 
(1)  Transferred to the Replacement Account or the G.O. Debt Account. 
(2)  Transferred to the Redemption Account and used for the purchase of Bonds on the open market at not more than the fair market value thereof or for the redemption of Bonds prior to maturity. 
Section 17. Priority of Funds. In the event the moneys in the Receiving Fund are insufficient to provide for the current requirements of the Operation and Maintenance Account or the Redemption Account, any moneys or securities in other funds of the System, except the proceeds of sale of the Bonds, shall be credited or transferred, first, to the Operation and Maintenance Account, and second to the Redemption Account. 
Section 18. Depositary and Funds on Hand. Moneys in the fund and the several accounts established pursuant to this Ordinance, except moneys in the Redemption Account (including the Bond Reserve Account) and moneys derived from the proceeds of sale of the Bonds, may be kept in one or more accounts at a bank or banks designated by resolution of the City Council, and if kept in one bank account the moneys shall be allocated on the books and records of the Issuer in the manner and at the times provided in this Ordinance. 
Section 19. Investments. Moneys in the fund and accounts established herein and moneys derived from the proceeds of sale of the Bonds, may be invested by the Issuer as set forth by State law and by the investment policy of the City, provided that investment of moneys in the Bond Reserve Account shall be limited to obligations bearing maturity dates or subject to redemption, at the option of the holder thereof, not later than five years from the date of the investment. In the event investments are made, any securities representing the same shall be kept on deposit with the bank or trust company having on deposit the fund or funds or account from which the purchase was made. Profit realized or interest income earned on investment of funds in the Receiving Account, Operation and Maintenance Account, Improvement Account or GO Debt Account shall be deposited in or credited to the Receiving Fund at the end of each fiscal year. Profit realized on interest income earned on investment of moneys in the Redemption Account including income derived from the Bond Reserve Account shall be credited to the Receiving Fund at the end of each fiscal year. 
Section 20. Form of Series 2005 Bonds and Series 2006 Bonds. The Series 2005 Bonds and the Series 2006 Bonds shall be in substantially the following forms:

Section 21. Covenants. The Issuer covenants and agrees with the holders of the Bonds that so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding and unpaid as to either principal or interest - 
(a)  The Issuer will maintain the System in good repair and working order and will operate the same efficiently and will faithfully and punctually perform all duties with reference to the System required by the Constitution and laws of the State of Michigan and this Ordinance. 
(b)  The Issuer will keep proper books of record and account separate from all other records and accounts of the Issuer, in which shall be made full and correct entries of all transactions relating to the System. The Issuer shall have an annual audit of the books of record and account of the System for the preceding operating year made each year by an independent certified public accountant, and a copy of the audit shall be mailed to the manager of each syndicate or account originally purchasing any issue of the Bonds. The auditor shall comment on the manner in which the Issuer is complying with the requirements of the Ordinance with respect to setting aside and investing moneys and meeting the requirements for acquiring and maintaining insurance. The audit shall be completed and so made available not later than six (6) months after the close of each operating year. 
(c)  The Issuer will maintain and carry, for the benefit of the holders of the Bonds, insurance on all physical properties of the System and liability insurance, of the kinds and in the amounts normally carried by municipalities engaged in the operation of Water Supply and Sewage Disposal Systems, including self-insurance. All moneys received for losses under any such insurance policies shall be applied solely to the replacement and restoration of the property damaged or destroyed, and to the extent not so used, shall be used for the purpose of redeeming or purchasing Bonds. 
(d)  The Issuer will not sell, lease or dispose of the System, or any substantial part, until all of the Bonds have been paid in full, both as to principal and interest or provision made thereof as herein provided. The Issuer will operate the System as economically as possible, will make all repairs and replacements necessary to keep the System in good repair and working order, and will not do or suffer to be done any act which would affect the System in such a way as to have a material adverse effect on the security for the Bonds. 
(e)  The Issuer will not grant any franchise or other rights to any person, firm or corporation to operate a System that will compete with the System and the Issuer will not operate a system that will compete with the System. 
(f)  The Issuer will cause the Project to be acquired and renovated promptly and in accordance with the plans and specification therefor. 
Section 22. Additional Bonds. Except as hereinafter provided, the Issuer shall not issue Additional Bonds of equal standing with the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds. 
The right is reserved in accordance with the provisions of Act 94, to issue Additional Bonds payable from the Revenues of the System which shall be of equal standing and priority of lien on the Net Revenues of the System with the Bonds and the Outstanding Bonds but only for the following purposes and under the following terms and conditions; 
(a)  To complete the Project in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor. Such bonds shall not be authorized unless the engineers in charge of construction shall execute a certificate evidencing the fact that additional funds are needed to complete the Project in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor and stating the amount that will be required to complete the Project. If such certificate shall be so executed and filed with the Issuer, it shall be the duty of the Issuer to provide for and issue additional revenue bonds in the amount stated in said certificate to be necessary to complete the Project in accordance with the plans and specifications plus an amount necessary to issue such bonds or to provide for part or all of such amount from other sources. 
(b)  For subsequent repairs, extensions, enlargements and improvements to the System or for the purpose of refunding part of any Bonds then outstanding and paying costs of issuing such additional Bonds including deposits which may be required to be made to the Bond Reserve Account. Bonds for such purposes shall not be issued pursuant to this subparagraph (b) unless the Adjusted Net Revenues of the System for the then last two (2) preceding twelve-month operating years or the Adjusted Net Revenues for the last preceding twelve- month operating year, if the same shall be lower than the average, shall be equal to at least one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the maximum amount of principal and interest thereafter maturing in any operating year on the then outstanding Bonds and on the additional Bonds then being issued. If the additional Bonds are to be issued in whole or in part for refunding outstanding Bonds, the annual principal and interest requirements shall be determined by deducting from the principal and interest requirements for each operating year the annual principal and interest requirements of any Bonds to be refunded from the proceeds of the additional Bonds. For purposes of this subparagraph (b) the Issuer may elect to use as the last preceding operating year any operating year ending not more than sixteen months prior to the date of delivery of the additional Bonds and as the next to the last preceding operating year, any operating year ending not more than twenty-eight months prior to the date of delivery of the additional Bonds. Determination by the Issuer as to existence of conditions permitting the issuance of additional Bonds shall be conclusive. No additional Bonds of equal standing as to the Net Revenues of the System shall be issued pursuant to the authorization contained in this subparagraph if the Issuer shall then be in default in making its required payments to the Operation and Maintenance Account or the Redemption Account. 
(c)  For refunding a part of the outstanding Bonds and paying costs of issuing such additional Bonds including deposits which may be required to be made to the Bond Reserve Account. No additional Bonds shall be issued pursuant to this subsection unless the maximum amount of principal and interest maturing in any operating year after giving effect to the refunding shall be less than the maximum amount of principal and interest maturing in any operating year prior to giving effect to the refunding. 
Section 23. Sale of Bonds. The Mayor, City Clerk, Treasurer and Finance Director are each hereby authorized to negotiate a Bond Purchase Agreement with the Underwriter finalizing the details of each issue of the Bonds within the authorized parameters of this Ordinance and the Mayor, Finance Director, City Clerk, City Attorney and Treasurer are each authorized to do all other acts and take all other necessary procedures required to effectuate the sale, issuance and delivery of the Bonds, including, but not limited to executing a Sales Order (the "Sales Order") selling the Bonds to the Underwriter and approving the Bond Purchase Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and further exercising the authority and making the determinations pursuant to Section 315(1)(d) of Act 34, Public Acts of Michigan, 2001, as amended ("Act 34"), including interest rates, prices, discounts, maturities, principal amounts, denominations, dates of issuance, interest payment dates, redemption rights and other matters for each issue of the Bonds within the parameters established by this Ordinance.

Section 25. Tax Matters. The Issuer shall, to the extent permitted by law, take all actions within its control necessary to maintain the exclusion of the interest on each issue of the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes under the Code, including, but not limited to, actions relating to any required rebate of arbitrage earnings and the expenditures and investment of Bond proceeds and moneys deemed to be Bond proceeds. 
Section 26. Disclosure. The City covenants it shall comply with the requirements of Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding continuing disclosure and agrees to file a Continuing Disclosure Undertaking as shall be approved by the Finance Director. 
Section 27. Severability; Paragraph Headings; and Conflict.

The paragraph headings in this Ordinance are furnished for convenience of reference only and shall not be considered to be part of this Ordinance.

Section 30. Negotiated Sale. The City Council has considered the option of selling both issues of the Bonds through a competitive sale and a negotiated sale, and, pursuant to the requirements of Act 34, hereby determines that a negotiated sale of both issues of the Bonds will result in the most efficient and expeditious means of selling both issues of the Bonds and will result in the lowest interest cost to the City.

WATER SUPPLY AND 
WASTEWATER SYSTEM 
REVENUE BOND, SERIES 2013 
REGISTERED OWNER: 	Michigan Finance 
Authority 
	
PRINCIPAL AMOUNT: 	Three Million Six 
Hundred Twenty 
Thousand Dollars 
($3,620,000) 
	
DATE OF ORIGINAL ISSUE: 	  
September 17, 2013 
 
The CITY OF LIVONIA, County of Wayne, State of Michigan (the "City"), acknowledges itself to owe and for value received hereby promises to pay, solely out of the hereinafter described Net Revenues of the City's Water Supply and Wastewater System (hereinafter defined), to the Michigan Finance Authority (the "Authority"), or registered assigns, the Principal Amount shown above, or such portion thereof as shall have been advanced to the City pursuant to a Purchase Contract between the City and the Authority and a Supplemental Agreement by and among the City, the Authority and the State of Michigan acting through the Department of Environmental Quality, in lawful money of the United States of America, unless prepaid or reduced prior thereto as hereinafter provided. 
During the time the Principal Amount is being drawn down by the City under this Bond, the Authority will periodically provide to the City a statement showing the amount of principal that has been advanced and the date of each advance, which statement shall constitute prima facie evidence of the reported information, provided that no failure on the part of the Authority to provide such a statement or to reflect a disbursement or the correct amount of a disbursement shall relieve the City of its obligation to repay the outstanding Principal Amount actually advanced, all accrued interest thereon, and any other amount payable with respect thereto in accordance with the terms of this Bond. 
The Principal Amount shall be payable on the dates and in the annual principal installment amounts set forth on the Schedule attached hereto and made a part hereof, as such Schedule may be adjusted if less than $3,620,000 is disbursed to the City or if a portion of the Principal Amount is prepaid as provided below, with interest on said principal installments from the date each said installment is delivered to the holder hereof until paid at the rate of two percent (2.00%) per annum. Interest is first payable on April 1, 2014 and semiannually thereafter on the first day of April and October of each year, and principal is payable on the first day of April commencing April 1, 2015 and annually thereafter, as set forth in the Purchase Contract. 
The Bond may be subject to redemption prior to maturity by the City only with the prior written consent of the Authority and on such terms as may be required by the Authority. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Bond, so long as the Authority is the owner of this Bond, (a) this Bond is payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest at The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. or at such other place as shall be designated in writing to the City by the Authority (the "Authority's Depository"); (b) the City agrees that it will deposit with the Authority's Depository payments of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Bond in immediately available funds by 12:00 noon at least five business days prior to the date on which any such payment is due whether by maturity, redemption or otherwise; in the event that the Authority's Depository has not received the City's deposit by 12:00 noon on the scheduled day, the City shall immediately pay to the Authority as invoiced by the Authority an amount to recover the Authority's administrative costs and lost investment earnings attributable to that late payment; and (c) written notice of any redemption of this Bond shall be given by the City and received by the Authority's Depository at least 40 days prior to the date on which such redemption is to be made. 
Additional Interest 
In the event of a default in the payment of principal or interest hereon when due, whether at maturity, by redemption or otherwise, the amount of such default shall bear interest (the "additional interest") at a rate equal to the rate of interest which is two percent above the Authority's cost of providing funds (as determined by the Authority) to make payment on the bonds of the Authority issued to provide funds to purchase this bond but in no event in excess of the maximum rate of interest permitted by law. The additional interest shall continue to accrue until the Authority has been fully reimbursed for all costs incurred by the Authority (as determined by the Authority) as a consequence of the City's default. Such additional interest shall be payable on the interest payment date following demand of the Authority. In the event that (for reasons other than the default in the payment of any municipal obligation purchased by the Authority) the investment of amounts in the reserve account established by the Authority for the bonds of the Authority issued to provide funds to purchase this bond fails to provide sufficient available funds (together with any other funds which may be made available for such purpose) to pay the interest on outstanding bonds of the Authority issued to fund such account, the City shall and hereby agrees to pay on demand only the City's pro rata share (as determined by the Authority) of such deficiency as additional interest on this bond. 
For prompt payment of principal and interest on this bond, the City has irrevocably pledged the revenues of the Water Supply and Wastewater System of the City, including all appurtenances, extensions and improvements thereto (the "Water Supply and Wastewater System"), after provision has been made for reasonable and necessary expenses of operation, maintenance and administration (the "Net Revenues"), and a statutory lien thereon is hereby recognized and created which is of equal standing and priority of lien as to the prior lien of the City's Water Supply and Wastewater System Revenue Bonds, Series 2005 and the City's Water Supply and Wastewater System Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2006 (collectively, the "Outstanding Bonds").

For a complete statement of the revenues from which and the conditions under which this bond is payable, a statement of the conditions under which additional bonds of superior and equal standing may hereafter be issued and the general covenants and provisions pursuant to which this bond is issued, reference is made to the Ordinance and the Prior Ordinance. 
This bond is a self-liquidating bond, payable, both as to principal and interest, solely and only from the Net Revenues of the Water Supply and Wastewater System. The principal of and interest on this bond are secured by the statutory lien hereinbefore mentioned. 
The City has covenanted and agreed, and does hereby covenant and agree, to fix and maintain at all times while any bonds payable from the Net Revenues of the Water Supply and Wastewater System shall be outstanding, such rates for service furnished by the Water Supply and Wastewater System as shall be sufficient to provide for payment of the interest upon and the principal of this bond and any bonds of equal standing with this bond, the Outstanding Bonds and any additional bonds of equal standing with the Outstanding Bonds, as and when the same shall become due and payable, and to maintain a bond redemption fund (including a bond reserve account) therefor, to provide for the payment of expenses of administration and operation and such expenses for maintenance of the Water Supply and Wastewater System as are necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order, and to provide for such other expenditures and funds for the Water Supply and Wastewater System as are required by the Ordinance and the Prior Ordinance. 
This bond is transferable only upon the books of the City by the registered owner in person or the registered owner's attorney duly authorized in writing, upon the surrender of this bond together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the transfer agent, duly executed by the registered owner or the registered owner's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon a new bond or bonds in the same aggregate principal amount and of the same maturity shall be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor as provided in the Ordinance and the Prior Ordinance, and upon payment of the charges, if any, therein prescribed. 
It is hereby certified and recited that all acts, conditions and things required by law to be done precedent to and in the issuance of this bond have been done and performed in regular and due time and form as required by law.

Section 17. Approval of Bond Counsel. The representation of the Issuer by Miller, Canfield, Paddock and Stone, P.L.C.

The System shall be operated on the basis of an operating year which shall coincide with the Issuer's fiscal year. 
Section 10. Rates and Charges; No Free Service. The rates and charges for service furnished by the System and the methods of collection and enforcement of the collection of the rates shall be those in effect on the date of adoption of this Ordinance.

In a case where a tenant is responsible for the payment of the charges for service furnished by the System, and the Issuer is so notified in writing, the Issuer shall require a cash deposit in a sum determined as set forth in Title 13, Chapter 8 of the Issuer's Code of Ordinances, as the same may from time to time be amended, as security for the payment of the charges.

The CITY OF LIVONIA, County of Wayne, State of Michigan (the "City"), acknowledges itself to owe and for value received hereby promises to pay, solely out of the hereinafter described Net Revenues of the City's Water Supply and Wastewater System (hereinafter defined), to the Michigan Finance Authority (the "Authority"), or registered assigns, the Principal Amount shown above, or such portion thereof as shall have been advanced to the City pursuant to a Purchase Contract between the City and the Authority and a Supplemental Agreement by and among the City, the Authority and the State of Michigan acting through the Department of Environmental Quality, in lawful money of the United States of America, unless prepaid or reduced prior thereto as hereinafter provided. 
During the time the Principal Amount is being drawn down by the City under this Bond, the Authority will periodically provide to the City a statement showing the amount of principal that has been advanced and the date of each advance, which statement shall constitute prima facie evidence of the reported information, provided that no failure on the part of the Authority to provide such a statement or to reflect a disbursement or the correct amount of a disbursement shall relieve the City of its obligation to repay the outstanding Principal Amount actually advanced (subject to any principal forgiveness as provided for in Schedule A), all accrued interest thereon, and any other amount payable with respect thereto in accordance with the terms of this Bond. 
The Principal Amount shall be payable on the dates and in the annual principal installment amounts set forth on the Schedule attached hereto and made a part hereof, as such Schedule may be adjusted if less than $9,400,000 is disbursed to the City or if a portion of the Principal Amount is prepaid as provided below, with interest on said principal installments from the date each said installment is delivered to the holder hereof until paid at the rate of two and one-half percent (2.50%) per annum. Interest is first payable on October 1, 2015 and semiannually thereafter on the first day of April and October of each year, and principal is payable on the first day of April commencing April 1, 2017 and annually thereafter, as set forth in the Purchase Contract. 
The Bond may be subject to redemption prior to maturity by the City only with the prior written consent of the Authority and on such terms as may be required by the Authority. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Bond, so long as the Authority is the owner of this Bond, (a) this Bond is payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest at The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. or at such other place as shall be designated in writing to the City by the Authority (the "Authority's Depository"); (b) the City agrees that it will deposit with the Authority's Depository payments of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Bond in immediately available funds by 12:00 noon at least five business days prior to the date on which any such payment is due whether by maturity, redemption or otherwise; in the event that the Authority's Depository has not received the City's deposit by 12:00 noon on the scheduled day, the City shall immediately pay to the Authority as invoiced by the Authority an amount to recover the Authority's administrative costs and lost investment earnings attributable to that late payment; and (c) written notice of any redemption of this Bond shall be given by the City and received by the Authority's Depository at least 40 days prior to the date on which such redemption is to be made. 
Additional Interest 
In the event of a default in the payment of principal or interest hereon when due, whether at maturity, by redemption or otherwise, the amount of such default shall bear interest (the "additional interest") at a rate equal to the rate of interest which is two percent above the Authority's cost of providing funds (as determined by the Authority) to make payment on the bonds of the Authority issued to provide funds to purchase this bond but in no event in excess of the maximum rate of interest permitted by law. The additional interest shall continue to accrue until the Authority has been fully reimbursed for all costs incurred by the Authority (as determined by the Authority) as a consequence of the City's default. Such additional interest shall be payable on the interest payment date following demand of the Authority. In the event that (for reasons other than the default in the payment of any municipal obligation purchased by the Authority) the investment of amounts in the reserve account established by the Authority for the bonds of the Authority issued to provide funds to purchase this bond fails to provide sufficient available funds (together with any other funds which may be made available for such purpose) to pay the interest on outstanding bonds of the Authority issued to fund such account, the City shall and hereby agrees to pay on demand only the City's pro rata share (as determined by the Authority) of such deficiency as additional interest on this bond. 
For prompt payment of principal and interest on this bond, the City has irrevocably pledged the revenues of the Water Supply and Wastewater System of the City, including all appurtenances, extensions and improvements thereto (the "Water Supply and Wastewater System"), after provision has been made for reasonable and necessary expenses of operation, maintenance and administration (the "Net Revenues"), and a statutory lien thereon is hereby recognized and created which is of equal standing and priority of lien as to the prior lien of the City's Water Supply and Wastewater System Revenue Bonds, Series 2005, the City's Water Supply and Wastewater System Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2006, the City's Water Supply and Wastewater System Revenue Bonds, Series 2013 and the City's Water Supply and Wastewater System Revenue Bonds, Series 2014 (collectively, the "Outstanding Bonds"). 
This bond is a single, fully-registered, non-convertible bond in the principal sum indicated above issued pursuant to Ordinance No. 2979 duly adopted by the City Council of the City (the "Ordinance") and Ordinance Nos. 2719, 2945 and 2963 authorizing issuance of the Outstanding Bonds (the "Prior Ordinances"), and under and in full compliance with the Constitution and statutes of the State of Michigan, including specifically Act 94, Public Acts of Michigan, 1933, as amended, for the purpose of paying part of the cost of acquiring and constructing additions, extensions and improvements to the Water Supply and Wastewater System of the City. 
For a complete statement of the revenues from which and the conditions under which this bond is payable, a statement of the conditions under which additional bonds of superior and equal standing may hereafter be issued and the general covenants and provisions pursuant to which this bond is issued, reference is made to the Ordinance and the Prior Ordinances. 
This bond is a self-liquidating bond, payable, both as to principal and interest, solely and only from the Net Revenues of the Water Supply and Wastewater System. The principal of and interest on this bond are secured by the statutory lien hereinbefore mentioned. 
The City has covenanted and agreed, and does hereby covenant and agree, to fix and maintain at all times while any bonds payable from the Net Revenues of the Water Supply and Wastewater System shall be outstanding, such rates for service furnished by the Water Supply and Wastewater System as shall be sufficient to provide for payment of the interest upon and the principal of this bond and any bonds of equal standing with this bond, the Outstanding Bonds and any additional bonds of equal standing with the Outstanding Bonds, as and when the same shall become due and payable, and to maintain a bond redemption fund (including a bond reserve account) therefor, to provide for the payment of expenses of administration and operation and such expenses for maintenance of the Water Supply and Wastewater System as are necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order, and to provide for such other expenditures and funds for the Water Supply and Wastewater System as are required by the Ordinance and the Prior Ordinances. 
This bond is transferable only upon the books of the City by the registered owner in person or the registered owner's attorney duly authorized in writing, upon the surrender of this bond together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the transfer agent, duly executed by the registered owner or the registered owner's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon a new bond or bonds in the same aggregate principal amount and of the same maturity shall be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor as provided in the Ordinance and the Prior Ordinances, and upon payment of the charges, if any, therein prescribed. 
It is hereby certified and recited that all acts, conditions and things required by law to be done precedent to and in the issuance of this bond have been done and performed in regular and due time and form as required by law. 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City, by its City Council has caused this bond to be executed with the manual signatures of its Mayor and its City Clerk and the corporate seal of the City to be impressed hereon, all as of the Date of Original Issue.

Section 6. Payment of Series 2015 Refunding Bonds . The Series 2015 Refunding Bonds and the interest thereon shall be payable solely from the Net Revenues, and to secure such payment, there is hereby created a statutory lien upon the whole of the Net Revenues which shall be a first lien that is equal in standing with the lien on the Outstanding Bonds created by the Prior Ordinances, to continue until payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Bonds payable from the Net Revenues, or, until sufficient cash or Sufficient Government Obligations have been deposited in trust for payment in full of all Bonds of a series then outstanding, principal and interest on such Bonds to maturity, or, if called for redemption, to the date fixed for redemption together with the amount of the redemption premium, if any. Upon deposit of cash or Sufficient Government Obligations, as provided in the previous sentence, the statutory lien shall be terminated with respect to that series of Bonds, the holders of that series shall have no further rights under the Prior Ordinances or this Ordinance except for payment from the deposited funds, and the Bonds of that series shall no longer be considered to be outstanding under the Prior Ordinances or this Ordinance.

The statutory lien upon the Net Revenues, however, shall not be construed as to compel the sale of the System or any part thereof. 
If there is a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on the Bonds, any court having jurisdiction in any proper action may appoint a receiver to administer and operate the System on behalf of the Issuer and under the direction of the court, and by and with the approval of the court to perform all of the duties of the officers of the Issuer more particularly set forth herein and in Act 94. 
The holder or holders of the Bonds shall have all other rights and remedies given by Act 94 and law, for the payment and enforcement of the Bonds and the security therefor.

In order to more effectively protect and promote the general welfare and to accomplish the aims and purposes of this comprehensive plan, the City is divided into districts of such number, shape and area, and of such common unity of purpose, adaptability of use, that are deemed most suitable to provide for the best general civic use, protect the common rights and interests within each district, preserve the general rights and interests of all, and to promote improved wholesome, sightly, harmonious and economic results in civic service, activities and operations; and by further regulations to limit the location, uses and occupancy of buildings, structures and land to be used for trade, industry, residence or other purposes, and also the location, height, bulk, occupancy, and uses of buildings and other structures, including the percentage of plot occupancy and coverage, street setback lines, sizes of yards, and other open spaces. 
    Section 1.03 Construction. This ordinance shall be liberally construed in such manner as to best effectuate its purpose. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this ordinance, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare. Whenever the requirements of this ordinance impose requirements of lower heights of buildings, or a less percentage of lot that may be occupied or require wider or larger courts or deeper yards than are imposed or required by existing provisions of law or ordinance, the provisions of this ordinance shall govern.

The provisions of this ordinance shall be construed, if possible, in such manner as to make such provisions compatible and consistent with each other and likewise with the provisions of all existing and future ordinances of the City of Livonia, and all amendments thereto; provided, however, that where any inconsistency or conflict cannot be avoided, then the most restrictive of such inconsistent or conflicting provisions shall control and prevail.

The Board in arriving at a decision on these matters, shall apply the following standards: 
(1)  Zoning District boundary lines are intended to follow lot lines, or be parallel or perpendicular thereto, or along the center lines of alleys, streets, rights-of-way, or water courses, unless such Zoning District boundary lines are fixed by dimensions as shown on the Zoning Map.

    Section 18.01 Application of this Article. The provisions of this article shall apply to all districts within the City of Livonia, except where otherwise expressly stated in this ordinance. 
    Section 18.02 Scope. No building or land, or part thereof, shall be used, altered, constructed or reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance and the regulations hereby established which apply to the district in which it is located. No building shall be erected or altered to exceed in height the limit herein established for the district in which such building is located; no building shall be erected, nor shall an existing building be altered, enlarged or rebuilt, nor shall any open space surrounding any building be encroached upon or reduced in any manner, except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance and the regulations hereby established for the district in which it is located. 
    Section 18.03 Buildings Under Construction. Any building or structure for which a building permit has been issued and the construction of the whole or a part of which has been started, or for which a contract or contracts have been entered into pursuant to a building permit issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance, may be completed and used in accordance with the plans and application on which said building permit was granted. 
    Section 18.04 Building and Easement Grades. 
(a)  Any building requiring yard space shall be located at such an elevation that a sloping grade shall be maintained to cause the flow of surface water to run away from the walls of the building. A building grade line (sometimes referred to as the finish grade or finish grade line) shall mean the elevation of the ground adjoining the building on all four sides. A first floor elevation shall mean the height which the first floor extends above the building grade. A sloping earth grade beginning at a sidewalk level shall be maintained and established from the center of the front lot line to the finish grade line at the front of the building and from the rear wall of the building to the rear lot line. The height of the finish grade line of any dwelling shall not be less than twelve (12) inches nor more than eighteen (18) inches above the average front sidewalk elevation; the first floor elevation shall not be more than twenty-six (26) inches above the finish grade line of the building. When a new building is being constructed on a vacant lot between two (2) existing buildings or adjacent to an existing building, the yards around the new building shall be graded in such a manner so as not to permit runoff of surface water to flow onto the adjacent properties. Whenever the natural drainage of the land is such as is likely to or will cause the flow of surface water to be from the front yard to the rear yard, or where the natural topography dictates a modification from the foregoing requirements, the building grade may be established otherwise than hereinbefore provided; provided, however, that in all such cases the altered design shall be submitted to and approved by the Department of Public Works. Surface grades shall be approved by the Department of Public Works before the issuance of any building permit. 
(b)  Where any lot, part or parcel of land, has located upon it a duly recorded easement for any purpose whatsoever, that portion of such land whereon the easement exists shall be graded as indicated by the Department of Public Works, and in no event shall be graded so as to obstruct or substantially slow down the natural flow of surface water across such easement. The grade in easements shall in all cases be subject to the approval of the Department of Public Works. 
    Section 18.05 Minimum Lot Size and Width. The size and width of each residential lot on which or in relation to which any building or use is affected by the provisions of this ordinance shall not be less than the minimum size and width requirements established by this ordinance which apply to the district in which the residential lot is located. 
    Section 18.06 Application to Lots of RecOrdinance (Section 18.06, as amended, by Ordinance No. 821, adopted 7-20-70; Ordinance No. 2642, § 1, adopted 12-17-03.) Where two (2) or more abutting lots of record are held under one (1) ownership and where one (1) or more of such lots are nonconforming, the provisions of this ordinance relating to lot width and area in the district in which such lots are located shall be observed and shall not be avoided by any sale or conveyance of all or any portion of any such lots after the effective date of this ordinance; provided, however, that any lot of record which is the same width and area as, or a larger width and area than, fifty-five percent (55%) or more of the lots in the same subdivision in which such lot is located, which have already been developed, with dwellings, and as building sites, may be developed as a separate building site of a width and area consistent with the majority of the lots theretofore developed. 
    Section 18.07 Approval of Plats. No proposed plat of a new subdivision shall hereafter be approved by the City Planning Commission unless all of the lots within such plat equal or exceeds the minimum lot size and width requirements which apply to the district in which the land sought to be platted is located and unless such plat in all other respects fully conforms with the statutes of the State of Michigan, the ordinances of the City of Livonia and the Subdivision Regulations of the City Planning Commission. 
    Section 18.08 Lot Limitation. (Section 18.08, as amended by Ordinance 1436, adopted 12-18-78.) No more than one (1) principal building shall be constructed, erected or placed on any lot in a recorded subdivision or on any parcel of land with the exception of (a) parcels described and designated as "outlots" in a recorded plat which are so arranged or subdivided as to provide for one or more principal buildings with a land area allocated to each building which is equal to or greater than the lot area required in the district, and the building and land comply with all other requirements of the district in which it is located; and (b) parcels in excess of two (2) acres in area to be used for a multiple family planned development provided that the land area allocated to each building is equal to or greater than the requirements of the R-7 District, the buildings and land comply with all other requirements of the R-7 District and a site plan, full dimensioned and showing the arrangement of buildings, parking areas, yards and all driveways and streets is first approved by the City Planning Commission; provided, however, that accessory buildings or uses shall be required to be located on the same lot or parcel or contiguous lots or parcels as the principal building or use except where such accessory building or use is separated from the principal building or use by an intervening alley, street, or other public right-of-way. 
    Section 18.09 Mobile Homes and Modular Homes. (Section 18.09 as amended by Ordinance No. 1636, adopted 6-7-82; Ordinance No. 2085, adopted 3-25-91.) The placement of a mobile home or a modular home, as defined in Section 2.07 of this ordinance, on any lot or parcel in R-1 through R-5, R-U-F, AG, R-6, R-C and R-7 districts shall comply with all the requirements and standards contained in such districts relating to one-family dwellings including, but not limited to, lot size, building setback and land coverage limitations and, in addition, shall comply with the requirements and standards set forth in Section 18.33 of this ordinance relating to one-family dwelling size; provided, however, that said mobile home or modular home shall comply with the following additional standards: 
(a)  Every mobile home or modular home shall have a minimum width across any main section of twenty (20) feet.

The compatibility of design and appearance shall be determined by the City of Livonia Inspection Department upon review of the plans submitted for a particular mobile home or modular home. Any determination of compatibility shall be based upon the standards set forth in this ordinance as well as the character of residential development within two thousand (2000) feet of the subject dwelling where such area is developed with dwellings to the extent of not less than twenty percent (20%) of said area; or, where said area is not so developed, by the character of residential development throughout the City; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit innovative design concepts involving such matters as solar energy, view, unique land contour, or relief from the common or standard designed home. 
(f)  The mobile home or modular home shall contain no additions or rooms or other areas which are not constructed with similar materials and which are not similar in appearance and which shall have similar quality of workmanship as the original structure, including the above described foundation and permanent attachment to the principal structure. 
(g)  Every mobile home or modular home shall comply with all pertinent City building and fire codes as well as, in the case of mobile homes, state and federal standards for mobile home construction. 
(h)  The foregoing standards shall not apply to a mobile home located in a licensed mobile home park except to the extent required by state or federal law or otherwise specifically required in any ordinance of the City of Livonia pertaining to such parks. 
    Section 18.10 Water Supply and Sewers. No zoning permit shall be issued under the provisions of this ordinance until the Bureau of Inspection shall have verified the existence of a well or water supply system and shall have approved two (2) sets of plot plans showing the location and distances of the building from a well or water supply system and sewage disposal system. 
    Section 18.11 Outdoor Toilets. No permanent building within the City of Livonia shall hereafter be erected, altered or used for an outside toilet of any type unless approved lavatory facilities are installed and connected to a public sewer if available or, if not available, then to an approved septic tank and drainage field. Temporary toilets shall be permitted on constructions during period of construction. 
    Section 18.12 Waste and Rubbish. No garbage, sewage, filth, refuse, waste, trash, debris or rubbish, including cans, bottles, waste paper, cartons, boxes and crates, or other offensive or obnoxious matter, shall be kept in open containers, or piled, placed, stored or dumped on any land within the City of Livonia; provided, however, that nothing contained in this ordinance shall prevent the City of Livonia from establishing or maintaining a City dump for the exclusive use of the residents of such City. All waste material, trash and rubbish must be disposed of at least once in each month; and provided further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the reasonable use of garbage, fertilizers, manure and similar material for the improvement of land situated within any R-U-F or AG District, or the reasonable use of any commercial fertilizer in any district, where such use is not carried on in an unhealthy or unsanitary manner or does not constitute a menace to the health and welfare of the public or a nuisance to the surrounding area. 
    Section 18.13A Removal of Soil; Permit Required. No person shall remove, excavate, extract, stockpile or transport or cause to be removed, excavated, extracted, transported or stockpiled for such removal any soil from any land within the City of Livonia unless and until the bonds and fees required herein have been filed and deposited and a permit therefor obtained from the City of Livonia. The word "soil" for all purposes of this and the succeeding four (4) sections of this ordinance is hereby defined to mean and include land, earth, dirt, clay, sand, gravel, soil components, minerals and kindred substances. All soil removal and excavation permits where authorized, shall be issued by the Bureau of Inspection after full compliance by the applicant of all terms and provisions of this section relating thereto. 
    Section 18.13B Removal of Soil; Approval of Commission Required. No soil removal permit or permit to stockpile shall hereafter be issued unless and until the City Planning Commission does, by resolution, (a) determine the proposed soil removal and/or excavation operations will not be injurious to the public health, safety and welfare, (b) approves the application for a soil removal permit, and (c) authorizes the issuance of a soil removal permit. Such approval shall be nontransferable and the applicant must obtain from the Bureau of Inspection a topsoil permit within a thirty (30) day period immediately following the approval. 
    Section 18.13C Removal of Soil; Application Required. Applications for soil removal and/or excavation permits, verified under oath, shall be filed, in quadruplicate, with the Bureau of Inspection. Such applications shall be accompanied by and set forth fully the following information: 
(a)  The full name, address and signature of the applicant; a full and complete legal description of the land on which the soil removal and/or excavation operations are proposed; the names, addresses and signatures of the owner or owners of such land; a detailed description of the nature and extent, including the amount of acreage, of the proposed operations so that the character thereof and the effect upon such land can readily be ascertained; a description of the equipment and vehicles to be used in the proposed operations; the time within which such operations shall be commenced and completed, and an agreement on the part of the applicant and owner, or owners, to fully comply with all the ordinances, rules and regulations of the City of Livonia and all its departments. 
(b)  A topographical survey, dated and certified by a registered engineer or land surveyor showing, in detail, the existing grade elevations, the proposed or finished grade elevation and the contour of the land described in the application. The survey shall also indicate the grade and elevation of all the nearest existing streets; provided that in those cases where the applicant desires to remove soil from land that has been or is being platted and a proposed subdivision has been approved or will be submitted to the City of Livonia, then the applicant shall submit, in addition to the above survey, a plat clearly indicating the grade elevations of the proposed streets in such subdivision. 
(c)  A license, witnessed and acknowledged as in the case of a deed, granting to the applicant (if the applicant is not the owner), the person or persons executing the corporate surety bond required hereafter and the City of Livonia, severally, the right to enter upon said premises, describing them and granting to the aforesaid the right to fill and grade such premises, and restore the same and bring it to the normal building grade as established from the nearest existing or proposed street as the case may be. 
    Section 18.13D Removal of Soil; Reports from Departments Required. The Bureau of Inspection shall forward a copy of such application and topographical survey to the Police Department, the Engineering Division and the City Planning Commission. 
(a)  The Police Department shall examine the application to determine whether or not the proposed operations will interfere with the enforcement and administration of traffic laws. The recommendation of the Police Department shall be transmitted to the City Planning Commission. 
(b)  The Engineering Division shall examine and investigate the application and topographical survey to determine the existing grade elevation of the property described in same. The City Engineer shall recommend approval of the application only if it appears from his examination and investigation that no soil will be removed below the normal building grade as established by the City Engineer from the nearest existing or proposed streets, as the case may be. The recommendation of the Engineering Division shall be transmitted to the City Planning Commission. 
    The City Planning Commission shall examine the application and topographical survey, together with the above recommendations. The Commission shall not approve any application to remove soil below the normal building grade as established from the nearest existing or proposed street; similarly, no application shall be approved where the proposed operations, in the opinion of the Commission, would result in land becoming unwholesome, unhealthy, offensive, filthy or otherwise obnoxious. If, in the opinion of the Commission, there is sufficient soil available above the normal building grade and the proposed operations will not endanger the public health, safety and welfare, then the Commission may approve the application. The approval shall be by resolution; such resolution shall also authorize the issuance of a soil removal permit subject to any restriction or condition which the Commission may specify in approving the application and upon the payment of the permit fee and filing of the bond hereinafter provided. 
    Section 18.13E Removal of Soil; Regulations, Fee, Bonds. Where an application requests permission to remove soil from land that has been platted and approved for subdividing by the City of Livonia, the grade elevation of the streets in the proposed subdivision may be used as a basis for determining the normal building grade. The applicant is herein required to present substantial evidence of the grade elevation of such proposed streets. 
    Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this section, no soil shall be removed below the normal building grade as established from the nearest existing or proposed street, by the Engineering Division. No soil shall be removed in such manner as to cause water to collect or as to result in a menace or danger to the public health, safety and welfare. No soil shall be removed in such manner as to leave the surface of the land below such established grade or unfit for the growing of turf and other land uses permitted in the district in which such removal occurs. The Engineering Division at any time may fully inspect or examine land from which it is proposed to remove or excavate soil, for the purpose of making any determination as to grades or otherwise. The holder of a permit shall, during such removal, provide for drainage in such manner as may be approved by the Engineering Division of the Department of Public Works. 
    The fee for such permit is hereby fixed at One Hundred Dollars ($100.00). No permit shall be transferable. Such permit shall specify the period for which it is granted, which shall in no case be longer than one (1) year from the date of issuance. A permit may be revoked by the Bureau of Inspection whenever the holder of such permit has violated any of the provisions of the ordinances, rules and regulations of the City of Livonia or whenever the exercise of the rights granted by such permit have caused or is reasonably likely to cause a menace or danger to the public health, safety or welfare. 
    No permit shall be issued until the applicant and owner or owners have filed with the City a cash bond guaranteeing and a corporate surety bond, conditioned on the full performance by the holder of the permit of all the provisions of this section, due compliance with the laws of the State and ordinances of the City of Livonia and payment of any and all claims of the City of Livonia and/or any person or persons arising out of any operation under or use of such permit, or any violation of said laws or ordinances; such bonds shall also be specifically conditioned upon the holder of the permit, at all times, maintaining the premises upon which the removal of soil or excavating is being performed, in a safe and proper condition, and that said permitholder will, upon completion of such operation, leave or restore the said land to normal building grade level (as established by the Department of Public Works), remove and abate all offensive conditions, all unhealthy, unwholesome, obnoxious, filthy and unsanitary conditions, drain stagnant water existing and resulting from such removal of soil or excavating. The City Planning Commission shall fix the amount of the bonds to be deposited by the applicant. The bonds shall be in an amount estimated as sufficient to fill and grade the land on which such operations are to be undertaken to the normal building grades as established by the Engineering Division of the Department of Public Works. The Commission shall fix the amount of the corporate surety bond to be filed and the applicant shall deposit in addition thereto a cash bond in an amount equal to ten (10) per cent of the surety bond. Such bonds shall be for an indefinite period until released and discharged, after recommendation of the Engineering Division and Bureau of Inspection, by resolution of the City Planning Commission adopted at a regular meeting of that body. The bonds shall be in such form as may be approved by the City Attorney. 
    Section 18.13F Removal of Soil; Exception. This section shall apply only to the removal of soil for commercial purposes and shall not apply to the moving, grading or leveling of soil within a parcel of land for reasonably immediate use upon such parcel of land, nor shall this section apply to such removal of soil as the Bureau of Inspection may determine to be reasonably necessary in the construction of basements, foundations, footings, driveways, underground utilities and parking areas, nor shall this section apply to the removal of grass sod grown for commercial purposes where the Department of Public Works determines that such removal will not cause water to collect, result in poor drainage conditions or constitute a menace to public health and safety; provided, however, that a determination that this section does or does not apply in the above instance shall always be made in writing by the Bureau of Inspection on written application of any person desiring to remove sod. 
    Section 18.14 Excavations and Holes. The construction, maintenance or existence within the City of Livonia of any unprotected, unbarricaded, open or dangerous excavations, holes, pits or wells, or of any excavations, holes or pits which constitute or are reasonably likely to constitute a danger or menace to the public health, safety or welfare, are hereby prohibited; provided, however, that this section shall not prevent construction of excavations under a permit issued pursuant to this ordinance or the Building Code Ordinances of the City of Livonia where such excavations are properly protected and warning signs posted in such manner as may be approved by the Bureau of Inspection; and, provided further, that this section shall not apply to lakes, streams or other natural bodies of water, or to ditches, streams, reservoirs, or other major bodies of water created or existing by authority of the State of Michigan, County of Wayne, City of Livonia or other governmental agency. 
    Section 18.15 Dumping of Soil, Sand, Clay or Gravel. The dumping of any soil, sand, clay or gravel on any parcel of land within the City of Livonia is hereby prohibited, except where, within six (6) months following such dumping, such parcel of land is graded in such manner as to prevent the collection of water, to provide proper drainage and to leave the ground surface fit for the growing of turf and other land uses permitted in the district; provided, however, that no soil, sand, clay, gravel, trash, rubbish or waste material shall be dumped on the spillways or flood planes of any natural streams or water courses, or on any area between the lower and upper banks of such streams or water courses, except on recommendation of the City Planning Commission and approval of the City Council after a public hearing and on a satisfactory showing that such dumping will not result in damage to other property within the City of Livonia and will not be injurious to the public health, safety and welfare. 
    Section 18.16 Billboards and Signs. The erection and maintenance of billboards and outdoor advertising signs on any parcel of land within the City of Livonia, or the use of any such parcel for said purpose, are hereby prohibited; provided, however, that this section shall not apply to billboards or outdoor advertising signs lawfully in existence at the time this ordinance becomes effective, nor to those specific signs which are expressly allowed by the district regulations contained in this ordinance.

Such a use, where lawfully continued pursuant to the provisions of this section, shall, for the purpose of this ordinance, be know as a "Valid Nonconforming Use"; but where such a use is not thus lawfully continued, the same, for the purpose of this ordinance, shall be known as an "Invalid Nonconforming Use." For purpose of this section, produce markets and nurseries existing in the City as of July 1, 1997 in RUF zoning districts and which are currently nonconforming uses shall be considered to be valid nonconforming uses as long as the continuation of the operation of such business and buildings utilized therein is substantially of the same size and same essential nature as the use existing as of July 1, 1997. Such produce markets and nurseries shall remain subject to the provisions of Sections 18.18 to 18.21, inclusive, of this ordinance and any expansion of these uses is prohibited. 
    Section 18.18 Nonconforming Use; Termination. Any use which is properly designated as a valid nonconforming use shall be automatically terminated on the happening of any one or more of the following events: 
(a)  A change of the actual use of a building or parcel of land from a valid nonconforming use to a use expressly permitted in the district in which such building or parcel is located; 
(b)  Actual discontinuance of such valid nonconforming use for a period of one (1) year, either as to the whole or any part of a building or parcel of land, in which case such discontinuance shall be considered an abandonment of said use; 
(c)  Damage to the extent of more than fifty (50) per cent of the assessed value of a building, exclusive of its foundation, by fire, explosion, act of God, or any act of a public enemy, occurring subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance; 
(d)  Acquisition by the City of Livonia, by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, of private property for the removal of such valid nonconforming use, pursuant to Section 3(a), Act 207, Public Acts of Michigan, 1921, as amended; or 
(e)  Failure of the owner or lessee of a building subject to a valid nonconforming use to obtain a certificate for such use within one (1) year from the effective date of this ordinance and after personal notice by registered mail, pursuant to Section 22.11 of this ordinance. 
After such termination, such nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed or revived. 
    Section 18.19 Nonconforming Use; Restoration. Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the restoration, repairing, or rebuilding of any valid nonconforming building or structure damaged to the extent of fifty (50) per cent or less of its assessed value, exclusive of the foundation, at the time the damage occurred, by fire, explosion, act of God, or any act of the public enemy, subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance, or shall prevent the continuance of the use of such building, or part thereof, as such use existed at the time of such impairment of such building or part thereof. 
    Section 18.20 Nonconforming Use; Repair. Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the repair, reinforcement, or reconstruction of a valid nonconforming building, structure, or part thereof existing at the effective date of this ordinance, rendered necessary by wear and tear, deterioration or depreciation, provided the cost of such work shall not exceed forty (40) per cent of the assessed valuation of such building or structure at the time such work is done, nor shall any provision of this ordinance prevent compliance with the provisions of any Building Code in effect in this City or the Housing Laws of Michigan relative to the maintenance of buildings or structures. 
    Section 18.21 Nonconforming Use; Exceptions. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Sections 18.17 to 18.20, inclusive, of this ordinance, nothing in this ordinance shall prevent: 
(a)  The alteration, improvement or rehabilitation of any valid nonconforming building which does not involve any increase in height, area, bulk or change of use; 
(b)  The strengthening or restoration of any building or wall declared unsafe by the Bureau of Inspection; 
(c)  Any alteration, improvement or repair required by the Department of Health or the Department of Public Safety, or by any of the divisions of said departments, as necessary to the protection of the public health, safety and welfare; 
(d)  Any alteration, improvement, repair or addition determined by the Bureau of Inspection to constitute full or partial compliance with the use requirements of the district in which the building in question is situated. 
(e)  The alteration, improvement or repair of, or addition to any dwelling or any accessory building, including private garage, incidental to such dwelling; or 
(f)  The erection of any accessory building, including private garage, incidental to an existing dwelling. 
    Section 18.22 Nonconforming Use; Elimination. Except as hereinafter provided, no building, structure or premises or part thereof shall be used, altered, constructed or reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance which apply to the district in which it is located. The existence of nonconforming uses is hereby declared to be contrary to the best interests of the community and it is hereby declared to be the policy of the City as expressed in this ordinance to discontinue nonconforming uses in the course of time, as circumstances permit, having due regard for the rights of all parties concerned. In order to accomplish the elimination of those nonconforming uses which constitute a nuisance or are detrimental to the public health and general welfare, the City of Livonia, pursuant to Section 3(a), Act 207, Public Acts of Michigan, 1921, as amended, and Sections 11 and 15, Chapter IV of the Charter, may acquire by purchase, condemnation or otherwise private property for the removal of nonconforming uses and structures; provided, however, that such property shall not be used for public housing. The Council may in its discretion provide that the cost and expense of acquiring such private property be paid from general funds, or the cost and expense or any portion thereof be assessed to a special district. 
    Section 18.23 Nonconforming Due to Reclassification. The foregoing provisions relating to nonconforming uses shall also apply to buildings, structures, land or uses which hereafter become nonconforming due to any reclassification of districts under this ordinance or any subsequent change in the regulations of the ordinance. 
    Section 18.24 Residential Accessory Building. (Section 18.24, as amended by the following: Ordinance No. 1237, adopted 3-10-76; Ordinance No. 1421, adopted 10-16-78; Ordinance No. 1790, adopted 7-29-85.)

Such space, unless otherwise adequately provided for, shall include a ten (10) foot by twenty-five (25) foot loading space with fourteen (14) foot height clearance for every twenty thousand (20,000) square feet or fraction thereof in excess of three thousand (3,000) square feet of building floor use or land use for above mentioned purposes. 
    Section 18.37 Off-Street Parking Requirements. (Section 18.37, as amended by Ordinance No. 1260, adopted 8-16-76; Ordinance No. 1616, adopted 12-10-81; Ordinance No. 2085, adopted 3-25-91; Ordinance No. 2373, adopted 5-22-97; Ordinance No. 2674, adopted 8-30-04; Ordinance No. 2741, adopted 6-14-06.) In all zoning districts, off-street parking facilities for the storage or parking of self-propelled motor vehicles for the use of occupants, employees, and patrons of the buildings hereafter erected, altered or extended after the effective date of this ordinance, shall be provided and maintained as herein prescribed. 
(a)  Each application for a building permit shall be accompanied by a drawing, to scale, showing the parking areas and spaces and parking design and arrangement hereinafter required. 
(b)  Parking spaces shall be arranged for convenient use and with a safe means of access thereto. Parking spaces in other than residential districts shall be arranged limiting vehicles entering and leaving the same to clearly marked and established driveways and designed in a manner that will preclude automobiles from going backward over any sidewalk, alley, public street or dedicated right-of-way. All parking spaces shall be clearly marked by the use of double striping. Parking spaces not complying with the foregoing standards shall not be counted toward satisfying the minimum parking space requirements. 
(c)  Loading space as required in Section 18.36 shall not be construed as supplying off-street parking space, nor shall required off-street parking areas be used for either the storage or display of merchandise so as to reduce the parking area below the required minimum. 
(d)  When units or measurements determining the number of required parking spaces result in requirements of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and fractions over one-half (1/2) shall require one (1) parking space. 
(e)  Whenever a use requiring off-street parking is increased in floor area, and such use is located in a building existing on or before the effective date of this ordinance, additional parking space shall be provided as set out below, not only for the addition to the building but for the original building as well, in amounts hereafter specified for that use. 
(f)  For the purpose of this ordinance, "Floor Area," in the case of offices, merchandising or service types of uses, shall mean the gross floor area used or intended to be used for services to the public as customers, patrons, clients or patients or as tenants, including areas occupied for fixtures and equipment used for display or sale of merchandise. 
(g)  Off-street parking facilities for one or two family dwellings shall be located on the same lot or plot of ground as the building they are intended to serve. The location of required off-street parking facilities for other than one and two family dwellings shall be within three hundred (300) feet of the building they are intended to serve, measured from the nearest point of the off-street parking facilities and the nearest point of the building. Such facilities for multiple dwelling, commercial and professional uses, in order to insure their use as a parking area for the building they are intended to serve, shall be located in a convenient and conspicuous position with reference to such building. For this purpose, the area to the rear of the building shall be considered as satisfying this requirement only when the building is to have a heavily used public entrance in the rear. 
(h)  In the case of a use not specifically mentioned, the requirements for off-street parking facilities for a similar use which is mentioned shall apply. 
(i)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent collective provisions of off-street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses, provided collectively, such facilities shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the various individual uses computed separately in accordance with the table. 
(j)  The amount of required off-street parking space for new uses or buildings, additions thereto and additions to existing buildings as specified above shall be determined in accordance with the schedule set forth in Section 18.38 of this ordinance and the space so required shall be stated in the application for a building permit and shall be irrevocably reserved for such use. Upon review and submission of findings by the Planning Commission, the City Council may, as a condition of site plan approval, permit up to twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of required parking spaces to be reserved for future consideration (i.e., landbanked), subject to the following: 
1.  The number of parking spaces required by Section 18.38 shall be forty (40) spaces or greater. 
2.  The landbanked parking area shall be landscaped in accordance with a plan approved by the Planning Commission and City Council and shall be arranged and designed so that the subject parking spaces can be installed at a later date if the need arises. 
3.  The owner shall agree in writing to install such landbanked parking within 180 days of a City Council resolution in which it is determined that such additional parking is needed. 
4.  The consequent reduction in off-street parking provided will not impair the functioning of the subject development or have a negative effect on traffic flow or parking on and/or adjacent to the site. 
5.  The landscaped landbanked parking area shall be in addition to any landscaped areas required by other provisions of this section. 
6.  Approvals for the voluntary landbanking of existing underutilized parking spaces may be granted by the City Council. 
(k)  The surfacing, drainage and maintenance of all off-street parking space in any C-1, C-2, P, OS, R-E, ML, M-1 or M-2 district shall conform to the provisions of Section 13.06 of this ordinance. 
(l)  Where the parking facilities are not on the same premises as the use to which they pertain or are under different ownership, or where one parking facility services two or more uses, the City may require appropriate recordable legal instruments sufficient, if recorded, to give third parties notice that the property is committed to use as parking facilities under this section. 
(m)  Where any parking area adjoins an existing or proposed sidewalk, the applicant for a building permit shall cause to be erected safety curbs on the private property to prevent autos from crossing the sidewalk. 
(n)  No land shall be used for parking purposes until the same is approved by the Inspection Department as in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(o)  Plans for the layout of off-street parking facilities as described in this section and as defined in Section 2.09 of this ordinance shall be in accord with the following minimum standards; provided, however, that parking spaces provided for handicapped persons as required by Act 1, Public Acts of Michigan, 1966, as amended, shall not be less than twelve (12) feet in width:

1.  After an application for a waiver use or special waiver use approval is filed with the Planning Commission, the Planning Official shall determine whether the application is administratively complete. Unless the Planning Official proceeds as provided under subparagraph 2 below, the application shall be considered to be administratively complete when the Planning Official makes that determination or 14 business days after the Planning Commission receives the application, whichever is first. 
2.  If, before the expiration of the 14-day period under subparagraph 1 above, the Planning Official notifies the applicant that the application is not administratively complete, specifying the information necessary to make the application administratively complete, or notifies the applicant that a fee required to accompany the application has not been paid, specifying the amount due, the running of the 14-day period under subparagraph 1 is tolled until the applicant submits to the Planning Official the specified information or fee amount due. The notice shall be given in writing or by electronic notification. 
3.  The Planning Commission and City Council shall approve or deny the application not more than 60 days after the application is considered to be administratively complete. If the Planning Commission and City Council fail to timely approve or deny the application, the application shall be considered approved and the Planning Commission and City Council shall be considered to have made any determination required for approval. 
4.  If the wireless communications equipment does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c) 1. or for a wireless communications support structure, subparagraphs 1 through 3 above apply to the waiver use and special waiver use approval process, except that the period for approval or denial under subparagraph 3 above is 90 days. 
(g)  Collocation. 
1.  Statement of Policy: 
It is the policy of the City of Livonia to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless communications equipment and wireless communications support structures within the City of Livonia, and encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communications purposes, consistent with the statement of purpose and intent set forth in paragraph (a) of this section above. In light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communications equipment and support structures reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the policy of the City of Livonia that all users should collocate on wireless communications support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section, as stated above, and as stated in paragraph (a) of this section. If a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it, where collocation is feasible, the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled, in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy, intent and purpose of the City of Livonia. The provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with the policy of the City of Livonia. 
2.  Feasibility of collocation: 
Collocation shall be deemed to be "feasible" for purposes of this section where all of the following are met: 
a.  The wireless communications provider entity under consideration for collocation will undertake to pay market rent or other market compensation for collocation. 
b.  The site on which collocation is being considered, taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a support structure, is able to provide structural support. 
c.  The collocation being considered is technologically reasonable, e.g., the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure, antennas, and the like. 
d.  The height of the structure necessary for collocation will not be increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the City of Livonia taking into consideration the several standards contained in paragraph (d) of this section, above. 
3.  Requirements for Collocation: 
a.  A special land use permit for the construction and use of a new wireless communications support structure shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible collocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs. 
b.  All new and modified wireless communications support structures shall be designed and constructed so as to accommodate collocation for a minimum of three (3) total users. The Planning Official and Building Official may reduce the number of required users if they are convinced that a total of three (3) users will be unfeasible. 
c.  The policy of the City of Livonia is for collocation. Thus, if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communications support structure within the City of Livonia shall fail or refuse to alter a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible collocation, such structure shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be altered, expanded or extended in any respect. 
d.  If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication support structure shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible collocation, and this requires the construction and/or use of a new wireless communications support structure, the party failing or refusing to permit a feasible collocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy, intent and purpose of the City of Livonia, and consequently, such party shall take responsibility for the violation, and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless communications support structure within the City of Livonia for a period of five years from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the collocation. Such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which, in this context, shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five year prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communications services, or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communications services. 
4.  Incentive. Review of an application for collocation (where required under this section) and review of an application for a permit for use of a facility permitted under paragraph (c) 4.a. above shall be expedited by the City of Livonia. 
(h)  Removal. 
1.  A condition of the installation of any wireless communications equipment or a wireless communications support structure shall be adequate provision for removal of all or part of the wireless communications equipment and support structure by users and owners upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events: 
a.  When the equipment or support structure has not been used for 180 days or more. For purposes of this section, the removal of antennas or other equipment from the support structure or the cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of radio signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse. 
b.  Six months after new technology is available at reasonable cost as determined by the Livonia City Council, which determination shall be rebuttable by the support structure owner, which permits the operation of the communications system without the requirement of a support structure. 
2.  The situations in which removal of wireless communications equipment or a wireless communications support structure is required, as set forth in paragraph 1 above, may be applied and limited to portions of wireless communications equipment or a wireless communications support structure. 
3.  Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal specified in paragraph 1 above, the property owner or persons who had used the equipment or support structure shall immediately apply or secure the application for any required demolition or removal permits, and immediately proceed with and complete the demolition/removal, restoring the premises to an acceptable condition as reasonably determined by the Planning Official and Building Official. 
4.  If the required removal of wireless communications equipment or a wireless communications support structure or a portion thereof has not been lawfully completed within sixty (60) days of the applicable deadline, and after at least thirty (30) days written notice to the equipment or support structure owner and property owner, the City of Livonia may remove or secure the removal of the equipment or support structure or required portions thereof, with its actual cost and reasonable administrative charge to be drawn, collected and/or enforced from or under the security posted at the time application was made for establishing the wireless communications equipment or support structure. 
(i)  Application Fees. All applicants for wireless communications equipment (except where approval is not required pursuant to paragraph (c) 1 above) and for a wireless communications support structure shall pay an application fee of $500.00 before a permit may be issued. 
(j)  Signs on Towers/Antennas/Wireless Communications Support Structures. No signs shall be displayed on any cellular tower antennas or wireless communications support structure or equipment without a submission of findings of the City Planning Commission and approval of the City Council. 
(k)  Franchise Fee - when required. 
1.  If a wireless communications equipment provider installs land-based equipment such as coaxial, wire or fiber optic cables to transmit information or electric impulses to or from wireless communications equipment or support structures, such provider shall apply to the City of Livonia for a permit or franchise as required by law prior to installing said land-based equipment. The provider shall submit all information in its possession to the City of Livonia regarding any entity installing, providing, or using a backhaul network, and such entity shall also apply for a permit or franchise as required by law. 
2.  Owners and/or operators of wireless communications equipment and support structures shall certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or operation of a wireless communications system in the City of Livonia have been obtained and shall file a copy of all required franchises with the Planning Official. 
    Section 18.43 Height; Parapet Walls. Parapet walls may extend not more than five (5) feet above the allowable height of a building. 
    Section 18.44 Height; Public Buildings; Utilities. The City Planning Commission may recommend and the City Council approve the erection and use of a building or an addition to an existing building which is publicly owned or owned by a public service corporation to be used for a public use or for public utility purposes, in any permitted district to a greater height or of larger area than the district requirements herein established, and permit the location in any use district of a public building or a public utility building, structure or use, provided the City Planning Commission shall find such use, height, area, building or structure reasonably necessary for the public convenience and service; and, provided further, that such building, structure or use is designed, erected and landscaped to conform harmoniously with the general architecture and plan of such district. 
    Section 18.45 Protective Wall; Required. (Section 18.45, as amended by the following: Ordinance No. 597, adopted 11-28-66; Ordinance No. 655, adopted 11-29-67; Ordinance No. 677, adopted 4-15-68; Ordinance No. 1582, adopted 7-2-81; Ordinance No. 2085, adopted 3-25-91; Ordinance No. 2149, adopted 11-30-92; Ordinance No. 2510, adopted 11-21-00; Ordinance No. 2792, adopted 11-26-07.) 
(a)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this ordinance, except those contained in Sections 16.06 and 17.05 of this ordinance, where off-street parking areas, P Districts, OS Districts, PO Districts, R-E Districts, C-1 Districts, C-2 Districts, C-3 Districts, C-4 Districts, M-L Districts, M-1 Districts or M-2 Districts adjoin or are contiguous to any residential district or districts, whether or not said residential district has been developed, the owner of the commercial, office, or industrial land shall provide and construct either a continuous, unpierced and reinforced poured concrete wall with false brick design, or a cement shadow block wall, or a brick wall. In any case where there are several contiguous property owners who are required to build a protective wall, such wall shall be constructed using the same materials and having uniformity in appearance. The protective wall shall be at least five (5) feet and not more than seven (7) feet in height to adequately screen such parking, office, commercial or industrial districts from abutting residential districts, with the exception that upon the recommendation of the Inspection Department when it deems necessary for the protection of the public to allow the nearest ten (10) feet of wall adjacent to any public right-of-way to be limited to a height of three (3) feet. The height of such wall shall be measured from the surface of the parking, office, commercial or industrial property or from the surface of the abutting residential property, whichever has the highest elevation. It shall be constructed on the easement line if an easement exists; if no easement exists, then on the lot line between the parking area of the office, commercial or industrial property and the abutting residential district; provided, however, that where the construction of such wall on an easement line will work a hardship on a particular property owner because of the peculiar location and size of the easement or for any other special circumstance this location requirement may be modified by the City Engineer. All plans and specifications for a protective wall shall conform to standard protective wall plans of the City of Livonia as on file in the Inspection Department. The construction of such wall shall not be commenced until a building permit therefor has been secured from the Inspection Department. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the office, commercial or industrial property or parking area to maintain the wall in a state of good repair and to keep the area between the wall and property line of the office, commercial or industrial property or parking area, free and clear of any debris, trash, weeds and waste of any material and at all times to keep such area in a neat, clean and orderly fashion. 
(b)  In P, OS, PO, C-1, C-2, C-3 and C-4 districts a greenbelt may be substituted for the protective wall required in paragraph (a) above if such substitution is authorized by the Planning Commission and/or City Council as part of site plan approval or amendment. Such greenbelt shall be sufficient to buffer the residentially-zoned property from the non-residential use, but in any event shall not be less than ten (10) feet in width and shall consist of appropriate live plant material and such other landscape materials as are appropriate including, but not limited to, earth berms and decorative fences. Plant materials shall be such that their height at installation shall comply with requirements of the Planning Commission and/or City Council but shall in no event be less than five (5) feet tall, as governed by current standards adopted by the American Nurseryman's Association, copies of which standards shall be on file with the City Planning Department and Inspection Department. A plan for such greenbelt shall be submitted prior to approval by the Planning Commission and/or City Council. It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the office, commercial or industrial property or parking area to continuously maintain the greenbelt in a healthy condition. Further, it shall be the duty of said owner to replace dead or dying plant material with new plant material of the same variety or with a variety of equal quality and growth characteristics; provided, however, that said greenbelt shall be subject to inspection by the Inspection Department at least every two years after its installation to insure that it is being maintained in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. The location of the greenbelt shall be substantially the same as would be required for a protective wall. 
(c)  The erection of the protective wall or the greenbelt as required by this section shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any building constructed on that particular office, commercial or industrial property or parking area. Where the owner or applicant can satisfy the Inspection Department that it is impossible or impracticable to construct the wall or install the greenbelt before the office, commercial, industrial building or parking area is completed, he may comply with this condition precedent by filing a performance bond in the form of a cash bond, irrevocable bank letter of credit or surety bond with the City Clerk in an amount equal to one and one-half (1-1/2) times the estimated cost of constructing the wall or installing the greenbelt, and by executing an affidavit agreeing to erect the wall or install the greenbelt on or before a date certain, which in no case shall exceed six (6) months from the date of the affidavit. In those cases where a bond and affidavit are deposited, if the required wall has not been satisfactorily erected or the greenbelt satisfactorily installed within ninety (90) days after the date of the affidavit or before the date fixed in the affidavit, whichever is the later, the City shall have the right to forfeit the cash bond and use the proceeds thereof to erect or cause to be erected the required protective wall or install or cause to be installed the required greenbelt. Any balance remaining shall thereafter be refunded to the depositor of the bond. 
(d)  Whenever planting is required to install or maintain a greenbelt pursuant to paragraph (b) above, suitable plant materials equal in characteristics to those listed in Table 1 below with the spacing as required shall be provided. Table 1 shall also be used as a guide in the selection of trees required to satisfy the landscaping requirements of Section 19.06(1)(j). The tree species listed are considered for such factors as: size, disease resistance, pest problems, location suitability, seed or fruit set, and visual appearance. Another factor that can be considered in species selection is which trees are presently doing well and are relatively free from insects and disease. While efforts have been made to make appropriate recommendations, nurseries may have further information as to specific cultivars or varieties which may be more suitable for the location and purpose.

(e)  Smoke, Dust, Dirt and Fly Ash. Shall not exceed 0.3 grains per cubic foot of flue gas at stack temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit and not to exceed fifty (50) per cent excess air and shall not be so unclean, destructive, unhealthful or hazardous as to be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare nor shall visibility be impaired by the emission of a haze which unduly impedes vision within apparent opaqueness equivalent to No. 1 of the Ringlemann Chart.

    Section 18.49 Fences. (Section 18.49, as amended by the following: Ordinance No. 1279, adopted 11-18-76; and Ordinance No. 2689, § 2, adopted 2-9-05.) Yards may be used for fences and similar structures as set forth in Chapter 44 of Title 15 of the Livonia Code of Ordinances, as amended. 
    Section 18.50 Signs. (Section 18.50 as amended by the following: Ordinance No. 1537, adopted 9-4-80; Ordinance No. 1673, adopted 3-14-83; Ordinance No. 2129, adopted 7-27-92; Ordinance No. 2632, § 1, adopted 12-17-03.) It is not the intent of this ordinance to have the open spaces and lines of vision created by public rights-of-way used as license for unrestricted advertising through the use of signage, but rather to enhance the physical appearance of the City, preserve scenic and natural beauty of designated areas, make the City a more enjoyable and pleasing community and to create a more attractive economic and business climate by preserving property values. It is intended by the provisions of this ordinance to reduce sign or advertising distractions, to eliminate the visual blight caused by abandoned or poorly maintained signs and to avoid the confusion of conflicting adjacent signs. Through this ordinance signage will be allowed in such a manner so as to provide those similar uses in similar zones the opportunity for identification exposure regardless of parcel size, although the location and size of buildings will influence the amount and type of signage permitted. This ordinance shall make a distinction between those non-residential zones that provide for transitional or other than retail activity as a primary use. This section, through this approach, reflects the transitional nature of the zoning district arrangements shown on the Zoning Map and the Future Land Use Plan so that as the intensity of land use is decreased, so is the amount of permitted signage. This consistent approach is necessary to remove the need for the type of signs which compete for attention for the motorist, thereby creating traffic hazards as well as creating visual blight within the City. It is therefore within the health, safety and welfare responsibility of the City of Livonia that this section of the ordinance is promulgated. 
    Section 18.50A Definitions Pertaining to Signs.

(k)  Windloads. For the purpose of design, wind pressure shall be taken upon the gross area of the vertical projection of all signs and sign structures at not less than fifteen (15) pounds per square foot for those portions above the ground.

If an activity, business, or usage is discontinued and occupies a portion of a multi-tenant wall or ground type business sign that complies with all the requirements and provisions of this ordinance, that portion of the sign identifying the previous use shall be painted out or replaced with a blank panel of the same color as the background color that it replaces, until such time as the space occupied by the previous use is reoccupied. Any sign that is maintained contrary to this section shall be subject to the sanctions provided in Section 18.50J(m), sign elimination.

It is the intent of this section to recognize that the existence of non-conforming signs is contrary to the best interests of the community. It is considered as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the prohibition of the establishment of new signs in violation of the requirements of this ordinance. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City of Livonia, as expressed in this ordinance, to remove non-conforming signs as expeditiously as is reasonable and as circumstances permit, having due regard for the rights of all parties concerned.

1.  Replaced by or changed to another non-conforming sign. 
2.  Structurally altered so as to prolong the life of the sign or to change the shape, size, type, or design of the sign unless the sign is brought into conformance with the requirements of this ordinance.

5.  Reestablished or maintained after the activity, business, or usage to which it relates has been discontinued for a period of ninety (90) days or longer. In the case where the activity, business, or usage which is discontinued occupies a portion of a non-conforming multi-tenant wall or ground type business sign, that portion of the sign identifying the previous use shall be painted out or replaced with a blank panel of the same color as the background color that it replaces until such time as fifty (50) percent or more of the total sign area is blank, at which time the entire sign structure is to be removed or replaced with a conforming sign. 
    Section 18.51 Illegal Parking of Motor Vehicles; Tickets; Towing of Motor Vehicles. (Section 18.51, added to Article XVIII by Ordinance No. 612, adopted 2-13-67; as amended by Ordinance 1397, adopted 7-3-78; Ordinance No. 1805, adopted 10-28-85.)

Any such motor vehicle thus removed or towed away shall be taken to the City automobile or motor vehicle pound or to a privately owned garage and kept under the custody or control of the officer or person in charge thereof; provided, however, that any such removal or towing shall be at the risk of the owner of said vehicle, and provided further that the disposition of said vehicle after removal shall be in accordance with the provisions set forth in Sections 10.21.210-10.21.260 of the Livonia Code of Ordinances, as amended, which provisions are made a part hereof and incorporated herein by reference.

(a)  The proposed use must be of such location, size and character that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the surrounding neighborhood. 
(b)  The location and size of the proposed use or uses, the nature and intensity of the principal use and all accessory uses, the site layout and its relation to streets giving access to it, shall be such that traffic to and from the use and uses, and the assembly of persons in connection therewith, will not be hazardous or inconvenient to the neighborhood nor unduly conflict with the normal traffic of the neighborhood.

Such design shall provide for (but shall not be limited to) the following: 
(i)  Facilities for the storage of refuse for subsequent disposal which shall be concealed and contained in such a manner that they will be screened from public view and will prevent the emission of noxious odors and the attraction of insects and vermin. 
(ii)  All mechanical equipment, such as (but not limited to) air conditioning and heating units which shall be located and concealed so as to be completely screened from public view; 
provided, however, that the location and method of containment and concealment of refuse storage facilities and mechanical equipment shall be subject to the review and recommendation of the Planning Commission and approval by the City Council.

ARTICLE XX. - SPECIAL WAIVER USE STANDARDS FOR PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PLANNED GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS (Article XX, as amended by the following: Ordinance No. 1013, adopted 8-30-72; Ordinance No. 1538, adopted 9-4-80; Ordinance No. 2585, §§ 1-3, adopted 12-18-02.) 
    Section 20.01 Statement of Intent. The intent of this article is to provide, in the case of Planned Residential Developments and Planned General Developments, an added degree of flexibility in the placement, bulk and interrelationship of the buildings and uses within the Planned Development, and the implementation of new design concepts so as to encourage a more efficient use of land and of public services through the use of a unified planning approach, while at the same time maintaining the over-all intensity of land use, density of population and amounts of light, air, access and required open space as specified in this ordinance for the zoning district in which the Planned Development is to be located. 
    A Planned Development shall be deemed to be a Planned Residential Development when such development is limited to dwelling units in detached, attached or multi-storied structures, or any combination thereof. A Planned Development shall be deemed to be a Planned General Development when it contains commercial and/or office structures and uses exclusively or when it includes residential structures or dwelling units in a unified plan with commercial and/or office structures and uses. 
    The City Council does hereby determine that the several district regulations pertaining to intensity of land use, density of population and required open space are the minimum requirements for the promotion and protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Nothing in this article is intended to allow a greater density of population, greater height, area or bulk of buildings, nor less open space than that which is specified in this ordinance for the zoning district in which a planned development is or is to be located. 
    Section 20.02 Authority to Grant Waiver for Planned Residential Development or Planned General Development. Subject to the foregoing statement of intent, the Planning Commission may grant a waiver authorizing a Planned Residential Development or a Planned General Development but only after notice and hearing in the manner provided for other waivers and subject to all other provisions of this article, and the City Planning Commission and City Council may, in the case of Planned Developments, allow for modification of the provisions of this ordinance. Such modifications shall be considered only with respect to the following guidelines: 
(a)  Modification in lot sizes may be granted irrespective of the minimum requirements imposed under the Zoning District within which such development is located provided that such modification does not result in a greater overall density of population than that which is specified in said Zoning District and provided that the lot depth and width is reduced no further than the minimum lot depth and width required by this ordinance. Provided, however, nothing in this requirement shall prevent the consolidation of one or more districts with respect to one or more contiguous properties in single ownership so as to permit the averaging of densities of the several districts. 
(b)  Modification of yard requirements may be granted irrespective of the minimum requirements imposed under the Zoning District within which a Planned Development is located when it is determined that such modification will result in a more efficient use of the land and will not be injurious to surrounding land and to the public as a whole. 
(c)  Uses not permitted in the Zoning District within which the Planned Development is located may be permitted when such uses are primarily designed and intended to service residents of any Planned Residential Development or Planned General Development or when such uses relate to an overall concept in the case of a non-residentially conceived Planned General Development. 
    Section 20.02A Single Family Clustering. (Section 20.02A added by Ordinance No. 1538, adopted 9-4-80; amended by Ordinance No. 2585, § 1, adopted 12-18-02) The intent of this section is to encourage development alternatives in any R-1 through R-4 district which will preserve open space while at the same time provide detached or attached single family dwellings; encourage improved design alternatives to provide more efficient use of land and public services; provide single family development for difficult sites, and encourage reasonable alternatives to multiple family residential development commonly referred to as apartments or townhouses. 
(1)  The overall density permitted under the Single Family Clustering option shall not exceed that permitted in a conventional subdivision development in the same zoning district. 
(2)  The Planning Commission may recommend and the City Council may grant a waiver authorizing a single family cluster project pursuant to Section 20.02 of this ordinance; provided, however, that in addition to requirements set forth in Section 20.03, the application for a waiver shall include documentation substantiating that the land area to be developed contains one or more of the following characteristics: 
(a)  Contains natural assets, such as, but not limited to, natural stands of large trees, natural habitat for wildlife, natural streams and watercourses, or unusual topographic features, a substantial portion of which would be preserved through the use of clustering. 
(b)  Has a substantial portion of its perimeter adjacent to major office, commercial, industrial, institutional or high rise residential development or is otherwise located so as to act as a transitional use between conventional single family residential areas and uses which are or are likely to be incompatible. 
(c)  Contains a flood plain which results in a substantial portion of the total land area being unbuildable as confirmed by current Flood Plain Information Report prepared by the Corps of Engineers, United States Army, a copy of which is on file with the Engineering Division. 
(d)  Contains poor soil conditions which result in a substantial portion of the total area being unbuildable using conventional construction methods as confirmed by soil test borings furnished by the applicant. 
(e)  Is a small parcel which has frontage on a major thoroughfare with an existing or planned right-of-way width of one hundred twenty (120) feet or more as indicated on the "Master Thoroughfare Plan" and contains acute angles or is of shallow depth as measured from the thoroughfare so as to make conventional subdivision development physically impractical. 
(3)  In addition to requirements contained in other sections of this ordinance regarding "Planned Residential Developments" or "Planned General Developments," the following standards shall govern single family cluster development: 
(a)  In a planned development that qualifies as a single family cluster project, yard requirements may be modified pursuant to Section 20.02 of this ordinance; provided, however, that the following additional rules shall apply: 
(i)  Attaching of single family dwelling units, one to another, will only be permitted when attached by means of one of the following methods; provided, however, that the number of dwelling units attached shall not exceed three (3): 
a.  An architectural wall detail which does not form interior room space. 
b.  Through a common party wall in only non-living portions of adjoining structures such as, but not limited to, attached garages and utility rooms. 
(ii)  Minimum yard requirements shall be provided as follows: 
a.  Minimum spacing between groups of attached buildings or between unattached buildings shall be ten (10) feet in an R-1 district, twelve (12) feet in an R-2 district, sixteen (16) feet in an R-3 district, and twenty (20) feet in an R-4 district; provided, however, that where a rear yard of one building or group of attached buildings abuts a rear yard or a side yard of another building or group of attached buildings, the distance between such buildings shall be the sum of the two abutting yards as required by Sections 4.05 and 4.06 of this ordinance. 
b.  Front yard abutting a private street shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet and a front yard abutting a public street shall be as required by Section 4.05 of this ordinance; a side yard abutting a private street shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet and a side yard abutting a public street shall be as required by Section 4.06 of this ordinance; provided, however, that all buildings and parking areas shall be set back at least forty (40) feet from any major thoroughfare with an existing or proposed right-of-way width of one hundred twenty (120) feet, or more, as indicated on the Master Thoroughfare Plan. 
(b)  In a planned development when a single family cluster project is proposed, the maximum number of units which may be developed shall be the number of acres of land on the proposed site, less any current or planned future rights-of-way of abutting public roads and areas designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as Special Flood Hazard Areas inundated by the 100-year flood or by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality as protected wetlands, times the following numbers of units per acre for each zoning district: 
(1)  R-1 Districts - 4.0 dwelling units per acre 
(2)  R-2 Districts - 3.5 dwelling units per acre 
(3)  R-3 Districts - 3.0 dwelling units per acre 
(4)  R-4 Districts - 2.5 dwelling units per acre 
(c)  Whenever a proposed single family cluster project abuts an existing single family residential district, such district shall be buffered by means of one (1) or more of the following methods as a part of the development of the single family cluster project: 
(i)  Locate detached single family dwellings on conventional lots immediately abutting the existing single family residential district subject to requirements contained in Article IV of this ordinance and the Subdivision Rules and Regulations of the City of Livonia. 
(ii)  Provide open space or recreation space immediately abutting said existing single family residential district. 
(iii)  Provide significant topographic features, landscaping or a combination thereof immediately abutting said existing single family residential district. 
(iv)  A major thoroughfare located between the cluster development and a single family residential district. 
(d)  The application shall include a fully dimensional and illustrated landscape treatment of the project, including the labeling of all materials as to type and size when installed, and shall also indicate the location, type and size of all existing trees having at least a three (3) inch caliper measured one (1) foot above the ground and shall designate for non-removal all such trees so located so as not to substantially interfere with proposed street and structure locations. 
    Section 20.03. Application for Waiver for Planned Residential Development and/or Planned General Development; Filing Fee. (Section 20.03, as amended by Ordinance No. 2655, § 1, adopted 5-19-04.) The owner or owners of any tract of land may submit to the City Planning Commission an application for a waiver to use and develop the entire tract in a manner not consistent with regular or conventional street and lot patterns or general site development concepts. The application shall be made and filed in triplicate with the City Planning Commission and shall either contain or be accompanied by the following: 
(a)  A legal description of the property under consideration. 
(b)  The existing zoning classification of the property. 
(c)  A fully dimensional map of the land showing topographic information at a contour interval of not less than two (2) feet. 
(d)  A site plan showing the location of all existing and proposed principal and accessory buildings and structures, parking areas, driveways, buffer strips, distances between buildings and between buildings and lot lines, setback lines, all open spaces to be dedicated for parks, recreation, light and air, etc., and also showing the location and design of all lots to be subdivided and the dimensions of all lot lines. 
(e)  A vicinity map showing the location of the site in relation to surrounding properties, streets, parks, schools, school sites, etc. 
(f)  Architectural sketches, at an appropriate scale, showing building heights, elevations and an indication of the design and distribution of signs to be erected.

(h)  For the examination and inspection of the site plan and the land proposed to be developed, and related expenses, a fee, which shall be nonrefundable, in the amount of six hundred dollars ($600.00) plus twenty dollars ($20.00) per lot or unit for residential construction and twenty dollars ($20.00) per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area for any new non-residential building construction. 
    Section 20.04 Action by Planning Commission. After a study of the application for a planned project, the Planning Commission shall send a resolution recommending approval or denial to the City Council for the final determination based upon the following standards: 
(a)  The proposed use or uses shall be of such location, size and character as to be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the zoning district in which situated and shall not be detrimental to the orderly development of adjacent zoning districts. 
(b)  The location and size of the proposed use or uses, the nature and intensity of the principal use and all accessory uses, the site layout and its relation to streets giving access to it, shall be such that traffic to and from the use or uses, and the assembly of persons in connection therewith, will not be hazardous or inconvenient to the neighborhood nor conflict with the normal traffic of the neighborhood. In applying this standard, the Commission shall consider, among other things: convenient routes for pedestrian traffic, particularly of children; the relationship of the proposed project to main traffic thoroughfares and to street and road intersections; and, the general character and intensity of the existing and potential development of the neighborhood. In addition, where appropriate, the Commission shall determine that noise, vibration, odor, light, glare, heat, electromagnetic or radioactive radiation, or other external effects, from any source whatsoever which is connected with the proposed use, will not have a detrimental effect upon neighboring property or the neighboring area in general. 
(c)  The location and height of buildings, the location and nature and height of walls and fences, and the nature and extent of landscaping of the site shall be such that they will not hinder or discourage the proper development and use of adjacent land and buildings nor impair the value thereof. 
(d)  The standards of density and required open space in the proposed project are at least equal to those required by this ordinance in the zoning district in which the proposed project is to be located. 
(e)  In any Planned Development wherein a shopping center is an integral part, the following specific standards shall be made a part of the site plan as it relates to the front, side and rear yards of said shopping center: 
(1)  Along freeways, major thoroughfares or secondary thoroughfares, except in areas described in (2), hereinbelow, the nearest fifteen (15) feet within the required yard area to the right-of-way line shall be maintained in landscaping and no parking or parking access aisles shall be permitted in such landscaped areas. 
(2)  Where residential districts adjoin the shopping center without an intervening street, the nearest twenty-five (25) feet to the property line within the required yard area of the shopping center shall be maintained in landscaping and no parking or vehicular access shall be permitted in such landscaped area. 
(3)  Where lots in residential areas front on minor streets at the boundary of a shopping center, the nearest twenty-five (25) feet to the right-of-way within the required yard of the shopping center shall be maintained in landscaping and no parking or parking access aisles shall be permitted in such area. 
(4)  All other yards within the shopping center, except those abutting a business or industrial district shall maintain no less than a fifteen (15) foot landscaped strip along the property lines which strip shall not be used for parking or parking access aisles. 
    The Commission may require such changes or modification in the site plan as are needed to achieve conformity to the standards as herein specified. Upon the finding by the Commission that all of the standards as herein specified have been met, it may approve the project and the requested minor modifications to the provisions of this ordinance, if any, and recommend approval of the same to the City Council. It shall also, where it deems appropriate and necessary, recommend to the City Council those conditions to be imposed upon the project, its operation, or both, that are needed to assure adherence to the aforesaid standards. The Commission and Council may, in their determination whether or not to approve a proposed Planned Residential Development or Planned General Development, consider the impacts of the proposed project on existing developed land bordering the site as well as the future impacts of any development or redevelopment on the adjoining lands. Upon such review and determination and in furtherance of its objective to provide for the orderly development of land within the city, the Council may require that the streets be arranged in such a manner so as to provide for the future continuation or appropriate projection of existing streets in the surrounding areas. Streets shall be laid out so as to prevent the creation of double frontage lots. 
    Section 20.05 Conditions Upon which Waiver is Granted. (Amended by Ord. No. 2643, § 1, adopted 12-17-03) Any waiver granted to authorize such a planned project shall in every case be subject to the following express conditions: 
(a)  Immediately after waiver approval by the City Planning Commission the applicant shall submit the proposal to the City Council and obtain its concurrence in the waiver; until the approval of the City Council is obtained, the City Planning Commission's approval shall not be effective; if the City Council rejects, then the action of the City Planning Commission shall be deemed null and void. 
(b)  The owner or owners shall thereafter submit proposed and final plats for the Planned Residential Development or Planned General Development for approval as in the case of other subdivision plats to the extent required by law; provided, however, that if the planned project is designed as site condominiums, the owner or owners shall thereafter submit the Master Deed for approval in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 18.62 of this Ordinance prior to any bonds being established by City Council pursuant to Section 18.66 of this Ordinance. 
(c)  Such plats or Master Deed shall be in strict conformity with the approved waiver, the conditions attached thereto, the site plan submitted with the waiver, and the provisions of this article. 
(d)  Appropriate private deed restrictions shall be submitted to the City in recordable form sufficient to assure the use and development of the planned project in accordance with the waiver, site plan and the provisions of this article. 
(e)  The aforesaid deed restrictions shall incorporate the approved site plan together with the resolutions of the City Planning Commission and City Council approving such waiver use. Said approved site plan shall be filed with the Department of Inspection and all building and land uses shall thereafter be in accordance with the site plan. 
(f)  When open space and/or park land is/are provided as a part of a Planned Residential Development or a Planned General Development, the applicant shall provide an appropriate document which sets forth the function of the open space and/or park land, and such provisions for the ownership and maintenance of such lands as are reasonably necessary to ensure its continuity, care, conservation and maintenance, and to ensure that remedial measures will be available to the City of Livonia if such open space and/or park land is permitted to deteriorate or is not maintained in a condition that is consistent with the best interests of the Planned Development or of the City of Livonia. 
(g)  No structure designed or intended to be used in part or in whole, for commercial purposes shall be constructed prior to the construction of not less than thirty (30) percent of the dwelling units, if any, proposed for the development. 
(h)  Except as may otherwise be expressly authorized by council resolution, all internal private roads within a Planned Residential Development or a Planned General Development shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the minimum standards set forth by the City of Livonia Engineering Division consisting of asphalt pavement with monolithic valley swales, twenty-eight (28) feet wide, with a six (6) inch thick asphalt base, and one and one-half (1-1/2) inch thick wearing course. 
    Section 20.06 Public Improvements within Planned Development. The applicant for a waiver to authorize a Planned Residential Development or a Planned General Development may apply to the City Council for a modification of the nature and extent of public improvements required to be installed with respect to new residential subdivisions. The City Council may in its discretion relieve the applicant from installing public improvements as would otherwise be required to the extent that it determines such improvements to be unnecessary with the Planned Development. In the event of such a determination, the City Council shall incorporate the same in its resolution granting the waiver for the Planned Development.

(b)  That the alleged hardships and practical difficulties, or both, which will result from a failure to grant the variance, include substantially more than mere inconvenience, inability to attain a higher financial return, or both. 
(c)  That allowing the variance will result in substantial justice being done, considering the public benefits intended to be secured by this ordinance, the individual hardships that will be suffered by a failure of the Board to grant a variance, and the rights of others whose property would be affected by the allowance of the variance.

The first of these inspections shall be requested when excavation for foundations has been completed, and the second inspection shall be requested when the building is completed.

Whenever a zoning compliance permit shall be issued for the use of vacant land, an inspection of such land may be made at any time by the Bureau of Inspection.

If such certificate is refused, the applicant shall be notified of such refusal and the reasons therefor within the aforesaid ten (10) day period. 
    Section 22.11 Certificates of Valid Nonconforming Uses. A certificate shall be required for each valid nonconforming use, as that term is defined in Section 18.17 of this ordinance.

Such application shall be filed with the Bureau of Inspection by the owner or lessee of the building or land occupied by such nonconforming use, within one (1) year from the effective date of this ordinance, and the Bureau shall issue such certificate within thirty (30) days following the filing of such application. Failure of an owner or lessee to so obtain such a certificate within said one (1) year period shall create a conclusive presumption that such use is not a valid nonconforming use and such use shall be discontinued immediately following said one (1) year period; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall affect existing dwellings or interfere with the continued use, as a dwelling, or any dwelling lawfully existing at the time this ordinance becomes effective, or prevent any alteration, repair or improvements as provided by Section 18.21 of this ordinance.
