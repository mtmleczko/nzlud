(KRS 61.872(5))

Any agency response denying, in whole or in part, inspection of any record shall include a statement of the specific exception authorizing the withholding of the record and a brief explanation of how the exception applies to the record withheld. The response shall be issued by the official custodian or under this authority and shall constitute final agency action.

 

(B) If the requesting party wants the Attorney General to review the denial of a request for inspection of a public record, he or she shall proceed under the provisions of KRS 61.880 and 61.882. Upon the Attorney General=s request, the agency will provide additional documentation.

 

(C) If upon request by the person seeking inspection, the Attorney General reviews the denial and issues a written opinion upholding, in whole or in part, the request for inspection, the requesting party may institute appeal proceedings within 30 days for injunctive or declaratory relief in the circuit court. In addition, if the Attorney General disallows the request, or if the city continues to withhold the record notwithstanding the Attorney General=s opinion, and the person seeking disclosure institutes proceedings in circuit court, the city shall notify the Attorney General of such action.

Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City of Russellville.

 

(H) In all buildings in which any sanitary facility drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the same building sewer and the owner shall install a backflow preventer. Drain pipe and sump for collection of such sanitary drainage shall be above basement floor or in separately watertight or drained sump or channel.

 

(I) The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the easement or property line. Where no property located service branch is available, an authorized agent of the City of Russellville shall cut a neat hole into the main line of the public sewer and a suitable wye or tee saddle installed to receive the building sewer. The invert of the building sewer at such point of connection with a saddle shall be in the upper quadrant to the main line of the public sewer. A neat workmanlike connection, not extending past the inner surface of the public sewer, shall be made and the saddle made secure and watertight by encasement in epoxy cement specially prepared for this purpose. A wye and H bend fitting shall be installed at the property line between the public sewer and the building sewer. This fitting shall serve the purpose of a clean out and for applying the smoke test during inspection of the line. After testing, a cast iron or ductile iron riser will be inserted in this fitting and brought flush with the ground surface. A stopper or plug, outfitted with a type joint applicable to the pipe used, shall seal this riser against the intrusion of ground or surface water.

' 51.051 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER PERMIT FEE.

 

An industrial wastewater permit fee in the amount of $500 per year with three years payable in advance upon the issuance of the wastewater discharge permit and a like amount payable upon a renewal of the wastewater discharge permit is hereby imposed. A waste haulers permit fee of $300 per year is hereby imposed with all such haulers being required to pay a disposal fee of $12.50 for the first 1,000 gallons, and thereafter a disposal fee of $1 per 100 gallons after the first 1,000 gallons, all of which is in addition to the annual permit fee.

(Ord. 2005-12, passed 9-6-05)

 

 

' 51.052 SURCHARGES.

 

(A) It is determined from information available to the City of Russellville personnel that the discharge of other loading parameters or wastewater substances are creating increased operation and maintenance costs within the wastewater system, whether collection or treatment, and the monetary effect of such parameter or parameters should be borne by the discharger of such parameters in proportion to the amount of discharge. The surcharge is a mechanism to recover these increased system costs incurred when treating high strength wastes discharged by some industrial and commercial users to the wastewater system. The surcharge also serves as an inducement to industrial and commercial users to provide internal pretreatment of waste streams when discharges exceed defined levels. The following formula is adopted to determine the proportionate monetary effect of such discharge:

 

Cost/lb. BOD5 = (Fractional WWTP BOD5 load) x (Total annual O & M cost of wastewater system) ) (Annual total LBS BOD5 plus TSS to WWTP)

 

Fractional WWTP BOD5 load = (Total average lbs. BOD5 to WWTP) ) (Total average lbs/day BOD5 plus TSS to WWTP)

 

2009 S-13

Costs/lbs. TSS = (Fractional WWTP TSS load) x (Total annual O & M cost of wastewater system) ) (Annual total lbs BOD5 plus TSS to WWTP)

 

Fractional WWTP TSS load = (1 - Fractional WWTP BOD5 load)

 

Cost/lb. COD = (Cost/lb. BOD5) x (.48)

 

WHERE:

 

(1) Surcharge rate for BOD5 - $1.22/pound

 

(2) Surcharge rate for COD - $1.04/pound with .48 correlation

 

(3) Surcharge rate for TSS - $.56/pound

 

(4) Surcharge rate for Ammonia NH3-N - $5.11/lb.

GREASE CONTROL REGULATIONS

 

 

' 51.080 IN GENERAL.

 

Grease is one of the primary causes of stoppages, backups, and overflows in a wastewater collection system. Grease buildup in the sewers also causes restrictions and capacity problems. The goal of the City of Russellville is to improve sewer service by reducing the impact of grease. This goal will be achieved through two related programs set forth in '' 51.081 and 51.082.

(Ord. 2005-14, passed 9-20-05)

 

 

' 51.081 PREVENTION MAINTENANCE PROGRAM.

 

The City of Russellville=s field control program, through which identified grease problem areas are routinely cleaned and inspected. The city is responsible for the field control of grease, through its normal collection system operations.

(Ord. 2005-14, passed 9-20-05)

 

 

' 51.082 GREASE CONTROL PROGRAM.

 

The City of Russellville=s source control program, through which food service facilities (FCFs) are required to capture and properly dispose of the grease generated by their operation. The focus of this subchapter is the grease control program, including the proper sizing, installation and maintenance of grease interceptors. The administrative and inspection requirements are established as well. Through the cooperative efforts of FSFs with the city, the goal of improved sewer service through proper grease control can be achieved.

instance by the City of Russellville. This definition includes any sewers that convey wastewater to the city=s sewage treatment plant.

 

PRETREATMENT COORDINATOR. An individual employed by the City of Russellville who is charged with the responsibility of administering the provisions of the pretreatment program to ensure compliance by users with applicable laws, rules, regulations, resolutions and ordinances relative to the concentration(s) of substances found in the waste stream of facilities connected to the POTW.

 

USER. A City of Russellville customer operating a food service facility inside the city wastewater service area.

(Ord. 2005-14, passed 9-20-05)

 

 

' 51.084 GENERAL CRITERIA.

 

(A) Installation requirements for new food service facilities. All proposed or newly remodeled food service facilities inside the City of Russellville wastewater service area shall be required to install an approved, properly operated and maintained grease interceptor.

 

(B) Phased implementation plan for existing food service facilities. All existing food service facilities inside the City of Russellville wastewater service area are expected to conduct their operations in such a way that grease is captured on the user=s premises and then disposed of properly. Existing food service facilities will typically be handled under the city=s grease control program.

 

(1) The City of Russellville will periodically inspect each food service facility on an as-needed basis to assure that each facility is complying with the intent of the grease control program. The City of Russellville=s goal is to achieve compliance by all existing food service facilities by January 1, 2005.

 

(2) Through preventive maintenance records or emergency calls related to grease, the City of Russellville will identify and target grease problem areas in the wastewater collection system. Food service facilities located upstream of these problem areas and discharge their waste water into problem lines will be identified as potential contributors to the grease build-up. The City of Russellville inspects the grease interceptors of all food service facilities in the vicinity of the problem area, making note of maintenance records, sizing and condition.

 

(3) Following the inspections, the City of Russellville will send written notice to the inspected food service facilities, containing and educational brochure on grease in the sewer system, a summary of the policy requirements, and the results of the inspection. The inspections will typically result in one of the following actions:

 

(a) Facilities may be required to develop and submit to the City of Russellville a proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment.

 

(b) Facilities that are not successful in achieving compliance with the intent of the grease control program through improved housekeeping and increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment will be required to install the necessary interceptor/equipment to bring the facility into compliance. An appropriate amount of time will be agreed upon between the city and the customer.

34 Russellville - Public Works

 

 

(C) Prohibited discharges. Black water shall not be discharged to the grease interceptor unless specifically approved, in writing, by the city.

 

(D) Garbage grinders and dishwashers.

 

(1) The City of Russellville recommends that solid food waste products be disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal procedures. The use of garbage grinders that discharge to the sanitary sewer is discouraged within the city=s wastewater service area but in the event that the device is used in a commercial or industrial facility, it must be connected to the grease interceptor. The use of a garbage grinder decreases the operational capacity of the grease interceptor and will require an increased pumping frequency to ensure continuous and effective operation.

 

(2) Commercial dishwasher connections must be connected to the grease interceptor. Food particles from garbage grinders take up storage capacity in the grease interceptor and will require that the interceptor be pumped more frequently. Dishwashers discharge hot water and soap, which can melt greases stored in an overburdened interceptor. Melted grease may then pass through the interceptor into the customer=s service line and the public sewer system, where the grease hardens and causes line clogs.

 

(a) Although not recommended, existing food service facilities may allow any fixture to remain connected to a grease interceptor, except fixtures which may discharge black water.

 

(b) Proposed and remodeled food service facilities may not connect janitor sinks or black water fixtures to a grease interceptor.

 

(E) Location.

 

(1) Each grease trap and grease interceptor shall be installed and connected so that it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at any time. A grease interceptor may not be installed in any part of a building unless approved in writing by the City of Russellville.

 

(2) Location of grease interceptors shall meet the approval of the City of Russellville. The best location is in an area outside of an outside wall, but upstream from the black water drain line(s).

(Ord. 2005-14, passed 9-20-05)

 

 

' 51.085 DESIGN CRITERIA.

 

(A) Construction of interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the City of Russellville=s standards and shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All grease removal devices or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the City of Russellville. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology. The City of Russellville=s standard drawing for grease interceptors is shown in Appendix A to Ord. 2005-14.

 

(B) Interceptor sizing. The required size of a grease interceptor shall be approximated by using the City of Russellville grease interceptor sizing formula shown in Appendix B to Ord. 2005-14. Most grease interceptors will have a capacity of not less than 1,000 gallons nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gallons. If the calculated capacity using the City of Russellville grease interceptor sizing formula exceeds 3,000 gallons, multiple units in series shall be installed. (See Appendix B to Ord. 2005-14 for example of formula).

 

2009 S-13

 

Sewer System and Water Works System 35

 

 

(C) Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by the City of Russellville. The City of Russellville reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula.

(Ord. 2005-14, passed 9-20-05)

 

 

' 51.086 GREASE TRAP AND INTERCEPTOR MAINTENANCE.

 

(A) Cleaning/pumping frequency. Under the sink grease traps must be cleaned no less than weekly. If grease traps are more than 50% full when cleaned weekly, the frequency shall be increased. Grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months, or more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system, unless it can be demonstrated to the City of Russellville that the pumping frequency can be extended past the three-month period.

 

(B) Disposal of grease interceptor waste. All waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed of at a facility approved by the City of Russellville to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumpage be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system.

 

(C) Additives. Any additive(s) placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a constant, regular, or scheduled basis shall be reported to the City of Russellville. Such additives shall include, but not be limited to, enzymes, commercially available bacteria, or other additives designed to absorb, purge, consume, treat, or otherwise eliminate fats, oils, and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as a substitution to the maintenance procedures required herein.

 

(D) Manifest. All pumpage from grease interceptors must be tracked by a manifest, which confirms pumping, hauling, and disposal of waste. The customer must obtain a copy of the original manifest from the hauler. The original manifest with original signatures must be left at the disposal facility. The customer is required to utilize only City of Russellville permitted haulers for the disposal of grease.

 

(E) Maintenance log. A grease interceptor cleaning record maintenance log indicating each pumping for the previous 24 months shall be maintained by each FSF. This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped, hauler, and disposal site and shall be kept in a conspicuous location for inspection. This log shall be made immediately available to the City of Russellville representative upon request.

The remedies available to the POTW include injunctive relief, civil and criminal penalties, immediate discontinuance of discharges and/or water service and the publishing of the list of significant violators annually. The enforcement authority shall be vested in the Public Works Director or his or her designee.

 

(B) The Public Works Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or an industrial user permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the City of Russellville, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the City of Russellville to violate any condition of its NPDES/KPDES permit.

 

(C) Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the industrial user permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City of Russellville shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The City of Russellville shall reinstate the industrial user permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City of Russellville within 15 days of the date of occurrence.

(A) Sanitary sewers.

 

(1) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to outline the requirements for proper design, construction, inspection, and final acceptance of manholes, sanitary sewer lines and house connections.

 

(2) Design requirements.

 

(a) A complete set of computations should be made available to the utility in a tabular form, which indicates depth of flow and velocities at minimum, average, and maximum daily waste flows for the different sizes of sewers proposed.

 

1. Depth. In general, sewers shall be sufficiently deep so as to receive sewage from the first floor of all places served by the sewers and to prevent freezing, but shall not be less than three feet deep.

 

2. A. Slope. All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two feet per second. The following are the minimum slopes which should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable:

BACKFLOW. The reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either back pressure or back siphonage.

 

BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY. An assembly or means designed to prevent backflow. A listing of acceptable backflow prevention assemblies and degree of hazard is available in the Kentucky State Plumbing Law, Regulations and Code.

 

CONTAMINATION. An impairment of the quality of the potable water supply by any waste product, fluid, substance, compound or other material to a degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease.

 

CROSS CONNECTION. Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems one of which contains potable water and the other non-potable water or substance of questionable quality, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur into the potable water system.

(Ord. 2006-06, passed 3-21-06)

 

 

' 51.227 REQUIREMENTS.

 

The city shall provide protection to the public water system against backflow by implementing the following requirements:

 

(A) Residential. Buildings used for habitation or occupancy shall be considered as residential buildings. No new water service connection to any premises shall be installed or allowed to be installed by the city unless such service connection is protected by a backflow prevention assembly. Residential service connections shall be considered as low hazard applications and all such connections shall have at a minimum a dual check valve backflow preventer installed between the water meter and the residence. The city may require additional or alternate backflow prevention assemblies if the degree of hazard constitutes a higher level of protection for the public water system.

 

(B) Non-residential. No new water service connection to any non-residential facility shall be installed or allowed to be installed by the city unless such water service connection is protected by a backflow prevention assembly. The type of protective device required shall be determined at the time of installation of the service connection and shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard at the point of such service connection. At a minimum the service connection shall be installed with a dual check valve backflow preventer. In the event activities to occur within a non-residential facility change and create a higher degree of hazard, then the backflow prevention assembly shall be replaced with an assembly which provides acceptable protection.

Sewer System and Water Works System 93

 

 

(C) Inspections. The customer=s water system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violation of this subchapter, exist. When such a condition becomes know, the city shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a physical break in the service lien until the customer has corrected the condition in conformance with the state and city laws relating to plumbing, water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. Water service to any premises shall be discontinued if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly required by this subchapter has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.

 

(D) Existing service connections. All existing water service connections which do not have backflow prevention assemblies or existing water service connections which have less than the minimum required backflow prevention assemblies, shall, except for the inspection requirements, be excluded from the requirements of this subchapter so long as the city is assured that the public water system is satisfactorily protected. However, if the city determines that a hazard to health exits, then a backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this subchapter may be installed on such existing service connection. Backflow prevention assemblies shall not be installed on existing service connections until after the property owner of such residential or commercial property has been informed of the actual and potential hazards that may be created as a result of such backflow assembly installation. Notices provided to such property owners shall include the following language:

 

AWhen cross connection control devices are properly installed, they create a closed water system. A properly sized thermal expansion tank shall be installed in the cold water supply located as near the water heater as possible.@

Where the sales of alcoholic beverages as they relate to other sales are determinative of the licensee's eligibility to retain a license, the licensee shall maintain adequate records to show that relationship. Such books and records shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection by the City Alcoholic Beverage Control Administrator, the Director of Finance, or any authorized representatives.

 

(F) If the holder of any license shall fail to pay the regulatory license fee imposed by this section within ten days of the due date, an automatic penalty of $50 shall be assessed for the first offense. An automatic penalty of $100 shall be assessed on the second offense, and an automatic penalty of

The calculation of the number of offenses for the purpose of invoking the above penalties shall be done on a 12-month basis, with the number of offenses being reduced to zero at the beginning of each new license period.

' 120.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.

 

(A) Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

 

(B) Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other communities including but not limited to Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis,

Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulations Of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Council finds:

 

(1) Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.

 

(2) Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.

 

(3) Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows.

 

(4) Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which does and will create unhealthy conditions.

 

(5) Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.

 

(6) At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A/Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.

 

(7) Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States - 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985 and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.

.

(8) As of June 30, 2001, there have been 3,481 reported cases of AIDS in the State of Kentucky.

 

(9) Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in Kentucky and more specifically in Logan County. As of June 30, 2000, there were 2,560 cases of persons living with HIV which had not developed into AIDS in the state of Kentucky.

 

(10) The number of cases of early stages of syphilis (less than one year) in the United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982 and 45,200 through November of 1990. These numbers have grown even more in the past 10 years.

 

(11) The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being reported in 1990.

 

 

 

 

 

2003 S-11

 

Sexually Oriented Businesses 47

 

 

(12) The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn.

 

(13) According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.

 

(14) Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.

 

(15) Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view Aadult@ oriented films.

 

(16) The findings noted in divisions (1) through (15) raise substantial governmental concerns.

 

(17) Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.

 

(18) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a presently non-existent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual. operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.

 

(19) Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres.

 

(20) Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.

 

(21) The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

 

(22) It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.

 

(23) The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.

 

 

 

2003 S-11

 

48 Russellville - Business Regulations

 

 

(24) The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

 

(25) The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

.~ 07 NONCONFORMING LOT OF RECORD, LAND, PREMISES, STRUCTURES, AND
USES
3.07. l INTENT
Unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter and subject to the restrictions and qua Ii !ications
set forth in Section 3.072 through Section 3.075. nonco1tforming situations that were otherwise lawful
on the effective date of thi s chapter may be continued.
3.07.2 NONCONFORMING LOT OR LOT OF RECORD
A. A lot. which at the time of the original adoption of thi s chapter was recorded in the Logan
County Clerk's office, which was otherwise legal, but did not include sufficient area ofland
to confonn to the minimum lot requirements or site development standard of this chapter
will be considered nonconfonning lot of record. The Zoning Administrator shall issue a
building permit. after approval of the Board of Adjustments for construction of a structure
on such non conforming lot of record, if proposed structures can comply with all site
development requirements contained in this chapter for the applicable zone with the
exception of minimum lot area and minimum lot frontage requirements.
B. When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable
to the intended minimum use except minimum area of Jot, the lot may be used for the
minimum use just as if it were conforming. No use (e.g., a two family residence) requiring
a greater lot size or minimum lot frontage than the established minimum area of lot for a
particular zone is permissible on a nonconfonning lot.
C. When the proposed use for a nonconforming lot is one that is confonning in all other
respects but the applicable setback requirements cannot reasonably be complied with, then
the zoning administrator shall issue a building permit for the proposed structure after the
applicant has received the required variance from the board of adjustments. In granting the
variance, the board of adjustments must find that:
I. The property cannot reasonably be developed for the minimum use vvithout such
variance:
2. The variance is necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot; and
3. The property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact
on surrounding properties. Mere inconvenience or financial hardship does not
constitute grounds for finding compliance is not reasonably possible.
D. This section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has
no substantial structures upon it or ifthe structures are proposed to be removed. A change
in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accom.plished in accordance with secti on
3.07.+.
E. When an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or
more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership, then neither the owner of the
nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of
this section. The nonconforming developed lot and the adjoining lots shall be considered
as one lot.
3-4
)
F
RUSSELLVILLE ZON ING REGULATIONS
This section shall not apply to a deve loped nonconforming lot ir one or more of the
adjoi ning lots with continuous frontage is under the same ownership. The nonconforming
de,·eloped lot and the adjoi ning lots shall be considered as one lot.
3.07.3 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
A. Where a lawful structure exists at the original date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on
area. lot coverage. height. y<lrds. its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning
the structure. such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
B. Except as specifically provided in this section. no person may engage in any activity that
causes an increase in the physical structure or the placement of new structures on open land
if such activity results in:
l. An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconfonning use, or
2. Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restriction such as set back
requirements, height limitations or density requirements or other requirements
such as parking requirements.
C. Any structure or portions thereof may be altered to decease its nonconformity.
D. Should a nonconfonning structure be damaged, destroyed, or demolished by natural means,
it may be reconstructed or repaired. The nonconfonning structure thus damaged. destroyed
or demolished, may be reconstructed or repaired but only to the extent of the square footage
of the structure at the time of the event. The structure may not be extended or enlarged onto
land outside the original building.
E. Should a nonconforming structure be moved or demolished by any other means other than
of section 3.07.5F, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone or district in
which it is located after it is moved.
3.07.4 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND
A. When at the original date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, lawful use of land
existed which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by the chapter. the use
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
B. A nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was
occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a use that inYOIYes the
removal· of natural materials from the lot may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot
where the use was established <lt the time it became non con.forming.
C. No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part lo any portions of open land than
was occupied at the elate of <ldoption or ;unendment of Lhis clrnpter.
D. The volume. intensiLy or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation
e:xists may be incre<lsed and the equipment or processes used at a location where a
nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only lo
changes in the degree of activity rather that changes in kind or no violations of ot her
p<lrag raphs of this section occur.
RUSSELLVILLE ZONING REGULATIONS 3-5
E. Any stmcturc used for single family residential purposes and 111ai111aincd as a
nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar stnicture of a larger size, so

that. when the use was made nonconforming by this chapter. '"as manifestly designed or
arranged to accommodate such use. A nonconforming use may not be extended to
additio11al buildings or to land outside the original building.
G. When a nonconfonning use of land is discontinued or abandoned so as to show a gross lack
of diligence in usage for twelve ( 12) months or more. except when governmental action
prevents such use, the land shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the zone or district in which it is located.
3.07.5 NONCONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN
COl\IIBINATION:
A. If lawful use involving individual structures or of structure and premises in combination
exists at the date of adoption or amendment of th.is chapter that would not be allowed in the
zone or district under the terms of this chapter. the lawful use may be continued so long as
it remains otherwise lawful.
B. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the zone or district
in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed. reconstructed, removed, or
structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use pennitted in the zone
or district in which it is located.
C. A nonconfonning use may be extended through out any portion of a completed building
that, when the use was made nonconfonning by this chapter. was manifestly designed or
arranged to accommodate such use. A nonconforming use may not be extended_ to
additional buildings or to land outside the original building.
D. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use
is superseded by a pennitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone or
district and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
E. When an nonconforming use of land is discontinued or abandoned so as to show a gross
· lack of diligence in usage for twelve ( 12) months or more, except when governmental action
prevents such use. the land shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the zone or district in which it is located.
F. When a nonconforming use of a structure or stmcture and premises in combinations, is
halted because of the damage, destruction. or demolition of the structure by natural means,
it may be reconstructed or repaired and the nonco1tforming use resumed.
G. The nonconforming structure thus damaged, destroyed or demolished. maybe reconstructed
or repaired but only to the extent of the square footage of the stnicture at the time of the
e,·ent. The structure may not be extended or enlarges to land outside the original building.
