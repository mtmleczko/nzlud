PREFACE 
    This volume contains the Code of Ordinances of the City of Harper Woods, which constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code of Ordinances of the City of Harper Woods, as adopted by Ordinance No. 123 on April 15, 1963, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1962 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Numbering system 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of chapter 13 is 13-14. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2 and 4-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as chapter 12.1. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Roger D. Merriam, Editor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to the City Manager, Mr. Ronald J. Bultman, the City Clerk, Mrs. Elinor Cramer, and the City Attorney, Mr. J. Russell LaBarge for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code.

ARTICLE VI. - SATELLITE OR MICROWAVE DISH ANTENNAS 

Sec. 5-199. - Legislative findings. 
    It is hereby declared that satellite or microwave dish antennas located in front yards, side yards or on the roofs are unsightly and have the potential of lowering property values and destroying the aesthetics of residential neighborhoods. It is further found that these dish antennas are more likely to catch the wind causing stresses that the roofs on most houses in the city are not designed to withstand. There is a danger that an antenna could become dislodged and cause physical injury or property damage. Finally, the aesthetic features as well as the safety concerns are different both in kind and in degree from traditional television and radio antennas so that differing regulatory treatment is necessary. 
(Ord. No. 93-4, § 1, 2-2-93) 
Sec. 5-200. - Prohibition. 
    No person shall install a satellite or microwave dish antenna on any property in the city without obtaining a permit and otherwise complying with the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 85-5, § 1, 5-22-85) 
Sec. 5-200.1. - Exceptions. 
    If the homeowner can demonstrate that the requirements of this article will prevent the antenna from picking up a usable signal, the building department shall vary the requirements of section 5-203 as provided in this section. However, if the failure to receive a usable signal is caused by trees or shrubbery on the homeowner's property, the homeowner shall trim or remove the trees or shrubbery before applying for a variance. 
    The building department shall permit the following variances in the following order until a placement is found which will generate a usable signal: 
(a)  Permit placement in a side yard in back of the front setback line of the residence provided that the other requirements of section 5-203(d) can be met. 
(b)  Increase the height above grade level to no more than twenty (20) feet. 
(c)  Allow the placement on the roof of a garage or other accessory building located in the back yard. The building department may require the written opinion of an architect, engineer or other qualified professional that the structure can withstand the stresses of the prevailing wind conditions, snow load and the weight of the antenna. If such opinion is required, it shall be at the expense of the homeowner. 
(Ord. No. 93-4, § 1, 2-2-93) 
Sec. 5-201. - Permit; site plan; fee. 
    Applications for a permit to install a satellite or microwave antenna shall be submitted to the building department. The application shall include a site plan showing the proposed location of the installation, including building locations on the site and on any contiguous lot, a picture or sketch of all the elements of the antenna which would be exposed to view from adjacent properties and the dimensions of all buildings, lot lines and set back lines as established in the zoning regulations. There shall be a permit fee in an amount established by resolution of the city council and payable at the time of application. 
(Ord. No. 85-5, § 2, 5-22-85) 
Sec. 5-202. - Considered as accessory building; area defined. 
    A satellite or microwave dish antenna shall be considered an accessory building and shall comply with the percent of lot coverage requirements for the zoning district in which it shall be located. The area is defined as the smallest rectangle which, if the sides were extended upwards at right angles to the ground, would completely enclose the antenna and platform. 
(Ord. No. 85-5, § 3, 5-22-85) 
Sec. 5-203. - Requirements-Residential. 
    All of the following shall be required of any satellite or microwave dish antenna installation upon residential property to satisfy local health and safety and aesthetic objectives: 
(a)  The diameter of the dish shall not exceed twelve (12) feet; 
(b)  No part of the installation shall extend more than fifteen (15) feet above grade level; 
(c)  The antenna shall be permanently installed upon a concrete platform at or within twelve (12) inches of grade level and with forty-two-inch footings; 
(d)  No part of the antenna or platform shall be located within three (3) feet of any side lot line, within ten (10) feet of the residence, within four (4) feet of a detached garage or within one foot of any easement for public utilities; 
(e)  All electrical wiring and any cable conveying the signals into the residence shall be installed underground in conformity with the National Electrical Code; 
(f)  The installation shall comply with all recommendations and instructions of the manufacturer; 
(g)  No part of the antenna or platform shall be located upon or extend over the front yard beyond the rear set back line of the residence; and

DIVISION 1. - INCIDENT AND RECOVERY 

Sec. 6-51. - Findings; purpose. 
(a)  The City of Harper Woods Fire Department, finds that due to the number of major roadways and interstate highways that dissect the City of Harper Woods and the number of high-risk major businesses found within our city boundaries, the potential exists for response to incidents involving the release or threaten release of hazardous materials and/or substances. Such incidents create a likelihood of personal injury and/or property damage. The control and abatement of such incidents places a significant financial and operational burden upon the city's firefighting, rescue and emergency medical services and other departments within the city (police, DPW, water, etc.). It is necessary to adopt an article to establish the liability for such incidents and to establish a policy and methods which will allow the city to seek recovery of all City of Harper Woods costs associated with emergency responses to hazardous materials and/or substance incidents from the responsible parties. 
(b)  The purpose is to protect the City of Harper Woods from extraordinary expenses resulting from the utilization of city resources in response to an incident involving the spill, release or discharge of hazardous materials and/or substances or the improper handling or storage of hazardous materials and/or substances by authorizing the imposition of charges to recover actual costs incurred by the city in responding to such incidents.

Any person wishing to discard bulky items which exceed in one or more characteristics the size and weight limitations prescribed in previous items of this section may have such items picked up after arrangements have been made with the superintendent relative to time and place of pickup and the item or items to be collected, or the superintendent may, at his discretion, permit a person to contract with a private handler to have said items removed to a location outside of the city. This item is not meant to prohibit any person from personally conveying to a point outside of the city such items.

ARTICLE III. - CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY 

Sec. 11-50. - Legislative findings. 
    The council finds that a certificate of occupancy program is in the public interest for the following reasons: 
(1)  The city is a mature community with much of the housing stock and commercial buildings being in excess of thirty (30) years old. 
(2)  Based on past experience with a voluntary inspection program, many of these buildings have serious code violations which are a threat to the health, welfare and safety of the residents of the city. 
(3)  It takes special training and knowledge which is beyond the expertise of the average property owner to recognize many of these code violations. 
(4)  In order to preserve the value of existing construction, to safeguard the public, and to prevent blight, it is necessary to institute a program to inspect every building in the city and continue to inspect on a periodic basis. 
(5)  The least intrusive method, which should result in eventual inspection of all residential premises, is to require a certificate of occupancy upon sale or transfer of the property. 
(6)  For commercial property, past experience has shown that reinspection every four (4) years and upon change of occupancy is reasonable. 
(Ord. No. 92-9, § 1, 5-13-92) 
Sec. 11-51. - Certificate of occupancy required; penalty; persons liable. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful to occupy any premises in the city unless there is an unexpired certificate of occupancy in effect which covers the specific use for which the premises are being occupied. 
(b)  Violations of this section are as follows: 
(1)  A first offense shall be a civil infraction subject to a fine of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) in addition to any costs and fees that may be imposed by the court; 
(2)  Thereafter, in the discretion of the building official, should there be a failure to take the required corrective action within a reasonable time period as determined by the building official, a misdemeanor ticket may be issued. 
(c)  Each day a violation exists shall constitute a separate offence, each violation for each rental dwelling or rental unit shall constitute a separate offense. These penalties and remedies are cumulative. 
(d)  In the case of tenant occupied commercial property, either the owner or the tenant, or both, may be cited for the violation. In the case of tenant occupied residential property, only the owner may be cited. 
(e)  In the case of a corporation, the president or managing agent shall be personally responsible for the violation, in addition to the corporation. 
(f)  In the case of a partnership, any general partner may be cited for the violation. 
(Ord. No. 92-9, § 1, 5-13-92; Ord. No. 2018-10, § 1, 11-19-2018)

(3)  Owners of all owner occupied residential property shall apply for a certificate of occupancy when the property is sold or transferred and thereafter as required by section 11-59 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 92-9, § 1, 5-13-92) 
Sec. 11-53. - Enforcement; search warrant. 
    If the building department has reason to believe that any premises are being occupied in violation of this ordinance, the following steps shall be taken. 
(1)  The owner or occupant will be contacted and notified of the requirements of this ordinance; and an inspection will be requested. 
(2)  If permission is refused, a search warrant shall be requested from the district court. 
(3)  If the warrant request is granted, the premises will be inspected and the owner or occupant will be given written notice of any violations. The owner or other responsible party will be billed for the regular inspection fee, any court costs and attorney fees incurred in securing the search warrant. If not paid, these amounts will become a lien on the property as provided by section 12.9 of the city charter. 
(4)  If the violations are not corrected within the time limits set by the building department, charges may be brought under section 11-51. 
(Ord. No. 92-9, § 1, 5-13-92)

If the housing unit is sold, or if it is no longer occupied by the owner, a certificate of occupancy shall be required, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section. A land contract purchaser shall be considered an owner if the land contract was executed before the effective date of this ordinance. 
(2)  Application for a certificate of occupancy is not required when owner occupied residential property is transferred to a member of the household of the owner, provided the transferee has resided in the property for at least one year immediately before the transfer; and the transfer is for a nominal consideration. 
(Ord. No. 92-9, § 1, 5-13-92) 
Sec. 11-57. - Application procedure; inspection/issuance. 
(a)  A certificate of occupancy may be obtained by submitting a written application to the building department on the prescribed form, and by paying the fee which shall be established by resolution of city council. 
(b)  Before issuing a certificate of occupancy, the building department shall inspect the property and determine whether the property is in compliance with all of the applicable provisions of the most recent edition of the BOCA National Property Maintenance Code adopted by the city. The building department shall give the applicant a list of all violations found as a result of the inspection. 
(c)  The building department shall issue a certificate of occupancy immediately if no violations are found. If violations are found, a certificate of occupancy shall be issued after the building department is satisfied that all violations have been corrected. If the premises are occupied without a valid certificate of occupancy, the city may proceed under section 11-51. 
(d)  The building department may, but is not required to, issue a conditional certificate of occupancy if the violations are not an immediate threat to the health and safety of the occupants and if there are compelling reasons why the violations cannot be corrected before occupancy. However, all such violations shall be corrected within a reasonable time as established by the building department but not to exceed ninety (90) days. If the violations are not corrected within the allotted time, the conditional certificate of occupancy will be void and the city may proceed under section 11-51. 
(e)  The certificate of occupancy shall state that the building department has inspected the dwelling or structure and has determined that the dwelling or structure may be occupied. The existence of an unexpired certificate of occupancy shall not bar enforcement of or excuse compliance with any building code or other ordinance of the city. The certificate of occupancy shall bear this legend in capital letters or boldface type: 
"THE CITY DOES NOT WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE THAT THERE ARE NO DEFECTS IN THE PREMISES COVERED BY THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE CITY SHALL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFECTS NOT NOTED IN THE INSPECTION REPORT. INTERESTED PERSONS ARE ADVISED AND ENCOURAGED TO MAKE THEIR OWN INSPECTION OF THE PREMISES IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THEIR CONDITION." 
(f)  The person applying for a certificate of occupancy shall sign an inspection agreement on a form prescribed by the building department. The inspection agreement shall disclose the scope of the inspection, state the limitations on the inspection and shall prohibit disclosure of the inspection report unless the scope and limitations of the inspection are also disclosed. In the case of a sale of the property, both the buyer and the seller shall sign the inspection agreement.

    All criminal fines and/or civil infractions, which are awarded in favor of the city and assessed against the owner and/or agent may be assess against the property in any way allowed by this article of any other law.

(b)  Within forty-eight (48) hours after receiving or purchasing a precious item, the dealer shall send a copy of the record of transaction form to the Harper Woods Police Department and, if the record of transaction form indicates that the customer resides outside the jurisdiction of the City of Harper Woods, the dealer shall send a copy of the record of transaction form to the police agency of the city, village, or township in which the customer resides as set forth on the record of transaction, or, if that city, village, or township does not have a police agency, to the sheriff's department of the county in which the customer resides as set forth on the record of transaction. 
(1)  Every licensee, owner and employee, shall keep a record of all persons and/or entities with whom business has transacted and all property coming into their possession. Reports must be electronically transmitted to the chief of police, or his or her designee. Within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt by purchase, or otherwise of a precious item, a report must be transmitted by means of electronic transmission through a modem, or similar device in a format that the data is capable of direct electronic entry into the City of Harper Woods Police Department's computerized system, as approved by the chief of police, or his or her designee for identifying property coming into the possession of a licensor.

The per transaction registration fee is not a per item fee, included in the transaction. It is within the sole discretion of the secondhand dealer whether to recover the fee from their customers for registering a transaction. 
(4)  The licensee will be invoiced on a monthly basis. The city's vendor automated reporting service isolates and generates a list of the billable transactions will be used for deriving invoiced amounts. The above fees are assessed for the use of the standard vendor's automated recording service any custom programming completed for the secondhand dealer will be negotiated on a contract basis and may result in additional licensing arrangements between the vendor and the licensor. Sales tax will be added to the above amounts where applicable. Failure to timely pay as invoiced is a violation of this article. 
(c)  The record of transaction forms received by a police agency or sheriffs department shall not be open to inspection by the general public. Each police agency or sheriff's department holding record of transaction forms shall be responsible for insuring the confidentiality of the record of transaction forms and insuring that the record of transaction forms are used only for the purpose for which they were received.

Sec. 21-1. - Statement of purpose. 
    The purpose and intent of this sign chapter is to create the legal framework for a comprehensive and balanced system of regulating signs and outdoor advertising. Such regulations are concerned with communication along streets and highways, and deal with symbols and letters as they appear on signs, billboards, banners, store fronts, marquees, canopies, and all other stationary visual media whether located on or off the premises of the activity to which the message pertains. 
    It is the further purpose and intent of this chapter to: 
(1)  Encourage good design in the context of the overall image and visual environment of the city, and prescribe sound practices with respect to size, spacing, illumination, type and placement of signs for the purpose of safeguarding and enhancing properties in each of the various types of zoning districts; 
(2)  Maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the city's ability to attract sources of economic growth and development while balancing the concerns to lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive size (area) of signs that compete for attention and may impinge on pedestrian or traffic safety; 
(3)  Protect and encourage the orderly growth and development of the city; 
(4)  Provide for signage that is adequate but not excessive and that displays a message through use of pictures, symbols and logos for rapid comprehension by the public; 
(5)  Regulate the erection of signs in such numbers, sizes, designs and locations as may create a hazard or distraction to pedestrians and motorists in an effort to improve safety upon the streets and highways in the city; 
(6)  Recognize the proliferation of signs is unduly distracting to motorists and nonmotorized travelers, reduces the effectiveness of signs directing and warning the public, causes confusion, reduces desired uniform traffic flow, and creates potential for vehicular accidents; 
(7)  Protect the safety of drivers and others by precluding animated signs and limiting changeable copy signs in a manner intended to lessen the diversion or distractions of a driver's attention from the roadway, particularly with regard to larger signs on heavily-trafficked roadways; 
(8)  Avoid excessive competition for large or multiple signs, so that permitted signs provide adequate identification and direction while minimizing clutter, unsightliness, and confusion; 
(9)  Establish sign size in relation to the scale of the lot and/or building on which the sign is placed or to which it pertains; 
(10)  Protect public investment in public structures, open spaces and thoroughfares; 
(11)  Minimize the adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property; 
(12)  Enhance the effectiveness of necessary directional, warning signs, traffic control devices consistent with national and state standards and whose purpose is to promote highway safety and efficiency by providing for the safe and orderly movement of motorized vehicles, nonmotorized vehicles and pedestrians; 
(13)  Recognize that there are generally accepted and empirically derived standards for the type, size, spacing, area, and setback of signs based upon the speed limits and number of vehicular traffic lanes on the street which they front. These standards are generally intended to allow signs that can be recognized at a given distance by a motorist, allowing them to safely slow down, turn into and access the site for which the sign advertises. However, these standards do not account for the peculiar characteristics of the city's business corridors. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, the following: unusually narrow widths and shallow depths of commercial properties fronting on the city's major thoroughfares, caused by progressive road widening; the proximity of existing buildings to each other and to property and right-of-way lines; traffic flows and congestion levels; and the goals and objectives of the city's comprehensive development plan and zoning code; 
(14)  Prevent signs that are potentially dangerous to the public due to structural deficiencies, disrepair or distraction to motorists; 
(15)  Reduce visual pollution and physical obstructions caused by a proliferation of signs that could diminish the city's image, property values and quality of life; 
(16)  Prevent placement of signs which will conceal or obscure signs of adjacent uses; 
(17)  Protect the public right to receive messages as provided by and protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; 
(18)  Maintain and improve the image of the city by encouraging signs which are compatible with conforming existing signs, have good viewing qualities with passing motorists, and are compatible with buildings and streets, through the establishment of specific standards for various areas in the city. 
    The city has thus determined that these characteristics warrant modifications to these generally accepted though empirically derived sign standards. The regulations and standards of this chapter represent these modifications and are considered the minimum amount of regulation necessary to achieve a substantial government interest for public safety, aesthetics, and protection of property values. The regulations and standards contained herein are intended to be content neutral while achieving the following objectives.

Sec. 21-2. - Conflict of laws. 
    Where more restrictive with respect to sign location, use, size or height, the limitations of the zoning code affecting light and ventilation requirements and the use of land shall take precedence over this chapter. 
    In any case where a provision of this chapter is found to be in conflict with a provision of the City's Code of Ordinances or Zoning Code, the provision which establishes the higher standard for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the people shall prevail. In any case where a provision of the City's Code of Ordinances or Zoning Code is found to be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter and contain a lower standard for the promotion and protection of the health and safety of the people, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail, and such other standards are hereby repealed to the extent that they may be found in conflict with this chapter.

Electronic Graphic Display Sign
(3)  Video display sign means a sign that displays a message or background characterized by motion, movement or pictorial imagery to depict action or a special effect that imitates movement through the progression of frames that gives the illusion of motion. Video display signs may or may not include text, moving objects, moving patterns or bands of light or expanding or contracting shapes. Video display signs use electronic display technology and may be combined with an electronic changeable copy sign. The following is an example of a video display sign. 

Video Display Sign
(4)  Multi-vision sign means a sign composed of a series of vertical or horizontal slats or cylinders that are designed to rotate at intervals so that each rotation of the group of slats or cylinders produces a different image or message and allows the display of one of two (2) or more images on a single sign structure and at any given time.

(1)  The sign board of appeals shall have the power to modify or reverse, wholly or partly, the notice or order, and may grant an extension of time for the performance of any act required of not more than three (3) additional months, where the board finds that there is practical difficulty connected with the performance of this chapter or by applicable rules or regulations issued pursuant thereto, and that such extension is in harmony with the general purpose of this chapter to secure the public health, safety and welfare. 
(2)  The sign board of appeals shall return a decision upon each case within sixty (60) days after a request or appeal has been filed, unless a further time is agreed upon with the parties concerned.

(3)  The concurring vote of four (4) members of the sign board of appeals shall be necessary to reverse, wholly or partly, or modify any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the building official, or to decide in favor of the applicant for any matter upon which they are required to pass or to effect any variation in this chapter. 
(4)  After a sign variance has been denied in whole or in part by the sign board of appeals, then such application shall not be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the last denial, provided however, that a denied variance may be reconsidered by the board when, in the opinion of the building official, or board, newly discovered evidence or changed conditions warrant such reconsideration. 
(e)  Scope of hearing. At the hearing, the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to show cause as to why the notice or order should be modified or withdrawn, or why the period of time permitted for compliance should be extended.

(g)  Sign variances. A sign variance to the strict letter of the requirements of this chapter governing area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk, and density may be allowed by the sign board of appeals only in cases involving practical difficulties when the evidence in the official record of the appeal supports all the following affirmative findings: 
(1)  That the alleged practical difficulties are exceptional and peculiar to the property of the person requesting the sign variance, are not self-created, and result from conditions which do not exist generally throughout the city; 
(2)  That the alleged practical difficulties, which will result from a failure to grant the sign variance, include substantially more than mere inconvenience, or mere inability to attain a higher financial return, and would prevent the applicant from using property in question for a permitted purpose, or would render conformity with the strict letter of this chapter unnecessarily burdensome; and 
(3)  That allowing the sign variance will result in substantial justice being done, considering the public benefits intended to be secured by this chapter, the individual hardships that will be suffered by a failure of the sign board of appeals to grant a sign variance, and the rights of others whose property would be affected by the allowance of the sign variance, will ensure that the spirit of this chapter is observed, will not be contrary to the public purpose and general intent and purpose of this chapter, and will secure the public safety. 
(h)  The above findings of fact shall be made by the sign board of appeals, which is not empowered to grant a sign variance without an affirmative finding of fact in each of the categories above. Every finding of fact shall be supported in the record of proceedings of the board. 
    If a sign variance to this chapter is requested, the applicant may be required to erect a three-dimensional mock up model on site or submit such a model to the building official that depicts the variance requested.

(Ord. No. 2017-06, 11-6-2017) 
Sec. 21-19. - Electronic display. 
(a)  Findings. Studies show that there is a correlation between electronic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers. Distraction can lead to traffic accidents. Drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message, but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message. Drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur. Drivers are also distracted by messages that do not tell the full story in one look. People have a natural desire to see the end of the story and will continue to look at the sign in order to wait for the end. In addition, drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message, such as fade-ins and fade-outs. Finally, drivers are generally more distracted by messages that are too small to be clearly viewed or that contain more than a simple message. Time and temperature displays appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are shorter and are easily absorbed, and become inaccurate without frequent changes. 
    Despite these public safety concerns, there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages. Except as prohibited by state or federal law, sign owners should have the opportunity to use the technologies with certain restrictions. The restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact the residential character. 
(b)  Districts permitted. Electronic display technology shall be permitted for ground signs located in the C1 and regional shopping districts, subject to the provisions herein of this chapter. 
(c)  Regulations. Electronic changeable copy, graphic display and tri-vision display signs shall be permitted for ground signs subject to the following regulations: 
(1)  Frequency. Copy change shall not be more frequently than once per fifteen (15) seconds. 
(2)  Color. Copy may be multi-color, as determined by the planning commission during site plan review or the planner and building official during an administrative review. 
(3)  Illumination. Glare shall be reduced and/or minimized in such a manner as to maintain an appropriate level of contrast during the day. To reduce driver distraction at night and light trespass into residential areas, an automatic dimmer shall be required to control brightness. A photometric plan which identifies the proposed illumination levels (in footcandles) shall be provided. Illumination levels shall not exceed 0.5 footcandles at the property line, measured five (5) feet from the ground. 
(4)  Area. An electronic changeable copy or electronic graphic display area shall not exceed more than sixty (60) percent of the actual sign area of any ground sign face of which it is a part, with not more than two (2) lines of text; except that one hundred (100) percent of the area of a billboard sign shall be permitted to be electronic graphic display. 
(5)  Integration into sign. The electronic changeable copy or electronic graphic display areas on ground signs shall be part of the same sign face as a ground sign without electronic display technology and shall be integrated into the face of such sign by use of a border or similar design treatment that provides a visual linkage to the remainder of the sign. 
(6)  Motion, animation and video. Video display, animation, scrolling text, flashing, whirling or fading signs, dissolving transitions, or any other type of motion associated with an electronic sign shall be prohibited, except that marquee signs in the general business district may incorporate video display technology.

"Approved service driveway" is defined to mean a driveway constructed of cement, asphalt, brick or no less than four (4) inches of compacted gravel from the sidewalk to the garage or sideyard. Gravel shall be of that type and aggregate designed for driveway use. Gravel, commonly referred to as "pea gravel" is specifically prohibited. The mere scattering of loose gravel upon grass, dirt or any other substance or material is deemed not to be in compliance with this section. All new driveways or additions to existing driveways, installed after June 1, 2001, other than for maintenance purposes, must be constructed of cement, asphalt or brick. 
    Parking of a licensed motor vehicle in any rear yard in a residentially zoned area is specifically prohibited except: 
a.  On an approved service driveway which extends continuously from the sidewalk to a garage located in the rear yard; or 
b.  On an approved service driveway for parking, not to be in excess of twenty (20) feet in length, which adjoins and extends from the rear portion of a garage having both a front and rear exit for a motor vehicle. 
(2)  Commercial-type vehicles, not exceeding five thousand (5,000) pounds gross vehicle weight and not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) inches in length with a current license, in operating condition, and: 
a.  With descriptive advertising or other exterior commercial lettering may be parked on an approved service driveway, extending from the street directly to a side yard or a garage, provided no part of such vehicle may extend beyond the front setback line of the residence. 
b.  With no descriptive advertising or any other exterior commercial lettering may be parked on an approved service driveway, extending from the street directly to a side yard or garage. 
In nonresidentially zoned areas, automobiles and commercial vehicles may be parked in approved off-street parking and loading areas, provided they have a current license and are in operable condition. Parking (storage) of commercial vehicles, for example, tractor and/or trailer, or a semitruck trailer used or modified to be used as a building for the purpose of the shelter of persons or animals and/or the sale or storage of merchandise or equipment, in excess of forty-eight (48) hours is prohibited, except for vehicles or trailers on an approved (building permit) site whereon construction activity is clearly evident. (The requirements of section 12-78 of this Code are in addition to the requirements of this section.) 
(b)  Parking of commercial vehicles. 
(1)  No commercial vehicle shall be parked on any residential street between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. unless a delivery is being made or services are being performed at an address within the city block where the vehicle is parked. The commercial vehicle shall only remain so parked while such delivery is being made or while such services are being performed. 
(2)  The parking or storage of any semi or tandem truck tractor for any purpose in any residentially zoned area of the city is, hereby, expressly prohibited.

(3)  Travel trailers, motor homes and boats may not be stored or parked in the front yard area, defined as that area between the front building setback and the front lot line, or within twenty-five (25) feet of the front lot line, whichever is the greater distance. Storage or parking is permitted in the rear and side yard of property only. Temporary parking will be permitted in the driveway for periods not to exceed forty-eight (48) hours for loading, unloading and related purposes only. A new forty-eight-hour period does not commence until the travel trailer, motor home or boat has been absent from the driveway for a period of at least seven (7) consecutive days. In calculating a forty-eight-hour violation, absence of less than seven (7) days shall be disregarded and shall be treated as if the travel trailer, motor home or boat was continuously present for the entire period. 
(4)  A suitable covering (e.g. tarpaulin) shall be placed over all boats whenever they are not enclosed, in order to prevent vandalism or injury to children. 
(e)  Use of parking area provided for City of Harper Woods municipal offices, library, police and fire departments, and public parks. No motor vehicle may be stored or parked on any parking area provided for the city municipal offices, library, police and fire departments or any public parks contrary to any posted parking control regulation which has been adopted by the city manager upon recommendation of the police department.

Any person or entity violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a civil infraction, and on conviction thereof, shall be fined in an amount not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).

An owner or operator of a motor vehicle who fails to produce evidence under this paragraph when requested to produce that evidence is responsible for a civil infraction. 
(b)  A certificate of insurance issued by an insurance company stating that there is in force a liability policy meeting the requirements of the personal and property protection and residual liability insurance law of the State of Michigan shall be accepted as prima facie evidence that insurance is in force for the motor vehicle described in the certificate of insurance until the expiration date shown on the certificate. The certificate, in addition to describing the motor vehicles for which insurance is in effect, shall state the name of each person named on the policy, policy declaration, or a declaration certificate whose operation of the vehicle would cause the liability coverage of that insurance to become void. 
(c)  If an owner or a motor vehicle is determined to be responsible for a violation of paragraph (a), the 32A District Court may require the person to surrender his or her operator's or chauffeur's license unless proof that the vehicle has insurance meeting the requirements of the personal and property protection and residual liability insurance law is submitted to the court. If the court requires the license to be surrendered, the court shall order the secretary of state to suspend the person's license beginning with the date on which a person is determined to be responsible for the civil infraction for a period of thirty (30) days or until proof of insurance which meets the requirements of the personal and property protection and residual liability insurance law is submitted to the secretary of state, whichever occurs later. 
(d)  An owner or operator of a motor vehicle who knowingly produces false evidence under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than one year, or a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or both.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 323, § 1, enacted June 21, 1982, amended the Code by adding a new § 25-5. Inasmuch as the Code already contained a § 25-5, the editor has redesignated the provisions of said Ord. No. 323 as § 25-6. 
Sec. 25-7. - Street parking during snow emergency.

The declaration of emergency shall be in writing, shall be filed with the city clerk, and shall go into effect when time-stamped by the city clerk. 
    The city manager, or designated representative, shall immediately publicize the snow emergency and the parking prohibition in such a manner as is calculated to inform a reasonably diligent resident of the snow emergency. The methods of publicizing the snow emergency shall be communicated, in writing, to the city clerk within a reasonable time. Failure of a defendant to receive notice of a snow emergency shall not be a defense to a prosecution under this section. 
(c)  Duration of prohibition. The parking prohibition shall go into effect two (2) hours after the city manager, or his designated representative, has declared a snow emergency. The prohibition shall end on any individual street if both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
(1)  It has stopped snowing; and 
(2)  The city has completed snow plowing on that street. 
The parking prohibition shall expire forty-eight (48) hours after it has stopped snowing unless the snow emergency is extended by the city manager or his designated representative. An extension of the snow emergency requires that the procedures of paragraph (b) above be repeated. 
(d)  Abandoning disabled vehicles. Whenever a vehicle becomes disabled for any reason on any street on which there is a parking prohibition in effect, the person operating such vehicle shall take immediate action to have the vehicle towed or pushed off the roadway. No person shall abandon or leave a vehicle in the roadway (regardless of whether indicated by a raised hood or otherwise, that the vehicle is disabled), except for the purpose of securing assistance, during the actual time necessary to go to a nearby telephone or to nearby garage, gasoline station, or other place of assistance and return without delay. 
(e)  Penalties. Violation of this section shall be punishable as a civil infraction punishable by a civil penalty not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
(f)  Evidentiary presumption relating to violators. Proof that the particular vehicle described in the complaint was parked in violation of this section together with proof that the defendant named in the complaint was, at the time of such parking, the registered owner of such vehicle, shall constitute in evidence a presumption that the registered owner of such vehicle was the person who parked or placed such vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, such violation occurred. 
(Ord. No. 329, §§ 1-6, 1-3-83) 
Editor's note- Ordinance No. 329, enacted Jan. 3, 1983, amended the Code, but did not specify the manner of inclusion. At the editor's discretion, therefore, §§ 1-6 of Ord. No. 329 have been codified as § 25-7.

(g)  A person shall be excused from a violation of this section if the person can show that the vehicle was temporarily parked while the owner or occupant was visiting or conducting business at the premises where the vehicle was parked at the time of the violation.

(8)  If a chemical test described in subsection (6) is administered, the results of the test shall be made available to the person charged or the person's attorney upon written request to the prosecution, with a copy of the request filed with the court. The prosecution shall furnish the results at least two (2) days before the day of the trial. The results of the test shall be offered as evidence by the prosecution in that trial. Failure to fully comply with the request shall bar the admission of the results into evidence by the prosecution. 
(9)  Except in a prosecution relating solely to a violation of section 5.15(1)(b), the amount of alcohol in the driver's blood at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis of the person's blood, urine, or breath shall give rise to the following presumptions: 
(a)  If there was at the time 0.07% or less by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood, it shall be presumed that the defendant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was not impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor, and that the defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor. 
(b)  If there was at the time in excess of 0.07% but less than 0.10% by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood, it shall be presumed that the defendant's ability to operate a vehicle was impaired within the provisions of section 5.15(3) due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor. 
(c)  If there was at the time 0.10% or more by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood, it shall be presumed that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. 
(10)  A person's refusal to submit to a chemical test as provided in subsection (6) shall be admissible in a criminal prosecution for a crime described in MCL 257.625c(1) only for the purpose of showing that a test was offered to the defendant, but not as evidence in determining innocence or guilt of the defendant. The jury shall be instructed accordingly.

ARTICLE IV. - INDUSTRIAL WASTE SURCHARGE 

Sec. 27-85. - Purpose and objective. 
    This article has as its purpose the protection of public health and safety and because of the widely varying quality characteristics of the sewage discharged by different users of the public sewer and the publicly owned treatment works, it is the objective of this article to impose sewage charges which reflect the cost of treating sewage strength factors as well as sewage volume. These charges to commercial and industrial users will be in the form of a payment called a surcharge and will reflect industries' equitable costs of wastewater treatment in excess of the strength of domestic sewage. Sewage charges will be based on a volume rate and surcharge based on volume of discharge and the strength of BOD, suspended solids and phosphorus or other pollutants present in the wastewater. In the event other pollutants are required to be surcharged under this article, authorized variances, or by special arrangement with the owner of the publicly owned treatment works the rules and regulations adopted herein will apply, said rules and regulations being on file with the city clerk (or other appropriate municipal officer).

Sec. 27-88. - Schedule of surcharges. 
    It is ordained that the schedule of industrial waste pollutant strength surcharges is hereby adopted and made effective for users of the wastewater system of the City of Harper Woods. Said surcharges to be computed as follows: 
Computation of Industrial Waste Pollutant Strength Surcharge 
    The industrial waste pollutant strength surcharge shall be computed in accordance with the following formula: 
SC = 0.0624 V a(BOD-250) + b(TSS-300) + c(P-12) Where: SC = Pollutant strength surcharge fee in dollars for the billing period. V = Volume of waste discharged in the billing period in Mcf (1000 cubic feet) BOD = Five-day biochemical oxygen demand of the waste expressed in milligrams per liter (ppm). TSS = Total suspended solids in the waste expressed in milligrams per liter (ppm). P = Phosphorus in the waste expressed in milligrams per liter (ppm). a, b, c, = Surcharge rates, dollars per pound for treating BOD, TSS and P respectively. 0.0624 = Factor which converts Mcf to MM pounds. a = $0.082/pound 
b =  0.083/pound 
c =  1.321/pound  
    For purposes of surcharge computation, the values of pollutant strengths shall not be less than the allowable values; the allowable values are: BOD - 250 
TSS - 300 
  P - 12 
    The total sewerage charge for a particular industry would be the sum of the base flow charge and the surcharge would be calculated from the following formula: 
UC = V(R) + SC Where: UC = Total sewerage charge for the billing period in dollars. V = Volume of waste discharged in billing period of Mcf. R = Basic flow sewage rate is $4.103 Mcf effective January 1, 1980. SC = Surcharge in dollars is computed above.

City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 II-12
¯ To promote a higher quality of development than could be achieved under conventional zoning regulations.
¯ To encourage innovation in land use and variety in design, layout, and type of structures constructed.
¯ To provide a feasible means of residential development on sites that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to develop because of the parcel size or shape, the character of surrounding land uses, or other constraints.
B. Eligibility Criteria.
1. In considering any proposal for the Single Family Cluster Option, the Planning Commission shall determine that the proposal satisfies one or more of the following eligibility criteria:
a. The overall impact of the development will provide a recognizable and substantial benefit to its ultimate residents and to the community.
b. The parcel has narrow width, shallow depth, or an unusual configuration that is a substantial detriment to development as a conventional subdivision.
c. A significant portion of the property's perimeter is bordered by a major thoroughfare so that, if developed as a conventional subdivision, a substantial number of the lots would abut the thoroughfare and be impacted by negative traffic noise and lights.
d. A substantial portion of the property's perimeter is bordered by land that is zoned or used for more intensive non-residential development that would be potentially incompatible with single family residents without special design preferences.
e. The parcel contains natural assets that would be preserved or enhanced through the use of cluster development. Such assets may include stands of trees, land that serves as a habitat for wildlife, unusual topographic features, or other natural assets that should be preserved.
2. An application for the Single Family Cluster Option shall be accompanied by written and graphic documentation demonstrating to the Planning Commission that the proposal satisfies one or more of the listed eligibility criteria.
C. Project Density. The overall density of development on a site that qualifies for cluster development shall not exceed the standards for net density as established by the underlying zoning regulations for the district in which the site is located. The net density of a development shall be computed by dividing the total number of units proposed to be devoted to residential use (residential lots and open space, excluding public and private streets and public right-of-way). The quotient shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of an acre.
For the purposes of computing density, allowable acreage shall include the following:
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 II-13
1. All areas to be used for residential purposes, including off-street parking and private access roads, but excluding public street rights-of-way;
2. Dedicated private parks and/or common open space devoted for use of residents of the single family cluster development.
D. Site Design Requirements. Single family cluster developments shall comply with the following requirements:
1. Clustering Alternatives.
a. Attached Unit Clusters
A maximum of four (4) single-family dwelling units may be attached to each other provided that measures are taken to avoid monotonous facade design or the appearance of massive buildings that are out-of-scale with surrounding single family development. The attached units shall be offset from one another, and/or different design details (i.e., different building entrance designs, different building materials, etc.) shall be used for each unit. (See diagram: Attached Unit Cluster.)
b. Detached Unit Clusters
A maximum of four (4) single-family detached units may be combined into a single cluster, provided that the units shall be spaced not less than 10 feet apart. This spacing requirement may be waived or modified by the Planning Commission during site plan review, based upon a favorable recommendation of the City Fire Chief. (See diagram: Detached Unit Cluster.)
2. Open Space.
a. General Requirements
Single family cluster developments shall provide and must maintain at least 15 percent of the site as dedicated common open space.
b. Water Bodies and Basins
Up to 25 percent of the required open space may include the area of any created water bodies or water detention/retention basins.
c. Conveyance of Open Space
The required open space shall be set aside by the developer through an irrevocable conveyance, such as a deed restriction(s) or covenant(s) that run with the land, assuring that the open space will be developed, dedicated
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 II-14
and continually maintained according to the site plan and never changed to another use.
3. Setbacks.
a. Setbacks between Clusters

Public street right-of-way: 25 feet;
Property line (other than street right-of-way): 25 feet;
Utility easement (other than individual unit lead): 12 feet.
4. Landscaping. Single family cluster developments shall comply with the landscaping requirements specified in Section 10-282 (including 10-282.1 through 10-282.6).
5. Transition in Density. Where the parcel proposed for use as a cluster development abuts a conventional single family development, the cluster development shall be designed to provide an orderly transition between the two developments. Such a transition may be achieved by providing a buffer zone consisting of any of the following: open space, additional landscaping, berms, changes in topography, or similar measures.
6. Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be provided along all public and private roads within the cluster development.
7. Utility Connections. Each dwelling unit shall be separately connected and metered for City water and sewer service.
E. Determination of Eligibility. The application for cluster development shall include documentation that the proposal satisfies one or more of the eligibility criteria set forth in subsection B.1. The Planning Commission shall make a preliminary determination whether the proposal qualifies for the cluster option, based on the submitted documentation.
F. Effect of Preliminary Eligibility Determination. Preliminary determination by the Planning Commission that a parcel qualifies for cluster development does not assure approval of the site plan. Such a determination, however, does give the applicant the opportunity to proceed further with site plan review.

Section 10.262 Planned Unit Developments
A. Intent.
1. The intent of this section is to provide, through the use of the planned unit development (PUD) concept, an added degree of flexibility in the density, placement, bulk and interrelation of buildings and uses, and the implementation of new design concepts so as to encourage a more efficient and innovative use of land and public services and the preservation of natural features through the use of a unified, flexible, planning approach, while at the same time maintaining adequate amounts of light, air, access and required open space and facilitating the economical provisions of public services and utilities. To further this intent, the respective zoning district regulations may be waived by City Council, as part of a PUD, after recommendation of the Planning Commission and as provided for in this section. The general boundaries of any PUD approved by Council shall be indicated on the Zoning Map as information for zoning purposes.
2. The PUD shall not be used for the sole purpose of avoiding the requirements for dimensional variances involving uses that would already be permitted in the underlying zoning district(s).
3. The development permitted under this section shall be considered as an optional means of development. The availability of this option imposes no obligation on the City to approve a proposed PUD.
B. Eligibility Criteria. The following provisions shall apply to all PUDs:
1. A PUD may be applied for in any zoning district. A PUD application shall require a rezoning by way of an amendment to this ordinance upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission and approval by City Council.
Adequate public health, safety, and welfare protection mechanisms shall be designed into the PUD to ensure the compatibility of varied land uses both within and outside the development for any land use or mix of land uses authorized in this ordinance, which may be included in a PUD.
2. A PUD zoning classification may only be approved in conjunction with an approved PUD site plan.
3. The PUD shall result in a recognizable and substantial benefit to the ultimate users of the project and to the community, and shall result in a higher quality of development than could be achieved under conventional zoning.
4. The proposed type and density of use shall not: result in an unreasonable increase in the use of public services, facilities and utilities; create a demand that exceeds the capacity of utilities; and place an unreasonable burden upon the subject site, surrounding land, property owners and occupants, or the natural environment.
5. The proposed PUD shall not have an adverse impact upon the City's Master Plan. Notwithstanding this requirement, the City may approve a PUD proposal that includes uses or residential density which are not called for in the Master Plan, provided that the City Council, upon receiving a recommendation from the Planning
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 II-31
Commission, determines that such a deviation from the Master Plan is justified in light of the current planning and development objectives of the City.
However, upon approval of a PUD, the Planning Commission shall initiate action where necessary to amend the Master Plan so that the Future Land Use map designation is consistent with the approved PUD.
6. The proposed PUD shall not result in an unreasonable negative economic impact upon surrounding properties.
7. The proposed PUD shall preserve distinctive natural features on the site to the maximum extent feasible, such as, but not limited to: woodlands, wetlands, rolling topography, natural drainage courses, etc. PUDs shall comply with all of the City's ordinances that protect natural features
8. The proposed PUD shall either: be under single ownership or control such that there is a single person or entity having responsibility for assuring completion of the project in conformity with this chapter, or if there is more than one (1) owner or entity with an interest in the project, then there shall be a commitment in writing by each owner and/or entity to work in unison to complete the project in complete conformity with this chapter.
The applicant(s) shall provide legal documentation of single ownership, single control, or joint unified control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and deed restrictions which indicate that the development can be completed as shown on the plans, and further, that all portions of the development that are not to be maintained or operated at public expense will continue to be operated and maintained by the developers or their successors. These legal documents shall bind all development successors in title to any commitments made as a part of the documents. This provision shall not prohibit a transfer of ownership or control, provided notice of such transfer is given to the Building Department.
C. Amendment Required. The approval of a PUD application shall constitute an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance to revise the Zoning Map and designate the subject property as Planned Unit Development (PUD). Approval granted under this section, including all aspects of the final site plan and conditions imposed on it, shall constitute an inseparable part of the zoning amendment.
D. Permitted Uses: Any land use authorized in this Zoning Ordinance may be included in a PUD as a principal or accessory use, provided that:
1. The predominant use on the site, based on acreage, shall be consistent with the uses specified for the parcel(s) on the City's Future Land Use Map and Zoning Map. Where the predominant uses are not consistent, prior to PUD approval an amendment to the Future Land Use Map may be required and an amendment to the Zoning Map may be required, as noted in item 5., below.
2. There shall be a reasonably harmonious relationship between the location of buildings on the site relative to buildings on lands in the surrounding area.
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 II-32
3. Residential, neighborhood commercial, office, and public uses may be developed together in a PUD, provided the uses are compatible and complementary, demonstrating good site design and planning principles.
4. The mix of uses and the arrangement of those uses within a PUD shall not impair the public health, safety, welfare, or quality of life of residents or the community as a whole.
5. Where the existing underlying zoning district is residential, nonresidential uses may be permitted as a part of a PUD provided that such nonresidential uses occupy a maximum of twenty percent (20%) of the buildable acreage of the site, subject to the following conditions:
a. The mix of uses must be consistent with the planned uses on the Future Land Use Map.
b. An amendment to the Zoning Map to change the underlying zoning shall be required prior to final PUD approval if more than twenty percent (20%) of the acreage in a residential PUD is proposed to be occupied by nonresidential uses.
c. For the purposes of this paragraph (D), nonresidential uses may include, but is not limited to: commercial, office, research, public (e.g., library, post office, municipal facilities), and recreational.
E. Review Procedures.
1. Pre-Application Meeting. In order to facilitate review of a PUD proposal in a timely manner, the applicant is highly encouraged to schedule an informal pre application conference with the City Manager, City Planner, City Engineer, City Attorney, and staff. The purpose of such a conference is to provide information and guidance to the applicant that will assist in preparation of the application and supporting materials.
The applicant shall present at such a conference or conferences, at minimum, a conceptual plan of the proposed planned development, consisting of the sketch plan information required in Section 10-763.
No formal action shall be taken at a pre application conference. At any time during the course of preparation of plans prior to submission of a formal application, the City shall upon request provide information concerning Zoning Ordinance procedures and standards.
2. PUD Plan Review. PUD projects are required to undergo a review process by the Planning Commission and City Council in order to facilitate a complete and thorough review prior to final approval. This requirement is deemed necessary because PUD projects are generally large or complex projects with higher intensity development that could have a major impact on surrounding land uses and significantly affect the health, safety and general welfare of City residents.
a. Planning Commission PUD Review and Recommendation. A public hearing on the PUD shall be held by the Planning Commission at its review. The
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 II-33
public hearing shall be noticed in accordance with Section 10-780(B). After the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to City Council of approval, approval with modifications, or denial of the PUD application. If the application is incomplete or requires additional information, the Planning Commission may defer action on the application until the proper information has been submitted.
b. City Council PUD Review and Final Action. Following receipt of the Planning Commissions review recommendation, the application shall be placed on the City Councils next available meeting agenda. The City Council shall review the PUD plan, together with the findings of the Planning Commission and the Planning Commission minutes, and the reports from the City Planner, City Engineer, City Attorney, and other review agencies. The site plan must meet the approval criteria of Section 10-762(C) and 10-764, and the uses in the PUD must meet the approval criteria of Section 10-782. Following completion of its review, the City Council shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the PUD application. If the City Council determines that there is additional information needed to make a decision, then the Council may defer the application to a subsequent meeting and/or remand the case to the Planning Commission for further review.
c. PUD Agreement. If the City Council approves the PUD proposal, the City and applicant shall execute a PUD agreement, which shall be recorded in the office of the Wayne County Register of Deeds. Final approval of the PUD shall become effective upon recording of the agreement. Evidence of the recorded agreement shall be submitted to the City, whereupon the designation on the Zoning Map will be changed to PUD.
d. Effect of Approval.
1) Approval of a PUD proposal shall constitute an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance. All improvements and use of the site shall be in conformity with the PUD amendment and any conditions imposed. Notice of the adoption of the amendment shall be published by the City in accordance with the requirements set forth in this ordinance.
2) Approval of a PUD application by Council confers on the applicant and any subsequent owners of the planned unit development property the right to utilize the property included as part of the approved PUD in accordance with the approved site plan. However, for the total PUD or for each portion of the PUD, if phasing of development is planned, a site plan review is required for each phase in accordance with Section 10.262, prior to the issuance of building permits, and for any portion of the PUD having an approved site plan, in accordance with said Section 10.262, the approved site plan shall take precedence over any previously-approved plan.
3) The Building Superintendent shall inspect the development at each stage to ensure reasonable compliance with the conditions of the approved planned unit development or approved site plans, as applicable.

Section 10-281 Screening Requirements.
In order to provide adequate protective screening for residential areas adjacent to or near non-residential areas, the following regulations shall apply:
A. Where a C-1, C-2, O-1 or RO-1 District abuts directly upon an R-1 or R-2 District, a landscaped greenbelt shall be provided and maintained along its entire length of the users of C-1, C-2, O-1 or RO-1 zoned property. In addition, those districts shall be screened from such contiguous, residentially zoned district by either a building housing a permitted use or else by a solid, ornamental masonry wall five (5) feet in height above grade between the required greenbelt area and the commercial use in the C-1, C-2, O-1 or RO-1 District. Such greenbelt shall be a strip of land not less than 15 feet in width which is planted and maintained with evergreens, such as spruce, pines or firs at least five (5) feet in height so as to create a permanent buffer within one (1) year following approval of the development by the City.
If, in the opinion of the City Planning Commission, the greenbelt would serve no good purpose, the Zoning Board of Appeals may waive such requirement and provide only the wall between the residential and C-1, C-2, O-1 or RO-1 District.
The remainder of the landscaped area which is not planted with evergreens as provided in the preceding sub-section shall be in well-kept lawns. All landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition, neat and orderly in appearance. All planting plans shall be
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 II-41
first submitted to the City Planning Commission for approval as to suitability of planting materials and arrangements thereof in accordance with the provisions of the preceding sub-section.
When vehicle(s) or open air display generally exceed a five (5) foot height, the wall shall be increased to a height necessary to screen the vehicle(s) or open air display, but not exceeding 10 feet. All such walls shall be of uniform height around the premises and approval of the design of such wall by the City Planning Commission is required.
B. Where required walls are provided on the business side of public alleys, wall requirements may be waived to provide necessary entrance to or exit from required off-street parking and loading areas; provided, that approval is secured from the Zoning Board of Appeals as to the suitability of the width and location of such openings in the wall.

Section 10-282 Landscaping Requirements - Statement of Purpose.
A. Intent. Landscaping enhances the visual image of the City, improving property values and alleviating the impact of noise, traffic, and visual distraction associated with certain uses. Screening is important to protect less intensive uses from the noise, light, traffic, litter and other impacts of more intensive, nonresidential uses. Accordingly, these provisions are intended to set minimum standards for the design and use of landscaping, greenbelts, and screening, and for the protection and enhancement of the City's environment. More specifically, the intent of these provisions is to:
1. Improve the appearance of off-street parking areas, vehicular use areas, and property abutting public rights-of-way, and
2. Protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of the neighborhoods which abut non-residential areas, parking areas, and other intensive use areas, thereby protecting the public health, safety and welfare, and
3. Protect the character, appearance and value of land and neighborhoods through the judicious and thoughtful use of landscaping, screening and buffering techniques that present a finished and aesthetically pleasing appearance, preserve environmental quality, and enhance the appearance of the City, thereby reducing conditions that lead to blight, and
4. Establish landscaping that guide and orient traffic flow within a site, and separate and protect pedestrian areas from vehicular encroachment, and
5. Encourage flexibility, creativity and innovation in landscape site design, including the incorporation of existing vegetation, topography and other site features into the design and placement of landscaping, and
6. Buffer the visual impact of parking lots, storage areas and similar activities from street rights-of-way and adjacent properties, provide adequate protective screening for residential uses adjacent to or near business zoning districts or uses, and establish minimum standards for the design, installation and maintenance of landscaping, screening and buffer areas between uses, and
7. Establish realistic and achievable objectives for the screening or buffering of uses of a significantly different scale or character, and the enhancement of individual sites, street rights-of-way and other areas of the City through appropriate landscaping.
B. Scope of Application. No site plan shall be approved unless it shows landscaping consistent with the requirements of this Section. A building permit shall not be issued until the required landscape plan is submitted and approved, and a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless provisions set forth in this section have been met or a performance guarantee has been posted in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 10-740.
C. Minimum Requirements. The requirements in this Section are minimum requirements, and under no circumstances shall they preclude the developer and the City from agreeing to more extensive landscaping.
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 II-43
D. Design Creativity. Creativity in landscape design is encouraged. Accordingly, required trees and shrubs may be planted at uniform distances, at random, or in groupings, depending on the designer's desired visual effect and, equally important, the intent of the City to coordinate landscaping on adjoining properties.
Section 10-282.1 General Landscaping Requirements.
A. General Site Requirements. All developed portions of the site shall conform to the following general landscaping standards, except for specific street and parking lot landscaping requirements or where specific landscape elements, such as a greenbelt, berms, or screening are required:

A. The public benefit intended by the landscape regulations could be better-achieved with a plan that varies from the strict requirements of the Ordinance, and
B. 1. Topographic features or other unique features of the site create conditions such that strict application of the landscape regulations would result in a less effective screen than an alternative landscape design, or
2. Parking, vehicular circulation, or land use are such that required landscaping would not enhance the site or result in the desired screening effect.
Section 10-290 Architectural and Site Design Standards General.
A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of the architectural and site design standards is to develop compatibility and continuity among buildings in the community and to provide minimum design standards intended to enhance the appearance of the community. Buildings, parking lots, lighting, signs, landscaping, and other site and architectural design elements have a strong influence on the character and appearance of the community. Site and building designs that meet minimum quality standards contribute to the attractiveness and economic well-being and public welfare of a community, making it a better place to live and work.
B. Projects Subject to Architectural and Site Design Standards. In addition to the standards of Section 10-761 and 10-762, all site plans for the erection of any buildings and structures or site improvements, including but not limited to parking lot improvements and landscaping, shall meet the following minimum appearance standards. All new construction requiring a Building Permit and/or Zoning Compliance Permit, including additions to existing structures and any renovations visible from the exterior of the building or structure, shall be subject to architectural and site design standards, except for single family residential uses, which are subject to Residential Architectural Design Standards set forth in Section 10-136B.
C. Special Provisions for Existing Sites. Special provision is made for applying these standards to developed sites which existed prior to adoption of architectural and site design standards. When an existing site is undergoing improvement, change in use, expansion or reoccupation, the objective of these standards is to bring the site into compliance with the minimum standards of this section as much as reasonably possible.
When reviewing plans for a change in use or expansion which requires site plan review, zoning compliance permit, or building permit, the administrative official or body reviewing the plan shall require compliance with all applicable landscaping requirements for the entire site. All other architectural and site design standards contained herein shall apply to the portion of the building or site proposed to be changed or expanded.

ARTICLE III - NONCONFORMITIES
Section 10-300 General.
Nonconformities are uses, structures or lots that were permitted by the regulations in effect of the time they were created, but which do not conform to one or more provisions of this Chapter.
Section 10-301 Change in Tenancy or Ownership.
There may be a change in tenancy, ownership, or management of an existing nonconforming use, provided there is no change in the nature or character of such nonconforming use.
Section 10-302 City Acquisition of Nonconformities.
The City Planning Commission may from time to time recommend to the City Council the acquisition by purchase, condemnation, or otherwise private property or an interest in private property as does not conform in use or structure to the regulations and restrictions of the various districts defined in this Chapter and the removal of such use or structure.
The City Planning Commission shall submit its reasons and estimates of cost and expenses of such acquisition and removal of the non-conformity and probable resale price of the property to be acquired after removal of the non-conformity as obtained from the appropriate City department, board or commission. The City Planning Commission shall recommend that portion of the difference between the estimated cost of acquisition and removal of the nonconformity and the probable resale price which in their opinion should be assessed against a benefited district.
Whenever the City Council has under advisement the acquisition by purchase, condemnation, or otherwise as provided by law of any non-conforming building, structure or use, a preliminary public hearing thereon shall be held before the City Council. Not less than 15 days before the hearing, a notice of time, place and purpose of such public hearing shall be published in a paper circulating in the City and the City Clerk shall send by mail addressed to the respective owners of any such properties and properties within 300 feet at the addresses given in the last assessment roll, a written notice of time, place and purpose of such hearing. If the cost and expense or any portion thereof is to be assessed to a special district, the City Assessor shall be directed to furnish the City Council with a tentative special assessment district and the tentative plan of assessment, the names of the respective owners of the property in such district and addresses of such owners in the last assessment roll. The City Clerk shall also send the notice to the respective owners in the tentative assessment district.
Whenever the City Council, after a public hearing as required shall declare by resolution that proceedings be instituted for the acquisition of any property on which is located a nonconforming building, structure or use in accordance with the laws of the State, the Charter, this Chapter and other applicable ordinances of the City, the City Clerk shall send by registered mail a certified copy of such resolution to the respective owners of the properties and to the owners of the properties in any special assessment district, at the address given in the last assessment roll.
Upon the passing of title to the private property so acquired as provided in the preceding section to the City, the City Council shall cause the discontinuance or removal of the nonconforming use or the removal, demolition or remodeling of the nonconforming structure. The City Council shall thereafter order such property sold or otherwise disposed of, but only for a conforming use.
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 III-2
The City Council shall confirm the cost and the expense of such project and report any assessable cost to the City Assessor who shall then prepare an assessment roll in the manner provided for in the Charter, Code and other applicable ordinance of the City. Such an assessment roll may, in the discretion of the City Council, be in one (1) or more but not to exceed five (5) annual installments.
Nonconforming Uses
Section 10-310 Nonconforming Uses, General.
Any lawful non-conforming use existing at the time of passage of this Ordinance may be continued, provided, however, that except in the case of dwellings or farm buildings, the building or the lot or land involved shall neither be structurally altered, repaired nor enlarged unless such revised structure shall conform to the provisions of this Chapter for the district in which it is located. Provided further, that this Section shall not prohibit structural alterations required by law.
Section 10-311 Nonconforming Use of Land.
Where at the time of passage of this Chapter, lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Chapter, and where such use involves no individual structure with an assessed value exceeding $500.00, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful provided:
A. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment to this Ordinance.
B. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment to this Ordinance.
C. If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 12 months, any subsequent use of such land or parcel shall conform to the regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which such use is located.
D. No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this Chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
Section 10-312 Nonconforming Use of Structure.
If lawful use involving individual structures with an assessed value of $500.00 or more or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption of this Chapter that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 III-3
B. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this Chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building.
C. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use, or to a use permitted in a district of greater restrictions, it shall no thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
D. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the entire structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of land.
E. If any such nonconforming use of a structure ceases for any reason for a period of more than 12 months, any subsequent use of such structure shall conform to the regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which such structure is located.
F. A zoning compliance permit and, as may be required in the particular zoning district involved, site plan review shall be required before any existing nonconforming use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
Section 10-313 Forfeiture of Right to Continue Nonconforming Use.
When nonconforming use of property is discontinued through vacancy, lack of operation, or other similar condition, for a period of 12 months or more, thereafter no right shall exist to maintain on said property a nonconforming use unless the Zoning Board of Appeals grants such privilege within six (6) months after such discontinuance. No nonconforming use, if changed to a use permitted in the district in which it is located, shall be resumed or changed back to a nonconforming use.
Nonconforming Structures
Section 10-320 Nonconforming Structures, General.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption of this Chapter that could not be built under the terms of this Chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its non-conformity.
B. Should such structure be moved for any reason whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
C. If any such non-conforming structure ceases being used for any reason for a period of more than 12 months, any subsequent use of such structure shall conform to the regulations specified by this Ordinance for the district in which such structure is located.

Section 10-322 Nonconforming Structures - Reconstruction.
Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the reconstruction, repair or restoration and the continued use of any nonconforming building or structure damaged by fire, collapse, explosion, Acts of God or acts or public enemy, subsequent to the effective date of this Chapter, wherein the expense of such reconstruction does not exceed 30 percent of the State Equalized Valuation of the entire building or structure at the time such damage occurred; provided that such violation shall be subject to the approval of the Building Inspector whose decision shall be subject to the Zoning Board of Appeals, and provided that such restoration and resumption shall take place within six (6) months of the time of such damage and that it be completed within one (1) year from time of such damage, and provided further, that said use be identical with the nonconforming use permitted and in effect directly preceding said damage.

Nonconforming Lots
Section 10-330 Nonconforming Lots, General.

City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 III-5
Section 10-332 Single Family Lots of Record.
In any district which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Chapter, a single family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Chapter, provided such lot is located in a block on which 51 percent or more of the lots on both sides of the street are occupied by single family dwellings. Where 51 percent or more of the existing homes are built upon a larger lot or combination of lots, a building permit will not be granted for a lot of less area or width than the size of the lots of the majority of the dwellings existing at the time of passage of this Chapter. In those areas where less than 51 percent of the lots are built upon in a one (1) block area, the provisions regarding the use of combined lots shall apply. Permission to use a single nonconforming lot as herein provided shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which lot is located. Provided, however, lots of 45 feet or less width of a plat officially approved and recorded prior to the adoption of this Chapter shall have two side yards each having a width of not less than four (4) feet and an aggregate width of not less than 12 feet.

ARTICLE V - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Section 10-500 Performance Standards, General.
A. Intent.
The purpose of this Article is to establish controls on the impacts generated by permitted uses so as to prevent an unreasonable negative impact that might interfere with another person's use of his or her property, or that might cause harm to the public health, safety, and welfare.
B. Scope of Application.
1. After the effective date of this Ordinance, no structure or tract of land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no structure, or part thereof, shall be erected, altered, reconstructed, or moved, except in conformity with all applicable performance standards set forth in this Article.
2. No activity, operation or use of land, buildings, or equipment shall be permitted if such activity, operation, or use produces an environmental impact or irritant to sensory perception which exceeds the standards set forth in this Article.
3. No site plan shall be approved unless evidence is presented to indicate conformity with the requirements of this Article.
C. Submission of Additional Data.
Nothing in this Article shall preclude the applicant or other interested party from submitting additional data or evidence related to a specific case. In consideration of such data or evidence, the Planning Commission may waive or modify the regulations set forth in this Article, provided that the Planning Commission finds that no harm to the public health, safety and welfare will result and that the intent of the this Chapter will be upheld.
Section 10-501 Procedures for Determining Compliance.
In the event that the City receives complaints or otherwise acquires evidence of possible violation of any of the performance standards set forth in this Article, the following procedures shall be used to investigate, and if necessary, resolve the violation:
A. Official Investigation.
Upon receipt of evidence of possible violation, the Building Inspector shall make a determination whether there is reasonable cause to suspect the operation is indeed in violation of the performance standards. The Building Inspector may initiate an official investigation in order to make such a determination.
Upon initiation of an official investigation, the Building Inspector is empowered to require the owner or operator of the facility in question to submit data along with any evidence deemed necessary to make an objective determination regarding the possible violation within a time period specified by the Building Inspector, but in every case a reply must be
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 V-2
forthcoming within three (3) calendar days from the receipt of notice. Failure of the owner or operator to supply requested data within the stated time period shall be considered an admission of violation and provide prima facia evidence of grounds for taking any action, including legal action, to terminate the use and/or deny or cancel any permits or licenses required for continued use of the land. Data which may be required includes, but is not limited to the following:
1. Plans of the existing or proposed facilities, including buildings and equipment.
2. A description of the existing or proposed machinery, processes, and products.
3. Specifications for the mechanisms and techniques used or proposed to be used to control emissions regulated under the provisions of this Article.
4. Measurement of the amount or rate of emissions of the material, including but not limited to, heat, sound, and glare, purported to be in violation.
5. Copies of studies, reports, specifications, and any other compilation of data.
B. Method and Cost of Determination.
The Building Inspector shall take measurements, or cause measurements to be taken by a competent contractor, and complete investigation necessary to make an objective determination concerning the purported violation. Where required measurements and investigation can be accurately made by the Building Inspector using equipment and personnel normally available to the City without extraordinary expense, such measurements and investigation may be completed before notice of violation is issued. If necessary, skilled personnel and specialized equipment or instruments shall be secured in order to make the required determination.
If the alleged violation is found to exist in fact, the costs of making such determination shall be charged against those responsible, in addition to such other penalties as may be allowable. If the bill is not paid within 30 days, the City shall take whatever appropriate action is necessary to recover such costs, or alternately, the cost shall be charged against the property where the violation occurred. If it is determined that no substantive violation exists, then the costs of this determination shall be paid by the City.
C. Appropriate Remedies.
If, after appropriate investigation, the Building Inspector determines that a violation does exist, the Building Inspector shall take or cause to be taken lawful action as provided by this Ordinance or any State or Federal regulation to eliminate such violation. The owners or operators of the facility deemed responsible shall be given written notice of the violation. The Building Inspector shall take appropriate action in accordance with the owner or operator's response to the notice of violation. Appropriate action includes the following:
1. Correction of Violation within Time Limit
If the alleged violation is corrected within the specified time limit, even if there is no reply to the notice, the Building Inspector shall note "Violation Corrected" on the City's copy of the notice, and the notice shall be retained on file. If
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 V-3
necessary, the Building Inspector may take other action as may be warranted by the circumstances of the case, pursuant to this Ordinance and any other applicable regulation.
2. Violation Not Corrected and No Reply from Owner or Operator
If there is no reply from the owner or operator within the specified time limits, and the alleged violation is not corrected in accordance with the regulations set forth in this Article, then the Building Inspector shall take any action reasonably calculated to correct or abate the violation.
3. Reply Requesting Extension of Time
If the alleged violator responds to the City within the specified time limit of the original notice and requests an extension of time, the Building Inspector shall review the information submitted with the reply. Upon finding that an extension is warranted because of unique circumstances and that an extension will not cause imminent peril to life, health, or property, the Building Inspector may extend the specified time limit to a date certain, if the Building Inspector concurs that:
a. The information requested pursuant to Section 10-502 (A) is impractical to readily produce, or
b. An extreme hardship exists, or
c. The reply indicates that an alleged violation shall be corrected or abated by the date certain and that all future operations shall comply with the regulations as set forth herein.
4. Reply Requesting Technical Determination
If a reply is received within the specified time limit requesting further review and technical analysis even though the alleged violations continue, then the Building Inspector may call in properly qualified experts to complete such analysis and confirm or refute the initial determination of violation.
If expert findings indicate that violations of the performance standards do exist in fact, the costs incurred in making such a determination shall be paid by the persons responsible for the violations, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate under the terms of this Ordinance or other applicable regulations. Such costs shall be billed to those owners or operators of the subject use who are deemed responsible for the violation. If the bill is not paid within 30 days, the City shall take whatever appropriate action is necessary to recover such costs, or alternately, the cost shall be charged against the property where the violation occurred. If no substantial violation is found, cost of determination shall be paid by the City.
D. Continued Violation.
If, after the conclusion of the time period granted for compliance, the Building Inspector finds that the violation still exists, any permits previously issued shall be void and the City may initiate appropriate legal action, including possible pursuit of remedies in Circuit Court.

Section 10-770 Special Land Uses.
The City Council, as herein created, shall have the following specific powers and duties concerning special approvals.
A. Purpose
In hearing and deciding upon special approvals, the City Council shall base its actions on the theory that the development and execution of a comprehensive zoning ordinance is founded upon the division of the City into districts within which districts the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are variations in the nature of special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such special uses fall into two categories:
1. Uses either municipally operated or operated by publicly regulated utilities or uses traditionally affected with a public interest; and,
2. Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
B. Authorization
The special approval of specific land uses and activities, as required under Sections 10-613, 10-623, 10-633, 10-643, 10-653, 10-663, 10-673, and 10-683 (as appropriate)
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 VII-13
may be authorized by the City Council provided that no application for special approval shall be acted upon by the City Council until after (1) a written recommendation is prepared and filed with the City Council by the City Planning Commission, which report shall become a part of the record, and (2) a public hearing is held by the Council.
C. Application
An application for special approval for a land use shall be filed and processed in the manner prescribed for application for site plan review in Sections 10-760 through 10-764 and shall be in such form and accompanied by such information as shall be established from time to time by the City Council. Any application for special approval shall be filed simultaneously with an application for site plan review for the subject use.
D. Notice of Request for Special Approval
Notice of a request for special approval of a land use shall be in the form of one (1) notice published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, plus a notice sent by mail or by personal delivery to the owners of property for which approval is being considered, to all persons whom real property is assessed within 300 feet of the boundary of the property in questions, and to the occupants of all structures within 300 feet, except that the notice shall be given notless than 15 days before the application will be considered. If the name of the occupant is not known, the term "occupant" may be given to more than one (1) occupant of a structure, except that if a structure contains more than one (1) dwelling unit or spatial area owned or leased by different individuals, partnerships, businesses or organizations, one (1) occupant of each unit or spatial area shall receive notice. In the case of a single structure containing more than four (4) dwelling units or other distinct spatial areas owned or leased by different individuals, partnerships, businesses, or organizations, notice may be given to the manager or owner of the structure who shall be requested to post the notice at the primary entrance to the structure. The notice shall:
1. Describe the nature of the special land use request.
2. Indicate the property which is the subject of the special land use request, including the street address(es) involved in the request.
3. State when and where the special land use request will be considered.
4. Indicate when and where written comments will be received concerning the request.
5. Indicate that a public hearing on the special land use request may be requested by a property owner or the occupant of a structure located within 300 feet of the boundary of the property being considered for a special use.
E. Hearing
At the initiative of the City Council, or upon the request of the applicant for special approval of a land use, or a property owner or the occupant of a structure located within 300 feet of the boundary of the property being considered for a special land use, a public hearing with notification as required for a notice of a request for special land use
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 VII-14
approval as provided in subsection (D of this section shall be held before a decision on the special approval request which is based on discretionary grounds. If the applicant or the City Council requests a public hearing, only notification of the public hearing need be made. A decision on a special approval request which is based on discretionary grounds shall not be made unless notification or the request for special approval, or notification of a public hearing on a special approval request is given as required by this section.
F. Standards
No special approval shall be granted by the City Council unless the special use:
1. Will promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner for those persons who will use the proposed land use or activity; for those land- owners and residents who are adjacent; and for the City as a whole.
2. Is necessary for the public convenience at the location.
3. Is compatible with adjacent uses of land.
4. Is so designed, located and proposed to be operated that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected.
5. Can be adequately served by public services and facilities without diminishing or adversely effecting public services and facilities to existing land uses in the area.
6. Will not cause injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is to be located.
7. Will protect the natural environment and help conserve natural resources and energy.
8. Is within the provisions of uses requiring special approval as set forth in the various zoning districts herein, is in harmony with the purposes and conforms to the applicable regulations of the zoning district in which it is to be located, and meets applicable site design standards for each use specified in Sections 10-241 through 10-259.
9. Is related to the valid exercise of the City's police power and purposes which are affected by the proposed use or activity.
G. Approval
City Council may deny, approve, or approve with conditions, request for special approval of a land use. The decision on a special approval shall be incorporated in a statement of conclusions relative to the specific land use under consideration. The decision shall specify the basis for the decision, and any conditions imposed. Any approval given by the City Council under which premises are not used or work is not started within six (6) months or when such use or work has been abandoned for a period of six (6) months, shall lapse and cease to be in effect.
City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 VII-15
H. Record
The conditions imposed with respect to the special approval of a land use or activity shall be recorded in the record of the special approval action and shall remain unchanged except upon the mutual consent of the City Council and the landowner. The City Council shall maintain a record of charges granted in conditions. (Amended, Ord. 295)

City of Harper Woods Zoning Ordinance
July, 2013 VIII-2
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall interpret the provisions of this Chapter in such a way as to enforce the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the map fixing the several zoning districts, in those cases where the street layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the aforesaid map.

C. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to permit variations in the requirements for outer courts in dwellings and to permit such variation or modification of yard, lot area, percentage of lot coverage and floor area requirements as may be necessary to secure the appropriate improvement of a parcel of land which was of such size, shape or dimension or which has such peculiar or exceptional geographical or topographical conditions that it cannot be appropriately improved without such variation or modification; provided, that the purpose and spirit of this Chapter shall be observed, the public safety secured and substantial justice done.
D. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to permit the erection and use of a building or an addition to an existing building of a public service corporation to be used for public utility purposes in any permitted district to a larger area than the district requirements established in this Chapter and permit the location in any district of a public utility building, structure or use provided that the Zoning Board of Appeals shall find such use, area, building or structure reasonably necessary for the public convenience and service and that such building, structure or use is designed, erected and landscaped to conform harmoniously with the general architecture and plan of such district.
