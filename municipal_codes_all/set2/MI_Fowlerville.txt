PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Fowlerville, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Compilation of Ordinances, as supplemented through Ordinance Number 289, effective December 12, 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the village council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLES SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Chantal Parker, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Laura Eisele, Village Clerk and David Stoker, Village Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

Sec. 1-8. - Severability. 
    If any provision or section of this Code shall be held unconstitutional or invalid, such holding shall not be construed as affecting the validity of any of the remaining provisions or sections of this Code, it being the intent of the village council that this Code shall stand, notwithstanding the invalidity of any provision or section thereof. This section shall apply to the amendment of any section of this Code, whether or not the wording of this section is set forth in the amendatory ordinance. 
Sec. 1-9. - Amendments to Code. 
(a)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code shall be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code in the following language: "That section _____ of the Code of Ordinances, Village of Fowlerville, Michigan (or Fowlerville Village Code), is hereby amended to read as follows:...." The new provisions shall then be set out in full as desired. 
(b)  If a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language shall be used: "That the Code of Ordinances, Village of Fowlerville, Michigan (or Fowlerville Village Code), is hereby amended by adding a section, to be numbered _____, which section reads as follows:...." The new section shall then be set out in full as desired. 
(c)  If a section is to be repealed, the following language shall be used: "That the Code of Ordinances, Village of Fowlerville, Michigan (or Fowlerville Village Code), is hereby amended by deleting a section, numbered _____." 
Sec. 1-10. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by village personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the village council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-11. - Altering Code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the Code to be misrepresented thereby. Any person violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-12. 
Sec. 1-12. - General penalty for violation of Code; continuing violations. 
(a)  Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this Code for any particular provision or section, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of this Code or any rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance of this Code shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500.00 and costs of prosecution or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each act of violation and every day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any section of this Code, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. 
(b)  In addition to the penalty prescribed in subsection (a) of this section, the village may pursue other remedies such as enforcement of a civil infraction, abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
State Law reference- Limitation on penalties, MCL 66.2, MSA 5.1272. 
Sec. 1-13. - General sanction for municipal civil infractions. 
(a)  As used in this section, the term "violation" includes any act which is prohibited or made or declared to be unlawful or an offense by this Code or any village ordinance, and any omission or failure to act where the act is required by this Code or any village ordinance. 
(b)  Unless otherwise specifically provided by any section of this Code or any village ordinance, for a particular municipal civil infraction violation the civil fine for a violation shall be $50.00 for each infraction. 
(c)  Increased civil fines shall be imposed for repeated violations by a person of any requirement or provision of any section of this Code or any ordinance. As used in this subsection, the term "repeat offense" means a second or any subsequent municipal civil infraction violation of the same requirement or provision (i) committed by a person within any six-month period, unless some other period is specifically provided by any section of this Code or any ordinance, and (ii) for which the person admits responsibility or is determined to be responsible. Unless otherwise specifically provided by any section of this Code or any ordinance for a particular municipal civil infraction violation, the increased fine for a repeat offense shall be as follows: 
(1)  For any offense which is a first repeat offense, the fine shall be $250.00. 
(2)  For any offense which is a second repeat offense or any subsequent repeat offense, the fine shall be $500.00. 
(3)  A copy of the schedule, as amended from time to time, shall be posted at the municipal ordinance violations bureau. 
(d)  Each day on which any violation of any section of this Code or village ordinance continues constitutes a separate offense and shall be subject to penalties or sanctions as a separate offense.

Secs. 2-181-2-184. - Reserved. 
Sec. 2-185. - Review and inspection expense reimbursements. 
(a)  Rationale and purpose. When individuals and entities seek reviews, inspections, and approvals for their private and individual benefit, depending upon the type of review, inspection, and/or approval involved, substantial costs and expenses may be incurred by the village for the work of the village professional consultants in determining whether approvals should be granted, and whether and the extent any conditions should be imposed, and to perform the necessary inspections. Therefore, it is the purpose of this section to protect the taxpayers of the village against the allocation of substantial sums of general fund moneys that would otherwise be expended for the singular benefit of the private individuals and entities seeking the reviews, inspections, and approvals. It is the policy of the village to secure payment for such reviews and inspections from the persons and entities seeking the special and singular benefit there from. 
(b)  General requirement and obligation. In circumstances in which the village is requested for an authorization, permission, permit selection of one person or entity over others, or other approval reasonably requiring a review by the village attorney, engineer, planner, or other professional review or inspection, the person or entity making the request for authorization, permission, selection, approval, or inspection, shall be obligated to advance the monies for such review or inspection. This shall expressly include, but not be limited to, any application for re-zoning, site plan approval, special land use permit, planned unit development, variance, or other use or activity requiring a permit under the village zoning ordinance; any application for a lot division or for plat approvals or amendments under the village subdivision control/land division ordinances; any application concerning granting or transferring of liquor licenses; any requests for construction of private streets or roads within the village; and private requests for water or sewer utility extensions or improvements. 
(c)  Amount of payment required. The amount of money required to be paid in escrow shall be set by council. For purposes of administering this section, the village council shall adopt one or more resolutions setting the fixed amount to be paid, in advance, by applicants seeking village review or inspection. The amount so established shall be based upon the amount reasonably estimated to be required to cover the anticipated fees, costs and expenses to be incurred in the reviews or inspections. 
(d)  Escrow amount if not stated in resolution. In the event a specific escrow amount has not been determined and specified by resolution for a particular purpose, the village manager shall estimate an amount to be placed in escrow with the village, in advance of the review(s) or inspection(s) being conducted. 
(e)  Charges. The village may charge the applicant and deduct from the escrow fund for all reasonable costs incurred by the village during and in connection with the review or inspection process and other related proceedings, whether or not the application or request is granted either in whole or in part. These costs may include, but shall not be limited to, village engineering fees, village attorney fees, village planning fees, fees and costs for services of outside consultants, fees and costs of other professionals who may assist the village, fees and costs for studies and reports pertaining to the matters in question, and other reasonable costs and expenses. The applicant will receive a copy of any written reports and statement of expenses for the professional services rendered, upon request. 
(f)  Collection and notice. The village treasurer shall collect the amounts as provided under subsections (c) and (d), and provide the village consultant notice of the receipt of the full amount of the escrowed funds in respect to each review or inspection. Upon receipt of such notice, the village consultant may then commence the review or inspection. 
(g)  Additional review and escrow. The village consultants shall keep records showing the work performed on each review or inspection, and the amount charged for such purposes, and, if the amount escrowed for any review or inspection, has been, or is likely to be, insufficient to cover the full amount of fees and costs of review or inspection, the village shall, from time-to-time, invoice the applicant, and the applicant shall pay additional amounts into escrow, as reasonably needed to proceed with and complete the review or inspection. The amount of additional payments required to be paid into escrow may be established by council resolution, and shall be based upon an estimate of the sum required to cover the anticipated costs and expenses to be incurred to complete the reviews and inspections. Work on the review or inspection shall be suspended until the additional payment has been escrowed. Upon receipt of the full amount of such additional escrow payment, the village treasurer shall provide notice of such receipt to the village consultant. 
(h)  Excess escrow funds. To the extent such an escrow fund exceeds the actual cost and expense of the reviews or inspections, as ultimately determined, the excess shall be returned to the person or entity that posted the escrow. If the village cannot locate such person or entity at the last known address, the excess escrow monies shall be disbursed as otherwise provided by law or ordinance. 
(i)  Qualifications for waiver. If a person does not have adequate funds to pay for the review, as required under this section, the fees may be waived by the village manager upon the filing of the following prior to the commencement of village review: 
(1)  An affidavit stating that the applicant is an indigent, and specifying under oath that such person does not have adequate real or personal property to pay or secure all or any part of the funds, and 
(2)  Such reasonable supporting documentation as may be requested by the village. In such event, the village shall pay the review fees to the village consultant out of general fund moneys, or from such other source as the village council shall determine. 
(j)  Appeal. In the event a person or entity called upon to pay or escrow monies under this section 2-185, disputes the costs of professional reviews or inspections, or feels aggrieved based upon the administration of such section, such person or entity may appeal the costs or decisions made in the administration of this section. An appeal must be taken within 21 days of the decision to be appealed by submitting a letter or other signed writing to the village clerk requesting the appeal. A copy of the appeal letter shall be provided to the village manager, who shall set a timely hearing and thereafter make a written report and recommendation on the appeal, which shall include the reasons for the conclusions reached. The report and recommendation shall be sent to the village council. If requested by the council at the meeting of the council held following distribution of the manager's recommendation, the appeal shall be placed on the agenda of the next available meeting of village council; and, after providing the person making the appeal and the village manager with the opportunity to be heard, the council shall make a final determination on the appeal, specifying its reasons for granting or denying the appeal. Unless the appeal is formally reviewed based upon the request of the council in the manner stated above, the manager's recommendation shall be deemed the final determination on the appeal.

A house trailer shall have an individual space identification number at least three inches in height on the side of the trailer facing the access road. The operator of the trailer park shall be responsible for assigning such numbers. If the house, dwelling, house trailer, business or structure is located on the property so that the posted numbers are not clearly readable from the roadway due to distance or intervening sight barriers, such as but not limited to shrubbery, terrain features or structures, the identification numbers shall also be posted separate from the main structure (i.e., on a yard light post, entrance gate, driveway marker, mailbox, etc.) in a fashion that is clearly readable from the adjacent roadway. Such additional identification numbers shall be either located centrally between the side boundaries of the property or located immediately adjacent to the driveway providing ingress to the property and shall be located on the same side of the adjacent roadway as the property it identifies. 
(b)  The property identification number or address shall consist of numbers not less than three inches in height. If the dwelling, house trailer, building, business or structure is located more than 90 feet from the centerline of the traveled portion of the adjacent roadway, the identifying numbers shall be not less than six inches in height, but the numbers shall be of a size sufficiently large so that the numbers are readable from the centerline of the adjacent roadway by a person of normal vision. 
(c)  The color of the numbers shall be in contrast with the immediate background on which they are mounted. 
(d)  For multiple units, either business or residential, the property identification numbers of those apartments or businesses accessible through each entrance shall be clearly indicated at such entrance. The purpose of this identification is to facilitate the rapid movement of emergency units to a specific apartment or business unit in apartment buildings or business complexes which have entrances bearing the same number and series of such units that are not accessible except through a specific entrance. 
(e)  The occupants of all buildings in the village used for commercial and/or industrial purposes that are connected with or located so close to other buildings as to prevent access between such buildings and which requires a different route of access to the rear than that to the front of the building shall cause the correct business name and street numbers to be placed on the rear entrance door or immediately adjacent thereto. Such names and numbers shall be not less than three or more than six inches in height and may consist of standard manufactured letters or numbers shall be applied with standard type numeral and letter stencil.

For addresses issued after the effective date of this ordinance, or when a building permit is required for any property due to new construction, then any applicable requirements of the Michigan State Construction Code, as amended, shall govern the display size requirements of address numbers on structures rather than the sizes called for in section 14-122 of this Code. Compliance with this article shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

In making its findings, as required in this section, the planning commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be recommended unless the planning commission finds after a public meeting all the following: 
(1)  There are such special circumstances or conditions affecting the property that the strict application of this article would clearly be impractical or unreasonable. In such cases the subdivider shall first state his reasons in writing as to the specific provision or requirement involved and submit them to the planning commission. 
(2)  The granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which the property is situated. 
(3)  The variance will not violate the provision of the land division act. 
(4)  The variance will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this article and the village master plan. 
(b)  The planning commission shall include its findings and the specific reasons therefor in its report of recommendations to the village council and shall also record its reasons and actions in its minutes.

The village manager may recommend to the village council a variance from this article upon a finding that undue hardship may result from strict compliance with specific sections or requirements of this article or that application of such section or requirement is impractical in the context of any other public improvements subject to this article. However, financial hardships alone are not grounds for granting a variance. Recommendations for variances shall be made only when it is deemed necessary or desirable for the public interest. In making its findings, as required in this section, the planning commission or village manager, as applicable, shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed development, and the probable effect of the development upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variance shall be recommended unless the planning commission or village manager, as applicable, finds all the following: 
a.  There are such special circumstances or conditions affecting the property that the strict application of this article would clearly be impractical or unreasonable. In such cases, the owner shall first state his or her reasons in writing as to the specific provision or requirement involved and submit them to the planning commission. 
b.  The granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which the property is situated. 
c.  As confirmed by the village engineer, the granting of the specified variance will not be incompatible with the village's public utility systems and will not create any unreasonable safety hazard. 
d.  The variance will not violate the provision of the Land Division Act. 
e.  The variance will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this article and the village master plan. 
(2)  The planning commission or village manager, as applicable, shall include their findings and the specific reasons therefor in the report of recommendations to the village council and, in the case of the planning commission, shall also record its reasons and actions in its minutes. 
(b)  Environmental, safety, topographical or physical limitation variances. Where, for a particular proposed development or public improvement, it can be shown that strict compliance with the requirements of this article would result in an environmental or safety hazard due to the specific physical conditions of the property involved, or an extraordinary hardship to the developer because of unusual topography, other physical conditions, or such other conditions that are not self-inflicted or that these conditions would result in inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of this article, the planning commission, village manager, or village engineer may recommend to the village council that variance modification or a waiver of this article be granted. This section shall expressly apply to situations in which the state department of environmental quality, the Livingston County drain commissioner, or a similar public entity has expressly indicated that strict compliance with the establish municipal standards may create environmental or safety hazard. 
(c)  Applications required. Under this article, application for any required public improvement variance or topographical variance shall be submitted in writing by the developer at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for the consideration of the planning commission in the case of proposed subdivisions; upon the submission of a proposed site plan in the case of site plans or planned unit developments; or upon request for approval of a proposed project plan in the case of other public improvements. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all the facts relied upon by the petitioner. 
(d)  Procedures. The concurring vote of a majority of the village council shall be necessary to grant a variance. 
(e)  Conditions. When granting the variance, the village council may authorize a lesser variance than that requested or may prescribe conditions and safeguards to satisfy the intent of this article. A variance granted shall become null and void unless the final plat, site plan, or public improvement shall have been approved by the village. A variance request shall not be resubmitted within one year from the date of the village council's action, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of changed conditions relating to the reasons for the denial of the original variance request found by the village council to be valid.

All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be made in the manner as provided for the original assessment except with regard to the correction of the proceedings for the purpose of making the proceedings legal.

Any surplus in the deposit amount over and above the construction costs shall be refunded to the owner or his agent. If the construction cost exceeds the deposit amount, the owner shall pay the excess amount, and no service connection shall be installed or water service rendered from the extension until the cost is paid in full.

When a water main extension has been constructed in accordance with such a petition, water tap connections to such extension shall be permitted only to serve premises for which the front foot charge was collected at the time of filing the petition. The owners of other property may, however, be permitted by the council to make connections to the main upon payment of sums respectively equal to charges paid by the petitioners, in which event the monies so received shall be repaid to the original petitioners. 
(4)  Special assessment. Water main extensions may also be constructed upon the council's approval through special assessments pursuant to article II of chapter 70 of this Code or through other applicable law or ordinances.

Whenever the council shall determine that it is in the best interests of the village water system to construct a water main extension, it shall construct such extension without the filing of any petition therefor or requiring any advance payment or deposit. After the completion of any such connecting water main extension, the council may cause premises abutting the street or way in which such connecting extension is laid to be assessed at a cost sufficient to pay all or part of the cost of the main extension.

    Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
    Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is also for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operations. These bypasses are not subject to subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the department of public works supervisor at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the department of public works supervisor of any unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The department of public works supervisor may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  (1) Bypass is prohibited, and the department of public works supervisor may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal period of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal period of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The department of public works supervisor may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the department of public works supervisor determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

Subdivision III. - Administrative Enforcement Remedies 

Sec. 82-481. - Notice of violation. 
    When the department of public works supervisor finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any section of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the department of public works supervisor may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, and explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the department of public works supervisor. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the department of public works supervisor to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(Ord. No. 316, § 10.1, eff. 10-27-1996) 
Sec. 82-482. - Consent orders. 
    The department of public works supervisor may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance with this article. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 82-484 and 82-485 and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(Ord. No. 316, § 10.2, eff. 10-27-1996) 
Sec. 82-483. - Show cause hearing. 
    The department of public works supervisor may order a user which has violated or continues to violate any section of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement to appear before the department of public works supervisor and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against or prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.

Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. For monthly or other longterm average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(b)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.8 percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(c)  A user desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the department of public works supervisor to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the department of public works supervisor may convene a hearing on the matter. If the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The department of public works supervisor may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and others, to the fine.

Sec. 82-487. - Emergency suspension. 
(a)  The department of public works supervisor may immediately suspend a user's wastewater discharge, after informal notice to the user, wherever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The department of public works supervisor may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or that presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
(b)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. If a user fails to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the department of public works supervisor may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individual. The department of public works supervisor may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the department of public works supervisor that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 82-488 are initiated against the user. 
(c)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the department of public works supervisor prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under section 82-483 or 82-488. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

DIVISION 3. - SEWER RATES AND CHARGES 

Sec. 82-721. - Established. 
    Charges for sewage transmission and treatment and disposal and debt service to each user connected to the system shall be as follows: 
(1)  Single-family premises. For each single-family residential premises or single-family residential equivalent served by the sanitary sewer system (15,000 gallons per quarter) there shall be a sewer service charge of an amount established by resolution of the village council. 
(2)  Schools. In lieu of debt service charges, schools shall be charged as set forth in the table of unit factors on file and available for inspection at the village offices, plus metered charges per 1,000 gallons. 
(3)  Table of unit factors. For all other users of the system and except as otherwise provided in article III of this chapter and this division, the village adopts a table of factors for the village wastewater collection and treatment system, which table is incorporated by reference and is on file and available for inspection at the village offices. The table shall set forth and identify the user class and all applicable factors to be multiplied by the quarterly charge established for single-family residential premises, which is designated as a residential equivalent (RE). The table may be modified or amended from time to time by resolution of the village council. 
(4)  Metered users. Commercial or other users may, at their request, install a water meter for measurement of actual water use. A user shall install a meter for measuring wastewater discharge to village wastewater treatment facilities. Meters shall be read monthly or at such other period as may be determined by the village. The sewer service charge for metered users shall be an amount established by resolution of the village council. 
(5)  Rules for interpreting table of unit factors. Rules for interpreting the table of unit factors shall be as follows: 
a.  The minimum equivalent factor for all users shall be one residential equivalent. 
b.  Equivalent units for users not originally contained in the table may be added thereto from time to time by resolution of the village council. 
c.  Where multiple metered businesses exist at one location, the various businesses shall be combined for determining the sewer service charge. 
(6)  Revision or modification of equivalent units. The equivalent units of a user having an equivalent unit factor of more than one residential equivalent shall be reviewed by the village at least once each year. Unless the equivalent unit factor of such user is changed by resolution of the village council on or before the 15th day of the last month preceding the commencement of the system fiscal year, the equivalent unit factor of such user shall remain the same as it was for the preceding fiscal year. Failure to specifically review as provided in this subsection shall not cause the factor to be omitted and shall not be considered grounds for discontinuance of the factor. 
(7)  Appeal. A property owner having an equivalent unit factor of more than one or a metered user may, upon written request, appeal to the village council. 
(8)  Effective dates for application of equivalent units. Where equivalent units are used to determine the connection, service and other charges of a property owner, the equivalent unit which shall be used in the calculation of such charges shall be the equivalent unit factor assigned to such factor as of the following dates: 
a.  For calculating a direct connection charge, the date the property owner applies for the permit or the last day of the period during which he is required by article III of this chapter to connect to the system, whichever comes first. 
b.  For calculating the operation, maintenance and replacement service charge, the date the property owner's available sanitary sewer becomes operational and thereafter on the first day of the last month preceding the commencement of the system fiscal year. 
(9)  Village use. For the reasonable cost value of sewage disposal services rendered to the village and its various departments by the wastewater system, the village shall pay according to the amounts set forth in the table of unit factors. 
(10)  Operation and maintenance surcharge. The rates and charges set forth in this division notwithstanding, if the character of the sewage of any user shall impose an unreasonable or additional burden upon the village sewage disposal and/or transmission system, an additional charge shall be made over and above the rates established in this division. Effluent in excess of the maximum limitations imposed by article III of this chapter shall be deemed prima facie subject to surcharge. If necessary to protect the system or any party thereof, the village shall deny the right of any user to empty such sewage into the system. Surcharges required by this subsection shall be computed as the prorated share of the annual cost of operation and maintenance, including replacement, attributable to treating the substance multiplied by the ratio of weight of surchargeable excess of the discharged substance multiplied by the ratio of weight of surchargeable excess of the discharged substance to the total weight of such substance that is treated in that year. This amount shall be collected on the basis of estimated surchargeable amounts with each periodic billing and shall be adjusted annually to reflect actual operation, maintenance and replacement costs. Surcharge rates shall be established by resolution of the village council. Surcharge applicable to industrial users shall be as set forth in section 82-726. 
(11)  Inspection fees. The cost of connecting private premises to the village sewer shall not be paid from the proceeds of the bond issue or from the revenues of the system but shall be paid by the property owners. In addition, premises connecting to the facilities of the system shall pay a charge for the inspection of such connection. Such charge shall be payable in cash upon application for a permit to connect the system and shall be in the amount established by resolution of the village council for each sewer connection. Each unit in a multiple commercial premises and each mobile home space in a mobile home park shall be treated as a separate user, and a separate inspection charge shall be made for each such user; provided, however, that such charge shall be made only once for each sewer service to each mobile home space in a mobile home park upon application for sewer service to such park. 
(12)  Capacity charge (indirect connection charge). There shall be paid for each single-family residential premises or single-family residential equivalent (RE) connecting to any sewer lines, in cash, at the time of application for the connection permit for the privilege of indirectly using the facilities of such sewer system and receiving service therefrom, the amount established by resolution of the village council, plus such other charges as may be levied. For all multiple residential dwellings, whether connecting directly or indirectly to the sanitary sewer system, there shall be paid, in cash, for all sewage treatment and transmission capacity, the sum equal to that established by the council for a single-family dwelling for each residential equivalent (RE). Premises subject to the capacity charge (indirect connection charge) and all other premises other than single-family residences and multiple residential dwellings connecting directly to the sanitary sewer system shall pay the amounts multiplied by the factor developed in the formula established by the table of unit factors pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. When the capacity charge (indirect connection charge) exceeds $5,000.00, the time for paying the charge may be extended under the terms that may be established by resolution of the village council. 
(13)  Charges and rates outside village. All sewer charges, surcharges, and fees for property outside of the village limits receiving sewer service shall be the same as that paid by system users within the village limits. 
(14)  Benefit charges. A person owning land in direct proximity to a village sewer main constructed after January 1, 1989, whose land has not been subjected to a special assessment to pay for the construction of the main and who makes connection to the sewer main shall pay a benefit charge for the privilege of each connection to the main in addition to all other charges under article III of this chapter and this division, which benefit charge shall be established from time to time by resolution of the village council. The benefit charge shall be paid in cash or in installments with interest and penalties, all as shall be established and provided from time to time by resolution of the village council.

Sec. 82-757. - Collections. 
    Water and sewer charge collections may be enforced as follows: 
(1)  Discontinuance of service. 
a.  If any water or sewer charges established pursuant to this article remain delinquent for a period in excess of 30 calendar days, the village shall have the right to shut off and discontinue water and/or sewer service to such user. 
b.  If water and sewer charges are not paid by the 30th day following the due date, notice of nonpayment shall be delivered or sent by first class mail to the owner or tenant made responsible therefore or shall be posted upon the premises receiving such services, the method of serving notice to be in the discretion of the clerk. The failure to receive such notice shall not affect the right of the village to charge penalties or discontinue services for nonpayment. If the charges and penalties are not paid in full within ten days of the mailing, delivering or posting as provided in this subsection, water services to the premises to which the charges apply may be discontinued. Service, if so discontinued, shall not be restored until all sums then due and owing shall be paid, together with any turn-off and turn-on charges. 
c.  The notice of nonpayment shall state the amount of the delinquent charges and penalties and shall include the following statement: 
"Village ordinance provides that water service may be discontinued if sewer and water charges are not paid on or before (the date which is the 30th day following the first day of the quarter). Water service so discontinued shall not be restored until all sums due and owing shall be paid together with any turn-off and turn-on charges as set by resolution of the village council. If for any reason you claim this bill is not due and payable, you must file a written notice of your objection to such billing with the clerk not later than ten days after the mailing, delivery or posting. All such objections shall be considered at the next regular village council meeting, and you will have an opportunity to present your objections and be heard thereon at that time." 
d.  If a statement of objections shall have been filed with the clerk on or before the date specified in the notice of nonpayment so mailed, delivered or served, water services for the premises to which the objected billing applies shall not be discontinued until the objecting owner or tenant has had an opportunity to present his objections to the village council. Such objections shall be presented to the village council at its next regular meeting following the deadline set forth in the notice of nonpayment for the filing of objections. At that meeting, the council shall review any objections filed or presented and either sustain or deny the objection. If the objection is denied, water services for the affected premises may be discontinued on the second day following such meeting unless payment of all charges and penalties shall have been made. 
e.  Service shall not be reestablished until all delinquent charges, penalties and a charge for the discontinuance of such service shall be paid. The turn-off and turn-on charges shall be established by resolution of the village council. 
(2)  Litigation. In addition to discontinuing service to a delinquent user, the village shall have the option of collecting all such delinquencies and penalties due by legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(3)  Enforcement of lien. Charges for water and sewer service, including penalties thereon, to property within the village, constitute a lien on the property served upon the provision of the water and/or sewer service. During March of each year, the clerk shall certify any such delinquent charges which, as of March 1 of that year, have been delinquent three months or more to the village tax assessing officer. The tax assessing officer shall enter the delinquent charges upon the village tax roll of that year against the premises to which such service shall have been rendered, and the charges shall be collected and the lien shall be enforced in the same manner as provided in respect to taxes assessed upon such roll. However, when a tenant is responsible for the payment of any such charges against any premises by a legally executed lease and the village clerk or village council is so notified of the lease by an affidavit of the owner, no such charge shall become a lien against such premises during the term of the lease from and after the date of such notice. If such affidavit is filed, no further service shall be rendered by the system to such premises until a cash deposit equal to three times the average quarterly charge to such premises shall have been made as security for payment of charges thereto.

In the case of a variance request, the legal or suitable owners must join in any appeal. Any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney at a hearing considering his request or appeal. 
4.  Stays all proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings, and thereupon all changes in the status quo of the property concerned shall constitute a violation of this ordinance; except that the zoning administrator may certify to the board of appeals after the notice of the appeal shall have been filed that for reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In which case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of appeals or on application to the circuit court when due cause can be shown.

Sec. 505. - Variances-Basic requirements. 
    The board of appeals may have the power to authorize, upon proper application of appeal, specific variances from such dimensional requirements as lot area and width regulations, building height and bulk regulations, yard and depth regulations, as specified in this ordinance, provided all the basic requirements listed herein and any one of the special requirements listed thereafter can be satisfied. The variances granted from this ordinance: 
1.  Will not be contrary to the public interest and will not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this ordinance. 
2.  Will not cause a substantial adverse effect upon property values in the immediate vicinity or in the district in which the property of the applicant is located. 
3.  Will relate to specific conditions particular to a property which are so unique that development of a general regulation for the conditions is not reasonable or practical. 
4.  Will relate only to property which is under the stated ownership and control of the applicant. 
5.  Affects only property subject to exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions that do not generally apply to other property or uses in the vicinity. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 505, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 506. - Special requirements for nonuse variance. 
    When all of the basic requirements in section 505 can be met, a nonuse variance may be granted when one of the following special requirements can be demonstrated clearly: 
1.  There are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships applied to the use of applicant's land which prevent carrying out the strict letter of this ordinance. These hardships or difficulties shall not be deemed economic, but shall be evaluated in terms of the use of that particular parcel of land. 
2.  Where there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or physical conditions such as narrowness, shallowness, shape or topography of the property involved, or to the intended use of the property, that did not generally apply to other property or uses in the same zoning district. Such circumstances or conditions shall not have resulted from any act of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the ordinance. 
3.  Where such variance is necessary for the preservation of a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the same zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 506, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 507. - Use variances requirements. 
    The board of appeals shall also have the power to authorize, upon application of appeal, specific use variances providing the petitioner establishes: 1) an unnecessary hardship exists, including that the specific property at issue cannot reasonably be put to any use conforming to the zoning district in which it is located; and 2) all of the basic requirements in section 505 and all of the special requirements in section 506 can be clearly demonstrated by the petitioner as being applicable to the property at issue. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 507, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 508. - Approval conditions. 
    The zoning board of appeals, in granting any appeal or variance request, may attach any reasonable conditions to its approval which it finds necessary to accomplish the reasonable application of the basic and special requirements described in this chapter, and are consistent with the zoning enabling laws. The conditions may include conditions necessary to insure [ensure] that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by the land use or activity, to protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to insure [ensure] compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner. Conditions imposed shall do all of the following: 
1.  Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety, and welfare, as well as the social and economic well-being of those who will use the land use or activity under consideration, residents and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the community as a whole. 
2.  Be related to the valid exercise of the police power and purposes which are affected by the proposed use or activity. 
3.  Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning regulations; be related to the basic and special conditions for variances established in this ordinance for the land use or activity under consideration; and be necessary to insure [ensure] compliance with those standards. 
The conditions imposed with respect to the approval of a land use or activity shall be recorded in the minutes of the approval action and shall remain unchanged except upon the mutual consent of the board and the landowner. The board shall maintain a record of changes granted in conditions. All approved variances shall also expressly be conditioned upon the variance being used within one year of the date it is approved, whether or not it is reflected in the board's minutes. If construction has not commenced and proceeded meaningfully toward completion by the end of this one-year period, or if a certificate of occupancy is not issued for the proposed use for which the variance was requested within 18 months after the date of approval of the variance by the zoning board of appeals, the variance shall become null and void. The zoning administrator may issue an extension of up to 90 calendar days as to the time limits provided in this section when the zoning administrator feels the extension is warranted and the work on the proposed use is proceeding meaningfully toward completion, as determined by the zoning administrator. Further extensions may be granted when deemed appropriate by the Fowlerville Zoning Board of Appeals. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 508, 6-19-2000) 
CHAPTER 6. - GENERAL AND SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS 

Sec. 601. - Establishment of districts. 
    In order to carry out the objectives of this ordinance, the Village of Fowlerville is hereby divided into districts of different types, each type being of such number, shape, kind and area, and of such common unity of purpose and adaptability of use that are deemed most suitable to carry out the objectives of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 601, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 602. - Types of districts.

Sec. 603. - Adoption of zoning map. 
    The boundaries of the zoning districts established in section 602 are established as shown upon the official Zoning Map of the Village of Fowlerville, dated October, 2003 which map, together with all notations, references and other information shown thereon, are hereby approved and adopted. Such map, together with all amendments which may be hereinafter made thereto, shall be known and cited as the "Zoning Map of the Village of Fowlerville" for all purposes. The Zoning Map of the Village of Fowlerville is hereby made a part of this ordinance with the same effect as if all matters and information set forth in said map were fully set forth herein. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 603, 6-19-2000; Ord. No. 365, § 1, 11-17-2003) 
Sec. 604. - Interpretation of district boundaries. 
    Where, due to scale, lack of detail, or illegibility, of the zoning map accompanying this ordinance, there is an uncertainty, contradiction or conflict as to the intended location of any zoning district boundary as shown thereon, interpretation concerning the exact location of zoning district boundary lines shall be determined by the zoning board of appeals. The zoning board of appeals, in arriving at a decision on these matters, may seek a recommendation from the planning commission. In making its determination, the ZBA shall also apply the following standards: 
1.  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately coinciding with the centerlines of streets or highways, street lines or highway right-of-way lines, such centerlines, street lines or highway right-of-way lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. 
2.  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately coincide with lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. 
3.  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately parallel the centerlines or street lines of streets, or the centerlines or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel to and at such distance as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning map. 
4.  In unsubdivided property, or where a zoning district divides a recorded lot, the location of any such boundary, unless the boundary is indicated by dimensions shown upon the zoning map, shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning map. 
5.  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following railroad lines, the line between the main track shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
6.  Where the boundary of a district follows stream or drain, the district boundary line shall be interpreted as following the approximate centerline between the two banks. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 604, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 605. - Zoning of annexed territory. 
1.  All territory which is annexed to the village shall be given an interim zoning, by the zoning administrator, with a district enumerated in section 602, which most closely resembles the zoning which the territory maintained prior to annexation. This interim zoning shall only be effective until rezoning pursuant to this section is completed. 
2.  The planning commission shall, within 180 days after territory is annexed, and pursuant to the procedures described in this ordinance for rezoning, review and recommend to the village council, the appropriate zoning of territory, with consideration being given to existing land use and the land use policies of the master plan. This section shall not preclude a person from at any time seeking a boundary amendment by submitting the appropriate application for rezoning pursuant to this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 605, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 606. - Zoning of vacated areas. 
    Whenever any road, alley or other public way is vacated by official action, the zoning district adjoining each side of such public way shall automatically be extended to the center of such vacation, and all area included therein shall henceforth be subject to all appropriate regulations of that district within [which] such area is located. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 606, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 607. - District regulations. 
    Each district, as created in this chapter, shall be subject to the regulations contained in this ordinance. Uses not expressly permitted are prohibited. Uses for enterprises or purposes that are contrary to federal, state or local laws or ordinances are prohibited. Special uses, because of their nature, require special restrictions and some measure of individual attention in order to determine whether or not such uses will be compatible with uses permitted by right in the district and with the purposes of this ordinance. Special uses, therefore, are prohibited uses unless this prohibition is waived by the village planning commission reviewing and approving a special use request as provided in this ordinance.

All buildings shall provide architectural features, details, and ornaments such as archways, colonnades, cornices, recesses, projections, wall insets, arcades, window display areas, peaked roof lines, or towers. 
2.  Building walls and roofs over 50 feet in length shall be broken up with varying building lines, windows, gables, and/or architectural accents such as pilasters, columns, dormers, and awnings. 
3.  Window area shall make up at least 20 percent or more of the exterior wall area facing the front yard. This requirement may be modified by the planning commission upon a finding that this requirement is excessive due to the nature of the use and surrounding land uses, the location of the site, or architectural incompatibility. 
4.  In addition, a portion of the on-site landscaping shall abut the walls so that the vegetation combined with the architectural features significantly reduce the visual impact of the building mass as viewed from the street. Additional landscaping requirements of this ordinance must also be satisfied. 
5.  Overhead doors shall not face a public street or residential district. The planning commission can modify this requirement upon a determination that there is no reasonable alternative and the visual impact will be moderated through use of building materials, architectural features and landscaping beyond that required. 
6.  Additions to existing buildings must complement the current building design with regard to height, proportions, scale, materials, and rhythm of openings. 
b.  Building materials. 
1.  Durable building materials which provide an attractive, quality appearance must be utilized. 
2.  The predominant building materials should be quality materials that are characteristic of Michigan such as earth-toned brick, decorative tilt-up panels, wood, native stone, and tinted/textured concrete masonry units and/or glass products. 
3.  Other materials such as smooth-faced concrete block, undecorated tilt-up concrete dryvit panels, or pre-fabricated steel panels should only be used as accents and not dominate the building exterior of the structure. 
4.  Metal roofs may be allowed if deemed by the planning commission to be compatible with the overall architectural design of the building. 
c.  Building and sign colors. 
1.  Exterior colors shall be of low reflectance, subtle, neutral, or earth tone colors. The use of high intensity colors such as neon, metallic, or fluorescent for the facade and/or roof of the building are prohibited except as approved by the planning commission for building trim. 
2.  The use of trademark colors not meeting this requirement shall be approved by the planning commission. 
3.  Mechanical and service features such as gutters, ductwork, service doors, etc. that cannot be screened must be of a color that blends in with the color of the building. 
d.  Roof design. 
1.  Roofs should be designed to reduce the apparent exterior mass of a building, add visual interest, and be appropriate to the architectural style of the building. 
2.  Variations in architectural style are highly encouraged. Visible roof lines and roofs that project over the exterior wall of a building enough to cast a shadow on the ground are highly encouraged, with a minimum overhang of 12 inches. 
3.  Architectural methods shall be used to conceal flat roof tops and mechanical equipment. 
4.  Overhanging eaves, peaked roofs, and multiple roof elements are highly encouraged. 
e.  Customer entrances. Clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances may be included in the design. Features such as canopies, porticos, arcades, arches, wing walls, and integral planters are highly encouraged to identify such entrances. 
f.  Community amenities. Community amenities such as patio/seating areas, water features, art work or sculpture, clock towers, pedestrian plazas with park benches, or other features located adjacent to the primary entrance to the building(s) are highly encouraged. 
g.  Signs. Signs shall be in accordance with chapter 21. All sign bases shall be constructed of materials compatible with the architecture of the building(s) located on the premises. 
h.  Natural features. Buildings shall be sited to protect existing natural areas such as steep natural grades, trees, significant groupings of healthy vegetation (shrubs and trees), and rock outcroppings. To the extent practical, these areas shall be incorporated into the overall site plan.

Sec. 640. - Lighting. 
    All lighting must comply with the following standards: 
a.  Freestanding pole lighting. 
1.  Exterior lighting shall be fully shielded and directed downward to prevent off-site glare. Fixed, downward directed, metal halide shoebox fixtures shall be used in an effort to maintain a unified lighting standard throughout the city [village] and prevent "sky glow." 
2.  The intensity of light within a site shall not exceed ten footcandles within any site or one footcandle at any property line, except where it abuts a service drive or other public right-of-way. Footcandles abutting a residential district or use can be a maximum of 0.5 footcandles at the property line. The only exception is for gas station canopy and automobile dealership lighting, where a maximum of 20 footcandles is permitted within the site but the above standards shall apply to intensity at the property line.

2.  The intensity of light within a site shall not exceed ten footcandles within any site or one footcandle at any property line, except where it abuts a service drive or other public right-of-way. Footcandles abutting a residential district or use can be a maximum of 0.5 footcandles at the property line. 
3.  The planning commission may approve decorative light fixtures as an alternative to shielded fixtures when it can be proven that there will be no off-site glare and the proposed fixtures will improve the appearance of the site. 
4.  Luminous tube and exposed bulb fluorescent lighting is prohibited as an architectural detail on all buildings, e.g. along the roof line and eaves, around windows, etc. The planning commission may approve internally illuminated architectural bands when it can be shown that the treatment will enhance the appearance of the building or is necessary for security purposes.

b.  The PUD shall contain open space in an amount equal to at least 15 percent of the total PUD site. Such open space shall not include required yards or buffers, parking areas, drives, rights-of-way, utility or road easements, storm water detention ponds, regulated wetlands, designated flood plains, or structures. Such open space shall be permanently set aside for the sole benefit, use, and enjoyment of present and future occupants of the PUD through covenant, deed restriction, open space easement, or similar legal instrument acceptable to the village; or, if agreed to by the village council, the open space may be conveyed to the Village for the use of the general public. 
3.  Business center standards. Planned unit developments within the BC district must meet the following qualifying conditions: 
a.  Development proposed must be consistent with traditional neighborhood design principles, which are historically based on urban development from the early colonial times to the 1940's and as stated in the BC district design guidelines reference manual. 
b.  Developments within the BC zoning district must first be reviewed by the village downtown development authority so they may comment on the plan. 
c.  Property zoned R-2 or PL that is located adjacent to the BC district may be considered as part of a commercial PUD, provided inclusion of said property will contribute to the traditional character desired, will not detract from the quality of the surrounding neighborhood nor create a nuisance to the surrounding properties; and provided further that no more than 40 percent of the total land area may be zoned R-2 or PL.

CHAPTER 20. - GENERAL OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

Sec. 2001. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose and intent of this chapter that off-street parking and loading areas be provided and adequately maintained in every zoning district for the purposes of promoting safe and efficient parking of motor vehicles; to avoid unnecessary congestion and interference with public use of streets; and to provide for sound and stable environmental conditions and the prevention of future blighted areas. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2001, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 2002. - Off-street parking and loading. 
1.  In all zoning districts, off-street parking and loading requirements shall be provided in amounts not less than specified for the various districts. 
2.  Requirements for a use not mentioned shall be the same as for that use which is most similar to the use not listed. 
3.  Additional parking shall be provided and maintained in proper ratio to any increase in floor area or building use capacity. 
4.  For the purposes of determining off-street parking and loading requirements, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  "Usable floor area" as applied to offices, merchandising or service types of uses, shall mean the floor area used or intended to be used for services to the public as customers, patrons, clients, patients, or tenants, including areas occupied for fixtures and equipment used for display or sale of merchandise, but excluding floor areas used exclusively for storage, housing of mechanical equipment integral with the building, maintenance facilities, or those areas so restricted that customers, patients, clients, salesmen, and the general public are denied access. Measurement of usable floor area shall be the sum of the horizontal area of each story of a structure measured from the interior faces of the exterior walls. 
b.  Where benches, pews, or other similar seating facilities are used as seats, each 24 inches of such seating facilities shall be counted as one seat. 
5.  In the case of mixed uses in the same building, the total requirements for off-street parking and loading shall be the sum of the requirements for the separate individual uses computed separately. 
6.  Joint or collective provisions of off-street parking for buildings or uses on two or more properties shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the participating individual uses computed separately. 
7.  It shall be unlawful to use any of the off-street parking or loading areas established to meet the requirements of this ordinance for any purpose other than the parking of licensed vehicles or the loading or unloading of necessary service trucks. 
8.  All off-street parking areas, including parking aisles, shall be setback a minimum of five (5) feet from the rear and side lot lines and a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from the front lot line. The planning commission may permit parking areas to encroach within the fifteen (15) foot setback where substantial additional screening or landscaping acceptable to the planning commission is provided. 
9.  When determination of the number of off-street parking or loading space required by this ordinance results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space. 
10.  No repairs or services to vehicles shall be carried on or permitted upon such premises. 
11.  No vehicular display for purpose of sale shall be carried on or permitted upon such premises, except in licensed and approved vehicle sales establishments. 
12.  Off-street parking in driveways or on nonpaved open space is prohibited, except on one-family lots. Two-family lots shall provide parking as required in section 2005 of this ordinance. 
13.  The use of an off-street parking lot in a residential district by any commercial or industrial use is prohibited. 
14.  Except for the BC district, off-street parking for all non-residential zoning districts and uses shall be either on the same lot or within 300 feet of the building or use it is intended to serve, measured from the nearest public entrance of the building to the nearest point of the off-street parking lot. In the BC district parking shall be provided on the same lot as the use, unless the property adjoins or has access to a community parking lot, or common parking area maintained by participating property owners. 
15.  The planning commission may defer construction of the required number of parking spaces if the following conditions are met: 
a.  Areas proposed for deferred parking shall be shown on the site plan, and shall be sufficient for construction of the required number of parking spaces in accordance with the standards of this ordinance for parking area design and other site development requirements. 
b.  Alterations to the deferred parking area may be initiated by the owner or required by the zoning administrator, and shall require the approval of an amended site plan, submitted by the applicant accompanied by evidence documenting the justification for the alteration.

d.  Sight distance: Adequate sight distance shall be ensured for all vehicles exiting from a proposed development. If certain movements cannot be made safely, then they shall be prohibited or joint access with adjoining properties shall be encouraged. 
e.  Driveway permits: Prior to granting a building permit for any construction involving a new or expanded driveway opening to a public street, a permit for such driveway shall be obtained from the village, county, or state agency having jurisdiction over the public street and shall be submitted to the building inspector. 
3.  Non-residential ingress and egress requirements. 
a.  Driveway spacing: The minimum spacing allowed between a proposed driveway and all other driveways (located on the same side of the public street which the proposed driveway abuts or adjoins) or street intersections shall be in accordance with the following standards:

on Adjacent Public Street * Minimum Driveway Spacing 
(feet) ** 30 mph or less 100 ft. 35 160 ft. 40 210 ft. 45 or over 300 ft.  
* Traffic speeds are based on posted speeds as of the effective date of this ordinance. In the event the posted speed limit is changed, the minimum spacing requirement in effect on the adoption date of this ordinance shall remain in force, unless amended at a later date by the village council. 
** Spacing requirements are based on average vehicle acceleration and deceleration rates and are considered the minimum distances necessary to maintain safe traffic operation. The required spacing shall be measured from the centerline of the proposed driveway to the centerline of the nearest existing driveway or the edge of the right-of-way or easement of the nearest intersecting street. 
b.  In the event that a particular parcel or parcels lack sufficient road frontage to meet the spacing requirement, the landowner(s) may: 
(1)  Seek a variance from the zoning board of appeals, but in no case shall the variance permit less separation than permitted in the next lowest spacing requirement, as shown in the table of spacing requirements; 
(2)  Obtain authorization from the adjacent property owner(s) to establish a shared driveway between the properties; or 
(3)  Obtain a cross-access easement to use an existing driveway on adjacent property. 
c.  Number of driveways per parcel: 
(1)  A maximum of one driveway opening shall be permitted to a parcel or lot from each abutting street. 
(2)  The Village Planning Commission may permit one additional driveway entrance along any street on which the parcel frontage exceeds four hundred feet. 
(3)  In the case of dual one-way driveways, one pair may be used per 250 feet of frontage. Only one pair of one-way drives shall be permitted per street frontage. 
d.  Property clearance: The minimum distance between the property line and the nearest edge of the driveway shall be twenty-five feet, except where the driveway provides access to more than one lot or parcel. 
e.  Corner clearance: The minimum corner clearance distance between the centerline of a proposed driveway and the edge of the right-of-way or easement of an intersecting street shall be 150 feet. Traffic movements into or out of any driveway, the centerline of which is located within 250 feet of the edge of the right-of-way or easement of a signalized street intersection, shall be limited to right-turns in and right-turns out only. 
4.  Residential ingress and egress requirements. 
a.  Residential: All residential driveway openings onto a public street shall be constructed to the adopted standards of the Village of Fowlerville. 
b.  Non-residential: All driveway openings for non-residential uses in the residential zoning districts shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission as part of the site plan review procedures of this ordinance.

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 436, § 2, adopted Dec. 16, 2013, amended Chapter 21 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 21, §§ 2101-2111, pertained to outdoor sign regulations, and derived from Ord. No. 346, §§ 2101-2111, adopted June 19, 2000; Ord. No. 355, §§ 2-8, effective May 5, 2002; Ord. No. 375, § 4, adopted May 16, 2005; Ord. No. 400, §§ 3, 4, adopted Feb. 4, 2008; Ord. No. 422, §§ 2-6, adopted July 18, 2011; Ord. No. 425, §§ 1-3, adopted Oct. 24, 2011. 

Sec. 2101. - Purpose. 
    The sign regulations of this chapter are intended to protect and further the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the village; to maintain and improve the appearance of the village; to conserve community character; to prevent traffic hazards; to provide safer conditions for pedestrians; and to promote economic development by regulating the construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, size, location, and number of signs. It is further determined that to allow signs of excessive number and size in the village would unduly distract pedestrians and motorists, create a traffic hazard, and reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public. The regulations of this chapter are intended to provide reasonable identification for businesses and other uses within the community. 
(Ord. No. 436, § 2, 12-16-2013)

Sec. 2106. - Nonconforming signs. 
1.  Every permanent sign which was erected legally and which lawfully exists at the time of the enactment of this chapter, but which does not conform to the height, size, area, or location requirements of this chapter as of the date of the adoption of these regulations, is hereby deemed to be nonconforming. This status shall not be granted to any temporary sign, banner, placard, or other non-permanent sign. 
2.  Nonconforming signs may not be altered, expanded, enlarged, or extended, except as allowed in this ordinance; however, nonconforming signs may be maintained and repaired so as to continue the useful life of the sign.

(Ord. No. 436, § 2, 12-16-2013) 
CHAPTER 22. - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES 

Sec. 2201. - Purpose. 
    This ordinance establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of specified types of buildings, structures, and uses. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of these districts that all lawfully nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses be permitted to continue only under specific controls. It is, further, necessary and consistent with the establishment of these districts that certain nonconforming uses be eliminated in accordance with applicable statutes. It is hereby declared that the existence of nonconforming uses is contrary to the best interests of the village and further, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the village council as expressed in this ordinance to discontinue nonconforming uses in the course of time as circumstances permit, having full regard for the rights of all parties concerned. Therefore, it is the purpose of the following sections to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures, uses and signs. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2201, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 2202. - Nonconforming use of land, buildings, or structures. 
    Any lawful nonconforming use of land, building or structures, may be continued, subject to the following provisions. 
1.  Expansion. A nonconforming use shall not be in any way increased in intensity, expanded or extended either on the same or adjoining property, or into any other portion of a building. 
2.  Discontinuance. If a nonconforming use is discontinued, it shall not thereafter be reestablished, and any subsequent use of the land, building, or structure shall conform to the regulations of the district in which the land is located. A nonconforming use shall be considered discontinued if customary operations of that use are not pursued for a period of six consecutive months or more. Thereafter, such use shall not be re-established, and any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of the district within which it is located. 
3.  Criteria for discontinuance. A nonconforming use shall be determined to be discontinued if one or more of the following conditions exists, and which shall be deemed to constitute the intent on the part of the property owner to discontinue the nonconforming use: 
a.  Utilities, such as water, gas and electricity to the property, have been disconnected; 
b.  The property, buildings, and grounds have fallen into disrepair; 
c.  Signs or other indications of the existence of the nonconforming use have been removed; 
d.  Equipment or fixtures necessary for the operation of the nonconforming use have been removed; or 
e.  Other actions which, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, constitute an intention on the part of the property owner or lessee to abandon the nonconforming use. 
4.  Change of use. The nonconforming use of land shall not be changed to any other use except to a use permitted in the district in which the land is located. If a nonconforming use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which it is located, it shall not revert or be changed back to a nonconforming use. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2202, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 2203. - Nonconforming buildings. 
    Any existing building which does not conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located may be continued subject to the provisions of this ordinance. 
1.  Repair of nonconforming buildings. Nothing in this ordinance shall prohibit the repair, improvement, or modernizing of a lawful nonconforming building to correct deterioration, obsolescence, depreciation, and wear. 
2.  Structural changes. In a district where residences are not permitted, an existing single-family or two-family use building may have permitted additions and structural alterations providing: 
a.  That such structural changes are made only if in conformity with all the regulations of height, area, yard, useable open space, and off-street parking, as required in the district. 
b.  That no additional family units may be provided, and that there is no intensification of occupancy as would constitute a rooming or boarding house. 
c.  That floor area added shall not exceed 50 percent of the total floor area in the existing dwelling. 
d.  That such addition may not be made if a portion of the existing dwelling has been converted to commercial or industrial use subsequent to the prospective zoning. 
3.  Restoration of damaged structures. A nonconforming building which is partially destroyed, in any manner or from any cause whatsoever, may be restored provided the cost of such restoration does not exceed its true cash value as determined by the most recent village tax roll. No repairs or restoration shall be permitted, however, unless started within one year from the date of the partial destruction and is diligently carried on to completion. If the cost of restoration exceeds the true cash value of the original structure, as determined by the most recent village tax roll, such structure when restored shall comply with all provisions of the district in which it is located, except that, if it is located on a lot with a smaller lot area or a lesser width of lot than is prescribed for the district in which it is located, it need not comply with the provisions of that district for minimum lot area or minimum width of lot but shall maintain as a minimum the lot area and lot width existing previous to the damage to the building or structure. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2203, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 2204. - Prior construction approval. 
    Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the completion of construction and use of a nonconforming building for which a building permit was issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance provided that construction is commenced within 90 days after the date of issuance of the permit; the construction is carried on diligently and without interruption for a continuous period in excess of 30 days; and that the entire building shall have been completed according to the plans filed with the permit application within two years after the issuance of the building permit. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2204, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 2205. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
    The purpose of this section is to permit the utilization of recorded lots, which lack required lot size and open space as long as reasonable standards can be provided. 
1.  In any zone or district in which single-family, two-family, or multiple-family dwellings are permitted, such dwellings, and customary accessory buildings, as permitted in the zone(s), may be erected or enlarged on any single lot that was a lot at the date of this ordinance. 
2.  This provision shall apply even though the lot of record fails to meet the requirements for minimum frontage or minimum area, or both, that are generally applicable in the zone or district. Notwithstanding the above provisions, the zoning administrator may issue a land use permit in those instances where a nonconforming lot or combination of lots of record meets 80 percent of the minimum frontage, setback, or area requirements of this ordinance upon a determination that said 80 percent is in conformance with the general standard of the neighborhood. 
3.  The lot must also meet all public health and sanitary requirements for the proper installation of sanitary facilities, such as but not limited to a septic system, for the proper disposal of human and household waste prior to permitting construction on the lot of record. 
4.  If two or more lots of record or combination of lots and portions of lots of record, in existence at the time of the passage of this ordinance, or an amendment thereto, with continuous frontage and under single ownership do not meet the requirements established for lot width or lot area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this ordinance, and no portions of such parcel shall be used or divided in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this ordinance. If such lot is used, it shall lose its nonconforming status. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2205, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 2206. - Nonconforming signs. 
    Nonconforming signs shall be regulated in accordance with the provisions of section 2111 of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2206, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 2207. - Elimination of nonconforming uses and buildings. 
    In accordance with applicable state and local permissive legislation, the legislative body, through its agents may acquire properties on which nonconforming buildings or uses are located by condemnation or other means, and may remove such uses or structures. The resultant property may be leased or sold for a conforming use or may be used by the village for a public use. The net cost of such acquisition may be assessed against a benefit district, or may be paid from other sources of revenue. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2207, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 2208. - Changes in nonconforming uses. 
    Upon a written petition of the owners of a parcel of property, the zoning board of appeals may authorize a change from one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use provided the proposed use would be more suitable to the zoning district in which it is located than the nonconforming use which is being replaced. The zoning board of appeals may place such limitations on such approval as it deems appropriate and as authorized in section 508 of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 346, § 2208, 6-19-2000) 
Sec. 2209. - Expansion or alteration of non-conforming structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, it may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions. 
1.  No non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be enlarged or altered if the alteration conforms to the requirements of the zoning district or if the alteration will decrease its non-conformity. 
2.  Should a non-conforming structure be moved for any reason whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
3.  In approving the expansion or enlargement of a non-conforming structure, the Zoning Administrator may place reasonable conditions (such as landscaping, fencing, etc.) to help mitigate the possible impacts of the area(s) of nonconformity from the adjacent property.

If the name of the occupant is not known, the term "occupant" may be used in making notification. Notification need not be given to more than one occupant of a structure, except that if a structure contains more than one dwelling unit or spatial area owned or leased by different individuals, partnerships, businesses or organizations, one occupant of each unit or spatial area shall receive notice. In the case of a single structure containing more than four dwelling units or other distinct spatial areas owned or leased by different individuals, partnerships, businesses or organizations, notice may be given to the manager or owner of the structure who shall be requested to post the notice at the primary entrance to the structure. The notice shall be given not less than five days and not more than 15 days before the public hearing.

5.  Permit expiration. A special use permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance. If construction has not commenced and proceeded meaningfully toward completion by the end of this one-year period, or if a certificate of occupancy is not issued for the proposed use within 18 months after the date of issuance of the permit by the zoning administrator, the special use permit shall become null and void. The zoning administrator may issue an extension of up to 90 calendar days as to the time limits provided in this subsection when the zoning administrator feels the extension is warranted and the work on the proposed use is proceeding meaningfully toward completion, as determined by the zoning administrator. Further extensions may be granted when deemed appropriate by the Fowlerville Planning Commission. The zoning administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of the expiration of said permit. 
a.  The planning commission may grant up to one additional one year extension, if requested by the property owner, in writing, prior to the expiration of the original one year period, upon showing that the development has encountered unforseen difficulties beyond the control of the applicant, and the project will proceed within the extension period. 
b.  If the above provisions are not fulfilled or the extension has expired prior to construction, the special use approval shall become null and void. 
6.  Revocation. The planning commission shall have the authority to revoke any special use permit after it has been proved that the holder of the permit has failed to comply with any of the applicable requirements in chapter 23, or other applicable sections.

The planning commission may impose reasonable conditions in conjunction with its approval of a special use permit, which are deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the general standards of section 2304 and the specific design standards of this chapter for individual uses. The conditions, if any, shall be recorded in the written decision of the planning commission. 
2.  Any condition imposed under this section shall do all of the following:

1.  The following regulations shall apply to all planned unit residential developments (PURDs): 
a.  PURDs must contain no less than two acres in lot area. 
b.  PURDs may be located only in zoning districts that list planned unit residential developments as a special use.

The uses permitted in a PURD shall be those uses permitted in the district in which the PURD is located and any additional uses which are shown to be compatible with the general objectives of the zoning ordinance, as well as being an integral part of the PURD in which they are contained. For purposes of this section, an integral use is one that has a specific functional relationship with other uses in the development. For example, a day care center which primarily serves the needs of the residents in the development. 
2.  The requirements and standards upon which the application will be judged are as follows: 
a.  Yard, setback, lot size, type of dwelling unit, height and frontage requirements may be waived for a PURD, provided that the spirit and intent of this section are part of the total development plan. The village may determine that certain setbacks may be established within all or a portion of the perimeter of the development and shall determine the suitability of the entire development plan in accordance with the purpose and intent of this section. 
b.  Every structure or dwelling unit shall have access to a public street, walkway, or other area dedicated to common use.

Common driveways, parking areas, walks and steps may be required together with appropriate lighting in order to insure the safety of the occupants and the general public. Screening of parking and service areas may be required through the use of trees, shrubs, hedges, or screening walls. 
f.  All elements of the site plan shall be harmoniously and efficiently organized in relation to topography, the size and type of plot, the character of adjoining property and the type and size of buildings. The arrangement of buildings shall be done in such a way as to utilize natural topography, existing vegetation and views within and beyond the site. 
g.  The development shall preserve and enhance the character of the site by retaining and protecting the existing trees and other site features; additional new landscaping shall be provided for privacy, shade, beauty of buildings and grounds and to screen objectionable features. 
3.  The following additional procedural requirements for PURDs are in addition to those required for other special land uses: 
a.  Prior to submitting an application for a PURD, the applicant shall attend a pre-application conference with the planning commission for the purpose of discussing the proposed development and obtaining information about the village procedures for processing PURD applications. This conference shall be informal and neither party needs to make any commitments. 
b.  In additional to the general requirements for special use permits, PURD applicants shall submit the following for preliminary review by the planning commission: 
(1)  A development plan, drawn to a readable scale, of the entire development, showing its location within the village and its relationship to adjacent property. 
(2)  A site plan showing the proposed types and location of all proposed structures and the anticipated population density for each type of structure and for the entire project. It shall indicate the purpose for each structure, traffic circulation, parking layout and pedestrian pathways.
