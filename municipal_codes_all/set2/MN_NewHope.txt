PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of New Hope, Minnesota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the July 26, 1984, as supplemented through Ord. No. 02-06, dated April 8, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
    The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate indexing and usage. Cross references tie related sections of the Code together. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

Sec. 2-60. - Administrative fines enforcement program. 
(a)  Administrative citations and civil penalties. Subsections (d)-(i) of this section shall govern administrative citations and civil penalties for violations of this Code. 
(b)  Purpose . The city council finds that there is a need for alternative methods of enforcing this Code. While criminal fines and penalties have been the most frequent enforcement mechanism, there are certain negative consequences for both the city and the accused. The delay inherent in that system does not ensure prompt resolution. Citizens resent being labeled as criminals for violations of administrative regulations. The higher burden of proof and the potential of incarceration do not appear appropriate for most administrative violations. The criminal process does not always regard Code violations as being important. Accordingly, the city council finds that the use of administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties and/or actions by the city to abate the violations including towing and/or impoundment of vehicles or recreational vehicles are legitimate and necessary alternative methods of enforcement. These methods of enforcement are in addition to any other legal remedy that may be pursued for Code violations. 
(c)  General provisions. 
(1)  Administrative offense. A violation of any provision of the city code is an administrative offense that may be subject to an administrative citation and civil penalties. Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense. 
(2)  Exemption. Alcohol and tobacco license violations are not subject to administrative citation under this section. See subsection 8-7(f) and section 10-82 of this Code for administrative sanctions relating to tobacco and alcohol license violations. 
(3)  Civil penalty. An administrative offense may be subject to a civil fine not to exceed the maximum fine for a misdemeanor violation under state law. 
(4)  Schedule of fines and fees. The city council shall adopt by resolution a schedule of fines for offenses initiated by administrative citation. The city council is not bound by that schedule when a matter is appealed to it for administrative review under subsection (g) of this section. The city council may adopt a schedule of fees to be paid to administrative hearing officers. 
(5)  Abatement procedures. A violation of any provision of the Code is an administrative offense that may be subject to an abatement order whereby the city or city's agent corrects or removes the violation and charges the violator for such corrective action. 
(d)  Administrative citation procedures. 
(1)  Administrative notice. 
a.  Upon the first violation, the city will issue an administrative notice to the violator. The city will deliver the administrative notice to the violator in person or by regular mail. The violator will have seven calendar days to correct the violation after issuance of the administrative notice. 
b.  If the violator is making a good faith attempt to remedy the violation, the city may grant an extension, the length of which must be agreed upon in writing between the city and the violator. 
(2)  Administrative citation. If the violator fails to correct the violation within the time period provided in the administrative notice, the city may issue an administrative citation. The city must issue the citation to the violator in person or by regular mail. In the case of a vehicular offense, the citation may be attached to the motor vehicle. The citation must state the date, time, and nature of the offense, the name of the issuing officer, the amount of the scheduled fine, the city's intention to abate the offense, if applicable, and the manner for paying the fine or appealing the citation. 
(3)  Payment. The violator must either pay the scheduled fine or request a hearing within seven days after issuance of the citation. The fee to conduct a hearing is established by the city's fee schedule. Penalties for failure to correct the violation or late payment of the fine may be imposed as set forth in subsection (h)(4) of this section. The city may issue a second citation or take other legal action to achieve compliance with the ordinances including, but not limited to, abatement actions correcting or removing the violation. 
(e)  Administrative hearing. 
(1)  Hearing officers. The city council will periodically approve a list of qualified individuals, from which the city clerk will randomly select a hearing officer to hear and determine a matter for which a hearing is requested. The hearing officer will be a public officer as defined by Minn. Stat. § 609.415. The hearing officer must not be a city employee. The city clerk must establish a procedure for evaluating the competency of the hearing officers, including comments from accused violators and city staff. These reports must be provided to the city council. 
(2)  Removal of hearing officer. No later than five days before the date of the hearing, the violator may make a written request that the assigned hearing officer be removed from the case. The city clerk will automatically grant one request for removal. A subsequent request must be directed to the assigned hearing officer who will decide whether they can fairly and objectively review the case. If the hearing officer determines they cannot fairly and objectively review the case, the hearing officer shall notify the city clerk in writing at least one day before the scheduled hearing date. The city clerk will then assign another hearing officer. 
(3)  Notice of hearing. Within 30 days of the request for a hearing, the city clerk will schedule the hearing and will notify the violator and involved city staff of the date, time and place for the hearing. Parties are expected to be available at the hearing for a minimum of two hours. Notice of the hearing must be mailed to the violator and the hearing officer at least ten days in advance of the scheduled hearing, unless a shorter time is accepted by all parties. The notice must contain the names of the parties, the identity of the hearing officer, the location of the alleged violation and the type of violation alleged. 
(4)  Continuance. A request for a continuance must be made to the city clerk at least five days prior to the scheduled hearing date. The city clerk may grant a continuance at the request of the violator or the city staff member only for good cause shown and for no more than ten days from the originally assigned date. 
(5)  File transmittal. 
a.  Upon receipt of any request for a hearing, the city clerk's office will compile a summary report detailing the facts in support of any determination that the offense constitutes a violation. The summary report will include the following information: 
1.  Copy of the citation issued; 
2.  Copy of the administrative notice, which preceded the citation; 
3.  Copy of any case history in the issuing employee's department; 
4.  Photographs and/or videotape of property where available; 
5.  Proof of mailing and/or posting of notice on the property if the citation was not personally served on the violator. 
b.  The file must be ready for the hearing officer to pick up on the business day preceding the scheduled hearing. 
(6)  Presentation of case. At the hearing, the parties will have the opportunity to present testimony and question any witnesses, but strict rules of evidence will not apply. The hearing officer must tape record the hearing and receive testimony and exhibits. The hearing officer must receive and give weight to evidence, including hearsay evidence that possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent people in the conduct of their affairs. 
(7)  Decision. 
a.  The hearing officer must issue a written decision containing findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order. The decision will be mailed to the parties within ten days after the hearing. The hearing officer has the authority to determine that a violation occurred, to dismiss a citation, to impose the scheduled fine, and to reduce, stay, or waive a scheduled fine either unconditionally or upon compliance with appropriate conditions. When imposing a penalty for a violation, the hearing officer may consider any or all of the following factors: 
1.  Duration of the violation; 
2.  Frequency of reoccurrence of the violation; 
3.  Seriousness of the violation; 
4.  History of the violation; 
5.  Violator's conduct after issuance of the administrative notice and citation; 
6.  Violator's conduct after issuance of the notice of hearing; 
7.  Good faith effort by the violator to comply; 
8.  Impact of the violation upon the community; 
9.  Prior record of city code violations; and 
10.  Any other factors appropriate to a just result. 
b.  The hearing officer may not impose a fine greater than the established fine, except that the hearing officer may impose a fine for each week that the violation continues if: 
1.  The violation caused or is causing a serious threat of harm to the public health, safety, or welfare; or 
2.  The violator intentionally and unreasonably refused or refuses to comply with the code requirement. 
(8)  Right of appeal. Except as provided in subsections (f) and (g) of this section, the decision of the hearing officer is final without any further right of appeal. 
(9)  Failure to appear. The failure to attend the hearing constitutes a waiver of the violator's rights to an administrative hearing and an admission of the violation. A hearing officer may waive this result upon good cause shown. Examples of "good cause" are: death in the immediate family or documented incapacitating illness of the violator; a court order requiring the violator to appear for another hearing at the same time; and lack of proper service of the citation or notice of the hearing. "Good cause" does not include: forgetfulness; lack of transportation or child care; and intentional delay. 
(f)  Judicial review. An aggrieved party may obtain judicial review of the decision of the hearing officer or the city council as provided in state law. 
(g)  Administrative review. 
(1)  Appeal. A violator may appeal the hearing officer's decision in any of the following matters to the city council for administrative review: 
a.  An alleged failure to obtain a permit, license or other approval from the city council as required by this Code, county ordinance or state law; 
b.  An alleged violation of a permit, license, other approval, or the conditions attached to the permit, license, or approval, that was granted by the city council; or 
c.  An alleged violation of regulations governing a person or entity who has received a license granted by the city council. 
(2)  Notice. The appeal under this section will be heard by the city council. Notice of the hearing must be delivered to the alleged violator or property owner and involved city staff, in person or by mail at least ten days in advance of the hearing. The parties to the hearing will have an opportunity to present oral or written arguments regarding the hearing officer's decision. 
(3)  Decisions. The city council must consider the record, the hearing officer's decision, and any additional arguments before making a determination. The city council is not bound by the hearing officer's decision, but may adopt all or part of the officer's decision. The council's decision must be in writing. 
(4)  Suspension or revocation. In addition to imposing a civil penalty, the council may suspend or revoke a city-issued license, permit, or other approval associated with the violation. 
(h)  Recovery of civil penalties and/or abatement actions . 
(1)  Nonpayment. If a civil penalty is not paid within the time specified: 
a.  It may constitute a lien on the real property upon which the violation occurred if the property or improvements on the property was the subject of the violation and the property owner was found responsible for that violation; or 
b.  It will be a personal obligation of the violator in all situations. 
(2)  Lien. A lien may be assessed against the property and collected in the same manner as real taxes as authorized by state law. 
(3)  Personal obligation. A personal obligation may be collected by appropriate legal means. 
(4)  Late fees/charges. 
a.  If after 30 days the fine has not been paid or a hearing requested, a late fee of 40 percent will be applied, the total bill will be assessed to the property taxes and all city licenses will be revoked. For continued violations, the city will correct or abate the violation and assess the charges for doing so onto the property taxes and/or criminal charges may be filed. 
b.  If the same property and property owner are charged with a subsequent violation(s) within a 12-month period for the same, or substantially similar offense, the initial fine will be increased by 100 percent. 
(5)  License revocation or suspension. Failure to pay a fine is grounds for suspending or revoking a license related to the violation. 
(i)  Criminal penalties. 
(1)  The following are misdemeanors, punishable in accordance with state law: 
a.  Failure, without good cause, to pay a fine or request a hearing within 30 days after issuance of an administrative citation; 
b.  Failure, without good cause, to appear at a hearing that was scheduled under subsection (e) of this section; 
c.  Failure to pay a fine imposed by a hearing officer within 30 days after it was imposed, or such other time as may be established by the hearing officer. 
(2)  If the final adjudication in the administrative penalty procedure is a finding of no violation, then the city may not prosecute a criminal violation in district court based on the same set of facts. This does not preclude the city from pursuing a criminal conviction for a violation of the same provisions based on a different set of facts. A different date of violation will constitute a different set of facts. 
(j)  Abatement of public nuisances or other Code violations . The city council has determined that the health, safety, good order, general welfare, and convenience of the public is threatened by certain public nuisances on property. It is declared to be the intention of the city council to correct or abate these nuisances or other Code violations, and this section is enacted for that purpose. This section shall apply to the abatement of all public nuisances or other Code violations as defined anywhere within this Code unless another procedure is specifically provided. 
(1)  Periodic inspection. The city shall cause to be inspected all public and private places within the city which might contain a public nuisance or other Code violations as defined in this Code as often as practicable to determine whether any such conditions exist. The city shall also investigate all reports of public nuisances located within the city. 
(2)  Abatement order. Upon a determination by the city that a public nuisance or other Code violation exists on any public or private property within the city, the city shall order the public nuisance or other Code violations to be abated in a manner consistent with this Code.

a.  Administrative notice . Upon the first violation, the city will issue an administrative notice to the violator specifying the nature of the nuisance or other Code violation that must be corrected. The city will deliver the administrative notice to the violator in person or by regular mail. The administrative notice shall also state that failure to abate the nuisance or request a hearing within the applicable time periods will result in summary abatement procedures, and that the cost of abatement will be assessed against the subject property. The violator will have seven calendar days to correct the violation after issuance of the administrative notice. If the violator is making a good faith attempt to remedy the violation, the city may grant an extension, the length of which must be agreed upon in writing between the city and the violator. 
b.  First administrative citation . If the violator fails to correct the violation within the time period provided in the administrative notice, the city may issue a first administrative citation. The city must issue the citation to the violator in person or by regular mail. In the case of a citation involving a vehicular offense, the citation shall be attached to the motor vehicle or recreational vehicle in addition to being delivered to the violator in person or by regular mail. The citation must state the date, time, and nature of the offense, the amount of the scheduled fine and/or the city's intention to abate the offense, and the manner for paying the fine, abating the offense and/or appealing the citation. The first administrative citation shall also state that failure to abate the nuisance or request a hearing within the applicable time periods will result in summary abatement procedures, and that the cost of abatement will be assessed against the subject property. The violator will have seven calendar days to correct the violation after issuance of the first administrative citation. 
c.  Second administrative citation . If the violator fails to correct the violation within the time period provided in the first administrative citation, the city may issue a second administrative citation. The city must issue the citation to the violator in person or by regular mail. The citation must state the date, time, and nature of the offense, the amount of the scheduled fine and/or the city's intention to abate the offense, and the manner for paying the fine, abating the offense and/or appealing the citation. The violator will have seven calendar days to correct the violation after issuance of the second administrative citation. The second administrative citation shall also state that failure to abate the nuisance or request a hearing within the applicable time periods will result in summary abatement procedures, and that the cost of abatement will be assessed against the subject property. Upon expiration of the time required by the second administrative citation, the city may immediately abate the nuisance. 
(4)  Any property owner who feels aggrieved by an administrative notice or administrative citation of the city issued pursuant to this section may request a hearing pursuant to section 2-60(d)(3) and (e). Within ten days after such hearing, the decision of the hearing officer shall be mailed to the parties. The hearing officer's order shall be accompanied by written findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order. An aggrieved party may obtain judicial review of the decision of the hearing officer or the city council provided in state law. A violator may also seek administrative review pursuant to section 2-60(g). The city shall take no action to abate any nuisance while the matter is still pending before the hearing officer. 
(5)  The recovery of civil penalties including assessment of a lien against the property apply to this section as set forth in section 2-60(h). The city shall keep a record of the costs of abatements performed under this section and shall report monthly to the city clerk or other appropriate city official all work done for which assessments are to be made, stating and certifying the description of the land, lots or parcels involved and the amount assessable to each. 
(6)  Interference prohibited. It is a misdemeanor for any person to prevent, delay or interfere with the city or their agents while they are engaged in the performance of duties set forth in this section. 
(7)  Immediate abatement. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city, without notice or other process, from immediately abating any condition that poses an imminent and serious hazard to human life or safety. 
(k)  Removal and impoundment of vehicles or recreational vehicles from private property . 
(1)  Authority to impound vehicles. The police may remove and impound or have removed and impounded any vehicle or recreational vehicle from private property, in the event of a violation of section 4-3(d)(8) relating to inoperable and/or unlicensed vehicles or recreational vehicles or 4-3(e) off-street parking requirements. If, following issuance of citation and failure of owner to cure the violation or request a hearing as set forth in this section, the police may proceed with impounding the vehicle or recreational vehicle. 
(2)  Notice of and procedure for impounding. The city shall follow the provisions of section 6-3 and 6-4 of this Code when impounding any vehicle or recreational vehicle from private property. Impounded vehicles or recreational vehicles may be reclaimed subject to provisions of section 6-4(e). If the vehicle or recreational vehicle is not reclaimed within the time period set forth in section 6-4(e), a public sale may occur pursuant to the provisions of section 6-4(f) and subject to Minnesota Statute Chapter 168B. 
(3)  Fine or penalty. The payment of towing and storage charges shall not operate to relieve the owner or operator of any vehicle or recreational vehicle from liability for any fine or penalty for the violation of this or any other law or provisions of this Code, for which the said vehicle or recreational vehicle was removed and impounded. 
(Ord. No. 14-07, §§ 1, 2, 4-28-2014; Ord. No. 16-02, § 1, 2-22-2016; Ord. No. 17-01, § 3, 1-23-2017; Ord. No. 18-25, § 2, 12-10-2018) 
Sec. 2-61. - Fees and charges policies. 
(a)  Assessable city charges certified to taxes. Minn. Stat. § 429.101 permits the city to certify to the county auditor delinquent unpaid billings for city services in the same manner as special assessments for public improvements to be collected with real estate taxes against offending lots or parcels owing for said services. Such services include, but are not limited to, water, sanitary and storm sewer, recycling, street lighting and weed and tree removal. In the event it becomes necessary to certify any unpaid billing for city services to the county auditor as a special assessment for the collection with real estate taxes, a certification processing fee will be charged to the costs so certified as specified in the city's fee schedule, in addition to the actual unpaid amount and applicable interest and/or penalty charges. This charge is necessary to cover the city's expense for certification and publication costs and administrative time spent to certify the unpaid billings to the county for collection. 
(b)  ACH electronic payment. If feasible, the city may implement the automatic clearing house (ACH) electronic payment procedure as its method of payment for city services billed to accounts on a regular basis. However, any service fee imposed by a bank rejecting an ACH electronic payment shall be charged back to the account holders billing using said payment method. 
(c)  On-line service charge. Any city transaction obtainable by internet access through the city's web site requiring payment of a fee shall be assessed an additional transaction fee as set forth in the city's fee schedule. This additional on-line service charge is necessary to reimburse the city for its cost to provide on-line permit access.

(3)  Notification. The building official shall notify the owner or the owner's agent in writing of the basis for the fine, revocation, suspension, denial or nonrenewal and the date upon which the city council shall review the request to fine, revoke, suspend, deny, or not renew the registration permit. The notice required by this section shall be served upon the owner or the owner's agent at least 20 days before the city council hearing. Service shall be deemed sufficient if the notice is sent to the owner or the owner's agent by first class mail at the address provided in the registration application. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or the owner's agent to notify the tenant in writing of the hearing date, time and place. 
(4)  Hearing. The owner or the owner's agent and the building official shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The owner may be represented by counsel and the building official may be represented by the city attorney. Both sides may be permitted to examine the other side's witness(es). The city council shall hear all relevant evidence and arguments and shall review all testimony, documents, and other evidence submitted. The city council shall record the hearing and keep a record of documentary evidence submitted. 
(5)  Decision. The city council shall make findings based on the evidence and shall make a decision on the recommendation to fine, revoke, suspend, deny, or nonrenew a registration permit based on the findings. The city council shall issue a written decision regarding the recommendation of the building official within 30 days following the date of the hearing and shall notify the appellant of the decision by first class mail with a duplicate copy to the building official. The decision shall specify the rental dwelling unit or units to which it applies. Thereafter, and until a registration permit is reissued or reinstated, no rental dwelling units that have had their rental registration permit revoked, suspended, denied, or nonrenewed may be re-let or occupied. Revocation, suspension, denial, or nonrenewal of a registration permit shall not excuse the owner from compliance with all terms of this section for as long as any rental dwelling units in the building are occupied. All fines are payable within 30 days of the council action imposing the fine. Failure to timely pay any fine imposed will result in a late fee equal to 25 percent of the fine and revocation or suspension of the registration permit to which the fine applies. 
(6)  Permit process after revocation, suspension, denial or renewal declination. After the city council revokes, suspends, denies or declines to renew a registration permit, no registration permit will be issued for the affected rental dwelling unit(s) until the building official determines that the applicant/owner has remedied the conditions identified by the city council as the basis for its action. An application to obtain a registration permit for a rental dwelling unit after the city council has revoked, suspended, denied or declined to renew a registration permit for the same rental dwelling unit(s) must be accompanied by all fees required by this section. 
(k)  Effect of revocation, suspension, denial, or nonrenewal. If a registration permit is revoked, suspended, denied or not renewed by the city council, it shall be unlawful for the owner or the owner's agent to thereafter permit the occupancy of the then vacant or, thereafter vacated, rental dwelling unit(s), until such time as a valid rental registration permit is obtained for the rental dwelling unit(s). Issuance of a new registration permit after revocation, suspension, denial or nonrenewal shall be made in the manner provided for in subsection (e) of this section. 
(l)  Posted to prevent occupancy. Whenever any rental dwelling unit has been denied an initial registration permit, had its registration permit revoked, suspended, denied or not renewed, it shall be posted by the building official to prevent further occupancy. No person other than the building official shall remove or alter any posting. The building official will post the date the rental dwelling unit shall be vacated and no person shall reside in, occupy or cause to be occupied that rental dwelling unit until the building official permits it. 
(m)  Penalties. A person who violates the provisions of this section 3-31 may be charged with a misdemeanor. Each day that a violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense. The building official may post the rental dwelling unit by appropriate signs or notices prohibiting occupancy and may act to cause the rental dwelling unit to be vacated or remain vacant until the code violations are corrected. 
(n)  No retaliation. Per Minn. Stat. § 504B.205.2, subd. 2 "Emergency calls permitted": 
(1)  A landlord may not: (1) bar or limit a residential tenant's right to call for police or emergency assistance in response to domestic abuse or any other conduct; or (2) impose a penalty on a residential tenant for calling for police or emergency assistance in response to domestic abuse or any other conduct. 
(2)  A residential tenant may not waive and a landlord may not require the residential tenant to waive the residential tenant's right to call for police or emergency assistance. 
(o)  No warranty by city. By enacting and undertaking to enforce this Code, the city, city council, its agents, and/or employees do not warrant or guaranty the safety, fitness or suitability of any dwelling in the city. Owners and occupants should take whatever steps they deem appropriate to protect their interests, health, safety and welfare. 
(p)  Best practices program. 
(1)  Program established. Rental properties with three or more units can qualify for the "Best Practices" program. Properties in compliance with the program requirements will receive a reduction in the annual rental registration permit fee as set out in the city's fee schedule. The "Best Practices" registration fee shall remain in effect as long as the "Best Practices" program requirements are maintained for the property as determined by the city. 
(2)  Program requirements. The "Best Practices" program qualification requirements are as follows: 
a.  Use of a city approved crime-free housing addendum or equivalent in all new and/or renewed leases;

e.  Attendance by the property manager each year at one New Hope Property Manager Association meeting; 
f.  During every inspection cycle, the property must fully comply with all property maintenance standards required by section 3-30 of this Code at the time of the first reinspection if needed.

(4)  Program disqualification. The city may terminate a property from the "Best Practices" program if it determines, in the city's sole discretion, that the property has failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (p)(2) of this section or has had a rental registration permit revoked per subsection (j) of this section. A rental property disqualified from the "Best Practices" program shall pay the nonparticipant registration permit fee to obtain the following year's registration permit. 
(5)  Reapplication procedure. If a property loses its "Best Practices" program status, the property owner may reapply for the program only after successfully passing the inspection during the following inspection cycle and re-submitting an application per subsection (p)(3) of this section.

Sec. 3-33. - Business use certificate of occupancy. 
(a)  Purpose and authority. The purpose of the business use certificate of occupancy procedure is to provide an administrative review process to ensure compliance with chapters 3 and 4 of this Code prior to the establishment or change of any business within the city. The city manager, or manager's designee, shall consider and render decisions on all applications for business use certificates of occupancy. 
(b)  Business use certificate of occupancy required. No person, firm, corporation or other entity shall conduct any business, including but not limited to nonprofit institutions, private schools and churches, within the city without having first obtained a valid business use certificate of occupancy from the city.

Upon the completion of all required corrections, the applicant shall be issued a business use certificate of occupancy.

Any change in tenant or occupant of premises, change in proprietor or owner of a business or material change in the business use of the premises by the same owner or occupant of the premises shall constitute a change for which a new business use certificate of occupancy shall be required. Any change in business location or change of the person or entity from that which is shown on the issued business use certificate of occupancy shall require a new certificate to be obtained. 
(h)  Denial, suspension, revocation.

(Ord. No. 14-08; §§ 1, 2, 9-8-2014) 
Sec. 3-34. - Vacant buildings. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section, pursuant to the authority of Minn. Stat. § 463.251, is to regulate vacant and hazardous dwellings and buildings in order to enhance the livability and preserve the tax base and property values of buildings within the city by assuring that vacant buildings that are capable of rehabilitation are adequately secured to prevent further dilapidation and those buildings that are not capable of rehabilitation are promptly demolished. 
(b)  Findings. The city council finds, determines and declares that buildings which remain vacant and unoccupied for an unreasonable period of time become an attractive nuisance to children, a harborage for rodents, an invitation to derelicts, vagrants and criminals as a temporary abode and an increased fire hazard; that the owners of such buildings may permit the buildings to become dilapidated since the buildings are often economically obsolete and the owners of such buildings are unwilling to expend the necessary funds to secure the buildings; that such buildings contribute to the growth of blight within the city, depress market values of surrounding properties, require additional government services, constitute an unreasonable use and condition to the annoyance, discomfort and repose of a considerable number of the public, and thus may constitute a nuisance condition. Adequate protection of the public health, safety and welfare, therefore, requires the establishment and enforcement of the means by which such nuisance conditions may be abated. 
(c)  Securing vacant buildings. 
(1)  Notice and order. In general, if any building becomes vacant or unoccupied and is deemed hazardous due to the fact that the building is open to trespass and has not been secured and the building could be made safe by securing the building, the city manager or the building official or their designated representatives may order the building secured and shall cause notice of the order to be served upon the owner of the premises or the owner's agent, the taxpayer identified in the property tax records for the parcel, the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate and any neighborhood association for the neighborhood in which the building is located that has requested notice. Such notice may be served personally or by mail. Service by mail is completed upon mailing a copy of the order to the parties designated herein, by first-class mail, at their last known address. 
(2)  Securing building by city; lien. If the owner fails to comply with or provide a reasonable plan and schedule to comply with the order within six days after the order is served, the building shall be boarded up or otherwise properly secured. Whenever a building is boarded up pursuant to the authority of this section, all openings to the building shall be boarded and secured. In securing the building, any reasonable action may be taken to insure that the gas, electric and water utilities serving the building are in an appropriate condition so as not to contribute any further damages to the property during the period that the building remains vacant and unoccupied. 
(3)  Emergencies. When it is determined by the city manager or the city manager's designee that an emergency exists with respect to the health or safety of persons in the community, and an immediate boarding and securing of a building is required, and where danger will exist to children, transients or others or the building itself in the absence of an immediate boarding or securing of the building, the city manager or the city manager's designee may waive all requirements herein and immediately cause the building to be boarded or otherwise secured, provided that: 
a.  The conditions showing the existence of an emergency are documented by the city manager or the city manager's designee; and 
b.  Notice is mailed immediately by the city manager or the city manager's designee invoking this section to the last known address of the owner of the premises or the owner's agent, the taxpayer identified in the property tax records for the parcel, the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate and any neighborhood association for the neighborhood in which the building is located that has requested notice, of the date of the boarding or otherwise securing of the property and the reasons therefor. 
(d)  Resecuring building. After a vacant or unoccupied building has been boarded or otherwise secured under this section, should the owner fail to maintain the building in a secured condition until such time as it has been repaired and occupied, the city shall resecure any openings into the building whenever it becomes open to trespass, without further notice to owner of the premises or the owner's agent, the taxpayer identified in the property tax records for the parcel, the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate and any neighborhood association. 
(e)  Collection of costs. All costs incurred by the city for boarding or otherwise securing a building under this section, including, but not limited to, the actual costs for boarding, inspecting, posting, administration and monitoring the building shall be the responsibility of the owner. Payment of the costs incurred by the city shall be due within 30 days of such notification. Upon default of payment after the 30-day notification period, the costs shall be levied and collected as a special assessment against the property pursuant to the authority of Minn. Stat. § 463.21.

Secs. 3-35-3-49. - Reserved. 
Sec. 3-50. - Sign code. 
(a)  Preamble. The city council finds that a lack of a comprehensive, constitutionally sound sign code regulating signs in the City of New Hope constitutes an emergency threatening public health, safety and welfare. Among the city's concerns are: 
(1)  Signs could be erected without regard to the manner in which the size, number, or location of the signs interferes with traffic sight lines, endangering or distracting drivers and pedestrians alike, thereby causing traffic hazards. 
(2)  Signs could be constructed in a manner or of materials that are structurally unsound and vulnerable to collapse, endangering persons or property in the vicinity of the signs. The following code is adopted as section 3-50 of the New Hope City Code. 
(b)  Findings, title, purpose, intent and effect. 
(1)  Findings. The city council hereby finds as follows: 
a.  Exterior signs have substantial impact on the character and quality of the environment. 
b.  Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. 
c.  Signs can create traffic hazards, aesthetic concerns and detriments to property values, thereby threatening the public health, safety and welfare. 
d.  The city's zoning regulations have included the regulation of signs in an effort to provide adequate means of expression and to promote the economic viability of the business community, while protecting the city and its citizens from a proliferation of signs of a type, size, location and character that would adversely impact upon the aesthetics of the community and threaten the health, safety and welfare of the community. The regulation of the physical characteristics of signs within the city has had a positive impact on traffic safety and the appearance of the community. 
(2)  Code. This section 3-50 through subsection (n) shall be known, cited and referred to as the "New Hope Sign Code" except as referred to herein, where it shall be known as the "sign code."

The purpose and intent of this Code is to: 
a.  Regulate the number, location, size, type, illumination and other physical characteristics of signs within the city in order to promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
b.  Maintain, enhance and improve the aesthetic environment of the city by preventing visual clutter that is harmful to the appearance of the community. 
c.  Improve the visual appearance of the city while providing for effective means of communication, consistent with constitutional guarantees and the city's goals of public safety and aesthetics. 
d.  Provide for fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations set forth herein under the zoning authority of the city. 
(4)  Effect. A sign may be erected, mounted, displayed or maintained in the city if it is in conformance with the provisions of this Code. The effect of this Code, as more specifically set forth herein, is to: 
a.  Allow a wide variety of sign types in commercial zones, and a more limited variety of signs in other zones, subject to the standards set forth in this sign code. 
b.  Allow certain small, unobtrusive signs incidental to the principal use of a site in all zones when in compliance with the requirements of this sign code. 
c.  Prohibit signs whose location, size, type, illumination or other physical characteristics negatively affect the environment and where the communication can be accomplished by means having a lesser impact on the environment and the public health, safety and welfare. 
d.  Provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this sign code. 
(c)  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this sign code is for any reason held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining portions of this sign code. The city council hereby declares that it would have adopted the sign code in each section, subsection, sentence, or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared invalid.

(2)  Adjudication of invalid application. If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the application of any provision of this Code to a particular property, building, or other structure, such judgment shall not affect the application of said provision to any other property, building, or structure not specifically included in said judgment.

Sec. 4-3. - General provisions. 
(a)  Nonconforming buildings, structures and uses. 
(1)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures and uses and to specify those requirements, circumstances and conditions under which nonconforming buildings, structures and uses will be operated and maintained. The zoning code establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of uses which are permitted in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of these districts that nonconforming buildings, structures and uses not be permitted to continue without restriction. Furthermore, it is the intent of this section that all nonconforming uses shall be eventually brought into conformity. 
(2)  Grandfather clause. Any structure or use lawfully existing on July 5, 1979, shall not be enlarged, but may be continued at the size and in the manner of operation existing upon such date except as hereinafter specified or, subsequently amended. 
(3)  Remedial work. Nothing in this Code shall prevent the placing of a structure in safe condition when said structure is declared unsafe by the building official providing the necessary repairs shall not constitute more than 50 percent of fair market value of such structure. Said value shall be determined by the city assessor. 
(4)  Moving of nonconforming structures. No nonconforming building, structure or use shall be moved to another lot or to any other part of the parcel of land upon which the same was constructed or was conducted at the time of this Code adoption unless such movement shall bring the nonconformance into compliance with the requirements of this Code. 
(5)  Reversal of nonconformity. When any lawful nonconforming use of any structure or land in any district has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to any nonconforming use. 
(6)  Reduction of nonconformity. A lawful nonconforming use of a structure or parcel of land may be changed to lessen the nonconformity of use. Once a nonconforming structure or parcel of land has been changed, it shall not thereafter be so altered as to increase the nonconformity. 
(7)  Partial destruction. If at any time a nonconforming building, structure or use shall be destroyed to the extent of more than 50 percent of its fair market value, said value to be determined by the city assessor, then without further action by the council, the building and the land on which such building was located or maintained shall, from and after the date of said destruction, be subject to all the regulations specified by these zoning regulations for the district in which such land and buildings are located. Any building which is damaged to an extent of less than 50 percent of its value may be restored to its former extent provided reconstruction is completed within 12 months of said damage. Estimate of the extent of damage or destruction shall be made by the building official. 
(8)  Discontinuance. Whenever a lawful nonconforming use of a structure or land is discontinued for a period of six months, any future use of said structure or land shall be made to conform with the provisions of this Code. 
(9)  Alterations. Alteration and normal maintenance to a lawful nonconforming building or structure may be made provided:

1.  Expansion of buildings found to be nonconforming only by reason of height, yard setback, lot area or off-street parking may be permitted provided the structural nonconformity is not increased and the expansion complies with the performance standards of this Code. 
2.  Lawful nonconforming single-family and two-family units may be expanded to improve the livability provided the nonconformity of the structure is not increased. 
b.  Conditional use permit. Lawful nonconforming commercial, industrial, public, semipublic, and multiple-family structures may be expanded on the same lot by conditional use permit in accordance with section 4-33 of this Code. 
1.  Expansion of buildings found to be nonconforming only by reason of height and setback are exempt from requiring a conditional use permit. 
2.  Except for the above, the expansion will not increase the nonconformity of the building or site. 
3.  The new building expansion will conform with all applicable performance standards of this Code. A conditional use permit shall not be issued under this section for a deviation from other requirements of this Code unless variances are also approved. 
4.  The request for conditional use permit shall be evaluated based on standards and criteria set forth in subsection 4-33(c) of this Code.

11.  Placement of natural rock rip rap, including associated grading of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the landward extent of the rip rap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water level, and the height of the rip rap above the ordinary high water level does not exceed three feet. 
e.  Connections to public waters. Excavations where the intended purpose is connection to a public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors, must be controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for excavations may be given only after the commissioner has approved the proposed connection to public waters. 
(4)  Stormwater management. The following general and specific standards shall apply: 
a.  General standards. 
1.  When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands, and vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater runoff before discharge to public waters. 
2.  Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential, and reduce and delay runoff velocities, erosion potential, and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment on the site. 
3.  When development density, topographic features, and soil and vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used. Preference must be given to designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried pipes and manmade materials and facilities. 
b.  Specific standards. 
1.  Impervious surface lot coverage shall not exceed 35 percent of the lot area, except as a conditional use, which shall comply with the following standards: 
i.  All structures, additions or expansions shall meet setback and other requirements of this Code. 
ii.  The lot shall be served with municipal sewer and water. 
iii.  The lot shall provide for the collection and treatment of stormwater in compliance with the city surface water management plan if determined that the site improvements will result in increased runoff directly entering a public water.

(Memo. of 2-5-2018) 
Sec. 4-26. - Floodplain district. 
(a)  Statutory authorization . The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minn. Stat. Ch. 103F and Ch. 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council of New Hope, Minnesota, does ordain as follows: 
(1)  Statement of purpose: 
a.  This section regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the City of New Hope. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment to the tax base. It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions. 
b.  National Flood Insurance Program compliance. This section is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the community's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
c.  This section is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development. 
(b)  General provisions . 
(1)  How to use this section. This section adopts the floodplain maps applicable to the City of New Hope and includes three floodplain districts: floodway, flood fringe, and general floodplain. 
a.  Where floodway and flood fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps, the standards in subsections 4-26(d) or (e) will apply depending on the location of a property. 
b.  Locations where floodway and flood fringe districts are not delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the general floodplain district. Within the general floodplain district, the floodway district standards in section 4-26(d) apply unless the floodway boundary is determined, according to the process outlined in section 4-26(f). Once the floodway boundary is determined, the flood fringe district standards in section 4-26(e) may apply outside the floodway. 
(2)  Lands to which this section applies. This section applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of New Hope shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of the floodway, flood fringe, or general floodplain districts. 
a.  The floodway, flood fringe and general floodplain districts are overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other requirements in this section. In case of a conflict, the more restrictive standards will apply. 
(3)  Incorporation of maps by reference. The following maps together with all attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the official zoning map and this section. The attached material includes the flood insurance study for Hennepin County, Minnesota, and incorporated areas, dated November 4, 2016 and the flood insurance rate map panels enumerated below, dated November 4, 2016, all prepared by the federal emergency management agency. These materials are on file in the city clerk's office. 
Effective flood insurance rate map panels: 
27053C0184F 27053C0192F 27053C0194F 
27053C0203F 27053C0211F 27053C0213F 
(4)  Interpretation. The boundaries of the floodplain district shall be determined by scaling distances on the flood insurance rate map. 
a.  Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the official zoning map and actual field conditions, the flood elevations shall be the governing factor. The zoning administrator must interpret the boundary location based on the ground elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the regulatory floodplain, and other available technical data. 
b.  Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the planning commission and to submit technical evidence. 
(5)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or other private agreements. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section prevail. All other sections inconsistent with this section are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(6)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. This section does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This section does not create liability on the part of the City of New Hope or its officers or employees for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(7)  Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this section is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the remainder of this section shall not be affected and shall remain in full force. 
(8)  Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this section must be interpreted according to common usage and so as to give this section its most reasonable application. 
    Accessory use or structure . A use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure. 
    Base flood elevation The elevation of the "regional flood." The term "base flood elevation" is used in the flood insurance survey.

2.  The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood. 
    Critical facilities . Facilities necessary to a community's public health and safety, those that store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials, and those that house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury. Examples of critical facilities include hospitals, correctional facilities, schools, daycare facilities, nursing homes, fire and police stations, wastewater treatment facilities, public electric utilities, water plants, fuel storage facilities, and waste handling and storage facilities. 
    Development . Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Equal degree of encroachment . A method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that floodplain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows. 
    Flood . A temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas. 
    Flood frequency . The frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded. 
    Flood fringe . The portion of the special flood hazard area (one percent annual chance flood) located outside of the floodway. Flood fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the flood insurance study for Hennepin County, Minnesota. 
    Flood insurance rate map . Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM). 
    Flood prone area . Any land susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see "flood"). 
    Floodplain . The beds proper and the areas adjoining a wetland, lake or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regional flood.

    One-hundred-year floodplain . Lands inundated by the "reginal flood" (see definition). 
    Principal use or structure . All uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures. 
    Reach . A hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or manmade obstruction. In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach. 
    Recreational vehicle . A vehicle that is built on a single chassis, is 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this section, the term recreational vehicle is synonymous with the term "travel trailer/travel vehicle." 
    Regional flood . A flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the one percent chance or 100-year recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood" used in a flood insurance study. 
    Regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) . An elevation not less than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
    Repetitive loss . Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Special flood hazard area . A term used for flood insurance purposes synonymous with "one-hundred-year floodplain." 
    Start of construction . Includes substantial improvement, and means the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement that occurred before the permit's expiration date. The actual start is either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure . Anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in subsection 4-26(i)(2)b. of this section and other similar items. 
    Substantial damage . Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement . Within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." For the purpose of this section, "historic structure" is as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1. 
(9)  Annexations. The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference into subsection 4-26(b)(3) above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the City of New Hope at the time of adoption of this section. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the City of New Hope after the date of adoption of this section, the newly annexed floodplain lands will be subject to the provisions of this section immediately upon the date of annexation. 
(c)  Establishment of zoning districts . 
(1)  Districts. 
a.  Floodway district . The floodway district includes those areas within zones AE that have a floodway delineated as shown on the flood insurance rate map adopted in subsection 4-26(b)(3), or are determined to be in the floodway through the evaluation criteria specified in subsection 4-26(f)(2). 
b.  Flood fringe district . The flood fringe district includes areas within zones AE that have a floodway delineated on the flood insurance rate map adopted in subsection 4-26(b)(3), but are located outside of the floodway. For lakes, wetlands and other basins within zones AE that do not have a floodway delineated, the flood fringe district also includes those areas below the one percent annual chance (100-year) flood elevation but above the ordinary high water level as defined in Minn. Stat. § 103G.005, subdivision 14.

a.  The use must have a low flood damage potential. 
b.  The use must not obstruct flood flows or cause any increase in flood elevations and must not involve structures, obstructions, or storage of materials or equipment. 
c.  Any facility that will be used by employees or the general public must be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of four upon occurrence of the regional (one percent chance) flood. 
(3)  Conditional uses. The following uses may be allowed as conditional uses following the standards and procedures set forth in subsection 4-26(j)(4) of this section and further subject to the standards set forth in subsection 4-26(d)(4), if otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district or any applicable overlay district.

(4)  Standards for floodway conditional uses. 
a.  All uses. A conditional use must not cause any increase in the stage of the one percent chance or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected. 
b.  Fill; storage of materials and equipment. 
1.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
2.  Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain must be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method. Permanent sand and gravel operations and similar uses must be covered by a long-term site development plan. 
3.  Temporary placement of fill, other materials, or equipment which would cause an increase to the stage of the one percent chance or regional flood may only be allowed if the New Hope City Council has approved a plan that assures removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. 
c.  Accessory structures. Accessory structures, as identified in subsection 4-26(d)(3)a., may be permitted, provided that: 
1.  Structures are not intended for human habitation; 
2.  Structures will have a low flood damage potential; 
3.  Structures will be constructed and placed so as to offer a minimal obstruction to the flow of floodwaters; 
4.  Service utilities, such as electrical and heating equipment, within these structures must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed; 
5.  Structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code. All floodproofed structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
6.  As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment and does not exceed 576 square feet in size. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria: 
(i)  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and 
(ii)  There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
d.  Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters are subject to the provisions of Minn. Stat. § 103G.245. 
e.  A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must not cause an increase to the one percent chance or regional flood. The technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream. 
f.  Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system. 
(e)  Flood fringe district (FF) . 
(1)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses are those uses of land or structures allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the standards in subsection 4-26(e)(2). If no pre-existing, underlying zoning districts exist, then any residential or nonresidential structure or use of a structure or land is a permitted use provided it does not constitute a public nuisance. 
(2)  Standards for flood fringe permitted uses. 
a.  All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures must be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill must extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure. 
b.  Accessory structures. As an alternative to the fill requirements of subsection 4-26(e)(2)a., structures accessory to the uses identified in subsection 4-26(e)(1) may be permitted to be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP3 or FP4 floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code, provided that: 
1.  The accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 576 square feet in size, and is only used for parking and storage. 
2.  All portions of floodproofed accessory structures below the regulatory flood protection elevation must be: (i) adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls, (ii) be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, and (iii) must have all service utilities be watertight or elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
3.  Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following criteria: 
(i)  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and 
(ii)  There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
c.  The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel must not exceed 1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection 4-26(e)(2)a. of this section, or if allowed as a conditional use under subsection 4-26(e)(3)c. below. 
d.  The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
e.  All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or watertight to prevent infiltration of floodwaters. 
f.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
g.  All fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. 
h.  All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation, or must have a flood warning/emergency evacuation plan acceptable to the City of New Hope City Council. 
i.  Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at an elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, any facilities used by employees or the general public must be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of four upon occurrence of the regional (one percent chance) flood. 
j.  Interference with normal manufacturing/industrial plant operations must be minimized, especially along streams having protracted flood durations. In considering permit applications, due consideration must be given to the needs of industries with operations that require a floodplain location. 
k.  Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the standards of subsection 4-26(i) of this section. 
(3)  Conditional uses. The following uses and activities may be allowed as conditional uses, if allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any applicable overlay district, following the procedures in subsection 4-26(j)(4) of this section. 
a.  Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with subsections 4-26(e)(2)a. and 4-26(e)(2)b. of this section. 
b.  Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
c.  The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill when the fill is not being used to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection 4-26(e)(2)a. of this section. 
(4)  Standards for flood fringe conditional uses. 
a.  The standards listed in subsections 4-26(e)(2)d.-k. apply to all conditional uses. 
b.  Basements, as defined by subsection 4-26(b)(8)c. of this section, are subject to the following: 
1.  Residential basement construction is not allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
2.  Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with subsection 4-26(e)(4)c. of this section. 
c.  All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation must be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP1 or FP2 floodproofing classification in the State Building Code, which requires making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. 
d.  The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material on a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a structure to the regulatory flood protection elevation) must comply with an approved erosion/sedimentation control plan. 
1.  The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the regional (one percent chance) flood event. 
2.  The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the City of New Hope City Council. 
3.  The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists. 
e.  Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood protection elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for removal of such materials within the time available after a flood warning. 
(f)  General floodplain district (GF) . 
(1)  Permitted uses: 
a.  The uses listed in subsection 4-26(d)(1) of this section, floodway district permitted uses, are permitted uses. 
b.  All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria specified in subsection 4-26(f)(2) below. Subsection 4-26(d) applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the floodway district. Subsection 4-26(e) applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the flood fringe district. 
(2)  Procedures for floodway and flood fringe determinations: 
a.  Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the general floodplain district, the zoning administrator must obtain, review and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source. 
b.  If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, the applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use would fall within the floodway or flood fringe district. Information must be consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards and the standards in subsection 4-26(f)(2)c. below. 
c.  The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the following components, as applicable: 
1.  Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (one percent chance) flood. 
2.  Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas. 
3.  Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half-foot. A lesser stage increase than one-half-foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 
d.  The zoning administrator will review the submitted information and assess the technical evaluation and the recommended floodway and/or flood fringe district boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of previous floodway encroachments. The zoning administrator may seek technical assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency, including the department of natural resources. Based on this assessment, the zoning administrator may approve or deny the application. 
e.  Once the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries have been determined, the zoning administrator must process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of subsections 4-26(d) and 4-26(e) of this section. 
(g)  Land development standards . 
(1)  In general. Recognizing that floodprone areas may exist outside of the designated floodplain districts, the requirements of this section apply to all land within the City of New Hope. 
(2)  Subdivisions. No land may be subdivided which is unsuitable for reasons of flooding or inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. Manufactured home parks and recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds are considered subdivisions under this section. 
a.  All lots within the floodplain districts must be able to contain a building site outside of the floodway district at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
b.  All subdivisions must have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation, unless a flood warning emergency plan for the safe evacuation of all vehicles and people during the regional (one percent chance) flood has been approved by the City of New Hope City Council. The plan must be prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified individual, and must demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation.

1.  Variances must not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
2.  Variances may only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or sections. 
3.  Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
d.  Flood insurance notice . The zoning administrator must notify the applicant for a variance that: 1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 2) such construction below the base or regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification must be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
e.  General considerations . The community may consider the following factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and conditional uses in floodplains: 
1.  The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments; 
2.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of others; 
3.  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the ability of these systems to minimize the potential for disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions; 
4.  The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
5.  The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use to the community; 
6.  The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location; 
7.  The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding; 
8.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future; 
9.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive land use plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
10.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
11.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site. 
f.  Submittal of hearing notices to the department of natural resources (DNR) . The City of New Hope City Council must submit hearing notices for proposed variances to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days' notice of the hearing.

a.  A nonconforming use, structure, or occupancy must not be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way that increases its flood damage potential or degree of obstruction to flood flows except as provided in subsection 4-26(k)(1)b. below. Expansion or enlargement of uses, structures or occupancies within the floodway district is prohibited. 
b.  Any addition or structural alteration to a nonconforming structure or nonconforming use that would result in increasing its flood damage potential must be protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP1 thru FP4 floodproofing classifications) allowable in the State Building Code, except as further restricted in [subsections] 4-26(k)(1)c.-g. below. 
c.  If the cost of all previous and proposed alterations and additions exceeds 50 percent of the market value of any nonconforming structure, that shall be considered substantial improvement, and the entire structure must meet the standards of subsection 4-26(d) or (e) of this section for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the floodway or flood fringe district, respectively. The cost of all structural alterations and additions must include all costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. 
d.  If any nonconforming use, or any use of a nonconforming structure, is discontinued for more than one year, any future use of the premises must conform to this section. The assessor must notify the zoning administrator in writing of instances of nonconformities that have been discontinued for a period of more than one year. 
e.  If any nonconformity is substantially damaged, as defined in subsection 4-26(b)(8) of this section, it may not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this section. The applicable provisions for establishing new uses or new structures in subsections 4-26(d) or 4-26(e) will apply depending upon whether the use or structure is in the floodway or flood fringe, respectively. 
f.  If any nonconforming use or structure experiences a repetitive loss, be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this section. 
g.  Any substantial improvement, as defined in subsection 4-26(b)(8) of this section, to a nonconforming structure requires that the existing structure and any additions must meet the requirements of subsection 4-26(d) or 4-26(e) of this section for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the floodway or flood fringe district. 
(l)  Penalties and enforcement . 
(1)  Violation constitutes a misdemeanor. Violation of the provisions of this section or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or conditional uses) constitute a misdemeanor and will be punishable as defined by law. 
(2)  Other lawful action. Nothing in this section restricts the City of New Hope from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the zoning administrator within the specified period of time, each additional day that lapses will constitute an additional violation of this section and will be prosecuted accordingly. 
(3)  Enforcement. Violations of the provisions of this section will be investigated and resolved in accordance with the provisions of section 4-30 of the zoning section/code. In responding to a suspected section violation, the zoning administrator and City of New Hope City Council may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, program for denial of flood insurance availability to the guilty party. The City of New Hope must act in good faith to enforce these official controls and to correct section violations to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(m)  Amendments . 
(1)  Floodplain designation-Restrictions on removal. The floodplain designation on the official zoning map must not be removed from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the floodplain. Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the commissioner of the department of natural resources (DNR) if the commissioner determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately protected for the intended use. 
(2)  Amendments require DNR approval. All amendments to this section must be submitted to and approved by the commissioner of the department of natural resources (DNR) prior to adoption. The commissioner must approve the amendment prior to community approval.

Sec. 4-33. - Administration-Conditional use permit. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of a conditional use permit is to provide the city with a reasonable and legally permissible degree of discretion in determining the suitability of certain designated uses upon the general welfare, public health and safety. In making a determination, to allow a conditional use permit application, the city may consider the nature of the adjoining land or buildings, similar uses already in existence and located on the same premises or on other lands close by, the effect upon traffic into and from the premises, or on any adjoining roads, and any other factors bearing on the general welfare, public health and safety from the approval of the conditional use permit. 
(b)  Procedure. An application for a conditional use permit requires a public hearing and shall be processed pursuant to the provisions outlined in subsection 4-30(c) of this Code. 
(c)  Criteria for decision. The planning commission and city council shall consider possible adverse effects of the proposed conditional use. In determining whether to approve or deny a conditional use permit, the city council and planning commission shall find that the conditional use permit complies with the following criteria. The burden of proof demonstrating compliance with the following criteria shall be the responsibility of the applicant. 
(1)  Comprehensive plan. The proposed action has been considered in relation to the specific policies and provisions of and has been found to be consistent with the official comprehensive municipal plan of the city. 
(2)  Compatibility. The proposed use is compatible with adjacent present and future anticipated land uses. 
(3)  Performance standards. The proposed use conforms with all applicable performance standards contained in this Code. 
(4)  No depreciation in value. The proposed use will not tend to or actually depreciate the area in which it is proposed. 
(5)  Zoning district criteria. In addition to the above general criteria, the proposed use meets the criteria specified for the various zoning districts. 
(6)  In residential districts (R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-B, R-O): 
a.  Traffic. Nonresidential traffic is channeled into thoroughfares or onto a street abutting business or industrial uses leading directly to thoroughfares, and not onto minor residential streets. 
b.  Screening. The proposed use will be sufficiently separated by distance or screening from adjacent residentially zoned land so that existing homes will not be materially depreciated in value and there will be no deterrence to development of vacant land. 
c.  Compatible appearance. The structure and site shall have an appearance that will not have an adverse effect upon adjacent residential properties. 
(7)  In business districts (LB, CB): 
a.  Traffic. The proposed use will not cause traffic hazards or congestion. 
b.  Nearby residences. Adjacent residentially-zoned land will not be adversely affected because of traffic generation, noise, glare, or other nuisance characteristics. 
c.  Effect on other businesses. Existing businesses nearby will not be adversely affected because of curtailment of customer trade brought about by intrusion of unduly heavy nonshopping traffic or general unsightliness. 
(8)  In industrial districts (I): 
a.  Nuisance. Nuisance characteristics generated by the use will not have an adverse effect upon existing and future development in adjacent areas. 
b.  Economic return. The use will provide an economic return to the community and be commensurate with other industrial uses for which the property could feasible be used. In considering the economic return to the community, the planning commission and city council may give weight to the sociological impact of a proposed use, both positive and negative. 
(d)  Conditional use permit amendment. No significant change in size (more than 25 percent of building size), circumstances or scope of operations for a use permitted by an approved conditional use permit shall be undertaken or allowed to remain uncorrected for any significant period of time without approval of an amendment by the city council. 
(1)  What circumstances constitute a significant change or changes shall be determined by the city manager or designated agent and may include, but are not limited to, expansion of structures and/or premises or operational modifications that affect the intensity of use. Significant changes in the scope of the approved use may include, but not be limited to, removal or abandonment of any important facility or use, hours of operation, number of employees or increased traffic and like. 
(2)  Holders of a conditional use permit may request an amendment to the permit at any time pursuant to the provisions for application set forth in subsection 4-30(c). 
(3)  The city council may initiate an amendment of an existing conditional use permit if a finding is made that the circumstances or scope of the proposed use have changed significantly, including the application of additional or revised conditions pursuant to the following process: 
a.  The application shall be processed and considered pursuant to subsection 4-30(c) of this Code. 
b.  The zoning administrator shall notify the responsible holder of the permit of the application and that they have an opportunity to appear before the planning commission and/or city council to show cause why the permit should or should not be amended. 
c.  The zoning administrator shall provide the responsible holder of the permit a notice of any decision as well as a copy of the proceedings and adopted findings of the city council. 
(e)  Conditional use permit revocation. The city council may initiate the revocation of an existing conditional use permit for cause, upon determination that the authorized conditional use is not in conformance with the conditions of the permit, that there has been a substantial change in the use or facility not in conformance with the original approval, that facilities or uses integral to the original approval have been abandoned or not timely replaced or repaired, or is in continued violation of existing city ordinances, codes or other applicable regulations. 
(1)  The city council may initiate a revocation of an approved conditional use permit subject to the following procedure: 
a.  The application shall be processed and considered pursuant to subsection 4-30(c) of this Code. 
b.  The zoning administrator shall notify the responsible holder of the permit of the application that they have an opportunity to appear before the planning commission and/or city council to show cause why the permit should not be revoked. 
c.  The zoning administrator shall provide the responsible holder of the permit a notice of any decision as well as a copy of the proceedings and adopted findings of the city council. 
Sec. 4-34. - Administration-PUD, planned unit development. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section of the zoning code is to provide for the grouping of lots or buildings for development as an integrated, coordinated unit as opposed to traditional parcel by parcel, piecemeal, sporadic and unplanned approach to development. This section is intended to introduce flexibility of site design and architecture for the conservation of land and open space through clustering of lots, buildings and activities, which promote the goals outlined in the comprehensive plan or serve another public purpose. It is further intended that planned unit developments are to be characterized by central management, integrated planning and architecture, joint and common use and maintenance of parking, open space and other similar facilities, and harmonious selection and efficient distribution of uses. The PUD process, by allowing deviation from the strict provisions of this Code related to setbacks, heights, lot area, width and depth, yards, etc., and from the provisions of section 3-50, New Hope Sign Code, by either conditional use permit or rezoning to a PUD district, is intended to encourage: 
(1)  A development pattern in harmony with the objectives of the comprehensive plan. (PUD is not intended as a means to vary applicable planning and zoning principles.) 
(2)  Innovations in development to the end that the growing demands for all styles of economic expansion may be met by greater variety in type, design, and siting of structures and by the conservation and more efficient use of land in such developments. 
(3)  The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as existing vegetation, natural topography and geologic features and the prevention of soil erosion. 
(4)  A creative use of land and related physical development which allows a phased and orderly transition of varying land uses in close proximity to each other. 
(5)  An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets thereby lowering development costs and public investments. 
(6)  Promotion of a desirable and creative environment that might be prevented through the strict application on zoning and subdivision regulations of the city. 
(b)  General requirements and standards for a PUD. 
(1)  Ownership. An application for PUD approval must be filed by the landowner or jointly by all landowners of the property included in a project. The application and all submissions must be directed to the development of the property as a unified whole. In the case of multiple ownership, the approved PUD shall be binding on all owners. 
(2)  Comprehensive plan consistency. The proposed PUD shall be consistent with the city comprehensive plan. 
(3)  Common open space. Common open space at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements established in this Code and such complementary structures and improvements as are necessary and appropriate for the benefit and enjoyment of the residents of the PUD shall be provided within the area of the PUD. 
(4)  Operating and maintenance requirements for PUD common open space/facilities. Whenever common open space or service facilities are provided within the PUD, the PUD plan shall contain provisions to assure the continued operation and maintenance of such open space and service facilities to a predetermined reasonable standard. Common open space and service facilities within a PUD may be placed under the ownership of one or more of the following: 
a.  Landlord-tenant. Landlord control, where only use by tenants is anticipated.

2.  Owner's association. The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions shall provide that an owner's association or corporation shall be formed and that all owners shall be members of said association or corporation which shall maintain all properties and common areas in good repair and which shall assess individual property owners proportionate shares of joint or common costs. 
3.  Open space permanent. The open space restrictions must be permanent and not for a given period of years. 
4.  Liability for costs. The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local taxes, and the maintenance of the open space facilities to be deeded to it. 
(5)  Staging of public and common open space dedication. When a PUD provides for common or public open space, the total area of common or public open space or land escrow security in any stage of development, shall, at a minimum, bear the same relationship to the total open space to be provided in the entire PUD as the stages or units completed or under development bear to the entire PUD. 
(6)  Density. The exact density allowable shall be determined by standards agreed upon between the applicant and the city. Whenever any PUD is to be developed in stages, no such stage shall, when averaged with all previously completed stages, have a residential density that exceeds 25 percent of the proposed residential density of the entire PUD. 
(7)  Underground utilities. In any PUD, all utilities, including, but not limited to, telephone, electricity, gas and cable television shall be installed underground. 
(8)  Utility connections.

b.  Parking. No portion of the required private road system may be used in calculating required off-street parking space or be used for parking. 
(10)  Landscaping. In any PUD, landscaping shall be provided according to a plan approved by the city council, which shall include a detailed planting list with sizes and species indicated as part of the final plan. In assessing the landscaping plan, the city council shall consider the natural features of the particular site, the architectural characteristics of the proposed structures and the overall scheme of the PUD plan. 
(11)  Public services. The proposed project shall be served by the city water and sewer system and fire hydrants shall be installed at such locations as necessary to provide fire protection. 
(12)  Refuse. Provision for trash pick-up shall be provided according to a plan approved by the city council. 
(13)  Development agreement. Prior to a rezoning or the issuance of a building permit as part of planned unit development, the permit, applicant, builder, or developer shall execute and deliver to the council a development agreement. The agreement shall detail all use restrictions and required on and off-site improvements conditional to the PUD rezoning or CUP approval. The agreement shall provide for the installation within one year of the off-site and on-site improvements as approved by the council, secured by a cash escrow or surety bond in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to the city, to insure the city that such improvements will be actually constructed and installed according to specifications and plans approved by the city as expressed in such agreement. The amount of the bond shall be one and one-half times the estimated cost of the improvements as determined by the city engineer or city building official. 
(c)  Residential planned unit development, CUP, requirements. 
(1)  Purpose. It is the intent of this section to establish special requirements for the granting of a conditional use permit for residential PUD projects which are in compliance with the density, permitted and conditional uses allowed in a specific base district including dwellings, offices and institutional uses of one or more buildings in relation to an overall design, and integrated physical plan and in accordance with the provisions and procedures as prescribed in sections 4-30, 4-33 and 4-34 of this Code.

c.  Building separation. Buildings within the same lot shall maintain a minimum setback of ten feet between buildings. 
(3)  Density bonus. As a consequence of a planned unit development's planned and integrated character, the number of dwelling units allowed within the respective base zoning district may be increased up to 20 percent based upon a finding by the city council that such an increase is consistent with the goals of the comprehensive plan and achieves the PUD stated objectives of subsection 4-34(a) of this Code. The building, parking and similar requirements for these extra units shall be observed in compliance with this Code. 
(4)  Townhouses, cooperatives, condominiums. 
a.  Frontage. Minimum unit lot frontage for townhouses shall be not less than 24 feet.

At the election of the city, filing of the development stage PUD may be delayed until the final plan is filed. Where the development stage plan is denied approval, council action shall be by written resolution setting forth its findings and conclusions in support of its action. In all cases, a certified copy of the document evidencing council action shall be promptly mailed to or served upon the applicant. 
(7)  Limitation on development plan approval. Unless a final plan covering the area designated in the development stage plan as the first stage of the PUD has been filed within six months from the date council grants development stage plan approval, or in any case where the applicant fails to file final plans and to proceed with development in accordance with the provisions of this Code and/or an approved development stage plan, the approval shall expire. The council may at its discretion, extend for not more than six months, the filing deadline for any final plan when, for good cause shown, such extension is necessary. In any case where development plan approval expires, the council may adopt a resolution repealing the general concept plan approval and the development stage plan approval for that portion of the PUD that has not received final plan approval and re-establishing the zoning and other code provisions that would otherwise be applicable. 
(i)  Final plan. 
(1)  Purpose. The final plan is to serve as a complete, and permanent public record of the PUD and the manner in which it is to be developed. It shall incorporate all prior approved plans and all approved modifications thereof resulting from the PUD process. It shall serve in conjunction with other provisions of the city code as the land use regulation applicable to the PUD. 
(2)  Submission of final plan. Upon approval of the development stage plan, and within the time established herein the applicant shall file with the zoning administrator a final plan consisting of the information and submissions required by this Code for the entire PUD or for one or more stages. The final plan is intended only to add detail to, and to put in final form, the information contained in the general concept plan and the development stage plan and shall conform to the development stage plan in all respects, and shall be integrated as a coherent statement of the entire plan. Appropriate cross-referencing and incorporation of recorded documents may be utilized. 
(3)  Final plan submission information. After approval of a general concept plan for the PUD and approval of a development stage plan for a section or sections of the proposed PUD, the applicant will submit the following material for review by the city staff prior to issuance of a building permit: 
a.  Recording proof. Certified copies establishing the recording of any easement or other documents required by the city prior to the sale of any land or dwelling unit included in the PUD and of the establishment and activation of any entity that is to be responsible for the management and maintenance of any public or common open space or service facility. 
b.  Final plans, structures. Final architectural working drawings at all structures. 
c.  Final engineering plans. Final engineering plans and specifications for streets, drainage, utilities and other public improvements, together with a development contract providing for the installation of such improvements and financial guarantees for the completion of such improvements as provided in chapter 13. 
d.  Other plans. Any other plans, agreements, or specifications necessary for the city staff to review the proposed construction. All work must be in conformance with the building code of the city. 
(4)  Recording of final plan. Within 60 days of its approval, the applicant, or at its election, the city, shall cause the final plan, or such portions thereof as are appropriate, to be recorded with the county recorder or registrar of titles, at the expense of the applicant. Certified copies of all relevant recorded documents shall be furnished to the city. 
(5)  Building and other permits. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, upon receiving notice from the city manager that the approved final plan or appropriate development stage plan and development agreement has been recorded, all appropriate officials of the city may issue building and other permits to the applicant for development, construction and other work in the area encompassed by the approved final plan or intermediate development stage plan provided, however, that no such permit shall be issued unless the appropriate official is first satisfied that all requirements of this Code which are applicable to the permit sought, have been satisfied. 
(6)  Limitation on final plan approval. Within one year after the approval of a final plan for PUD, or such shorter time as may be established by the approved development schedule, construction shall commence in accordance with such approved plan. Failure to commence construction within such period shall, unless an extension shall have been granted and hereinafter provided, automatically render void the PUD permit and all approvals of the PUD plan and the area encompassed within the PUD shall thereafter be subject to those provisions of the zoning code, and other Code provisions, applicable in the district in which it is located. In such case, the council shall adopt a resolution repealing the PUD permit and PUD approvals and re-establishing the zoning and other provisions that would otherwise be applicable.

(Ord. No. 11-10, § 1, 8-22-2011) 
Chapter 5 - WATER, SEWER AND DRAINS 

Sec. 5-1. - Purpose and general. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide all rules and regulations of the city, including regulations adopted by reference, for governing operation of the city's sewer and water system and drains. These rules and regulations are necessary for the protection of the public health, enhancement and stabilization of property values and maintenance of an orderly and healthy structure of community living. 
(b)  Responsibility and administration. The department of public works is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the municipal sewer and water systems of the city, and for the maintenance of all public drains, and shall be governed by this Code, under the direction of the city manager. 
(c)  Sewer connection mandatory. The owner of each house, building or property used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purpose, situated within the city and abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is located a public sanitary sewer of the city, is required at the expense of the owner to install suitable toilet facilities therein and to connect such facilities directly with the public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this Code, within 90 days after date of official notice to do so, provided that said public sewer is located in the municipal right of way or easement of the abutting property. 
(1)  Hearing and order to connect. When the owner or occupant of any property shall fail, refuse or neglect to make the connection with the municipal sewer system adjacent to the property in question the council, after written notice thereof and a hearing, both as provided in chapter 1, may by resolution direct that a connection be made and the cost thereof be assessed against the property benefitted thereby, which assessment shall be levied as provided by Minn. Stat. ch. 429. 
(2)  Waiver. Whenever the owner signs a written waiver of notice or hearing or both and consents and authorizes the city to make such connection, the city may, without notice being given as required above, connect the property to the municipal sewer system and assess the cost thereof as provided in Minn. Stat. ch. 429. 
(d)  Discharge of surface waters into sanitary sewer prohibited. 
(1)  Purpose. The discharge of unpolluted water and/or natural precipitation into the city sanitary sewer system results in flooding and overloading of the sewerage system. When this water is discharged into the sanitary sewer system it is treated at the sewage treatment plant. This results in needless city expenditures. The city council, therefore, finds it in the best interest of the city to prohibit such discharges. 
(2)  Discharge prohibited. Except as otherwise expressly authorized in this section, no water from any roof surface, sump pump, footing tile, swimming pool, any other natural precipitation, cooling water or industrial process water shall be discharged into the sanitary sewer system. Dwellings and other buildings and structures which require sump pumps or footing tiles shall have a permanently installed discharge line which shall not at any time discharge water into the sanitary sewer system, except as provided herein. A permanent installation shall be one which provides for year round discharge capability onto the premises without impact to neighbors or roadways. The discharge may also be connected to a municipal drain tile system, if available, located in a municipal right of way or easement. The discharge must be equipped with an operable and accessible cleanout with its location recordable by GPS or other city-approved location system to the outside of the dwelling, building, or structure. The city's right-of-way permit process must be used to make a connection to the city drain tile or stormwater system: the accurate location of the cleanout must be filed with the public works department. The private discharge system shall consist of a rigid line and backflow valve, without other valves or quick connections for altering the path of discharge. All dwellings, buildings or structures with a sump pump abutting a municipal right-of-way or easement equipped with an operable municipal drain tile system or an accessible storm sewer must connect to the system or storm sewer at the earliest possible time at the sole direction of the public works director if a public safety issue or significant impact to a roadway is identified. 
(3)  Disconnection. Any person, firm or corporation having a roof surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile, swimming pool, cooling water or unpolluted industrial process water now connected and/or discharging into the sanitary sewer system shall disconnect or remove same. Any disconnects or openings in the sanitary sewer system shall be closed or repaired in an effective, workmanlike manner. 
(4)  Inspection. Every person owning improved real estate that discharges into the city's sanitary sewer system shall allow the city or a designated representative of the city to inspect the buildings to confirm that there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary sewer system. In lieu of having the city inspect their property, any person may furnish a city inspection report from a city approved licensed plumber certifying that their property is in compliance with this section. 
(5)  Future inspections. Any property with a sump pump found not in compliance with this Code but subsequently verified as compliant shall be subject to an annual reinspection to confirm continued compliance. Any property found not to be in compliance upon reinspection, or any person refusing to allow their property to be reinspected, within 30 days after receipt of mailed written notice from the city of the reinspection, shall be subject to the nonrefundable fee set forth in subsection 5-1(d)(7) of this Code. Mailed written notice shall mean that notice as described in subsection 1-4(b)(2) of this Code. 
(6)  New construction. All new construction of buildings with sumps for which a building permit is issued shall have a pump and shall be piped to the outside of the building before a certificate of occupancy is issued. In the event the property on which the new building is constructed abuts a municipal street right of way or easement equipped with a municipal drain tile system, the sump system must be connected to the drain tile system. Further, the sump system must contain a clean-out with its location recordable by GPS. 
(7)  Nonrefundable fee. A nonrefundable fee of $100.00 per month is hereby imposed on every sewer bill mailed on and after October 1, 2003 to property owners who are not in compliance with this section or who have refused to allow their property to be inspected to determine if there is compliance. All properties found during any reinspection to have violated this section will be subject to the $100.00 per month nonrefundable fee for all months between the two most recent inspections. 
(8)  Winter discharge. The city manager is authorized to issue a permit to allow a property owner to discharge water into the sanitary sewer system. Prior to issuance of the permit, the city manager may consult with the city engineer or public works director to verify one of the criteria to issue the permit has been satisfied. The permit shall authorize such discharge only from November 1 to March 31, shall require the owner to permit an inspection of the property on April 1 or as soon thereafter as possible to determine that discharge into the sanitary sewer has been discontinued and shall subject the owner to a $100.00 monthly nonrefundable fee for each month water is discharged into the sanitary sewer system. The nonrefundable fee will commence with the November water billing and continue until the property owner establishes discharge into the sanitary sewer system has been discontinued. A property owner is required to meet at least one of the following criteria in order to obtain the permit: 
a.  The freezing of the surface water discharge from the sump pump or footing drain is causing a dangerous condition, such as ice buildup or flooding, on either public or private property. 
b.  The property owner has demonstrated that there is a danger that the sump pump or footing drain pipes will freeze up and result in either failure or damage to the sump pump unit or the footing drain and cause basement flooding. 
c.  The water being discharged from the sump pump or footing drain cannot be readily discharged into a storm drain or other acceptable drainage system. 
Following ten days' written notice and an opportunity to be heard, the city manager may require the owner of a property to discharge their sump pump into the sanitary sewer from November 1 to March 31 if surface water discharge from their property is causing an icy condition on public streets or sidewalks. The $100.00 nonrefundable discharge fee referenced above will also apply in this event as well. 
(e)  Discharge of certain gases, wastes, noxious substances into sanitary sewer prohibited. Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following described waters or wastes to any public sewer: 
(1)  High temperature. Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit. 
(2)  Fat, oil. Any water or waste which may contain more than 100 parts per million by weight, of fat, oil, or grease. 
(3)  Flammable liquid. Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or explosive liquid, solid or gas.

(Ord. No. 15-13, § 1, 12-14-2015; Memo. of 2-5-2018) 
Sec. 5-3. - Permits, licenses and other charges. 
(a)  Licensed plumbers. All plumbing involved in the installation of sewer and/or connection to the municipal water and sewer systems shall be made by a state licensed plumber. 
(b)  Permits required. No person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or pipe connection to the public water system or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the city's building official and otherwise complying with the terms of this Code, including the payment of established fees. 
(1)  Classes of permits. There shall be two classes of building sewer permits: 
a.  Residential. 
b.  Commercial and industrial. 
(2)  Forms. In either case, the owner or the agent shall make application on forms furnished by the city. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications and other information which the building official may reasonably require. 
(3)  Permit cards. The city shall furnish a permit card with permit numbers which shall be promptly displayed on property where a water or sewer connection is being made; said cards shall be displayed for the duration of the work. 
(4)  Revocation of permit. The public works director or building official may, at any time, revoke or suspend any permit issued hereunder for any violation of this chapter and require that the work be stopped, or if already completed, that it be removed, and the violation corrected. The public works director or building official shall notify the plumber and owner, as provided in chapter 1, of the revocation and the reasons for the revocation. The owner or plumber may appeal such action in the manner provided in chapter 1. 
(5)  Connection changes. In addition to the issuance of a permit, the payment of certain connection charges is required to authorize connection to the city water and sewer system, which charges are fully described elsewhere in this Code. 
(6)  Sewer availability charges (SAC). The Metropolitan Council Environmental Services Board (MCES) is the responsible agency for the provision of wastewater treatment services within the metropolitan area. The SAC charges are authorized by Minn. Stat. Ch. 473 and are set out in the MCES web page relating to the SAC program/rates and charges. As authorized by Minn. Stat. § 444.075, the city administers these charges as pass through charges to the property owner/developer of the property within the city as set out in subsection 5-3(6) of this Code. The MCES establishes charges on an annual basis which city charges must reflect. The city shall report monthly to the MCES for all single family residential SAC determinations and shall request the MCES to make all other determinations per MCES criteria and guidance. Charges of the MCES for providing reserve trunk capacity as described in the city's fee schedule are: 
a.  The responsibility of the property owner and are required to be paid before issuance of a permit for connection to the municipal sewer system. 
b.  Additional SAC charges may apply after any MCES building plans audit and shall be the continuing responsibility of the property owner. Any additional unpaid SAC charges are due within 30 days from the date of mailing by the city to the property owner of the amount remaining unpaid. A $50.00 late fee shall apply to any SAC charges paid after the 30-day notice period referred to herein and may be certified to the real estate taxes of the property for collection if they remain unpaid after the 30-day notice period. 
(c)  Sanitary sewer strength charges. MCES charges for recovery of operation and maintenance costs of treatment works as described in the city's fee schedule must be paid when due by all industrial users of the city sewer system: 
(1)  Recitals. The Metropolitan Waste Control Commission, a metropolitan commission organized and existing under the laws of the state (hereinafter in this subsection the "commission"), in order to receive and retain grants in compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and regulations thereunder (hereinafter in this subsection the "Act"), has determined to impose an industrial user sewer strength charge upon users of the interceptors or treatment facilities owned or operated by the commission to recover operation and maintenance costs of treatment works attributable to the strength of the discharge of industrial waste, such sewer strength charge being in addition to the charge based upon the volume of discharge. In order for the city to pay such costs based upon strength of industrial discharge and allocated to it each year by the commission, it is hereby found, determined and declared to be necessary to establish sewer strength charges and a formula for the computation thereof for all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city. Furthermore, Minn. Stat. § 444.075, subd. 3, empowers the city to make such sewer charge a charge against the owner, lessee, occupant or all of them and certify unpaid charges to the county auditor as a tax lien against the property served. 
(2)  Establishment of strength. For the purpose of paying the costs allocated to the city each year by the commission that are based upon the strength of discharge of all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, there is hereby approved, adopted and established, in addition to the sewer charge based upon the volume of discharge, a sewer charge upon each person, company or corporation receiving waste treatment services within or served by the city, based upon strength of industrial waste discharged into the sewer system of the city (the "strength charge"). 
(3)  Establishment of strength charge formula. For the purpose of computation of the strength charge established above, there is hereby established, approved and adopted in compliance with the act, the formula fixed by the metropolitan waste control commission for industrial users receiving waste treatment services. Such formula being based upon pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of the sewage produced through an evaluation of pollution qualities and quantities in excess of an annual average base and the proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of waste treatment services provided by the commission. 
(4)  Strength charge payment. It is hereby approved, adopted and established that the strength charge established above shall be paid by each industrial user receiving waste treatment services and subject thereto before the twentieth day next succeeding the day of billing thereof to such user by or on behalf of the city, and such payment thereof shall be deemed to be delinquent if not so paid to the billing entity before such date. Furthermore, it is hereby established, approved and adopted that if such payment is not paid before such date an industrial user shall pay interest compounded monthly at the rate of two-thirds of one percent per month on the unpaid balance due. 
(5)  Establishment of tax lien. As provided by Minn. Stat. § 444.075, subd. 3, it is hereby approved, adopted and established that if payment of the strength charge established above is not paid before the sixtieth day next succeeding the date of billing thereof to the industrial user by or on behalf of the city, said delinquent sewer strength charge, plus accrued interest established above, shall be deemed to be a charge against the owner, lessee and occupant of the property served, and the city or its agent shall certify such unpaid delinquent balance to the county auditor with taxes against the property served for collection as other taxes are collected; provided, however, that such certification shall not preclude the city from recovery of such delinquent sewer strength charge and interest thereon under any other available remedy. 
(d)  Sanitary sewer service and use charges. 
(1)  Rates. Rates and charges for use and service of the sanitary sewer system are prescribed in the city's fee schedule, such charges and rates to be made against each lot, parcel of land, unit or premises which may have a connection directly or indirectly into the city sanitary sewer system and which discharge only normal sewage into such system. For single-family residences only, sewer charges shall be computed on the basis of actual gallons of water metered during the winter months of December through March; sewer charges for all 12 months shall be determined by averaging the gallonage of water metered during the winter months between December through March; provided, however, that the gallons charged for each individual month shall not exceed an amount equal to the actual metered water, if actual usage is less than the amount determined by the averaging method. In terms of beginning service, for a fraction of a month the charges and rates for non-metered unit shall be based upon the amount of the established flat charge, provided, however, that the actual month of beginning shall be considered as having begun on the first or the fifteenth of the month, whichever is closer. 
(2)  Required installation of water meters. A meter recording the use of water may be installed on any lot, parcel, premises or unit in the city and thereafter the rate shall be based upon such use of water. The council may, by resolution, require and order the installation of such meter on any such lot, parcel, premises or unit or class thereof where it shall determine that the equitable administration and application of sewer rates requires the metering of water used on the premises. 
(3)  Installation of meter. Any water meter installed for use or used as a basis for the computation of sewer rates shall be installed and maintained in good operating condition at all times, such installation and maintenance to be without expense to the city. Any such meter shall be of a type approved by the council, and shall accurately measure all water received on the premises. Installation of and maintenance of such meter shall be made in accordance with the plumbing regulations of the city. 
(4)  Water not entering sewer system. If the lot, parcel of land, or premises discharges normal sewage or industrial waste into the sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the council that a portion of the water measured by the water meter does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewerage system, then, and in that event, the council may permit or require the installation of other or additional meters in such a manner that the quantity of water which actually could enter the sewer may be determined. In such case the charges or rates shall be based upon the amount of water which can enter the sanitary sewer system. 
(5)  Supplying information violations. The owner, occupant, or person in charge of any premises shall supply the city with such information as the city may reasonably require related to use of water, use of sewer, or sewer rates. Willful failure to provide such information or willful falsification of such information shall constitute a violation of this section, as shall willful failure to comply with any requirement or order issued pursuant to this section. 
(6)  Billing and collections. Bills for charges for the use and service of the sewage system shall be made out by the city in accordance with the city's usual and customary general billing practices. All bills shall be payable at the city administrative offices. Bills shall be rendered monthly to owners of the premises in the same manner as prescribed elsewhere in this chapter pertaining to the sale of municipal water. All bills shall be due and payable when rendered. Bills paid by automatic clearing house (ACH) electronic payment shall be due on the first business day after the 15 th day of each month. If payment is not made on or before the 21 st day of each month next succeeding the mailing of the bill, a penalty as set forth in the city's fee schedule, shall be added to the bill. Sewer bills shall be considered to be in default on the first day of the month next succeeding the date the above penalty attaches. When a charge is more than 45 days past due, civil action may be begun on behalf of the city for the collection of said sewage service charge, and if such charge is not paid within 60 days after due, the said unpaid charge plus penalty may be certified to the county auditor with the taxes against such property and shall be collected with other taxes on such property. 
(7)  Shutting off service. The city may shut off sewer service to any premises for which the connection charge is unpaid and in default, after notice as provided in chapter 1. The decision to shut off sewer service may be appealed as provided in chapter 1. The right reserved by the city to shut off sewer service for failure to fully make said connection charge payments shall in no way be defeated, diminished or cut-off by the cancellation, termination or discharge, by operation of law, of the individual liability of the applicant for the connection. Until the full connection charge due has been paid, no owner, tenant, grantee, successor in interest, assigns, or possessor of any premises shall be entitled to connection thereof with the municipal sewer system, except as provided elsewhere in this Code. It is the intention of this section to ensure that the financial costs of establishing and maintaining the sewer system is equitably borne by all the premises using it. 
(8)  Certification of past due fees on taxes. Notwithstanding subsection 5-3(d)(7) of this Code, every owner of any premises served by sanitary sewer shall be deemed to have agreed that any delinquencies in the payment for sanitary sewer usage on the premises shall be a lien and charge against the premises so served regardless of whether the premises is a homestead. In the case of a delinquency, said lien, including a certification processing fee in the amount as set forth in chapter 14 of this Code, may be certified to the county auditor with the taxes against such premises, in the same manner as special assessments on real estate for other public improvements, and shall be collected in the same manner as taxes against real estate. This section shall not affect the city's ability to terminate service per subsection 5-3(d)(7) or any other remedy of this Code, the intention being that all remedies for collection of delinquent payments are cumulative and not exclusive in nature. 
(9)  Sewer operating fund. All revenues derived from these rates and charges shall be credited to the sewer operating fund. Such revenue shall be used for the purpose of paying the cost of operating and maintaining the sewage system, paying charges made by a duly authorized municipal authority, such as the metropolitan sewer board, providing an adequate depreciation fund, paying costs of meter-reading, billing, collection and other similar or related sewer operating expenses. To the sewer operating fund shall also be credited all revenues derived from any "use charge" paid for use of service of the sanitary sewer system. Net revenues from "use charge" shall be paid by the city from time to time for the purpose for which such use charge was established. If the rates and charges prescribed herein do not produce a net revenue sufficient to permit payment of the use charge revenues for the purposes for which established, the rates and charges provided herein shall be adjusted from time to time to permit the accumulation of net revenues equal to the deposits of use charge funds to the sewer operating fund. 
(e)  Stormwater drainage utility and use charges. 
(1)  Stormwater drainage utility established. The municipal storm sewer system shall be operated as a public utility pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 444.075. Revenues derived from said system shall be subject to the provisions of this Code and Minnesota Statutes. The following findings and determinations are hereby made in providing for said utility: 
a.  In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the city has constructed, operated and maintained a storm sewer system ("the system"). This section is adopted in the further exercise of such authority and for the same purposes. 
b.  The system, as constructed, heretofore has been financed and paid for through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. Such financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were used. It is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the future costs of improving, maintaining and operating the system through the imposition of charges as provided in this section. 
c.  In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into account the status of completion of the system, past methods of recovering system costs, the topography of the city and other relevant factors, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of operating, maintaining and improving the system on the basis of the expected stormwater runoff from the various parcels of land within the city during a standard one-year rainfall event. 
d.  Assigning costs and making charges based upon typical stormwater runoff cannot be done with mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits. The provisions of this section undertake to establish a reasonable and practical methodology for making such charges. 
(2)  Stormwater drainage rate. Stormwater drainage rates are prescribed in the city's fee schedule. The rate charged for a land parcel shall be determined by its assigned residential equivalent factor (REF) multiplied by the drainage rate for the parcel's actual land use. The purpose of said charge is to pay for the repair, improvement, maintenance and operation of the municipal stormwater drainage system. A parcel shall be assigned an REF by determining its percentage of impervious area and multiplying its total acreage by the corresponding REF to percentage of impervious area in accordance with the following table: 
Percentage of Impervious Area REF per acre 0 2.12 12 2.61 20 2.94 25 3.00 30 3.07 38 3.45 65 4.56 72 4.65 85 5.50 100 6.48  
A higher drainage rate is imposed on commercial and industrial land uses due to greater water pollution from run-off caused by said uses which justify the higher rate. 
(3)  Residential equivalent factor defined. One REF is defined as the ratio of the average volume of runoff generated by one acre of a given land use to the average volume of runoff generated by one acre of typical single family residential land, during a standard five-year rainfall event. It is further assumed that land in New Hope is Type C soil composed of sandy clay loam and that a five-year rainfall event generates 3.5 inches of rain per hour. 
(4)  Credits. The city council may adopt policies by resolution, for adjustment of the stormwater drainage fee for parcels based upon hydrologic data to be supplied by property owners, which data demonstrates a hydrologic response substantially different from the standards. Such adjustments of stormwater drainage fees shall not be made retroactively. 
(5)  Payment of fee. Billing statements for stormwater drainage shall be computed and invoiced by the city's finance department for each parcel of the monthly sewer and water utility billing system. Any parcel not included in the sewer and water utility billing system, such as unimproved parcels, shall be invoiced quarterly for storm sewer service charges. 
(6)  Recalculation of fee. If a property owner or person responsible for paying the stormwater drainage fee questions the correctness of an invoice for such charge, such person may have the determination of the charge recomputed by written request to the public works director made within twelve months of mailing of the invoice in question by the city. 
(7)  Penalty for late payment. Every billing for stormwater drainage fees not paid when due shall incur a penalty charge of five percent of the amount past due. 
(8)  Certification of past due fees on taxes. Any past due stormwater drainage fees in excess of 60 days past due on September 1 of any year may be certified to the county auditor for collection with real estate taxes in the following year pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 444.075, subd. 2a. In addition, the city shall also have the right to bring a civil action or to take other legal remedies to collect unpaid fees. 
(Ord. No. 66-1; Ord. No. 73-26; Ord. No. 82-13; Code 072684; Ord. 90-13; Ord. No. 95-11; Ord. No. 2000-09; Ord. No. 2001-04; Ord. No. 11-11, §§ 1, 2, 8-22-2011; Ord. No. 15-13, § 1, 12-14-2015; Ord. No. 17-01, § 6, 1-23-2017) 
Sec. 5-4. - Water regulations. 
    The following requirements shall govern the installation and operation of water mains in the city: 
(1)  Checkvalves. Checkvalves are required on all water connections to steamboilers or on any other connection deemed by the public works director to require one. Safety and release valves shall be placed on all boilers or other steam apparatus connected with the water system where the steam pressure may be raised in excess of 50 pounds per square inch. 
(2)  Use of water during fires. It is hereby declared to be unlawful for any person in this city or any person owning or occupying premises connected to the municipal water system to use or allow to be used during a fire any water from said water system, except for the purpose of extinguishing said fire, and upon the sounding of a fire alarm, it shall be the duty of every such person to see that all water services are tightly closed, and that no water is used except for necessary household purposes or essential to commercial operations during said fire. 
(3)  Continuous flow prohibited. In order to prevent waste or excessive use of water or irregularity of pressure, no person shall allow water to flow continuously in order to guard against freezing or for any other purpose, except by permission from the public works director provided, however, the public works director may, at any time, rescind such special permission when the director shall deem its continuance to be detrimental to the operation of the water system and the service available to other consumers. 
(4)  Emergencies and repairs. The public works director is hereby authorized to limit or discontinue the supply of water, in cases of emergency, and to shut off the supply of water for repairs or extensions, the director being the judge of the time and necessity. 
(5)  Deficiency of water. The city shall not be liable for any deficiency or failure in the supply of water to consumers, whether occasioned by shutting the water off for the purpose of making repairs or connections, or for any other cause whatsoever. 
(6)  Consent to regulation. Every person applying for water service from the municipal water system, and every owner of property for which such application is made, shall be deemed by such application to consent to all rules, regulations, and rates contained in the provisions of this Code, and to all modifications thereof, and all rules, regulations and rates duly adopted hereafter. 
(7)  Plumbing. No water shall be turned on for service in premises in which the plumbing does not comply with the provisions of this Code; provided that water may be turned on for construction work in unfinished buildings, subject to provisions of this Code. After giving reasonable notice, the public works director may shut off the supply of water to any consumer because of any substantial violation of this Code. The supply shall not be turned on again until all violations have been corrected and the city has ordered the water to be turned on. 
(8)  Service pipes. Water pipes from private buildings connecting to the city's water system are controlled by this section. 
a.  Installation. All service pipes from the curb box to the premises served shall be installed by, and at the expense of the owner of the property to be served. Such installation shall be inspected and approved by the public works director or the director's designee. 
b.  Expense. All repairs for service pipes out to their connection with the street mains, including any repairs caused by any damage to any portion of the city's street or right of way infrastructure, repairs necessary to the curb box, and plumbing systems of a building, shall be made by and at the expense of the owners of the premises served. All repairs shall be made in accordance with industry standards as determined in the sole discretion of the public works director. The city may, in case of emergency, repair any service pipes and if this is done, the cost of such repair work shall be repaid to the city by the owner of the premises served. The public works director shall determine the existence of an emergency. 
c.  Depth and size. Service pipes shall be placed not less than seven feet below the surface from the main to the building line and in all cases so arranged as to prevent rupture or damage from freezing. In all cases, service pipes must be of a size specified in the permit order and shall be a minimum of three-fourths-inch type K copper or approved poly vinyl chloride with tracer wire attached to the water main, curb box or water meter. 
d.  Stop boxes. Such service pipes must extend from the main to the inside of the building, or if not taken into a building, then to the hydrant or other fixtures which it is intended to supply. A stop-caulk must in all cases be placed outside any box and a shut-off or other stop-caulk with waste, of the size and strength required, shall be placed close to the inside wall of the building, well protected from freezing. All stop boxes at the curbs shall be set between the curb and the building, if practical. 
e.  Supply from one service. Not more than one house or building shall be supplied from one service pipe connecting with the street main, unless by special permit. Such house or building shall have a separate stop box. 
f.  Inspection of and approval. All water service pipes and their connections to the municipal water system must be inspected and approved in writing by the public works director, or the director's designee, before they are covered, and the public works director shall keep a record of such approvals. If the director refuses to approve the work on the grounds of improper or inadequate compliance with specified city requirements, the plumber or owner shall proceed immediately to correct the work so that it will meet with the director's approval. Every person who uses or intends to use the municipal water system shall permit the public works director, or the director's designee, to enter the premises to inspect the water pipes and appurtenances at all reasonable hours. 
(9)  Water meters. 
a.  Water to be metered. No water shall be furnished to any consumer from the municipal water system unless the same is measured by a meter, except by special permission of the council. A request for service from the municipal water system is deemed to include permission to authorized city employees or authorized city contractors to enter upon the premises to be served at all reasonable times and places for the purpose of reading, installation, inspection and repair of meters and remote electronic transponders to determine water usage. Refusal to permit access to any premises for the stated purposes herein, after reasonable demand, shall be deemed grounds for cancellation of the agreement of the city to provide water to the premises, and the water supply may be shut off after notice, as provided in chapter 1, to the record owner and to the occupant. Such an order to shut off the water supply may be appealed as provided in chapter 1. 
b.  Water meter purchase, installation, ownership and control. All meters and remote electronic transponders shall be purchased from the city and installed by the consumer. Upon connection with the city water system, all meters and remote electronic transponders shall thereafter be deemed the property of and under control of the city; the applicant for the connection permit releasing all claims thereto. All meters and remote electronic transponders heretofore connected to the city water system regardless of how paid for or installed shall be deemed the property of and under the control of the city. Payment therefore shall be made in advance, unless otherwise noted, in the amount as follows: 
1.  Original meter. The charges set forth in the city's fee schedule do not include any installation fee since original meters must be installed by a licensed plumber. The city manager shall, from time to time, post with the water department the total purchase price for the meters as established hereinabove. 
2.  Replacement meters. Replacement meters shall be furnished by the city to users of the water system on the same cost basis as original meters. 
3.  Manual reading fee. A monthly fee shall be charged to the monthly utility billing when a water user, after reasonable notice fails to install or replace the faulty equipment. This fee shall be in addition to the water rate fees set forth in the city's fee schedule. 
c.  Electronic transponders. 
1.  Policy of the city. It is the policy of the city to require the installation of a city approved remote water meter reading electronic transponder with every water meter installation. In the city's sole discretion, the city may also require the replacement of obsolete and previously installed transponders as permitted or required by advances or improvements in transponder technology. The city shall not be obligated to furnish water to any residence which does not provide or replace a remote water meter reading electronic transponder approved by the city. If the parties to a sale and purchase do not provide an electronic transponder, it shall be the responsibility of the owner to provide for the required installation. 
2.  Installation. All electronic transponders shall be purchased from the city and installed by the property owner. In all cases, inspection of the installation shall be performed by the city. Upon request of the user, the cost of such equipment shall be divided in 12 parts, and shall be billed monthly with the regular water bill. 
3.  Location. The location of the electronic transponder installation shall be elevated as high as possible towards the lower level ceiling. The electronic transponder must be accessible to authorized city personnel. 
4.  General provisions. All provisions of this Code applicable to ownership, maintenance, reading and testing of water meters shall apply to the electronic transponder as well. 
d.  Meter maintenance. Meters and electronic transponders shall be maintained by the city, as far as ordinary wear and tear are concerned; but damage due to freezing, or due to hot water, or external causes, shall be paid for by the consumer. The city reserves the right to discontinue water service upon notice as provided in chapter 1, if such repair bill is not paid. The consumer shall notify the city of any injury to or the nonworking of the meter, as soon as it comes to the consumer's knowledge. 
e.  Meter reading and water rates. Where the water furnished is measured by a meter, the meter shall be electronically read by city staff monthly by use of an electronic transponder installed on the property per subsection 5-4(9)c. of this Code. If an electronic reading cannot be made, the meter may be manually read monthly by city staff. However, if manual meter readings cannot be obtained for any reason, billing for service to the premises shall be made on an estimated consumption basis. There shall be an additional fee as prescribed by the city's fee schedule of this Code on all water billings requiring manual reading by city staff regardless of whether the meter readings are being manually obtained. The quantity recorded by the meter shall be conclusive on both the consumer and the city, except when the meter has ceased to register; in that case, the quantity may be determined by the average registration of the meter when in order. Water bills shall be concurrent with sewer billings. The rate for water furnished to consumers by the municipal water system incorporates a "conservation rate structure" and a fee for the construction and maintenance of an emergency water supply system required by Minn. Stat. §§ 473.859 and 103G.291 and shall be as set forth in the city's fee schedule: 
1.  Beginning service. When the initial month of service is a fraction of a month, the minimum charges provided in (2), above, shall be reduced and shall, for the initial month, be a pro rata amount of the regular minimum charges therein provided, except that the actual month of beginning shall be considered as having begun on the first or the 15 th of the month, whichever is closer. 
2.  Collections. All bills shall be due and payable when rendered. Bills paid by automatic clearing house (ACH) electronic payment shall be due on the first business day after the 15 th day of each month. If payment is not made on or before the 21 st day of each month, next succeeding the mailing of the bill, a penalty as set forth in the city's fee schedule shall be added to the bill. Water bills shall be considered to be in default on the first day of the month next succeeding the date the above penalty attaches. When a charge is more than 45 days past due, civil action may be started on behalf of the city for the said water service bill, and if such charge is not paid within 60 days after due, the unpaid charge plus penalty may be certified to the county auditor with the taxes against such property and shall be collected with other taxes on such property. 
f.  Testing meters. A water or sewer meter connected to the municipal system shall be considered accurate if it records within three percent of actual flow. If upon testing by the city, the meter is found to be inaccurate, it shall be replaced without charge to the consumer, unless the meter has been damaged by the consumer. If damaged by the consumer, the consumer shall pay the cost of a new meter. No refund or additional charge shall be made for billings based on an inaccurate meter. 
g.  Accounts in the name of property owner. All accounts shall be carried in the name of the owner, who personally, or by an authorized agent, shall apply for water service. Unless the city is furnished with evidence of ownership satisfactory to it which establishes that a person or entity, other than the taxpayer shown on the official rolls, is the legal or equitable owner, the taxpayer of record shall be deemed the owner for purposes of billing hereunder. The owner may designate in writing a billing address. A lessee shall not be deemed an owner, but at the written request of the owner a duplicate billing for water supplied may be provided to any tenant of the owner. A monthly fee shall be charged to the owner's account for each duplicate tenant billing requested by the owner as set out in the city's fee schedule. The legal and equitable owners of a property shall at all times be responsible for payment of water delivered to the premises, whether or not he or she occupies the premises, it being the stated intention of this section to ensure the financial costs of supplying water service are borne by the premises using it. 
h.  Nonpayment. The water supply may be shut off from any premises for which the water bill remains unpaid and in default after notice as provided in chapter 1. The decision to shut off the water supply may be appealed as provided in chapter 1. When shut off, the water shall not be turned on except upon the payment of the bill, together with interest thereon at the rate of ten percent, and the reconnection fee set out in the city's fee schedule. Provided, however, that if the consumer of water whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises, and the clerk has notice of this, then notice as provided in chapter 1, shall be to the owner of the premises as indicated on the city records, and the water supply shall not be shut off unless the bill with interest is not paid within ten days after said notice is completed. The clerk will begin the notice process within 20 days after the due date. 
i.  Reconnection to water service. A fee for reconnection to the city water service as set out in the city's fee schedule shall be charged against any property after a voluntary disconnection requested by either a property owner or occupant for any reason. Said reconnection service will be performed only between the hours of 7:30 a.m. through 3:00 p.m. Monday through Friday excluding city holidays. A person requesting a voluntary disconnection shall be informed of this fee and conditions of reconnection prior to the service being disconnected; however, the city's failure to provide the owner or occupant with notice of the fee or times of reconnection shall not relieve the owner or occupant of payment for this reconnection fee. 
j.  Certification of past due fees on taxes. Notwithstanding subsection 5-4(9)h. of this Code, every owner of any premises served by water shall be deemed to have agreed that any delinquencies in the payment for water usage on the premises shall be a lien and charge against the premises so served regardless of whether the premises is homestead. In the case of a delinquency, said lien, including a certification processing fee in the amount as set forth in the city's fee schedule, may be certified to the county auditor with the taxes against such premises, in the same manner as special assessments on real estate for other public improvements, and shall be collected in the same manner as taxes against real estate. This section shall not affect the city's ability to terminate water service per subsection 5-4(9)h. or any other remedy of this Code, the intention being that all remedies for collection of delinquent payments are cumulative and not exclusive in nature.

(8)  Sewer lines. 
a.  Separate lines. A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, yard or driveway. In that event, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer except for rate purposes. 
b.  Old lines. Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the plumbing inspector, to meet all requirements of this section. 
(9)  Sewer specifications. 
a.  Sewer pipe. Building sewer shall be of extra heavy duty cast iron pipe, asbestos cement pipe, vitrified clay or approved plastic (PVC). No building sewer pipe shall be laid parallel within ten feet of any well. When building sewer pipe shall come within 20 feet of any well, it shall be of heavy duty cast iron construction. Minimum size of building sewer shall be four inch extra heavy cast iron pipe, four inch asbestos cement pipe and six inch vitrified clay pipe or approved plastic. Change in direction of building sewer shall be made by use of fittings approved by the building official. 
b.  Over cesspools and septic tanks. Building sewer pipe may be laid across existing cesspools and septic tanks, providing the pipe rests on a steel reinforced concrete slab which ends rest directly on the concrete block walls. The two center sections of a regular cesspool cover laid parallel with each other may be used. 
c.  Elevation. Whenever possible the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment in so far as possible. 
d.  Lifts. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer. 
(10)  Joints. 
a.  Type. Type of joints shall comply with the following specifications: Cast iron shall have a packed oakum joint with a hot poured lead ring approximately three-fourths inch deep and caulked. Asbestos cement pipe shall consist of the rubber ring type joint as recommended by the manufacturer, except when connection to the house drain cast iron pipe where a packed oakum joint with a hot poured lead ring approximately three-fourths inch deep shall be used. Vitrified clay tile joints shall consist of a ring of packed oakum and a hot poured approved joint compound. Plastic joints shall be made with glue approved by the manufacturer. 
b.  Leaded joints. Cast iron pipe with leaded joints may be required by the public works director where the building sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots.

e.  Hot-poured joints. Material for hot-poured joints shall not soften sufficiently to destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit, nor be soluble in any of the wastes carried by the drainage system. The joint shall first be caulked tight with jute, hemp, or similar approved material. 
f.  Plastic joints (PCV). The adhesive used for joints in PCV pipe must be manufacture approved or in lieu thereof, approved by the public works director. 
g.  Other methods. Other jointing materials and methods may be used only by approval of the public works director. 
(11)  Connection to public sewer. 
a.  "Y" branch. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the owner shall, at their expense, install a "Y" branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the city engineer. Where the public sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees. 
b.  45 degree Ell. A 45 degree ell may be used to make such connection with the spigot end so cut as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by engagement in concrete. Special filling may be used for the connection only when approved by the public works director. 
c.  Connect to established location. Building sewers or house sewers have been provided for each separate structure and all connection to the public sanitary sewer shall be made where building sewers and house sewers have been installed. Connection with the public sanitary sewer at any other location must be approved by the public works director prior to starting of any construction. In the event the building sewer or house sewer which has been installed cannot be used, then the property owner shall pay the full cost of making the connection elsewhere. After any connection, the location of the connection must be GPS recorded and filed with the public works department. 
(12)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors. 
a.  Required. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any inflammable wastes, sand, and other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the public works director, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
b.  Interceptor maintenance. Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the owner, at the owner's expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. 
(13)  Certain industrial wastes. 
a.  When city approval required. The admission into the public sewers of any waters or wastes having (a) five-day biochemical oxygen demand greater than 300 parts per million by weight, or (b) containing more than 350 parts per million by weight of suspended solids, or (c) containing any quantity of substances having the characteristics described in subsection 5-1(e), or (d) having an average daily flow greater than two percent of the average daily sewage flow of the city, shall be subject to the review and approval of the public works director. 
b.  Treatment. The owner shall provide, at the owner's expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to (a) reduce the biochemical oxygen demand to 300 parts per million and the suspended solids to 350 parts per million by weight, or (b) reduce objectionable characteristics or constituents to within the maximum limits provided for in subsection 5-1(e), or (c) control the quantities and rates of discharges of such waters or wastes. Plans, specifications, and other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the city engineer and of the Water Pollution Control Agency of the State of Minnesota, and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until said approvals are obtained in writing. 
c.  Maintenance of treatment facilities. Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation, by the owner at his expense. 
d.  Control manholes. The owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city engineer. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner's expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
e.  Testing. All measurements, tests and analysis of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in subsections 5-1(e) and 5-5(13) shall be determined in accordance with methods employed by the Minnesota Department of Health, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided for above, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.

Sec. 5-6. - Reserved. 
Sec. 5-7. - Drainage. 
(a)  Obstruction of drainage structure . Drainage structures that adjoin or run on, across, or through any property, may not become obstructed or fall into a state of disrepair. Drainage structures must be maintained in a state that allows for the free and unrestricted passage of water therein. 
(1)  Notice to land owner to remedy conditions. 
a.  Generally . Whenever the public works director, or the director's designee, shall determine that any drainage structure is obstructed, in a state of disrepair, or is not adequate, the owner of such premises shall be notified on which such condition exists or adjoins, to remedy such condition at once, so that such obstruction shall be removed and condition corrected. The existence of the condition which obstructs or impedes the free flow of surface water from, on or in the streets or drainage easements as herein set forth shall constitute a nuisance. 
b.  Trees or fences in drainage easements . Whenever the public works director, or the director's designee, shall determine that any fence or tree obstructs or impedes the free flow of surface water from, or in any drainage easements, or interferes with remedying or correcting of obstructions in any drainage structure, the director or director's designee shall notify as provided in chapter 1, the owner of such premises on which such fences or trees exist, to remove said fences or trees at once. The existence of fences or trees which obstruct or impede the free flow of surface water from, or in any drainage easement, or interferes with remedying or correcting of obstructions in any drainage structure, as herein set forth, shall constitute a nuisance. The city shall not be required to pay compensation for any such fences or trees that are removed. 
(2)  Failure to comply with notice. Any person who fails or refuses to comply with the notice given by the city as herein provided, within 20 days after such notice, is guilty of a misdemeanor. In addition thereto, the city shall have all rights granted to it by law to abate the nuisance. 
(3)  Regrading. The regrading of a property may not adversely affect neighboring properties and shall be subject to the grading, erosion, and sediment control regulations set forth in sections 4-3(i) and 4-3(j) of this Code. 
(b)  Development standards . All development and redevelopment will demonstrate compliance with the most stringent requirements of the following: 
(1)  The performance standards of section 4-3(i) of this Code. 
(2)  The requirements of either the Bassett Creek Watershed District or the Shingle Creek Watershed District, whichever is applicable. 
(3)  Infiltration requirements. 
a.  Infiltration systems must be prohibited when the system would be constructed in areas: 
1.  That receive discharges from vehicle fueling and maintenance, regardless of the amount of new and fully reconstructed impervious surface; 
2.  Where high levels of contaminants in soil or groundwater may be mobilized by the infiltrating stormwater. To make this determination, the owners and/or operators of construction activity must complete the MPCA's site screening assessment checklist, which is available in the Minnesota Stormwater Manual, or conduct their own assessment. The assessment must be retained with the site plans; 
3.  Where soil infiltration rates are more than 8.3 inches per hour unless soils are amended to slow the infiltration rate below 8.3 inches per hour; 
4.  With less than three feet of separation distance from the bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of the seasonally saturated soils or the top of bedrock; 
5.  Of predominately Hydrologic Soil Group D (clay) soils; 
6.  In an Emergency Response Area (ERA) within a Drinking Water Supply Management Area (DWSMA) as defined in Minn. R. 4720.5100, Subp. 13, classified as high or very high vulnerability as defined by the Minnesota Department of Health; 
7.  In an ERA within a DWSMA classified as moderate vulnerability unless the permittee performs or approves a higher level of engineering review sufficient to provide a functioning treatment system and to prevent adverse impacts to groundwater; 
8.  Outside of an ERA within a DWSMA classified as high or very high vulnerability unless the permittee performs or approves a higher level of engineering review sufficient to provide a functioning treatment system and to prevent adverse impacts to groundwater; 
9.  Within 1,000 feet up-gradient or 100 feet down gradient of active karst features; or 
10.  That receive stormwater runoff from entities regulated under NPDES for industrial stormwater; automobile salvage yards; scrap recycling and waste recycling facilities; hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities; or air transportation facilities that conduct deicing activities. 
(4)  Mitigation provisions. There may be circumstances where the permittee or other owners and operators of a construction activity cannot cost effectively meet the conditions for post-construction stormwater management for TSS and/or TP required by the city's MS4 permit (Part III.D.5.a(2)) on the site of the original construction activity. For this purpose, the permittee shall identify, or may require owners or operators of a construction activity to identify, locations where mitigation projects can be completed. The following conditions must be met: 
a.  Mitigation project areas are selected in the following order of preference: 
1.  Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that receives runoff from the original construction activity, 
2.  Locations within the same Department of Natural Resource (DNR) catchment area as the original construction activity. 
3.  Locations in the next adjacent DNR catchment area up-stream. 
4.  Locations anywhere within the city's jurisdiction. 
b.  Mitigation projects must involve creation of new structural stormwater BMPs or the retrofit of existing structural stormwater BMPSs, or the use of a properly designed regional structural stormwater BMP. 
c.  Routine maintenance of structural stormwater BMPs already required by the city cannot be used to meet mitigation requirements. 
d.  Mitigation projects shall be completed within 24 months after the start of the original construction activity. 
e.  The city shall determine, and document, who is responsible for long-term maintenance on all mitigation projects. 
(5)  Linear redevelopment projects. A net reduction from pre-project conditions (on an annual average basis) of: stormwater discharge volume, total suspended solids, and total phosphorus. 
a.  Where the lack of right-of-way precludes the installation of volume control practices that meet the conditions for post-stormwater management in Part.III.D.5a(2) of the city's MS4 permit, the permittee shall ensure that a reasonable attempt be made to obtain right-of-way during the project planning process. 
b.  Exceptions for stormwater discharge volume will be made only under the following circumstances: 
1.  The owner and/or operator of a construction activity is precluded from infiltrating stormwater through a designed system due to any of the infiltration related limitations described in subsection (b)(2) in this code, or 
2.  The owner and/or operator of the construction activity implements, to the MEP, volume reduction techniques, other than infiltration on the site of the original construction activity that reduces stormwater discharge volume, but may not meet the conditions for post-construction stormwater management in the MS4 permit. 
(Code 072684; Ord. No. 15-13, § 1, 12-14-2015; Ord. No. 18-17, § 1, 2-25-2019; Ord. No. 19-03, § 1, 4-22-2019) 
Sec. 5-8. - Water sprinkling ban. 
(a)  Purpose. The city council has determined that in certain drought conditions it may become necessary for the protection of the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of New Hope to conserve the water supply of the city by imposing a water sprinkling ban on all residential, commercial and industrial lawn and garden vegetation. Also, New Hope's contract with the City of Minneapolis for the purchase of water requires the imposition of a water sprinkling ban at the direction of the City of Minneapolis. The purpose of this section is to set forth the nature and extent of the regulations controlling any sprinkling ban imposed by the council. 
(b)  Resolution imposing ban. All water sprinkling bans shall be imposed by adoption of a resolution at any regular or special meeting of the New Hope City Council. The resolution shall set forth the duration of the ban, whether the ban shall be partial or absolute, if a partial ban, whether it shall apply to lawns and boulevards only or also to gardens, new sod and/or new tree saplings, the days or schedule when sprinkling will be permitted under a partial ban, and any other regulations that the city council deems reasonable and appropriate. Said ban shall become effective immediately upon the adoption of said resolution. 
(c)  Notice of ban. The resolution imposing the sprinkling ban shall be published once in the official newspaper of the city, and conspicuously posted in four places throughout the city. Any deficiencies in this notice requirement shall not invalidate the ban. 
(d)  Enforcement. A violation of this section shall be a petty misdemeanor. However, a first offense shall not result in the issuance of a ticket. The owner, any occupant of legal age or party responsible for the water billing shall be first issued a warning ticket upon the first violation of the water sprinkling ban. A warning letter mailed by regular mail, attached to an e-mail or delivered personally to the occupant of the property or the individual responsible for the water billing at the violating property shall satisfy the warning notice requirement of this section. Each act of violation and each day a violation occurs or continues constitutes a separate offense.

Sec. 6-9. - Vacating streets and publicly owned utility easements. 
(a)  Vacation proceedings. 
(1)  Public rights of way and publicly owned easements. The council may by resolution, vacate any street, alley, public grounds, public way, or any publicly owned utility easement, or any portion thereof. As to a public utility easement, or a part thereof, such easement may not be used for sewer, drainage, electric, telegraph, telephone, gas or steam purposes. 
(2)  Council super-majority required for vacation on its own motion. The council may initiate such vacation proceedings on its own motion, and this procedure shall require that a resolution vacating the premises may be adopted only by a vote of four-fifths of all members of the council. 
(3)  Council simple-majority required for vacation upon petition. On petition of a majority of the owners abutting the public property interest to be vacated, a resolution vacating the premises may be adopted only by a three-fifths vote of a majority of all of the members of the council. 
(4)  Change in legal description. The council resolution vacating the interest of the public in the proceedings may be modified subsequent to posting and publication of notice for purposes of clarity, but such modification may not increase nor decrease the extent or scope of the vacation proceedings, without republishing and posting of notice, with the revised legal description. 
(b)  Form of initiating action. 
(1)  Form of resolution. In all instances, the resolution of the council initiating a vacation proceeding shall include the following, which should be furnished by the petitioners, unless the council is acting upon its own motion: 
a.  Owner's name. Name of owner(s). 
b.  Petitioner's home. Home of petitioner(s). 
c.  Legal description. Legal description.

(3)  Fee. The petition to vacate the premises shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee in an amount as set forth in the city's fee schedule, for each lot or parcel abutting the property interest proposed to be vacated. 
(c)  Notice of hearing . After receipt of the evidence of title, the city attorney shall review it and the petition and make a written report to the clerk as to their sufficiency. Thereafter a hearing shall be held, preceded by two weeks' published and posted notice. Said notice shall set forth the time and place of such hearing, and the area proposed to be vacated. This notice includes a land use petition sign which shall be posted not less than two weeks' prior to the hearing as provided in chapter 1 of this Code. The city clerk shall mail written notice of the hearing at least ten days before the hearing to the utility companies providing natural gas, electric energy, telephone and cable television service, and to each property owner affected by the proposed vacation. Said written notice shall contain, at a minimum, a copy of the petition or proposed resolution as well as the time, place and date of the hearing. In addition, if the street, alley, public grounds, public way or any part thereof terminates at or abuts upon any public water, no vacation shall be made unless written notice of the petition or proposed resolution is served by certified mail upon the commissioner of natural resources at least 30 days before the hearing on the matter. The notice to the commissioner of natural resources is for notification purposes only and does not create a right of intervention by the commissioner.

(Ord. No. 75-5; Code 072684; Ord. No. 91-6; Ord. No. 15-13, § 2, 12-14-2015; Ord. No. 17-10, § 5, 12-11-2017; Memo. of 2-5-2018) 
Sec. 6-10. - Dispersion of percolating waters. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for the reasonable dispersal of percolating waters which are beyond the ability or the responsibility of the individual property owner to control. 
(b)  Abatement of private nuisance. Soil conditions in the city at times produce percolating water collection or infiltration in and around basements which results in the use of sump pumps to discharge such water outside of and away from the affected buildings (diverted percolating waters). In some instances, these discharges of water exceed the absorptive and evaporative capacity of the soil of the premises on which the building is situated, and saturate the soil to such an extent that it becomes unusable and cannot be maintained as a part of the yard of the owner or occupant of the structure, threatens re-entry into the house area, or unreasonably interferes with the use of adjacent property. The artificial rerouting and the accumulation of such diverted percolating waters on the surface of the ground may constitute a private nuisance for the individual owner, and possibly the neighbors. If such a private nuisance is so great as to make a substantial portion of the private property unusable or impossible to maintain and beyond the capacity of the private owner producing the diverted percolating waters, or his neighbor, to control; the city will, upon petition or application, or upon its own initiative, consider alternative methods to provide relief and to bring the accumulation of such diverted percolating waters under such reasonable control as it deems necessary and in the public interest. 
(c)  Pumping of diverted percolating water onto streets, a public nuisance. The carrying of surface waters to drainage structures for channeling away from areas where it could cause damage is one of the primary functions of the public streets. Although not primarily designed for such a function, the streets may also be used sometimes to carry away diverted percolating waters, except where quantity or constancy of flow, or unsuitable grade elevations result in damage to the streets. Because the streets are not primarily intended for the transporting of diverted percolating waters, the unrestricted discharge of diverted percolating waters onto the public streets is declared to be a public nuisance, which shall be abated or regulated as provided herein. 
(1)  Permit. In those instances where diverted percolating waters constitute a private nuisance for the owner (or neighbors), the city may, upon application or petition by the owner or on its own initiative issue a permit to the owner to discharge diverted percolating waters onto the streets if it finds that the projected flows will not damage the streets, exceed the storm sewer capacity, and not create a traffic or other hazard. 
Such permits shall be issued or denied by the city manager, and shall be cancellable by the city council at any time after notice and hearing as provided in chapter 1. In the event of an emergency as determined by the city manager, the city manager may suspend any such permit until the next regularly scheduled council meeting, at which time the council shall either confirm the suspension or reinstate the permit to its original status until the referenced hearing can be held. The permit may contain such conditions and provisions as the manager or the city council deems necessary and desirable in considering anticipated flows, adequacy of street and storm sewer design and capacity, perceived safety hazards, and other factors required for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Unless otherwise specified, such permits shall be for an indefinite period of time, unless annual or other review is required by the council at any time. The fee for such permits shall be as set forth in the city's fee schedule. If the city manager denies the issuance of a permit hereunder, the applicant may request a hearing before the city council, as prescribed in chapter 1, at such succeeding regular council meeting, as the applicant shall specify, and to which the city manager agrees, but in any event to be within the next succeeding 60 days. The city manager shall specify the reasons for such denial in writing, which shall be promptly furnished to the owner. 
(2)  Limited storm sewer. If the city finds that the proposed discharge of diverted percolating waters onto the streets for the purpose of abating a private nuisance does not qualify for a permit, the city may, at its option, construct an underground connection to the storm sewer system of the city. A limited storm sewer of this nature would be constructed upon acceptance by the council of the petition of the owner for such construction, or by the order of the council, and upon the ordering of the construction by the city council. 
a.  Minimum criteria. As minimum requirements, the council will find that the following facts exist prior to ordering the prevention of a public nuisance by construction of a limited storm sewer: 
1.  Discharge permit not applicable. The proposed discharge of diverted percolating waters does not qualify for the issuance of a permit to discharge upon the public street. 
2.  Property's water dissipation capacity exceeded. The quantity and consistency of the diverted percolating waters exceed the capacity of the property of the owner to dissipate the same. 
3.  Property unsuitable for intended use. The excess quantity of diverted percolating waters renders the property of the owner unsuitable for its intended use; not just inconvenient or a diminished enjoyment, but unsuitable for residential use. 
4.  Condition permanent. The condition is found to be permanent, not a temporary phenomenon experienced only in severe wet years or periods. Sporadic conditions of this nature may be corrected by the city upon request of the owner, but at the expense of the owner. 
5.  Twenty to 50 gallons per hour discharge rate. The anticipated average rate of discharge of diverted percolating waters is in the 20 to 50 gallons per hour range. 
6.  Payment. If the owner does not elect to pay for the construction of the limited storm sewer, the construction qualifies as a special assessment public improvement project under Minn. Stat. ch. 429, either as a necessary adjunct to an existing street construction or repair project, or as a separate assessment district. 
7.  Other requirements. Any other requirements deemed desirable or necessary in the public interest. 
b.  Private nuisance policy. Private nuisances created by diverted percolating waters which do not trespass on the streets as a public nuisance or upon the property of others as a private or public nuisance will not be abated by the construction of limited storm sewers. 
(3)  Permit to connect to limited storm sewer. No person shall connect any pipe or otherwise divert waters to a limited storm sewer of the city unless a permit has been issued in the same manner as provided in paragraph a above, with payment of a fee as set forth in the city's fee schedule. 
(Ord. No. 83-12; Ord. No. 83-16; Ord. No. 15-13, § 2, 12-14-2015; Memo. of 2-5-2018) 
Sec. 6-11. - Unclaimed property. 
(a)  When unclaimed property may be disposed of. Any personal property (except dogs and motor vehicles) in the custody or possession of the city or with any party with whom the city has contracted for removal and storage, which has been abandoned by the owners thereof or for which no owner has been found may be disposed of after said property has been so held by the city for at least 60 days. The city may dispose of perishable property prior to the expiration of said sixty days if said 60-day wait would result in a substantial reduction in the value of the property. 
(b)  Method of disposition. 
(1)  Notice of sale. All property held in custody of the city, or any party with whom it contracts for such storage, shall be sold at public auction or sale, at any time after such property has been held for at least 60 days. Public notice of the sale shall be given at least once, not less than three days before the date of proposed sale. Said notice shall state the time and place of said proposed sale and the property to be sold. 
(2)  Conduct of sale. Said sale may be conducted by the city clerk or by any other authorized employee or agent of the city. The proceeds of any such sale shall be applied in payment of the expenses of the sale and all other costs occurred in retaining and storing such property. The balance of the proceeds remaining from such sale shall be paid into the general fund of the city. Any property offered for sale but not sold and not suitable for appropriation to the use of the city shall be deemed of no value and shall be disposed of in such manner as the city manager directs. 
(3)  Terms of sale. The city shall not be liable in any manner for the condition of any such property which is sold, and no warranty, express or implied, is authorized in connection with any such sale. 
(c)  Former owner may receive payment. The true owner of such unclaimed personal property, held for sale or disposal by the city, may reclaim the property upon satisfactory proof of ownership thereof prior to the sale or other disposition hereunder. If such unclaimed personal property has already been sold or otherwise has been disposed of under the provisions of this section, the true owner, upon application to the city clerk within six months of such sale or disposition and upon satisfactory proof of ownership, shall be entitled to receive the actual sale price of such property, except that there shall be deducted from said sale price any expenses incurred by the city in connection with the retention, storage and sale of such property. The net proceeds of the sale deposited in the general fund shall be subject only to the former owner's right to receive payments as herein provided.

Sec. 6-14. - Right-of-way management. 
(a)  Findings and purpose . The city holds the rights-of-way within its geographical boundaries as an asset in trust for its citizens. The city and other public entities have invested substantial dollars in public funds to build and maintain the rights-of-way. The city also recognizes that by placing other utility equipment in the right-of-way for the purpose of delivering services to the citizens of the city also is a public use of this property for the public good. Although such services are necessary or convenient for the citizens, other persons or entities receive revenue and/or profit through their use of public property. Although the installation of such service delivery facilities are in most cases a necessary and proper use of right-of-way, the city must regulate and manage such uses. 
To provide for the health, safety and well-being of its citizens, and to ensure the structural integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances. Although the general population bears the financial burden for the upkeep of the rights-of-way, one of the causes for the early and excessive deterioration of its rights-of-way is frequent excavation. 
This section imposes reasonable regulations on the placement and maintenance of equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this section, persons disturbing and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear a fair share of the financial responsibility for their integrity. Finally, this section provides for recovery of the city's costs associated with managing its rights-of-way. 
This section shall be interpreted consistently with Minn. Stat. Ch. 237, Minnesota Rules Chapter 7819, and other laws governing applicable rights of the city and users of the right-of-way. This section shall not be interpreted to limit the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
(b)  Election to manage the rights-of-way . Pursuant to the authority granted to the city under state and federal statutory, administrative, and common law, the city hereby elects, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 237.163, subd. 2(b), to manage rights-of-way within its jurisdiction.

(g)  Revocation of permit. The city manager may revoke or deny renewal of any permit for failure to comply with the provisions of this Code, the zoning code, for misrepresentation of material facts in the original application, for failure to maintain the courtesy bench, because the bench is considered a safety hazard, because the bench location is no longer served by public transportation, because the transit route on which the bench is located has or will be included in a streetscape project or for any reason which would have been grounds for denial of the original application. 
(h)  Installation and maintenance. 
(1)  Location. Courtesy benches shall be installed parallel with the curb, sidewalk or trail, and set back at least three feet from the back of the curb.

Advertisements of obscene, immoral, indecent or illegal matter is prohibited on all courtesy benches. No advertising matter on any courtesy bench may display the words stop, look, drive in, danger, or any other word, phrase or symbol, reflective material or illumination device which might interfere with, mislead or distract traffic.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 15-23, § 1, adopted Oct. 26, 2015, repealed the former ch. 7, §§ 7-1-7-4, and § 2 of said ordinance enacted a new ch. 7 as set out herein. The former ch. 7 pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for derivation. 

Sec. 7-1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations governing the ownership and control of dogs, cats and other animals in the city, in order to protect the public and the animals themselves, and to promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. No. 15-23, § 2, 10-26-2015) 
Sec. 7-2. - Control of dogs, cats and other animals. 
    The following provisions shall regulate the ownership and control of dogs, cats and other animals: 
(1)  License, registration and vaccination. 
a.  Licenses required. All dogs, cats and ferrets kept, harbored or maintained by their owners in the city shall be licensed and registered if over six months of age. Any animal or dog determined by the city's animal control officer to be a "dangerous animal or dog" or a "potentially dangerous animal or dog" as those terms are defined by Minn. Stat. § 347.50 shall register said animal or dog with the animal control officer in accordance with section 7-3 of this Code and Minn. Stat. § 347.51. The requirements to keep a dangerous animal or dog or a potentially dangerous animal or dog as set out in section 7-3 of this Code or Minn. Stat. §§ 347.50 through 347.565 shall apply in addition to and not in exclusion of the other requirements to keep and maintain animals within the city. In the event of any inconsistency between Minn. Stat. §§ 347.50 through 347.565 and the provisions of this Code as it relates to the regulation of dangerous animals or dogs or potentially dangerous animals or dogs, the most stringent regulation shall apply. 
b.  Rabies vaccination required. All licensed dogs, cats and ferrets must have a current rabies vaccination during the entire license period per section 7-2(7) of this Code. 
c.  License and fees. All licenses shall expire simultaneously with the rabies vaccination expiration. The fees for licensing and registration are set forth in the city's fee schedule. Cats and ferrets may be declared "indoor only" by their owners at the time of licensing and will receive their license at no charge. However, if an "indoor only" animal is later impounded or found to be running at large, the owner will be required to pay all previously waived license fees and the animal will permanently lose its "indoor only" status for future license fees. 
d.  Certified assistance animals. Licenses for certified assistance animals shall be issued free of charge. This section shall apply to any working animals trained to perform tasks for people with disabilities, including, but not limited to, guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling wheel chairs or alerting or protecting people having a seizure. 
e.  Transfer of ownership. Upon the sale or transfer of any licensed animal to a new owner, the license and registration issued by the City of New Hope shall be void, and if the animal remains in the City of New Hope, a new license and registration must be obtained. License tags shall not be transferable from one animal to another, and no refunds shall be made on any license fee because of death of the animal or the owners leaving the city before expiration of the license. 
(2)  Tag and collar. 
a.  Tag issuance and wearing. Upon payment of the license fee, the clerk or clerk's designee shall furnish each owner of a licensed dog, cat or ferret a metallic tag upon which there shall be stamped or engraved the registered number of the animal and the words "New Hope." Every owner shall be required to provide each animal with a collar to which the license tag must be affixed, and shall see that the collar and tag are constantly worn. 
b.  Lost tags. If a metallic tag is lost or destroyed, a duplicate or new tag will be issued upon proof that such animal was licensed, and the payment of the fee set forth in the city's fee schedule. 
(3)  Nuisances and running at large. 
a.  Nuisance animals. Animals shall be maintained and handled in such a manner as to prevent their becoming a nuisance or a threat to health and safety. 
b.  Responsibility of owners, loose animals. No owner or keeper of animals shall permit such animal to run at large within the limits of the city other than on premises owned or rented by the owner, or with the permission of the owner, in accordance with the provisions regarding confinement and control per section 7-2(6) of this Code. 
c.  Responsibility of guests loose animals. No person who is a guest of a resident in the city shall permit his animal to run at large, other than on the premises owned or occupied by his host, or with the permission of the owner, in accordance with the provisions regarding confinement and control, below. 
d.  Noisy animals. No owner of an animal shall permit barking, howling or other noises that disturb the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. 
e.  Animal wastes. No owner of an animal shall permit the deposit of animal excrement on public property or on the property of others, nor to accumulate on his own or rented property, as otherwise provided herein. The public streets, the adjacent boulevards and city parks are public property and within the scope of this subsection and any deposit of excrement by animals, even if accidental, shall be the responsibility of the owner or caretaker of the animal to immediately remove and deposit. Persons in control of animals must have in their possession tools or equipment suitable for the removal of animal fecal material and shall promptly and effectively remove from the ground all fecal material deposited there by the animal. Persons removing animal waste from park surfaces or public property shall dispose of it in a sanitary manner, which may include depositing it in any designated waste receptacle located in public parks or on public property. It is expressly prohibited to dispose of animal fecal material in any city storm sewer or any area connected in any way to the city storm sewer system. 
f.  Permanent outdoor animal shelter. No animal owner shall permanently maintain or keep any animal outside in any kennel or shelter that does not comply with the following bedding and shelter requirements: 
1.  The shelter must be enclosed or fenced in such a manner so as to prevent the running at large or escape of the animal confined; 
2.  The shelter must be capable of adequately protecting the animal from heat, cold, wind, snow and rain, and bedding must be provided for the animal and maintained in a clean condition; 
3.  The shelter must be constructed on an impervious surface permitting for proper drainage and cleaning or on a surface which does not permit the collection of water, waste, feed or a mixture thereof to ensure against an unsanitary condition for the animal, humans or the environment; 
4.  Clean drinking water and suitable commercial or natural food appropriate for the diet of the specific animal sheltered shall be provided on a routine regular basis; 
5.  The animal and shelter shall be at all times maintained in a clean, healthy, sanitary, safe and humane condition. 
(4)  Impounding. 
a.  When impounded. It shall be the duty of the poundmaster, animal control officer and every police officer to apprehend any dog found unlicensed, or any animal running at large, contrary to the provisions of this section, and to impound such animal at the city or other suitable place. 
b.  Dangerous, fierce or vicious animals. If any dangerous, fierce, or vicious animal found at large in the city cannot be safely taken and impounded, such animal may be slain by the animal control officer or any police officer, or impounded until a licensed veterinarian shall certify that the animal is not rabid. 
c.  Dangerous propensities of biting animals. Any animal which has bitten a person within 60 days preceding impoundment or other disposition hereunder shall, for the purposes of this section, be considered an animal of dangerous, fierce, or vicious propensities. 
d.  Notice. Notice of impounding shall be given to the owner of the animal, as provided in chapter 1 of this Code. In case the owner is unknown, written notice shall be posted at the police department and the records will be maintained in accordance with Minn. Stat. § 346.47, subd. 2. 
e.  Reclaiming animals and fees. The owner of any animal so impounded may reclaim such animal upon payment of any required and unpaid license fee, the impounding fee and the boarding charges. Fees, in connection with the boarding, impounding, euthanasia and similar services shall be as set forth in the city's fee schedule. 
(5)  Disposition of unclaimed or infected animals. Any animal impounded shall be kept for at least five days unless sooner reclaimed by the owner as provided above. If the animal shall not have been redeemed at such time it may be disposed of in the following manner: 
a.  Destroyed or sold. The animal may be destroyed or sold, provided that such animal shall not be sold for less than the aggregate amount of fees, above. All animals which appear in the judgment of the pets under police security (PUPS) poundkeeper to be suffering from rabies or affected with hydrophobia, shall not be released but shall be euthanized by the poundkeeper and the remains shall be disposed of in an appropriate manner as determined by the poundkeeper. 
b.  Reserved. 
(6)  Confinement and control. No person who owns, keeps, harbors or maintains an animal, or the parents or guardian of any person under 18 years of age who keeps an animal, shall allow or permit an animal to be on any private parcel, lot, area or land in the city without being effectively restrained from entering beyond such parcel, area or lot by leashing or fencing. No person having custody or control of any animal shall permit such animal to be on any street, public park, school grounds or public place in the city without being effectively restrained by chain or leash so as not to interfere with the safety or activity of others. This leash confinement requirement shall not apply to a designated "off leash dog park" area established by the city within a city park. The acceptable standard of control is a leash six feet or less. Retractable leashes exceeding six feet are acceptable so long as the distance between the person and the animal provides real control of the animal and the animal does not interfere with the safety or activity of others. It shall be prima facie evidence of control if the animal is restrained by a leash six feet or less. Animals in heat shall be confined in an enclosure which prevents their escape, or the entry therein of other animals. 
(7)  Rabies vaccination. 
a.  Vaccination required. Except as provided in subsection (7)c. below, no license shall be issued for an animal which has not been vaccinated for rabies. A certificate of vaccination or other written statement to the same effect executed by a doctor qualified to practice veterinary medicine in the state in which the animal is vaccinated shall be prima facie proof of the required vaccination. 
b.  Effective period of vaccine. To be accepted, a certificate must show on its face the effective vaccination period. All vaccinations and boosters are deemed to be effective for the shorter of the effective period stated in the certificate of vaccination or the period recognized by the State of Minnesota Board of Animal Health, which currently follows the guidelines in the Compendium of Animal Rabies Control issued by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, Inc. 
c.  Young animals. Animals vaccinated between three and six months shall be revaccinated at one year of age. 
(8)  Muzzling proclamation. Whenever the prevalence of hydrophobia or rabies render such action necessary to protect the public health and safety, the mayor may issue a proclamation ordering every person owning or keeping an animal to confine it securely on his premises unless it is muzzled so that it cannot bite. No person shall violate such proclamation and any unmuzzled animal running at large during the time affixed in the proclamation shall be killed by the poundmaster, animal control officer or any police officer, without notice to the owner. 
(9)  Biting animals. 
a.  Impounding. An animal which is capable of transmitting rabies and which has bitten a person shall be impounded at PUPS for at least ten days from the time of the bite, separate and apart from all other animals and under the care and supervision of a licensed veterinarian, until it is determined whether or not said animal had or has rabies. If the animal is found to be rabid, it shall be destroyed; if it is found not to be rabid, it shall be returned to the owner provided that owner shall first pay for the cost of impounding it. If the owner does not pay such cost within five days after he has been notified to claim or retrieve his animal, the animal may be disposed of as provided for the disposition of unclaimed or infected animals per section 7-2(5) of this Code. If the said impounding facility is one other than the city dog pound, it shall be one acceptable to the poundmaster. The cost incurred by the city in carrying out the provisions of this paragraph shall be paid by the owner of such impounded animal. In any event, no impounded animal shall be released until it is licensed as provided above. 
b.  Bitten animals. An animal which has been bitten by a known rabid animal shall be picked up and destroyed, provided, however, that such animal may be immediately killed if with reasonable effort it cannot first be taken up and impounded. If so picked up and impounded, the animal shall not be destroyed if the owner thereof makes provisions for a suitable quarantine for a period of not less than six months for unvaccinated animals, or for 30 days, if proof of previous immunization is furnished and booster injections are given by a licensed veterinarian at the expense of the owner of such animal. 
(10)  Establishment of city pound. The city pound and city poundkeeper shall be named by resolution of the city council. 
(11)  Records. The poundkeeper shall cause an account to be kept of animals impounded at the city pound, and of their disposition. The poundkeeper shall turn over such accounts to the city clerk from time to time, or upon request of the police chief, city clerk, or the city manager. 
(12)  Animal control officer. The animal control officer shall be appointed by the city manager. The animal control officer shall have the powers and duties to patrol the city and enforce the provisions of this section including the issuing of citations for violations thereof. 
(13)  Interference with others. No unauthorized person shall break open the pound or attempt to do so, or to take or let out any animal therefrom or take or attempt to take from any police officer or animal control officer any animal taken up by a police officer or animal control officer in compliance with this section, or in any manner interfere with or hinder a police officer or animal control officer in the discharge of their duties under this section. 
(14)  Penalty. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a petty misdemeanor provided, however, that violation of the biting animals provision of section 7-2(9) of this Code, by an animal owner, or person responsible for any animal, shall be a misdemeanor.

(a)  Purpose. In acknowledgment of the public benefit to be gained by providing urban residents with convenient and cost-effective access to rural farm produce, the purpose of this section is to establish guidelines for the permitting of temporary agricultural sales sites. As a mature, inner ring suburb, New Hope lacks suitable permanent or long-term open space sites to devote to such sales activity. Therefore, it is the intent of this section to modify certain zoning requirements specifically for the uses contemplated by this section, while still maintaining a level of regulation that protects the general public health, safety, and welfare. 
(b)  Requirements for sales operations. 
(1)  No such operation shall take place in a zoning district for which it is not allowed as a permitted use.

This limitation shall not apply to the product display area but does apply to any merchandise storage area not accessible by customers of the sales operation. 
(9)  The site plan must clearly demonstrate that adequate off-street parking for the proposed event can be provided for the permit's duration without reducing the parking requirements of the principal use below minimum parking standards of this Code.

Such signs shall be located within either the area occupied by the sales operation or as an attachment to an existing sign for the principal use otherwise occupying the site, provided that the city staff must in any case approve the exact sign location. All off-premises signage beyond the sales display area, including but not limited to directional signage, is prohibited. 
(11)  Any use of an outdoor sound system in any connection with the sales operation shall not be audible beyond a distance of ten feet from the sales structure or sales display area.

Sec. 8-34. - Private alarm systems. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote and maintain the operational effectiveness and reliability of private alarm systems, reduce or eliminate false alarms and prevent unnecessary responses by the New Hope Police and the West Metro Fire-Rescue District unduly diverting them from other law enforcement and fire protection activities. Nothing herein shall be construed to impose any duty on the New Hope Police Department or the West Metro Fire-Rescue District to respond to alarm dispatch requests, limit the discretion of the police department or fire district to establish response policies, or waive any applicable governmental immunities. The city council hereby makes the following findings to regulate alarm systems within the city: 
(1)  The police department and fire district's response to false alarms has placed an intolerable burden upon the time and resources of both departments. 
(2)  The police department's response to false alarms unduly diverts law enforcement resources from legitimate crime prevention and law enforcement activities. The fire district's response to false alarms unduly diverts fire enforcement from legitimate fire protection and prevention activities. This threatens the health, safety and welfare of the city and its citizens. 
(b)  Scope. Section 8-34 et al. governs alarm systems intended to summon fire protection and law enforcement response and thereby requires alarm system registration, establishes fees, provides for penalties and fees for violations, establishes a system of administration, and sets conditions for suspension of police response and fire response. 
(c)  Definitions. The following definitions are specific to this subsection and are not applicable to any other sections of this Code: 
    Alarm administrator. The director of police, or designee, is responsible for the administration, control, and review of the city's false police alarm reduction efforts. The fire chief of the West Metro Fire-Rescue District, or designee, is responsible for the administration, control and review of the city's false fire alarm reduction efforts.

Specifically included in this section and the provisions of it are individuals, partnerships, corporations, or other entities performing alarm system monitoring services. 
    Alarm dispatch request means notification to a law enforcement agency or fire department that an alarm, either manual or automatic, has been activated at a particular alarm site.

Alarm systems to monitor temperature, carbon monoxide, humidity, medical emergencies, or any other condition not related to the detection of a fire or criminal intrusion into an alarm site or an attempted robbery at an alarm site are specifically excluded from the provisions of this Code. Alarm systems installed on a vehicle or person are also excluded unless the alarm is permanently affixed to a specific location.

    False fire alarm means the activation of any fire alarm system which results in a dispatch of the fire district caused by mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation, lack of proper maintenance or any other response for which the fire district personnel are unable to determine the apparent cause of the alarm activation, or which is caused by the negligence or intentional misuse of the fire alarm system by the owner, its employees, agents or any other activation of a fire alarm system not caused by heat, smoke or fire. False fire alarms do not include alarms caused by climatic conditions such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, utility line mishaps, violent conditions of nature, or any other conditions which are clearly beyond the control of the alarm manufacturer, installer or owner. 
    False police alarm means an alarm signal eliciting notification to and a response by police personnel where the responding police officer, having completed a timely investigation of the alarm site, is unable to find any evidence of a crime or attempted crime and which is caused by the activation of the alarm system through mechanical failure, alarm malfunction, improper installation, or the inadvertence of the owner or lessee of an alarm system, or of such owner or lessee's employees or agents, or by service technicians. False police alarms do not include alarms caused by climatic conditions such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, utility line mishaps, violent conditions of nature, or any other conditions which are clearly beyond the control of the alarm manufacturer, installer, or owner.

(2)  Fees nonrefundable. The fee for initial registration and annual renewal for an alarm site are as set forth in the city's fee schedule. The fees shall reflect the administrative cost to the city to monitor and respond to alarm systems as provided herein. Registration and annual renewal fees are nonrefundable. The initial registration fee must be submitted to the alarm administrator within seven days after the alarm installation or alarm takeover. 
(3)  Failure to register. Failure to register alarm systems at an alarm site shall constitute a violation of this subsection (d). An alarm user that fails to register as required herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of $100.00 for each false alarm occurrence while the alarm system remains unregistered. The fine for the first violation of this section will be waived if the alarm user registers within seven days from the false alarm occurrence. 
(4)  Transferability. An alarm registration cannot be transferred to another person or alarm site. An alarm user shall inform the alarm administrator of any change that alters any information listed on the registration application within seven days from the date of said change. 
(5)  Registration, duration, and renewal. The initial registration for a single residence is valid for the time period the registrant is the alarm user. If the alarm user has a false alarm requiring the payment of a false alarm fee, the alarm administrator may require the alarm user to file a registration renewal at no cost. The initial registration shall expire December 31 for all other alarm sites and must be renewed annually per section 8-2 of this Code by submitting an updated application and a registration renewal fee to the alarm administrator. The alarm administrator shall notify each alarm user of the need to renew 30 days prior to the expiration of the registration. It is the responsibility of the alarm user to submit an application prior to the registration expiration date. Failure to renew will constitute a violation of this section. A $25.00 late fee shall be assessed if the renewal application is submitted more than 30 days after the receipt of the above-described notice from the alarm administrator.

(4)  Alarm adjustment. Adjust the mechanism or cause the mechanism to be adjusted so that an alarm signal on the exterior of an alarm site will sound for no longer than ten minutes after being activated (or 15 minutes for systems operating under Underwriter Laboratories, Inc. Standard 365 or 609). Fire alarm systems shall be exempt from this section; 
(5)  Key-holder list. Maintain a current key-holder list with their alarm company;

Provide each of its alarm system users with operating instructions for their alarm system, including an explanation of the company's verification process, a telephone number to call for assistance in operating the system, and a summary of the provisions of this section relating to penalties for false alarms and the possibility of no police response to alarm systems experiencing excessive false alarms; and 
f.  Establish a training period during the first seven days following the installation of any burglary alarm system during which the alarm user will be trained on the proper use of the system and during which no requests for an immediate dispatch of police personnel will be made by the alarm company without independent factual support.

(2)  False alarm fee-Alarm company. Where the responding police officer or fire district representative determines that a false alarm was caused by the on-site actions of an employee of the alarm company, a penalty of $100.00 shall be assessed against the alarm company with no corresponding false alarm fee being assessed against the alarm user. 
(3)  Exceptions. No false alarm fee shall be due and no alarm shall be deemed as a false alarm if it is shown that the false alarm was the result of damage to utility lines, tornadoes, lightning, earthquakes, or other such severe weather conditions. 
(4)  Payment of fees. Payment of fees provided for herein shall be paid to the city within 30 days from the date of notice by the city to the alarm user. Failure to pay the fee within 30 days of notice will cause the alarm user to be considered delinquent and subject to a late payment penalty equal to ten percent of the false alarm fee. 
(5)  Outstanding balances. If an alarm user has an outstanding balance due the city that is 60 days past due, all delinquent charges will be certified by the city clerk to the county assessor who shall prepare an assessment roll each year. Each delinquent account will be charged an additional assessment fee as set forth in the city's fee schedule for approval by the city council, the second Monday of October each calendar year. Any alarm user who has an outstanding balance at the time of renewal will not have their false alarm count reset to zero and will not be eligible for no fee false alarms for the following year unless the outstanding alarm balance is being formally appealed. If the appeal is denied, the outstanding balance and any other fees must be paid at the time of renewal in order to have the false alarm ordinance count reset to zero. 
(i)  Right to notice and appeal. 
(1)  Notice. Written notice shall be provided to all alarm users notifying them of all false alarm responses to the premises and their status as a chargeable fee. The alarm user has the right to request an informal hearing before the director of police, fire chief or their designee to appeal the false alarm fee. The request must be in writing and filed with the director of police or fire chief within ten days of the false alarm notice. 
(2)  Appeal. Anyone aggrieved by the decision of the director of police, fire chief or their designee to affirm the false alarm fee may appeal that decision to the city manager by filing a written request for an appeal within ten days of the date of that decision. The city manager's decision will be final. 
(j)  Penalties. Any alarm user who fails to register an alarm system, after being given notice and ample opportunity, or any person who fails to pay any fees levied after given an opportunity to appeal is guilty of a petty misdemeanor. 
(k)  Suspension of police response. 
(1)  Notice of suspension of police response. Upon the occurrence of the sixth false burglary alarm from an alarm site within the alarm registration calendar year, or where the alarm user is more than 120 days overdue in their payment of false alarm fees, the alarm administrator shall serve in person, or by U.S. mail, the alarm user's designated contact person with written notification that effective 14 days from the date of the notice, the New Hope Police Department will not respond to a burglary alarm dispatch request from that site for the remainder of the alarm registration calendar year unless there is an in-person call for assistance from someone at or near the premises or other independent information that verifies the need for an immediate police response. The notification will include the reasons for suspension of police response and requirements for reinstatement. 
(2)  Written appeal of suspension notice. Within seven days from the date of the suspension notice, the alarm user may file with the alarm administrator a written appeal of the proposed suspension of police response explaining the steps taken to correct the problem, any facts pertaining to the overdue payment of fines, the facts and circumstances of the false alarms from this alarm site, and any other information relevant to the alarm administrator's proposed suspension of police response. Within five days of the alarm administrator's receipt of the written appeal, and after reviewing the city's files for the alarm site, alarm user, and alarm company, and all of the submissions of the alarm user, the alarm administrator shall issue a decision to confirm, suspend, or rescind the suspension notice and serve a written copy thereof on the alarm user's contact person by mail. 
(3)  Suspension of police response. Where an alarm user has failed to properly file a timely appeal of a notice to suspend or where the alarm administrator has issued a decision confirming a notice to suspend, the New Hope Police Department, in determining whether to make an immediate police dispatch and response to notification of a signal from that alarm user's alarm system, may disregard that burglary alarm dispatch request when the alarm signal is the only basis for making the dispatch request. Where there is, in addition to the alarm dispatch request, an in-person call verification from a person at or near the premises or other independent evidence showing a need for police dispatch to the alarm site, police may consider the suspension of police response as an additional factor in the decision to order an immediate response. 
(l)  Reinstatement of police response. An alarm user whose police alarm response has been suspended may have police alarm response reinstated by the alarm administrator if they have complied with the alarm administrator's requirements including one or more of the following: 
(1)  Submits an updated application and the registration fee; 
(2)  Pays, or otherwise resolves, all citations and fees; 
(3)  Submits a certification from an alarm company stating that the alarm system has been inspected and repaired, if necessary, by the alarm company; 
(4)  Submits proof that an employee of the alarm company caused the false alarm; 
(5)  Files certification demonstrating that the alarm user has corrected operator errors causing the false alarm. 
(m)  Fire watch. The fire chief or the chief's designee has the authority to require a fire watch after six false fire alarms within the alarm registration calendar year until corrective action is taken to eliminate the cause of the false fire alarm. A fire watch shall be established as follows: 
(1)  Written notice to establish a fire watch and to disconnect or deactivate the fire alarm system shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the alarm user's designated contact person. The notice shall specify the date on which the alarm user shall be required to disconnect or deactivate the fire alarm system. The date shall be at least 15 days after the notice is mailed to the alarm user. The alarm user may appeal the order pursuant to subsection (i) of this section. 
(2)  Each building affected because the signal from the fire alarm system has been disconnected or deactivated shall be required to establish a fire watch until the fire alarm system has been returned to service. Duties of the fire watch shall include notifying the fire department and building occupants of an emergency, preventing a fire from occurring or extinguishing small fires. 
(3)  The alarm user is responsible for paying all costs associated with establishing a fire watch. 
(4)  The fire chief or the chief's designee shall have the authority to direct the alarm user of the premises to silence an activated fire alarm system, have corrective action taken and thereafter order the alarm system reset. 
(n)  Reconnection of fire alarm system. A fire alarm system may be reactivated upon a finding by the fire chief that the alarm user of the premises has taken corrective action to remedy the cause of the false fire alarms at the premises. The findings shall be based on compliance with the following conditions: 
(1)  In making a request for such reactivation, the alarm user shall have the burden of proving the corrective action was taken. 
(2)  The fire chief, or the chief's designee, shall inspect the fire alarm system and test it prior to approving a new order to reconnect or reactivate the fire alarm system. 
(3)  A $50.00 inspection fee may be assessed to the owner before any reconnection of a fire alarm system may be made. 
(4)  The fire chief shall not approve a new order to reconnect or reactivate if the alarm user has failed to pay any fee pursuant to this Code. 
(5)  The fire chief shall have the authority to require that a fire alarm system be brought into compliance with all current codes and standards prior to the fire alarm system reactivation or reconnection. 
(o)  Enforcement and penalties. Enforcement of this section may be by civil action and/or by criminal prosecution. 
(p)  Confidentiality. Information contained in the registration application and applications for appeal is classified as security information as designated under the Minnesota Data Privacy Act, Section 13.37 and shall be handled accordingly by all employees or representatives of the City of New Hope or the West Metro Fire-Rescue District and by any third party administrator or employees of a third party administrator with access to such information.

(5)  Variance standards. In approving or denying applications for a variance, the noise control officer or the appeal authority may approve a variance application only with a finding that full compliance with the requirements of this section would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, on other persons, or the community. In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the noise control officer or the appeal authority shall balance the hardship to the applicant against the adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of the persons affected, the adverse impact on property and persons affected, and any other adverse effects of granting the variance. 
(6)  Condition. The variance may be granted subject to conditions, including a time limit, all of which shall be clearly stated in writing within a permit approving the variance. 
(h)  Enforcement . 
(1)  Notice of certain violations. When the noise control officer determines that a noise exceeds the maximum sound level permitted under this Code, he or she shall give written notice of the violation to the owner or occupant of the premises where the noise originates and order such person to correct or remove each specified violation within such reasonable time as is prescribed in the notice. The failure to remove or correct any such violation within the time so prescribed constitutes a violation of this section. 
(2)  Criminal penalties. Any violation of this section involving the operation of a motor vehicle is a petty misdemeanor. Every person who violates any other provision of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor. Each act of violation and each day a violation occurs or continues constitutes a separate offense.

a.  Landowner or owner means the person who is listed as the contact person on the current rental licensing application on file with the city, if any, or, if none, the person listed as owner by the county assessor on the homestead record, or, if none, the taxpayer as shown by the records of the county assessor.

Secs. 9-81-9-89. - Reserved. 
Sec. 9-90. - Graffiti prohibited. 
(a)  Findings and purpose . The purpose of this section is to prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property thereby limiting its adverse impact on neighborhoods. Therefore, the city council makes the following findings regarding the need to promptly remove graffiti from private and public property: 
(1)  Graffiti constitutes a form of vandalism defacing public and private property without the permission of the owner, and causing citizens, businesses and the city to incur the cost of repair and removal. 
(2)  Graffiti is a visual symbol of disorder eroding public safety, contributing to a downward spiral of blight and decay, lessening property values, business viability and ultimately tax revenues and, as such, is inconsistent with the city's property maintenance goals and aesthetic standards. 
(3)  There is substantial evidence that prompt eradication of graffiti is an effective prevention strategy which discourages its return while failure to promptly remove graffiti increases the likelihood that more graffiti will occur on the same site and on other nearby property. 
(4)  The failure to maintain one's property by removing graffiti which has been declared by the city to constitute a public nuisance within a reasonable period of time is injurious to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the residents of the city. 
(b)  Definitions . The following words and terms when used in this section shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
(1)  Graffiti. Any inscription, word, figure, painting or other defacement that is written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any surface of a structure, fixture or object, including but not limited to: buildings, walls, fences, bridges, benches, shelters, sidewalks, hydrants, fountains, pavement, curbs, trees, rocks, signs, railroad cars, vehicles, utility poles or boxes situated on public or private property by any graffiti implement, to the extent that the inscription, word, figure, painting or other defacement was not authorized in advance by the responsible party for the property, or, despite advance authorization, is otherwise deemed a public nuisance by the city manager, or the designee thereof, pursuant to subsections (b)(3) and (d). 
(2)  Graffiti implement. Paint, aerosol or pressurized containers of paint, indelible broad-tipped markers, paint stick, etching equipment or any other device capable of scarring or leaving a visible mark on any natural or manmade surface. A paint stick is further defined as any device containing a solid form of paint or other similar substance capable of being applied to a surface by pressure. 
(3)  Public nuisance. Real property within the city containing a condition that defaces it or any permanent structure, fixture or object situated thereon which in turn causes or tends to cause depreciation in the enjoyment and use, or in the value of the property in its immediate vicinity or which has the potential to unreasonably annoy, injure or endanger the safety, health, morals or general welfare of ordinary and reasonable members of the public. 
(4)  Responsible party. An owner, legal occupant or an entity or person acting as an agent for an owner by agreement, who has authority over the real property or is responsible for the property's maintenance or management. Irrespective of any arrangement to the contrary with any other party, each property owner shall always be a responsible party for the purposes of this section. There may be more than one responsible party for a particular property. 
(c)  Prohibited acts . The following acts constitute graffiti vandalism: 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person to intentionally place or apply, or attempt to place or apply, graffiti on any surface of a structure, fixture or object located on public or private real property within the city without the advance authorization of a responsible party for the property. This shall apply to permanent, temporary or moveable structures or objects such as vehicles and railroad cars. 
(2)  It shall be unlawful for any person to possess any graffiti implement with the intent to use the same to place or apply graffiti on any public or private real property within the city or on any surface of a permanent structure, fixture or object located thereon. 
(d)  Graffiti as nuisance . 
(1)  Declaration. The existence of graffiti on public or private property in violation of this section is expressly declared to be public nuisance and, therefore, is subject to the removal and abatement provisions specified in this Code. 
(2)  Duty of property owner. It is the duty of both the owner of the property to which the graffiti has been applied and any person who may be in possession of or who has the right to possess such property to at all times keep the property clear of graffiti. 
(e)  Removal of graffiti . 
(1)  By perpetrator. The city may require any person applying graffiti on public or private property to either remove or pay for all costs for removal of the graffiti within 24 hours after notice by the city or property owner. The removal must be performed in a manner prescribed by the city, with materials and colors compatible with existing surfaces and to a comparable or improved condition before the graffiti application as determined by the city. Where graffiti is applied by a person under 18 years old, the parents or legal guardian will also be responsible for such removal or for payment for the costs of removal. Failure of any person to remove graffiti or pay for the removal will constitute an additional violation of this chapter. 
(2)  By property owner or city. The city may also order that the graffiti be removed by the property owner or any person who may be in possession or who has the right to possess such property, pursuant to the nuisance abatement procedure herein. Graffiti removal and corrections must be performed by the property owner within five days of its occurrence with materials and colors compatible with existing surfaces as determined by the city. If the property owner or responsible party fails to remove graffiti within five days of its occurrence, the city may commence abatement and cost recovery proceedings for the graffiti removal in accordance with subsection 9-90(f) of this Code. 
(f)  Graffiti abatement procedure . 
(1)  Abatement by city. If the owner, occupant or other responsible party does not remove the graffiti within five days of its occurrence, the city may abate the public nuisance. 
(2)  Notice of hearing. The following notification must be conducted prior to city abatement of the public nuisance. Whenever it is determined that a public nuisance is being maintained or exists on a property, the city manager or authorized designee must give five days' written notice through service by first class mail or by posting a notice on the property or by personal delivery to the owner of or person in control of the property on which the public nuisance is located. When the property is occupied, service upon the occupant is deemed service upon the owner. Where the property is unoccupied or abandoned, service may be by mail to the last known owner of record of the property or by posting on the property. The notice must state: 
a.  A description of the public nuisance or graffiti to be removed; 
b.  That the public nuisance must be corrected and removed within five days of the service of the notice; 
c.  That if the public nuisance or graffiti is not properly removed or corrected as ordered, the public nuisance or graffiti will be abated by the city and the costs of abatement will be specially assessed to the property taxes; 
d.  That the owner of or person in control of the property on which the public nuisance is located may in writing request a hearing before the city manager or authorized designee. 
(3)  Hearing, action. If a hearing is requested during the five-day period, the city manager or authorized designee must promptly schedule the hearing, and no further action on the abatement of the public nuisance or graffiti may be taken until the manager's decision is rendered. At the conclusion of the scheduled hearing, the manager or authorized designee may cancel the notice to remove or correct the public nuisance. If the notice is modified or affirmed, the public nuisance or graffiti must be abated within 48 hours in accordance with the manager's written order. 
(4)  Summary abatement. The city manager may provide for abating a public nuisance or graffiti without following the procedure required in subsections (2) and (3) above if any of the following conditions exist:

A reasonable attempt must be made to notify the owner, occupant, or other responsible party of the intended action and the right to appeal the abatement and cost recovery at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting. 
(5)  Cost recovery. The owner of a property on which a nuisance or graffiti has been abated by the city or a person who has caused a public nuisance on property not owned by that person is personally liable to the city for the cost of the abatement, including administrative costs. As soon as the work has been completed and the cost determined, the city manager or authorized designee will prepare a bill for the cost and mail it to the owner or other responsible party. The amount is immediately due and payable to the city. 
(6)  Assessment. If the cost, or any portion of it, has not been paid within 30 days after the date of the bill, the council may certify to the real estate taxes the unpaid cost against the property to which the cost is attributable in accordance with the process set forth in this Code. 
(g)  Penalties . 
(1)  Any violation of this section is a misdemeanor, punishable in accordance with state law. 
(2)  This section is not intended to prohibit a private property owner from seeking additional penalties or remedies.

This is to protect and assist the owners, operators, and employees of the establishment, as well as patrons and the public in general, from harm stemming from the physical immediacy and combination of alcohol, nudity, and sex. The council especially intends to prevent any subliminal endorsement of sexual harassment or activities likely to lead to the possibility of various criminal conduct, including prostitution, sexual assault, and disorderly conduct.

(3)  Increase in on-sale/off-sale intoxicating licenses. The council in its sound discretion may provide by amendment to this section that a larger number of on-sale or off-sale licenses may be issued up to the number of licenses authorized by Minn. Stat. ch. 340A, as it may be amended from time to time; however, the council is not required to issue the full number of licenses that it has available.

Stat. §§ 14.57 through 14.69. The city council may at its option conduct the hearing, or may refer the matter to a hearing conducted by another person or body. The hearing shall be held within a reasonable time after a request by the licensee but no later than 30 days after said request. 
(3)  Waiver of hearing. If a licensee fails to request a hearing at or before the initial appearance, or fails to appear, the licensee will be deemed to have admitted the violation and to have waived its right to a hearing; the city council may then impose sanctions as provided in this section.

(b)  Parking for certain purposes prohibited. No person shall leave or park a house trailer, camper, motor home or recreational vehicle on any public street, highway, alley or other right-of-way thereof; nor shall any person park a vehicle upon the street or roadway for the principal purpose of:

Other than persons on emergency calls, parking of motorized or non-motorized vehicles is prohibited on any public street, highway or alley within the city between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m., and all parking is limited to ten consecutive hours at any other time. Hardship exceptions are provided per the police department notification procedure described in subsections (e) and (f) of this section. 
(d)  Snow removal. Notwithstanding the issuance of a temporary on street parking permit as provided below, no person shall park or leave standing any vehicle upon any street in the city after a snowfall of one and one-half inch depth or more, until the snow from such street has been removed or plowed to an approximate over-all city average, and the official depth for the purpose of this subsection shall be determined by the city manager or the manager's designee, whose determination shall be final and not subject to appeal. In case any vehicles are parked or left standing on the street in violation of this subsection said vehicle or vehicles may be removed in accordance with chapter 6, by or under the direction of any police officer or city employee. Removal of the car by or under the direction of the city shall not prevent prosecution under this section.

(f)  Permit for temporary on-street parking. The following criteria shall govern temporary on-street parking permits by the police department: 
(1)  Undue hardship. Refusal of the permit would create an unnecessary and undue hardship. 
(2)  Public health, safety and general welfare. The permit would not present an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(3)  Temporary circumstances. The circumstances resulting in the request for a temporary permit shall be of a temporary nature such as driveway repairs, social occasions, numerous guests, and similar situations where the advantage of the city having vehicles off the street in the early morning hours is outweighed by the practical problems created by such prohibition of on-street parking. 
(4)  Length of permit. The grant shall be for a length of time not to exceed the minimum time necessary to relieve the hardship as determined by the police department. 
(5)  Release of liability. The city shall incur no liability for any damages to a vehicle parked on a city street per a permit for on-street parking requested under this section. 
(6)  Records. The police department will maintain a record of parking permits including the nature of the request and the time period for which the parking grant was allowed. 
(7)  Application to snow removal. A permit for on-street parking provided under this section shall not be a defense to the violation of this chapter relating to snow removal.

(g)  Parking for the physically disabled. 
(1)  Definition. The term physically disabled as employed herein shall be defined as set out in Minn. Stat. § 169.345 subd. 2(f). 
(2)  Parking prohibited.

Stat. § 169.345 subd. 3. 
(3)  Type of sign required. Any sign or identification posted for parking for physically disabled persons, pursuant to the state building code, must be permanently affixed to the building served by the parking spaces so as to afford a clear and unobstructed view to any person using the designated parking spaces or, in the alternative, shall be mounted or placed at the head of the required parking spaces in such a manner as to prevent any movement or removal without considerable human effort. Such sign shall be approved by the Minnesota State Traffic Control Division, contain a blue background with white letters indicating that a state physically disabled parking permit is required, and shall be at least 18 by 12 inches in size.

Sec. 11-14. - Social host criminal liability. 
(a)  Purpose and findings. The purpose of this section is to reduce underage possession and consumption of alcohol, regardless of whether it's done in a public or a private residence, by imposing criminal penalties on those person(s) who host events or gatherings where persons under the age of 21 possess or consume alcohol, regardless of whether the person hosting the event or gathering supplied the alcohol. The city council further finds that: 
(1)  Events and gatherings held on private or public property where alcohol is possessed or consumed by persons under the age of 21 are harmful to those persons and constitute a potential threat to public health, safety and welfare requiring prevention or abatement. 
(2)  Prohibiting underage consumption acts to protect underage persons, as well as the general public, from injuries related to alcohol consumption, such as alcohol overdose or alcohol-related traffic collisions. 
(3)  Alcohol is an addictive drug which, if used irresponsibly, could have drastic effects on those who use it as well as those who are affected by the actions of the irresponsible user. 
(4)  Often, events or gatherings involving underage possession and consumption occur outside the presence of parents. However, there are times when the parent(s) is/are present and, condone the activity, and in some circumstances provide the alcohol. Despite the fact giving or furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime, it is difficult to prove, and this section is necessary to help further combat underage consumption. 
(5)  Holding a person criminally responsible for hosting or permitting an event or gathering where underage possession or consumption of alcohol occurs will serve to deter underage consumption. 
(b)  Authority. This section is enacted pursuant to Minn. Stat. §§ 340A.509 and 145A.05 subd. 1. 
(c)  Definitions. 
(1)  Alcohol means ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl, beer or spirits of wine, whiskey, rum, brandy, gin, or any other distilled spirits including dilutions and mixtures thereof from whatever source or by whatever process produced. 
(2)  Alcoholic beverage means alcohol, spirits, liquor, wine, beer, and every liquid or solid containing alcohol, spirits, wine, or beer, and which contains one-half of one percent or more of alcohol by volume and which is fit for beverage purposes either alone or when diluted, mixed, or combined with other substances. 
(3)  Event or gathering means any group of three or more persons who have assembled or gathered together for a social occasion or other activity. 
(4)  Host means to permit, aid, conduct, allow, entertain, organize, supervise, control, or permit an event or gathering. 
(5)  Parent means any person having legal custody of a juvenile as a natural parent, adoptive parent, step parent, legal guardian, or a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of the court. 
(6)  Person means any individual, partnership, co-partnership, corporation, or any association of one or more individuals. 
(7)  Residence or premises means any home, yard, field, land, apartment, condominium, hotel or motel room, or other dwelling unit, or a hall or meeting room, park or any other place of assembly, public or private, whether occupied on a temporary or permanent basis, whether occupied as a dwelling or specifically for a party or other social function, and whether owned, leased, rented, or used with or without permission or compensation. 
(8)  Underage person means any person under the age of 21. 
(d)  Prohibited acts. It is unlawful for any person to: 
(1)  Host an event or gathering; 
(2)  At any resident, premises, or on any other private or public property; 
(3)  Where alcohol or alcoholic beverages are present; and 
(4)  When the person knows or should have known that an underage person will or does: 
a.  Consume any alcohol or alcoholic beverage; or 
b.  Possess any alcohol or alcoholic beverage with the intent to consume it; and 
c.  The person fails to prevent possession or consumption by the underage person(s). 
(5)  Possession by an underage person at a place other than the household of a parent or guardian creates a rebuttable presumption of intent to consume it. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. 
(6)  A person is criminally liable for a violation of this section, if the person intentionally aids, advises, hires, counsels, or conspires with another or otherwise procures another to commit the prohibited act. 
(7)  A person who hosts an event or gathering does not have to be present at the event or gathering to be criminally responsible for a violation of this section. 
(e)  Penalty. A violation of this section is a misdemeanor. 
(f)  Exceptions. This section shall not apply in the following circumstances: 
(1)  To conduct solely between an underage person and his or her parents while present in the parents' household. 
(2)  To legally protected religious observances. 
(3)  To retail intoxicating liquor or 3.2 percent malt liquor licensees or bottle club permit holders who are regulated by Minn. Stat. § 340A.503 subd. 1(a)(1). 
(4)  To situations where underage persons are lawfully in possession of alcohol or alcoholic beverages during the course and scope of their employment.

Sec. 13-5. - Design standards. 
(a)  Blocks. 
(1)  General. Block length and width or acreage within bounding roads shall be such as to accommodate the size of residential lots required in the area by chapter 4 and to provide for convenient access, circulation control and safety of street traffic. Blocks intended for commercial, institutional and industrial use must be designated as such. 
(2)  Block length. In general, intersecting streets, determining block lengths, shall be provided at such intervals as to serve cross-traffic adequately and to meet existing streets. Where no existing plats control, the blocks in residential subdivisions shall not exceed 1,320 feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from this maximum. In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block may be required near the center of the block. Blocks for business or industrial use should normally not exceed 1,320 feet in length. 
(3)  Block width. The width of the block should be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries. 
(b)  Lots. 
(1)  Minimums. The minimum lot area, width and depth shall not be less than that established by the zoning provisions of this Code in effect at the time of adoption of the final plat, except for cul-de-sac lots which may have a front lot width of not less than 40 feet. 
(2)  Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have 15 feet of additional width to permit appropriate building setback from both streets as required in chapter 4. 
(3)  Side lot lines. Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles to street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
(4)  Abut street. Every lot must have its full frontage abutting on a city approved street other than an alley. 
(5)  Setbacks. Setback or building lines shall be shown on all lots and shall not be less than the setback required by chapter 4. 
(6)  Water courses. Lots abutting upon a water course, drainage way, channel or stream shall have an additional depth and/or width as required, to assure house sites are not subject to flooding. 
(7)  Features. In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as free growth, water courses, historic spots or similar conditions which if preserved, will add attractiveness and stability to the proposed development. 
(8)  Lot remnants. All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. 
(9)  Crossing public boundary lines. No plat shall extend over a municipal or school district line. 
(10)  Double frontage lots. Double-frontage, or lots with frontage on two parallel streets, shall not be permitted except where lots back on arterial streets or highways, or where topographic or other conditions render subdividing otherwise unreasonable. Such double-frontage lots shall have an additional depth of at least 20 feet in order to allow space for screen planting along the back lot line. 
(c)  Streets and alleys. 
(1)  Traffic circulation. Except for cul-de-sacs, streets shall connect with streets already dedicated in adjoining or adjacent subdivisions, or provide for future connections to adjoining unsubdivided tracts, or shall be a reasonable projection of streets in the nearest subdivided tracts. The arrangement of arterials and collector streets shall be considered in their relation to the reasonable circulation of traffic, to topographic conditions, to run-off of stormwater, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the area to be served. 
(2)  Cul-de-sacs, minor and dead ends. Minor streets should be so planned as to discourage their use by nonlocal traffic. Dead end streets are prohibited, but cul-de-sacs shall be permitted where topography or other physical conditions justify their use. Cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than 500 feet, including a terminal turn-around which shall be provided at the closed end, with an outside curb radius of at least 50 feet and a right-of-way radius of not less than 60 feet. 
(3)  Proposed future street plans. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider. 
(4)  Future subdivision provision. When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical location and openings of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with provision for adequate utility connections for such resubdivision. 
(5)  Intersections. Upon normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other conditions justify variations. Under normal conditions, the minimum angle of intersection of streets shall be eighty degrees. Street intersection jogs with an offset of less than 125 feet shall be prohibited unless for reason of topography or other physical features. 
(6)  Access roads. Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to the right-of-way of U.S. or state highway, principal arterial or railroad, provision may be made for a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such right-of-way, or for a street at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between such street and right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade separations, or for lot depths. 
(7)  Sidewalks. Where a proposed plat abuts or includes an arterial or collector street, concrete sidewalks of not less than five feet in width, on both sides of the paved surface shall be provided. 
(8)  Alleys. Alleys may be provided in commercial and industrial districts, except that this requirement may be waived where other definite and assured provisions are made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Except where justified by special conditions such as the continuation of an existing alley in the same block or where necessitated by the lack of alternative adequate off-street loading space, alleys will not be approved in residential districts. Dead-end alleys may be approved if adequate turn-around facilities are provided at the closed end. 
(9)  Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of this Code; and where the city council finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. In cases where half streets are accepted, the owner and subdivider shall be required to grade half the streets in accordance with the plans therefore to be prepared by the city engineer, and in addition, the owner and subdivider shall be required to deposit payment or approved bond with the city for one-half of the city engineer's estimated cost of other improvements required for that street under this chapter. In cases where the entire right-of-way has been dedicated to the public but the property of the owner and subdivider is located on one side of said street, the owner and subdivider may be required to grade the entire street in accordance with the plans to be prepared by the city engineer. Building permits shall be denied for lots on the side of the street where the property is owned by persons who have not entered into an agreement with the city for the installation of the improvements required under this chapter. 
(10)  Widths. For all public ways hereafter dedicated and/or accepted, the minimum right-of-way and paved width for streets, alleys or pedestrian ways included in any subdivision shall not be less than the minimum dimensions for each classification as follows: 
Right-of-Way Paved Arterial Street + + Collector Street 70 feet 44 feet Minor Street 60 feet 30 feet Cul-de-Sac or Marginal Access Service Streets 60 feet 30 feet++ Alley 30 feet 24 Feet  
+ As determined by the New Hope Five Year Transportation Plan. 
++For Cul-de-sac see subsection 13-5(c)(2). 
Where the existing or anticipated traffic on arterial and collector streets warrants greater widths of rights-of-way or paved surface, these shall be required. 
(11)  Street grades. Except when, upon the recommendation of the city engineer that the topography warrants a greater maximum, the grades in all streets, arterials, collector streets, minor streets, and alleys in any subdivision shall not be greater than six percent. In addition, there shall be a minimum grade on all streets and thoroughfares of not less than one-half percent. 
(12)  Reverse curves. Tangents of at least 50 feet in length shall be introduced between reverse curves on collector streets. 
(13)  Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except under conditions accepted by the city council. 
(14)  Private streets. Private streets shall meet standards as established by the planning commission and approved by the city council. 
(15)  Street deflections. When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 300 feet for minor and collector streets, and of such greater radius as the city council shall determine for special cases. 
(16)  Vertical curves. Different connecting street gradients shall be connected with vertical parabolic curves. Minimum length, in feet, of these curves, shall be 100 feet. 
(d)  Easements. 
(1)  Provision for utilities. Easements at least ten feet wide, centered on rear and other lot lines, shall be provided for utilities, where necessary. They shall have continuity of alignment from block to block, and at deflection points, easements for pole-line anchors shall be provided where necessary. 
(2)  Provisions for drainage. Easements shall be provided along each side of the center line of any water course or drainage channel whether or not shown in the comprehensive plan, to a width sufficient in the judgment of the city council to provide proper maintenance and protection and to provide for stormwater runoff and installation and maintenance of storm sewers, and they shall be dedicated to the city by appropriate language in the owner's certificate. 
(e)  Erosion and sediment control. 
(1)  Natural limitations. The development shall conform to the natural limitations presented by topography and soil so as to create the least potential for soil erosion. 
(2)  Coordination of control with construction. Erosion and siltation control measures shall be coordinated with the different stages of construction. Appropriate control measures shall be installed prior to development when necessary to control erosion. 
(3)  Minimum size exposure. Land shall be developed in increments of workable size such that adequate erosion and siltation controls can be provided as construction progresses. The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one period of time. 
(4)  Minimum exposure time. When soil is exposed, the exposure shall be for the shortest feasible period of time.

Also, no construction or grading will be conducted on slopes steeper than 18 percent in grade. 
Sec. 13-6. - Required agreements and bonds. 
(a)  General. Prior to final plat approval, the subdivider and city shall enter into an agreement for the required improvements, as follows: 
(1)  Plat bonding requirements. Before a final plat is approved by the city council, the owner and subdivider of the land covered by said plat shall execute and submit to the council an agreement to make and install within one year, all improvements required to be installed by him under the provisions of this chapter, in accordance with the time table and plans and specifications therefore to be prepared or approved by the city engineer. The agreement (hereinafter sometimes referred to as development contract) shall be accompanied by a cash escrow equal to one and one-half times the city engineer's estimated cost for completing said improvements, or a corporate performance bond, or other collateral authorized by law (sometimes referred to as a subdivision bond) to be approved by the city, in an amount equal to one and one-half times the city engineer's estimated cost of said improvement. Bond amounts for assessments for which the developer agrees to pay shall be determined initially by the cost of the project as estimated by the city engineer, and may subsequently be modified by the city based upon the actual assessments levied. The bond shall be accompanied by surety and conditions satisfactory to the city to assure the city that such improvements and utilities will be actually constructed by the developer according to the specifications approved by the city council as expressed in the development contract, and the assessments which the developer has specifically agreed to pay in accordance with its contract are in fact paid on a timely basis. The performance bond or cash escrow shall be conditioned upon: 
a.  Completion of improvements. The making and installing of the improvements required under terms of this chapter within the one year period, unless the said one year period is extended by city resolution, or by the city not taking action to compel timely performance by the developer, for any reason. If the city has agreed to perform the work, the completion of the improvements shall be performed within the time established by the council. 
b.  Completion of works. Completion of the work undertaken by the owner or subdivider in accordance with the development contract executed by him and for him. 
c.  Payment of assessments. Payment on a timely basis of all assessments against the premises which the developer has specifically and contractually agreed to pay. 
d.  Payment. The payment by the subdivider to the city of all expenses incurred by the city, which expenses shall include but not be limited to engineering, fiscal, legal, construction and administration expenses. In instances where a cash escrow is submitted in lieu of a corporate performance bond, there shall be a cash escrow agreement or development contract which shall provide that in the event the required improvements are not completed within one year, unless extended by the city council, all amounts held under the cash escrow agreement shall be automatically turned over and delivered to the city and applied by the city to the cost of completing the required improvements. If the funds available within said cash escrow agreement are not sufficient to complete the required improvements, the necessary additional cost to the city may be assessed against the subdivision in accordance with assessment procedures as regulated under Minnesota Statutes, or the city may, at its option, proceed against those persons who agreed to pay the sums involved. Any balance remaining in the cash escrow fund after such improvements have been made and all expenses therefore have been paid, shall be returned to the subdivider. 
e.  Assessed improvements. When the city agrees to install improvements in a subdivision and assess the cost pursuant to M.S. chapter 429, the subdivision bond shall be one-half of the estimated cost of the improvement. The subdivision bond shall guarantee timely payment of all assessments on the property, and shall provide for payment in full of such assessments within three years of the date of a resolution levying such assessments. 
(b)  Inspection of improvements. All required land improvements to be installed under the provisions of this chapter shall be inspected at the subdivider's expense during the course of construction. Such inspection shall be by the city engineer or an inspector appointed by the council. 
(c)  Building permits withheld. No building permit shall be issued by any governing official for the construction of any building, structure or improvement on any land required to be subdivided by this chapter until all requirements of this chapter have been fully complied with.

Where telephone, electric and gas service lines are placed underground entirely throughout a subdivided area, conduits or cables shall be placed within easements or dedicated public ways in a manner which will not conflict with other underground services. Further transformer boxes shall be located so as not to be hazardous to the public. All drainage and underground utility installations which traverse privately owned property shall be protected by easements. 
(f)  City election to install improvements. The city may, in its discretion, elect to install all or any part of the improvements conditioned upon the developer providing a bond guaranteeing payment for the cost or assessments as acceptable to the city, except that the city shall install all sanitary sewer and water distribution facilities as provided in subsection 13-7(b). 
(g)  City topographic map. The subdivider shall revise the city topographic map at his expense to conform with elevations as revised for subdivision purposes. 
(h)  Railroad crossings. No street dedications will be accepted which require a crossing of a railroad unless sufficient land is dedicated to provide for a clear and safe approach view as determined by the city council and Minnesota Public Service Commission. 
(i)  Park dedication. 
(1)  Dedication required. As a condition of approval of any plat, replat, subdivision or lot division allowing development of land for residential, commercial, industrial or other uses or combination thereof, a reasonable portion of the buildable land to be divided must be dedicated to the public or preserved for public uses as parks, playgrounds, trails or open space. This requirement applies to plats, replats, subdivisions or lot divisions that (i) create at least one additional lot or provide for at least one additional dwelling unit, or (ii) combine lots for the purpose of development involving changes or mixed land uses or the intensification of uses, or (iii) consist of a planned unit development as defined and regulated by the zoning code. The city shall reasonably determine if the buildable land proposed for dedication is suitable for public recreational use based on the following factors. Further, the dedication required by this section is in addition to dedication required for streets, roads, utilities, storm waterponding areas or similar utilities and improvements. 
a.  The land must be conveniently located to the intended users being served by the dedication. 
b.  The dedicated buildable land must be adequate in size, shape, topography, geology, hydrology, tree cover, access and location for future park needs consistent with the city's comprehensive park plan. 
c.  Wetlands, ponding areas and drainage ways are not suitable for park dedication credits. Dedicated park land must be above the ordinary high water level as determined by the city engineer. 
d.  Land with grades exceeding 12 percent is not suitable for park dedication. 
e.  Land contaminated by any pollutants or containing trash, junk and/or unwanted structures is not suitable for park dedication. 
(2)  Amount required. The amount of land required for dedication is based upon the gross land area to be subdivided and equals the land the city reasonably finds it will need to acquire for park or other recreational purposes as a result of approval of the land division. Generally, ten percent of the gross land area to be subdivided must be dedicated for residential subdivisions and five percent for commercial and industrial subdivisions. 
(3)  Cash payment in lieu of dedication. The city may require a cash payment in lieu of land dedication. In determining to require payment or dedication, the council will consider such factors as whether the land is needed in the proposed location, whether the proposed dedication is suitable for the intended use and whether a cash payment would be more beneficial to development of the entire park system. 
(4)  Amount of cash payment. The cash payment in lieu of dedication is set forth in the fee schedule. 
(5)  Park and open space fund. Cash payments in lieu of dedication are payable at the time of final subdivision approval. The payment must be placed in a special fund established by the city to be used solely for the purposes of acquisition, development or improvement of parks, playgrounds, trails, open space or as otherwise provided by Minnesota Statutes. 
(6)  Partial dedication. The city may accept a dedication of land in an amount less than that specified in subsection (i)(2) and require a cash payment equivalent to the balance of the dedication requirement. The partial cash payment is determined by subtracting the percentage of land actually dedicated from the percentage of land required to be dedicated under subsection (i)(2), and applying the resulting percentage to the fair market value of the proposed subdivision. 
(7)  Credit for private land. A credit of up to 25 percent of the dedication requirements may be awarded for park and open space that is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision. A credit will not be awarded unless the following conditions are met: 
a.  Private open space may not be occupied by non-recreational buildings and must be available for the use of all the residents of the proposed subdivision; 
b.  Required building setbacks will not be included in computation of private open spaces; 
c.  Use of the private open space must be restricted for park, playground, trail or open space purposes by recorded covenants that (i) run with the land in favor of future owners of property within the subdivision and (ii) cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city council; 
d.  The private open space will be of a size, shape, location, topography and usability for park or recreational purposes, or contain unique features which are important to be preserved; and 
e.  The private open space must reduce the demand for public recreational facilities or public open space occasioned by development of the subdivision.

    Subd. 2. Within five days after service of the notice upon him, the secretary shall certify the record of the proceedings, including all documents, testimony and minutes to the clerk of the District Court.

APPENDIX D - FLOODPLAIN AND WETLAND SYSTEMS DISTRICT 
    The flood plain (FP) and Wetland Systems District (W) of the Zoning Code are included in this Appendix D for administrative convenience. 
    4.17 Flood Plain District 
4.171 Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purpose. The Legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103F and 462 delegated the authority to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Minnesota Statute, Chapter 103F further stipulates that communities subject to recurrent flooding must participate and maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. Therefore, the City of New Hope, Minnesota does order as follows: 
4.171 (1) Statement of Purpose. The purpose of §§ 4.171 through 4.179B is to maintain the City's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
4.171 (2) Warning of Disclaimer of Liability. This Code does not imply that areas outside of the flood plain district or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding and flood damages. This Code shall not create liability on the part of the City of New Hope or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Code or any administrative decisions lawfully made thereunder. 
4.172 General Provisions. 
4.172 (1) Adoption of Flood Insurance Rate Map. The Flood Insurance Rate Map for the City of New Hope, dated January 2, 1981, developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency is hereby adopted by reference as the Official Flood Plain Zoning District Map and made a part of this ordinance. This map was previously entitled the Flood Hazard Boundary map. 
4.172 (2) Lands to Which Ordinance Applies. This ordinance shall apply to all lands designated as flood plain within the jurisdiction of the City of New Hope. 
4.172 (3) Interpretation. The boundaries of the flood plain district shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official Flood Plain Zoning District Map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the flood plain district, the City Manager or his designated representative shall make the necessary interpretation based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, if available. If 100-year flood elevations are not available, the community shall: 
4.172(3) (a) Require a flood plain evaluation consistent with § 4.174(3) of this Code to determine a 100-year flood elevation for the site; or 
4.172(3) (b) Base its decision on available hydraulic/hydrologic or site elevation survey data which demonstrates the likelihood the site is within or outside of the flood plain. 
    4.173 Conflict with Pre-Existing Zoning Regulations and General Compliance. 
4.173 (1) The Flood Plain District as Overlay Zoning District. The flood plain zoning district shall be considered an overlay zoning district to all existing land use regulations of the community. The uses permitted in §§ 4.174 and 4.175 of this Code shall be permitted only if not prohibited by any established, underlying zoning district. The requirements of §§ 4.171 through 4.179B shall apply in addition to other legally established regulations of the City and where these Sections impose greater restrictions, the provisions of §§ 4.171 through 4.179B shall apply. 
4.173 (2) Compliance. No new structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this Code and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this Code. Within the Floodway and Flood Fringe, all uses not listed as permitted uses in § 4.174 shall be prohibited. In addition, a caution is provided here that: 
4.173(2) (a) New manufactured homes and replacement manufactured homes are subject to the general provisions of this Code and specifically § 4.174.

4.174(2) (c) No use shall be permitted which will adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways of any tributary to the main stream, or of any drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system. 
4.174(2) (d) All structures, including accessory structures, additions to existing structures and manufactured homes, shall be constructed on fill so that the basement floor, or first floor if there is no basement, is at or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. The finished fill elevation must be no lower than one foot below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and shall extend at such elevation at least 15' beyond the limits of the structure constructed thereon. 
4.174(2) (e) All Uses. Uses that do not have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation to lands outside of the flood plain shall not be permitted unless granted a variance by the City Council. In granting a variance, the Council shall specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the use and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local emergency response and recovery procedures exist. 
4.174(2) (f) Commercial and Manufacturing Uses. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth greater than two feet or be subject to flood velocities greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the regional flood. 
4.174(2) (g) All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
4.174 (3) Flood Plain Evaluation. 
4.174(3) (a) Upon receipt of an application for a permit, manufactured home park development or subdivision approval within the flood plain district, the City Manager or his designative representative shall require the applicant to furnish sufficient site development plans and a hydrologic/hydraulic analysis by a qualified engineer or hydrologist specifying the nature of the development and whether the proposed use is located in the floodway or flood fringe and the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation for the site. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Rules 1983 Parts 6120.5600 (Technical Standards and Requirements for Floodplain Evaluation) and 6120.5700 (Minimum Floodplain Management Standards for Local Ordinances) shall be followed during the technical evaluation and review of the development proposal. 
4.174(3) (b) The City shall submit one copy of all information required by Section 4.174(3)(a) of this Code to the respective Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist for review and comment at least 20 days prior to the granting of a permit or manufactured home park development/subdivision approval by the community. The City shall notify the respective Department of Natural Resources Area Hydrologist within 10-days after a permit or manufactured home park development/subdivision approval is granted. 
4.175 Utilities, Railroads, Roads and Bridges in the Flood Plain District.

4.177(4) (d) Forfeiture. Failure to comply with the conditions of the use permit and/or the regulations and laws of the City shall result in forfeiture of the security. 
4.178 Variances. 
4.178 (1) A variance means a modification of a specific permitted development standard required in an official control including this Code to allow an alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in the City's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation. 
4.178 (2) The City Council may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such relief or variance from the terms of this Code as will not be contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances such as hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under consideration, as provided for in the respective enabling legislation for planning and zoning for cities or counties as appropriate. In the granting of such variance, the City Council shall clearly identify in writing the specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in the respective enabling legislation which justified the granting of the variance. 
4.178 (3) Variances from the provisions of this Code may be authorized where the City Council has determined the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and the spirit and intent of this Code. No variance shall allow in any district a use prohibited in that district or permit a lower degree of flood protection than the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation. Variances may be used to modify permissible methods of flood protection. 
4.178 (4) The City shall submit by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources a copy of the application for proposed Variance sufficiently in advance so that the Commissioner will receive at least ten days notice of the hearing.

4.178 (6) Flood Insurance Notice and Record Keeping. The Building Official shall notify the applicant for a variance that: a) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and b) Such construction below the 100-year or regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions. The City shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
4.179 Nonconformities. A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this Code but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this Code may be continued subject to the following conditions: 
4.179 (1) No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. 
4.179 (2) An alteration within the inside dimensions of a nonconforming use or structure is permissible provided it will not result in increasing the flood damage potential of that use or structure. 
4.179 (3) The cost of all structural alterations or additions both inside and outside of a structure to any nonconforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure unless the conditions of this Code are satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations and additions constructed since the adoption of the City's initial flood plain controls must be calculated into today's current cost which will include all costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. If the current cost of all previous and proposed alterations and additions exceeds 50 percent of the current market value of the structure, then the structure must meet the standards of § 4.174 of this Code for new structures. 
4.179 (4) If any nonconforming use of a structure or land or nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means, including floods, to an extent of 50 percent or more of its market value at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Code. The City may issue a Permit for reconstruction if the use is located outside the floodway and, upon reconstruction, is adequately elevated on fill in conformity with the provisions of this Code. 
4.179A Penalties for Violation. A violation of the provisions of this Code or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of Variance) shall constitute a misdemeanor. 
4.179A (1) In responding to a suspected code violation, the City may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it including but not limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective measures or a request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance availability to the guilty party. The City must act in good faith to enforce these official controls and to correct code violations to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
4.179A (2) When a code violation is either discovered by or brought to the attention of the City, it shall immediately investigate the situation and document the nature and extent of the violation of the official control. As soon as is reasonably possible, this information will be submitted to the appropriate Department of Natural Resources' and Federal Emergency Management Agency Regional Office along with the City's plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible. 
4.179A (3) The City shall notify the suspected party of the requirements of this Code and all other Official Controls and the nature and extent of the suspected violation of these controls. If the structure and/or use is under construction or development, the City may order the construction or development immediately halted until a proper permit or approval is granted by the City. If the construction or development is already completed, then the City may either (a) issue an order identifying the corrective actions that must be made within a specified time period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official controls, or (b) notify the responsible party to apply for an after-the-fact permit/development approval within a specified period of time not to exceed 30 days. 
4.179A (4) If the responsible party does not appropriately respond to the City within the specified period of time, each additional day that lapses shall constitute an additional violation of this Code and shall be prosecuted accordingly. The City shall also upon the lapse of the specified response period notify the landowner to restore the land to the condition which existed prior to the violation of this Code. 
4.179B Amendments. All amendments to this Code, including revisions to the Official Flood Plain Zoning District Map, shall be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Natural Resources prior to adoption. The flood plain designation on the Official Flood Plain Zoning District Map shall not be removed unless an area is filled to an elevation at or above the Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation and is contiguous to lands outside of the flood plain. Changes in the Official Zoning Map must meet the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Technical Conditions and Criteria and must receive prior FEMA approval before adoption. The Commissioner of Natural Resources must be given 10-days written notice of all hearings to consider an amendment to this Code and said notice shall include a draft of the Code amendment or technical study under consideration.

3.  Continuity of Service Mandatory. It shall be the right of all Subscribers to receive all available Services insofar as their financial and other obligations to the Grantee are honored.

Upon revocation of this Franchise, any portion of the System designated by Grantor for removal but not removed within a reasonable time shall become the property of Grantor without payment to Grantee and Grantee shall execute and deliver such documents as Grantor shall request, in form and substance acceptable to Grantor, to evidence ownership by Grantor. 
D.  Grantee shall not abandon any portion of the System without having given three (3) months prior written notice to Grantor.

11.  General Provision on Rights and Remedies. 
A.  All rights and remedies given to Grantor by this Franchise shall be in addition to and cumulative of all other rights or remedies available to Grantor or Cities, at law or in equity. The rights and remedies provided by this Franchise are not exclusive and the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise any other right or remedy. No delay or omission of Grantor in the exercise of any right or remedy shall impair any such right or remedy, nor shall any such delay or omission be construed to be a waiver of or acquiescence to any default. The exercise of any such right or remedy by Grantor shall not release Grantee from its obligations or any liability under this Franchise. 
B.  Grantee shall not claim that any condition or term of this Franchise is unreasonable, arbitrary, void or that Grantor or Cities had no power or authority to make such term or condition, but accepts the validity of the terms and conditions of this Franchise in its entirety. 
C.  Grantor reserves the right to delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Franchise to any Person. Any delegation by Grantor shall be effective upon written notice by Grantor to Grantee of such delegation. Upon receipt of notice by Grantee of Grantor's delegation, Grantee shall be bound by all terms and conditions of the delegation not in conflict with this Franchise. Any such delegation shall not be deemed an amendment to this Franchise or require any consent of Grantee. 
12.  Publication of Notices. All public notices or ordinances required to be published by Grantor or Cities, including this Franchise or the title thereof, shall be published in the official newspaper of all Cities. Grantee shall pay the costs for publication of this Franchise and amendments to it, as such publication is required or authorized by law. 
13.  Effectiveness of Franchise. 
A.  After this Franchise is approved by Grantor, a copy of this Franchise shall be delivered to each Member for a thirty (30) day review period. 
B.  Not later than fifteen (15) days after adoption of this Franchise, Grantor shall publish the Franchise or title thereof in the legal newspaper of each Member.

Upon review, any City shall have the opportunity to withdraw from the Grantor if done so at least five (5) days prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day review period. This Franchise shall not become effective in such withdrawn City. If more than one City advises the Grantor of its intent to withdraw from the Grantor at least five (5) days prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day review period pursuant to this paragraph, the approval of this Franchise shall be null and void and this Franchise shall have no effect. 
D.  Within thirty (30) days after review by Cities, the Grantee shall provide to Grantor its acceptance of the grant of this Franchise and execute, together with the Grantor, all such other documents required under this Franchise, at which time this Franchise shall become effective and shall thereby replace, supercede and repeal all prior franchises and amendments granted by Grantor. 
E.  Grantee shall have continuing responsibility for this Franchise, and if Grantee is a subsidiary or wholly owned corporate entity of a parent corporation, performance of this Franchise shall be secured by guarantees of the parent corporation in form and substance acceptable to Grantor, which shall be delivered at the time of, and as part of, acceptance of this Franchise. 
14.  Incorporation by Reference. To obtain the power and obligation to enforce the applicable provisions as may be done by Cities and to prosecute for any violations within their territorial limits and to further insure that Cities may succeed the Grantor, as provided in this Article by reason of withdrawal or dissolution, each City shall, by ordinance authorized by Minnesota Statute 238.08, incorporate by reference into its code all of the provisions and subsequent amendments to this Franchise. To the extent any City withdraws as a Member and has not validly incorporated this Franchise by reference, Grantee, by acceptance of this Franchise, consents to and agrees to be bound by the requirements of this section providing for the separate administration and enforcement by that City in the event of withdrawal or dissolution. Grantee agrees to execute acceptance of an ordinance of each City as they adopt the same to incorporate this Franchise. 
15.  Withdrawal. Any City may withdraw from the Grantor at any time later than five (5) days prior to the expiration of each City's thirty (30) day review period set forth in section 15.13 by sending a written notice of withdrawal to the Grantor before October 15 of any year. 
A.  Any City withdrawing pursuant to this section shall send to the Grantor and to Grantee a written notice of withdrawal specifying the effective date of withdrawal and containing a copy of the City's action approving its withdrawal. City's withdrawal shall be effective on December 31 of the year that City sends its notice of withdrawal, unless it specifies a later date in its notice. A notice of withdrawal may be rescinded prior to its effective date at any time by affected City. 
B.  This Franchise shall be effective and enforceable within the territorial limits of a City which has withdrawn pursuant to this section, and such City shall be bound by the terms of this Franchise and any amendments adopted by Grantor. A City which has withdrawn shall be the exclusive authority to administer and enforce this Franchise within the territorial limits of that City. 
C.  Any City withdrawing from membership at a time when such withdrawal does not result in dissolution of Grantor, shall forfeit its claim to any assets of Grantor except that such City shall have access, at a reasonable cost and under such conditions as Grantor may determine, to any cable communications programs, files or other materials developed for such City's use while it was a Member. 
16.  Dissolution of Grantor. 
A.  Grantor shall continue for an indefinite term unless the number of Members shall become less than four (4). The Grantor may also be terminated by mutual agreement of all of the Members at any time. 
B.  Upon dissolution of the Grantor, all remaining assets of the Grantor, after payment of obligations, shall be distributed among the then existing Members in proportion to their contributions and in accordance with procedures established by Grantor. Grantor shall continue to exist after dissolution for such period, no longer than six (6) months, as is necessary to wind up its affairs, but for no other purpose. 
17.  Successor in Interest and Grantee's Rights. 
A.  In the event of withdrawal by a City or dissolution of the Grantor, affected Cities shall be deemed successor to the rights, duties and obligations of Grantor within the affected Cities' territorial limits. However, no new rights, duties and obligations of Grantee will be created thereby and Grantee shall not be required to furnish additional services or be required to provide increased payments, or separate bonds, insurance or security funds. Such existing bonds, insurance, or security funds shall, however, afford equal protection to any affected City. 
B.  In the event of withdrawal of a City or dissolution of the Grantor, Grantor and Grantee, together with Cities, shall make their best efforts to achieve an orderly and efficient transfer to any affected City of the administration and enforcement authority over this Franchise.

If the City elects to require a franchise fee it shall notify Company. The franchise fee shall be set forth in a separate ordinance. The separate ordinance adopting a franchise fee shall not be adopted until at least 60 days after Notice of the proposed ordinance has been served upon the Company. 
(h)  Limitation on Applicability; No Waiver. This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between the City and its successors and the Company and its successors and permitted assigns, as the only parties. No provision of this franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto. This franchise agreement shall not be interpreted to constitute a waiver by the City of any of its defenses of immunity or limitations on liability under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 466. 
(i)  Amendment Procedure. Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the agreement be amended. This Ordinance may be amended at any time by the City passing a subsequent ordinance declaring the provisions of the amendment, which amendatory ordinance shall become effective upon the filing of Company's written consent thereto with the City Clerk within 60 days after the effective date of the amendatory ordinance. An ordinance passed by the City for the purpose of updating City Code references to Minnesota Statutes or other laws shall not constitute an amendment to this franchise. 
(j)  Previous Franchises Superseded. This franchise supersedes and replaces previous franchises granted to the Company or its predecessors. Upon Company's acceptance of this franchise the previous franchise shall terminate. 
(k)  Indemnification and Defense. The Company shall indemnify, keep and hold the City, its elected officials, officers, employees, and agents free and harmless from any and all claims and actions (including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the City) on account of injury or death of persons or damage to property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, removal, or operation of the Company's property located in, on, over, under, or across the Public Ways or Public Ground of the City, unless such injury or damage is the result of the negligence of the City, its elected officials, employees, officers, or agents. The City shall not be entitled to reimbursement for its costs incurred prior to notification to the Company of claims or actions and a reasonable opportunity for the Company to accept and undertake the defense. If a claim or action shall be brought against the City under circumstances where indemnification applies, the Company, at its sole cost and expense, shall defend the City if written notice of the claim or action is promptly given to the Company within a period wherein the Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. The Company shall have complete control of such claim or action, but it may not settle without the consent of the City, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City, and the Company in defending any action on behalf of the City shall be entitled to assert every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf. 
(l)  Severability. If any portion of this franchise is found to be invalid for any reason whatsoever, the validity of the rest of this franchise shall not be affected. 
(m)  Additional Costs. Company shall reimburse City for any additional costs incurred by the City under the following circumstances: 
a.  The additional costs are caused in part by inaccuracies in information provided by Company to City regarding the placement of Gas Facilities; and 
b.  The additional costs could have been avoided or reduced had the information provided to the City been accurate. 
This provision specifically contemplates, but is not limited to, additional costs incurred by the City due to delays in construction projects because Gas Facilities could not be accurately located in advance. In the event that the Gas Facilities are not the sole cause of any such additional costs, the additional costs shall be pro rated by the City in a reasonable manner and the Company shall only be liable for its pro rated share.

Electric Facilities shall be located on Public Grounds as determined by the City. Company's construction, reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance and location of Electric Facilities shall be subject to permits if required by other separate sections of the New Hope Code and to other reasonable regulations of the City to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this franchise agreement.

12.232 Field Locations. Company shall provide field locations for its underground Electric Facilities within City consistent with the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 216D. 
12.233 Street Openings. Company shall not open or disturb any Public Ground or Public Way for any purpose without first having obtained a permit from the City, if required by a separate City Code section, for which the City may impose a reasonable fee. Permit conditions imposed on Company shall not be more burdensome than those imposed on other utilities for similar facilities or work. Company may, however, open and disturb any Public Ground or Public Way without permission from the City where an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of Electric Facilities. In such event Company shall notify the City by telephone to the office designated by the City as soon as practicable. Not later than the second working day thereafter, Company shall obtain any required permits and pay any required fees. 
12.234 Restoration. After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any Public Ground or Public Way, Company shall restore the same, including paving and its foundation, to as good a condition as formerly existed, and shall maintain any paved surface in good condition for two years thereafter. The work shall be completed as promptly as weather permits, and if Company shall not promptly perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and material, and put the Public Ground or Public Way in the said condition, the City shall have, after demand to Company to cure and the passage of a reasonable period of time following the demand, but not to exceed five days, the right to make the restoration at the expense of Company. Company shall pay to the City the cost of such work done for or performed by the City. This remedy shall be in addition to any other remedy available to the City for noncompliance with this Section 12.234, but the City hereby waives any requirement for Company to post a construction performance bond, certificate of insurance, letter of credit or any other form of security or assurance that may be required, under a separate existing or future ordinance of the City, of a person or entity obtaining the City's permission to install, replace or maintain facilities in a Public Way. 
12.235 Avoid Damage to Electric Facilities. Nothing in this Ordinance relieves any person from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging Electric Facilities while performing any activity. 
12.236 Notice of Improvements. The City must give Company reasonable notice of plans for improvements to Public Grounds or Public Ways where the City has reason to believe that Electric Facilities may affect or be affected by the improvement. The notice must contain: (i) the nature and character of the improvements, (ii) the Public Grounds and Public Ways upon which the improvements are to be made, (iii) the extent of the improvements, (iv) the time when the City will start the work, and (v) if more than one Public Ground or Public Way is involved, the order in which the work is to proceed. The notice must be given to Company a sufficient length of time in advance of the actual commencement of the work to permit Company to make any necessary additions, alterations or repairs to its Electric Facilities. 
12.237 Shared Use of Poles. Company shall make space available on its poles or towers for City fire, water utility, police or other City facilities upon terms and conditions acceptable to Company whenever such use will not interfere with the use of such poles or towers by Company, by another electric utility, by a telephone utility, or by any cable television company or other form of communication company. In addition, the City shall pay for any added cost incurred by Company because of such use by City. 
12.24 Relocations. 
12.241 Relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ways. If the City determines to vacate a Public Way for a City improvement project, or at City's cost to grade, regrade, or change the line of any Public Way, or construct or reconstruct any City Utility System in any Public Way, it may order Company to relocate its Electric Facilities located therein if relocation is reasonably necessary to accomplish the City's proposed public improvement. Except as provided in Section 12.243, Company shall relocate its Electric Facilities at its own expense. The City shall give Company reasonable notice of plans to vacate for a City improvement project, or to grade, regrade, or change the line of any Public Way or to construct or reconstruct any City Utility System. If a relocation is ordered within five (5) years of a prior relocation of the same Electric Facilities, which was made at Company expense, the City shall reimburse Company for non-betterment costs on a time and material basis, provided that if a subsequent relocation is required because of the extension of a City Utility System to a previously unserved area, Company may be required to make the subsequent relocation at its expense. Nothing in this Appendix requires Company to relocate, remove, replace or reconstruct at its own expense its reconstruction is solely for the convenience of the City and is not reasonably necessary for the construction or reconstruction of a Public Way or City Utility System or other City improvement. 
12.242 Relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ground. City may require Company at Company's expense to relocate or remove its Electric Facilities from Public Ground upon a finding by City that the Electric Facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment to the existing or proposed public use of the Public Ground. 
12.243 Projects with Federal Funding. City shall not order Company to remove or relocate its Electric Facilities when a Public Way is vacated, improved or realigned for a right-of-way project or any other project which is financially subsidized in whole or in part by the Federal Government or any agency thereof, unless the reasonable non-betterment costs of such relocation are reimbursed to Company. The City is obligated to pay Company only for those portions of its relocation costs for which City has received federal funding specifically allocated for relocation costs in the amount requested by the Company, which allocated funding the City shall specifically request. Relocation, removal or rearrangement of any Company Electric Facilities made necessary because of a federally-aided highway project shall be governed by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Section 161.46, as supplemented or amended. It is understood that the rights herein granted to Company are valuable rights. 
12.244 No Waiver. The provisions of this franchise apply only to facilities constructed in reliance on a franchise from the City and shall not be construed to waive or modify any rights obtained by Company for installations within a Company right-of-way acquired by easement or prescriptive right before the applicable Public Ground or Public Way was established, or Company's rights under state or county permit. 
12.25 Tree Trimming. 
Company may trim all trees and shrubs in the Public Grounds and Public Ways of City to the extent Company finds necessary to avoid interference with the proper construction, operation, repair and maintenance of any Electric Facilities installed hereunder, provided that Company shall save the City harmless from any liability arising therefrom, and subject to permit or other reasonable regulation by the City. 
12.26 Indemnification. 
12.261 Indemnity of City. Company shall indemnify, keep and hold the City free and harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, the issuance of permits, or the operation of the Electric Facilities located in the Public Grounds and Public Ways. The City shall not be indemnified for losses or claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or claims arising out of or alleging the City's negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or inspection of, Company's plans or work. The City shall not be indemnified if the injury or damage results from the performance in a proper manner of acts reasonably deemed hazardous by Company, and such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by City after notice of Company's determination. 
12.262 Defense of City. In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances where this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its sole cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Company within a period wherein Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. If Company is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company may not settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City and Company, in defending any action on behalf of the City shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf. 
12.27 Vacation of Public Ways. 
The City shall give Company at least two weeks prior written notice of a proposed vacation of a Public Way. Except where required for a City improvement project, the vacation of any Public Way, after the installation of Electric Facilities, shall not operate to deprive Company of its rights to operate and maintain such Electric Facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to Company. In no case, however, shall City be liable to Company for failure to specifically preserve a right-of-way under Minnesota Statutes, Section 160.29. 
12.28 Change in Form of Government. 
Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity of this Ordinance. Any governmental unit succeeding the City shall, without the consent of Company, succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the City provided in this Ordinance. 
12.29 Franchise Fee. 
12.291 Fee Schedule. During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in lieu of any permit or other fees being imposed on Company, the City may impose on Company a franchise fee not to exceed four and one-half percent (4.5%) of the Company's Gross Revenues, as hereinafter defined, by collecting the amounts calculated on a flat fee per meter/per class/per month basis as indicated in a Fee Schedule set forth in a separate ordinance from each customer in the designated Company Customer Class. The parties have agreed that the franchise fee collected by the Company and paid to the City in accordance with this Sec. 12.29 shall initially be equal to the amounts indicated in the Fee Schedule adopted by Ordinance No. 03-21, codified as New Hope Code §14.51(c) and set forth again below: 
Class Fee Per Premise Per Month Residential $1.50 Sm C & I - Non-Dem $4.50 Sm C & I - Demand $9.00 Large C & I $36.00 Public Street Ltg $4.50 Muni Pumping - N/D $4.50 MuniPumping - Dem $4.50  
12.292 Separate Ordinance. Any change to the franchise fee established by the Fee Schedule set out in Sec. 12.291 above shall be imposed by a separate ordinance duly adopted by the City Council, which ordinance shall not be adopted until at least 90 days after written notice enclosing such proposed ordinance has been served upon Company by certified mail. The change in fee shall not become effective until the beginning of a Company billing month at least 90 days after written notice enclosing such adopted ordinance has been served upon Company by certified mail. Section 2.5 shall constitute the sole remedy for solving disputes between Company and the City in regard to the interpretation of, or enforcement of, the Franchise Fee Schedule or any separate ordinance changing the franchise fee. No action by the City to implement a separate ordinance to change the franchise fee will commence until this Ordinance is effective. A separate ordinance which imposes a lesser franchise fee on the residential class of customers than the amount set forth in Sec. 12.291 above shall not be effective against Company unless the fee imposed on each other customer classification is reduced proportionately in the same or greater amount per class as the reduction represented by the lesser fee on the residential class. 
12.293 Terms Defined. For the purpose of this Section 12.293, the following definitions apply: 
a.  "Customer Class" shall refer to the classes listed on the Fee Schedule and as defined or determined in Company's electric tariffs on file with the Commission. 
b.  "Fee Schedule" refers to the schedule in Sec. 12.291 setting forth the various customer classes from which a franchise fee will be collected immediately after the effective date of this franchise agreement. In the event the Fee Schedule is amended by a separate ordinance, it may include any new Customer Class added by Company to its electric tariffs after the effective date of this franchise agreement. 
c.  "Gross Revenues" means all sums, excluding any surcharge or similar addition to the Company's charges to customers for the purpose of reimbursing the Company for the cost resulting from the franchise fee, received from the Company for the sales of electricity to its retail customers within the corporate limits of the City. 
12.294 Collection of the Fee. The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly and shall be based on the amount collected by Company during complete billing months during the period for which payment is to be made by imposing a surcharge equal to the designated franchise fee for the applicable customer classification in all customer billings for electric service in each class. The payment shall be due the last business day of the month following the period for which the payment is made. The franchise fee may be changed by ordinance from time to time; however, each change shall meet the same notice requirements and not occur more often than annually and no change shall require a collection from any customer for electric service in excess of the amounts specifically permitted by this Sec. 12.29. The time and manner of collecting the franchise fee is subject to the approval of the Commission. No franchise fee shall be payable by Company if Company is legally unable to first collect an amount equal to the franchise fee from its customers in each applicable class of customers by imposing a surcharge in Company's applicable rates for electric service. Company may pay the City the fee based upon the surcharge billed subject to subsequent reductions to account for uncollectibles, refunds and correction of erroneous billings. Company agrees to make its records available for inspection by the City at reasonable times provided that the City and its designated representative agree in writing not to disclose any information which would indicate the amount paid by any identifiable customer or customers or any other information regarding identified customers. In addition, the Company agrees to provide at the time of each payment a statement summarizing how the franchise fee payment was determined, including information showing any adjustments to the total surcharge billed in the period for which the payment is being made to account for any uncollectibles, refunds or error corrections. 
12.295 Equivalent Fee Requirement. The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be effective against Company unless it lawfully imposes and the City monthly or more often collects a fee or tax of the same or greater equivalent amount on the receipts from sales of energy within the City by any other energy supplier, provided that, as to such a supplier, the City has the authority to require a franchise fee or to impose a tax. The "same or greater equivalent amount" shall be measured, if practicable, by comparing amounts collected as a franchise fee from each similar customer, or by comparing, as to similar customers the percentage of the annual bill represented by the amount collected for franchise fee purposes. The franchise fee or tax shall be applicable to energy sales for any energy use related to heating, cooling or lighting, or to run machinery and appliances, but shall not apply to energy sales for the purpose of providing fuel for vehicles. If the Company specifically consents in writing to a franchise or separate ordinance collecting or failing to collect a fee from another energy supplier in contravention of this Sec. 12.295, the foregoing conditions will be waived to the extent of such written consent. Company acknowledges and agrees the City has implemented Ordinance No. 03- 22 "An Ordinance Implementing A Gas Energy Franchise Fee On Centerpoint Energy Minnegasco For Providing Gas Energy Service Within The City Of New Hope" and that Ordinance No. 03-22 satisfies the equivalent fee requirement of this section. 
12.30 Provisions of Ordinance. 
12.301 Severability. Every section, provision, or part of this Appendix is declared separate from every other section, provision, or part and if any section, provision, or part shall be held invalid, it shall not affect any other section, provision, or part. Where a section of any other City Code conflicts with the provisions of this Appendix, the provisions of this Appendix shall prevail. 
12.302 Limitation on Applicability. This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between the City and Company as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto. 
12.31 Amendment Procedure. 
Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the agreement be amended to address a subject of concern and the other party will consider whether it agrees that the amendment is mutually appropriate. If an amendment is agreed upon, this Ordinance may be amended at any time by the City passing a subsequent ordinance declaring the provisions of the amendment, which amendatory ordinance shall become effective upon the filing of Company's written consent thereto with the City Clerk within 90 days after the date of final passage by the City of the amendatory ordinance. 
12.32 Previous Franchises Superseded. 
This franchise supersedes any previous electric franchise granted to Company or its predecessor.
