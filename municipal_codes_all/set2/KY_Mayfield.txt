PREFACE 
    This volume is a republication of the 1985 Code as supplemented through Supplement No. 6 and further updated through Ordinance No. 20-96, adopted September 9, 1996. 
    This Code is a republication of the ordinances of the City of a general and permanent nature. The Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The republication of this Code was under the direct supervision of John E. Dombroski, Vice-President, and Heather R. Doepker, Editor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to the Officials of the City for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

    All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein, or in the case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. 
Sec. 1-6. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive parts of permanent and general ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings, and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be or to "sections _______ to _______" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of the ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-7. - Effect of repeal of ordinances. 
    When any ordinance repealing a former ordinance, clause or provision shall be itself repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive such former ordinance, clause or provision unless it shall be therein so expressly provided. 
    The repeal of an ordinance shall not affect any punishment or penalty incurred before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or proceeding pending at the time of the repeal, for an offense committed or cause of action arising under the ordinance repealed.

    The following procedures shall be the "grievance procedures" for any person who believes such person has been discriminated against by the city based on handicapped status with respect to federally funded programs: Section 504 Grievance Procedure. The city has adopted an internal grievance procedure providing for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the Office of Revenue Sharing's (ORS) regulations (31 C.F.R. 51.55(d)(2)) implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794). Section 504 states, in part, that "no otherwise qualified handicapped individual...shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance...". Complaints should be addressed to the designated Section 504 Coordinator, City of Mayfield, Kentucky, 211 East Broadway, Mayfield, KY 42066, (502) 247-2485. 
(1)  A complaint may be filed in writing or verbally, contain the name and address of the person filing it and briefly described the alleged violation of the regulations. 
(2)  A complaint shall be filed within ten days after the complainant becomes aware of the alleged violation. (Processing of allegations of discrimination occurring before this grievance procedure was in place will be considered on a case-by-case basis.) 
(3)  An investigation, as may be appropriate, shall follow after the filing of a complaint. The investigation will be conducted by the Section 504 coordinator. These rules contemplate informal but thorough investigations affording all interested persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to a complaint. Under 31 C.F.R. 51.55(d)(2), the city need not process complaints from applicants for employment. 
(4)  A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and description of resolution, if any, shall be issued by the Section 504 coordinator and a copy forwarded to the complainant not later than ten days after its filing. 
(5)  The Section 504 coordinator shall maintain the files and records of the city relating to the complaints filed. 
(6)  The complainant can request a reconsideration of the case in instances where such complainant is dissatisfied with the resolution. The request for reconsideration shall be made within 30 days to the mayor. 
(7)  The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies such as the filing of a section 504 complaint with the Office of Revenue Sharing, U.S. Department of the Treasury. Utilization of this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of this grievance. 
(8)  These rules shall be constructed to protect the substantive rights of interested persons, to meet appropriate due process standards and to assure that the city complies with section 504 and the ORS regulations.

(c)  Investment objectives. The city's primary investment objectives, in order of priority, are the following: 
(1)  Safety. Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the city's investment program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this objective, diversification is required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio. 
(2)  Liquidity. The city's investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to enable the city to meet all operating requirements which might be reasonably anticipated. 
(3)  Return on investment. The city's investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout the budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the city's investment risk constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio. 
(d)  Investment authority. Management responsibility for the city's investment program is hereby delegated to the city clerk/treasurer. The city clerk/treasurer shall have the authority, subject to the disapproval of the governing body, to establish additional specific written procedures for the operation of the investment program which are consistent with this investment policy. The procedures shall include explicit delegation of authority if any, to persons responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the city clerk/treasurer. The city clerk/treasurer shall be ultimately responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials and employees. The controls shall be designed to prevent and control losses of public funds arising from fraud, employee error, misrepresentation by third parties, unanticipated changes in financial markets or imprudent actions by officers and employees. The city clerk/treasurer shall maintain all records related to the city's investment program. 
(e)  Prudent person rule. The actions of the city clerk/treasurer in the performance of his or her duties as manager of the city's funds shall be evaluated using the "prudent person" standard. Investments shall be made with judgment and care under prevailing circumstances which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived. 
The city clerk/treasurer acting in accordance with written procedures and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's performance, provided that deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion to the governing body and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. 
(f)  Authorized investments. The funds of the city available for investment shall be invested in accordance with this policy and all applicable state statutes only in the following types of investments instruments: 
(1)  Authorized investment instruments. 
a.  Obligations of the United States and of its agencies and instrumentalities, including obligations subject to repurchase agreements, provided that delivery of these obligations subject to repurchase agreements is taken either directly or through an authorized custodian. 
b.  Obligations and contracts for future delivery or purchase of obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the United States or a United States government agency, including but not limited to: 
1.  United States Treasury;

8.  Tennessee Valley Authority. 
d.  Bankers' acceptances for banks rated in one of the three highest categories by a nationally recognized rating agency. 
e.  Commercial paper rated in the highest category by a nationally recognized rating agency. 
(g)  Authorized financial institutions. The city clerk/treasurer shall maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment services to the city. 
    All financial institutions who desire to provide investment services to the city shall supply the city clerk/treasurer with information sufficient to adequately evaluate the institution and answer any and all inquiries posed by the city clerk/treasurer or the governing body, including the following information: 
(1)  Audited financial statements. 
(2)  Regulatory reports on financial condition. 
(3)  Written memorandum of agreement for the deposit of public funds or trading resolution, as appropriate. 
(4)  Any additional information considered necessary to allow the city clerk/treasurer to evaluate the creditworthiness of the institution. 
    The city clerk/treasurer shall evaluate the financial capacity and creditworthiness of financial institutions and broker/dealers prior to the placement of the city's funds. The city clerk/treasurer shall conduct an annual review of the financial condition and registrations of financial institutions and brokers/dealers and, based on the review, make any recommendations regarding investment policy or program changes determined to be necessary. 
(h)  Safekeeping and custody. To protect against potential fraud and embezzlement, investment assets shall be secured through third-party custody and safekeeping procedures. Bearer instruments shall be held only through third-party institutions. The city clerk/treasurer and any other officers or employees of the city authorized to engage in investment transactions shall be bonded in an amount established by the governing body. Collateralized securities such as repurchase agreements shall be purchased using the delivery vs. payment procedure. Money market mutual funds used for investments must provide for independent custodians of their portfolios and delivery vs. payment on their portfolio securities. The safekeeping procedures utilized in the city's investment program shall be reviewed annually by the independent auditor. 
(i)  Collateral. 
(1)  It is the policy of the city to require that all cash and investments maintained in any financial institution named as a depository be collateralized. Collateral shall be limited to the types of instruments authorized as collateral for state funds in KRS 41.240. 
(2)  Collateral shall always be held by an independent third-party custodian with whom the city has a current custodial agreement. A clearly marked evidence of ownership (safekeeping receipt) must be supplied to the city and retained by the city clerk/treasurer. The right of collateral substitution is hereby granted. 
(j)  Audit. In connection with the audit of city funds conducted by an independent certified public accountant, the auditor shall conduct a review of the city's investment program, including internal controls and procedures, and the results of the review, including recommended changes, shall be included in the city's audit.

State Law reference- Flood control generally, KRS ch. 104. 

Sec. 4-40. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS 100 delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Mayfield located in Mayfield, Kentucky, hereby adopts the following floodplain management ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 8-09, Art. 1, § A, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 4-41. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Mayfield are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity, and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 8-09, Art. 1, § B, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 4-42. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas. 
(Ord. No. 8-09, Art. Art. 1, § C, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 4-43. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding; 
(7)  Ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a special flood hazard area; 
(8)  Ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 8-09, Art. 1, § D, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 4-44. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application. 
    A zone: Portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure): A structure located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure, the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Accessory use: A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
    Addition (to an existing structure): Any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction. 
    A1-30 and AE zones: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one percent annual chance flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined. 
    AH zone: An area of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one and three feet (usually shallow ponding). Base flood elevations are shown. 
    AO zone: An area of 100-year shallow flooding where water depth is between one and three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain). Flood depths are shown. 
    Appeal: A request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article or from the floodplain administrator's ruling on a request for a variance. 
    AR/A1-A30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A zones: Special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) that result from the de-certification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is in the process of being restored to provide a 100-year or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources. 
    A99 zone: That part of the SFHA inundated by the 100-year flood which is to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under construction. No base flood elevations are determined. 
    Area of shallow flooding: A designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) where the base flood depths range from one to three feet, there is no clearly defined channel, the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    B and X zones (shaded): Areas of the two-tenths percent annual chance (500-year) flood, areas subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing drainage area less than one square mile, and areas protected by levees from the base flood. 
    Base flood: A flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this article. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE): The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, and AR/AO that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement: That portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides. 
    Building: A walled and roofed structure that is principally aboveground; including a manufactured home, gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade facility or infrastructure. See definition for "structure." 
    C and X (unshaded) zones: Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain. 
    Community: A political entity having the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. 
    Community flood hazard area (CFHA): An area that has been determined by the floodplain administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from available technical studies, historical information, and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams. 
    Community rating system (CRS): A program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures for protection from flooding. 
    Critical facility: Any property that, if flooded, would result in severe consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the health and safety of the public. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility facilities important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after a flood, and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials, hazardous materials or hazardous waste. 
    D zone: An area in which the flood hazard is undetermined. 
    Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated structure: A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, piling, columns (post and piers), shear walls, or breakaway walls. (See freeboard requirements for residential and nonresidential structures.) 
    Elevation certificate: A statement certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor on the FEMA approved form in effect at the time of certification that verifies a structure's elevation and other related information to verify compliance with this article. 
    Emergency program: The initial phase under which a community participates in the NFIP, intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM. 
    Enclosure: That portion of a structure below the base flood elevation (BFE) used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage, or access to the structure. 
    Encroachment: The physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    Existing construction: Any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the City of Mayfield based on specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of special flood hazards. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision: The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Five-hundred-year flood: The flood that has a two-tenths percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 500-year flood have a moderate to low risk of flooding. 
    Flood, flooding, or floodwater: 
(1)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e. mudflows). See "mudslides." 
(2)  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. See flood-related erosion. 
    Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM): A map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and the regulatory floodway. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM): A map on which the boundaries of the flood, mudslide (i.e. mudflow), and flood-related erosion areas having special hazards have been designated as zones A, M, and/or E by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA). 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM): A map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones. 
    Flood insurance study: The report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), and/or the flood boundary floodway map (FBFM), and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by floodwaters from any source. 
    Floodplain administrator: The individual appointed by a NFIP participating community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances. 
    Floodplain management: The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations: This article and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodproofing: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities, structures, and their contents. 
    Floodproofing certificate: A certification by a registered professional engineer or architect, on a FEMA approved form in effect at the time of certification stating that a nonresidential structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities is watertight to a specified design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact forces. 
    Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as the "regulatory floodway." 
    Floodway fringe: That area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis. 
    Fraud and victimization: As related in section 4-63, appeals and variance procedures, of this article, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    Freeboard: A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood. Freeboard must be applied not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing level, but also to the level of protection provided to all components of the structure, such as building utilities, HVAC components, etc. 
    Functionally dependent use facility: A facility, structure, or other development, which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
    Governing body: The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
    Hazard potential: The possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or misoperation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing capacity). 
    Highest adjacent grade: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure: Any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary of the interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior, or 
b.  Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
    Increased cost of compliance (ICC): Increased cost of compliance coverage provides for the payment of a claim for the cost to comply with state or community floodplain management laws or ordinances after a direct physical loss by flood. When a building covered by a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP sustains a loss and the state or community declares the building to be substantially or repetitively damaged, ICC will help pay up to $30,000.00 for the cost to elevate, floodproof, demolish, or remove the building. 
    ICC coverage is available on residential and nonresidential buildings (this category includes public or government buildings, such as schools, libraries, and municipal buildings) insured under the NFIP. 
    Kentucky Revised Statute 151.250: Plans for dams, levees, etc. to be approved and permit issued by cabinet (Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet): 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city, county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts, drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies, shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except those constructed by the department of highways) across or along any stream, or in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit issued. However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments or other obstructions, which are not of such size or type as to require approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply. 
(2)  No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the state shall commence the filing of any area with earth, debris, or any other material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a building, barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in subsection (1) above. 
(3)  Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so notified. The Department for Natural Resources through KRS ch. 350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS ch. 151 concerning the regulation of dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are permitted under KRS ch. 350 for surface coal mining operations. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC): Is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMC's include the following categories: 
(1)  Letter of map amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a SFHA. 
(2)  Letter of map revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. 
(3)  Letter of map revision-Fill (LOMR_F): A determination that a structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SHFA. 
    Levee: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system: A flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met: 
(1)  All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised). 
(2)  All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP. 
    Limited storage: An area used for storage and intended to be limited to incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature controlled. 
    Lowest adjacent grade: The elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of construction. It does not include earth that is emplaced for aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure's foundation system. 
    Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, structure access, or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a structure's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this article. 
    Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected or attached to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle" (see "recreational vehicle"). 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Map: The flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) or the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
    Map panel number: The four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four digits represent the map panel. The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. (The letter "A" is not used by FEMA, the letter "B" is the first revision.) 
    Market value: The structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value) or adjusted assessed values. 
    Mean sea level (MSL): The average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as shown on a community's FIRM. For purposes of this article, the term is synonymous with either National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 1929 or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988. 
    Mitigation: Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the costs of disaster response and recovery. 
    Mudslide (i.e. mudflow): Describes a condition where there is a river, flow, or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. A mudslide (i.e. mudflow) may occur as a distinct phenomenon while a landslide is in progress, and will be recognized as such by the floodplain administrator only if the mudflow, and not the landslide, is the proximate cause of damage that occurs. 
    Mudslide (i.e. mudflow) area management: The operation of and overall program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing mudslide (i.e. mudflow) damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, mudslide control works, and floodplain management regulations. 
    Mudslide (i.e. mudflow) prone area: An area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow. 
    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD): As corrected in 1929, a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. (Generally used as the vertical datum on the older FIRM's. Refer to FIRM legend panel for correct datum.) 
    New construction: Structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of the City of Mayfield's floodplain management regulations and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the City of Mayfield's adopted floodplain management ordinances. 
    Nonresidential: Structures that are not designed for human habitation, including but is not limited to: small business concerns, churches, schools, farm structures (including grain bins and silos), pool houses, clubhouses, recreational structures, mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial structures, warehouses, and hotels or motels with normal room rentals for less than six months' duration. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD): As corrected in 1988, a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. Generally used on the newer FIRMs and digitally referenced FIRMs (DFIRMs). (Refer to FIRM or DFIRM legend panel for correct datum.) 
    Obstruction: Includes but is not limited to any dam, wall, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, structure, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One-hundred year flood (100-year flood) (see "base flood"): The flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the 100-year flood. Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a 26-percent chance of experiencing such a flood with the SFHA. 
    Participating community: A community that voluntarily elects to participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP. 
    Post-FIRM construction: Construction or substantial improvement that started on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later. 
    Pre-FIRM construction: Construction or substantial improvement, which started on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later. 
    Probation: A means of formally notifying participating NFIP communities of violations and deficiencies in the administration and enforcement of the local floodplain management regulations. During periods of probation, each insurance policy is subject to a $50.00 surcharge. 
    Program deficiency: A defect in a community's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management standards or of the standards of 44 CFR 60.3, 60.4, 60.5, and/or 60.6. 
    Public safety and nuisance: Anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Recreational vehicle: A vehicle that is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable to a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regular program: The phase of a community's participation in the NFIP where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS. 
    Regulatory floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. See "base flood." 
    Remedy a violation: The process by which a community brings a structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impact of noncompliance.

Sec. 4-57. - Specific standards. 
    In all special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in subsection 4-46, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork elevated no lower than 18 inches above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 4-57(3). 
a.  In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. 
b.  In an A zone, where no technical data has been produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, elevated 18 inches above the base flood elevation, as determined by this community. The floodplain administrator will determine the method by which base flood elevations are determined. Methods include but are not limited to detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses, use of existing data available from other sources, use of historical data, best supportable and reasonable judgement in the event no data can be produced. Title 401 KAR (Kentucky Administrative Regulations) Chapter 4, Regulation 060, states as a part of the technical requirements for a state floodplain permit: The applicant shall provide cross sections for determining floodway boundaries (and thereby base flood elevations) at any proposed construction site where FEMA maps are not available. All cross sections shall be referenced to mean sea level and shall have vertical error tolerances of no more than [plus] five-tenths foot. Cross sections elevations shall be taken at those points which represent significant breaks in slope and at points where hydraulic characteristics of the base floodplain change. Each cross section shall extend across the entire base floodplain and shall be in the number and at the locations specified by the cabinet. If necessary to ensure that significant flood damage will not occur, the cabinet may require additional cross sections or specific site elevations which extend beyond those needed for making routine regulatory floodway boundary calculations. 
c.  In all other zones, elevated 18 inches above the base flood elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspection department to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure (including manufactured homes used for nonresidential purposes) shall be elevated to conform with subsection 4-57(1) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities: 
a.  Be floodproofed below an elevation 18 inches above the level of the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
b.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; 
c.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, mechanical equipment, and ductwork, elevated no lower than 18 inches above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
d.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in subsection 4-54(1)c. 
e.  Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in subsection 4-57(4). 
f.  All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be constructed of flood resistant materials below an elevation 18 inches above the base flood elevation, and, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Opening sizes (FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93) for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or 
2.  Have a minimum of two openings with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
(3)  Elevated structures. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated structures on columns, posts, or pilings (e.g.) that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
a.  Opening sizes for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above foundation interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior foundation grade); and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
b.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed areas shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(4)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
a.  All new or substantially improved manufactured homes placed on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring. Locations include: 
1.  On individual lots or parcels, 
2.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, 
3.  In new manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or 
4.  In substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or 
5.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, 
6.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood. 
All manufactured homes must be: 
1.  Elevated on a permanent foundation; and 
2.  Have its lowest floor elevated no lower than 18 inches above the level of the base flood elevation; and 
3.  Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
b.  Except manufactured homes that have incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, all manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: 
1.  The manufactured home is securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, so that either the: 
i.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than 18 inches above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
ii.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent grade. 
c.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites located within A, A1-30, AO, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
3.  Meet the permit requirements for new construction of this article, including anchoring and elevation requirements for "manufactured homes." 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured in accordance with the State of Kentucky motor vehicle regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(5)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 4-46, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation levels during occurrence of base flood discharge; 
If subsection 4-57(5) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements and other proposed new development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections 4-56 through 4-62. 
(Ord. No. 8-09, Art. 5, § B, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 4-58. - Standards for streams without established base flood elevation (unnumbered A zones) and/or floodways. 
    Located within the special flood hazard areas established in section 4-46, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be located within special flood hazard areas, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
(2)  New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with section 4-46. 
(Ord. No. 8-09, Art. 5, § C, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 4-59. - Standards for shallow flooding zones. 
    Located within the special flood hazard areas established in section 4-46, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the water path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in zone AO the flood depth specified on the flood insurance rate map above the highest adjacent grade. In zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above either the base flood elevation or in zone AO the flood depth specified on the flood insurance rate map, above the highest adjacent grade. In zone AO, if no flood depth is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed either to the base flood elevation or above or, in zone AO, to or above the specified flood depth plus a minimum of one foot so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as stated in subsection 4-57(2). 
(Ord. No. 8-09, Art. 5, § D, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 4-60. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood and be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(b)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(c)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
(d)  In areas where base flood elevation and floodway data is not available (zone A or unmapped streams), base flood elevation and floodway data for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall be provided. 
(e)  All subdivision plans will include the elevation of proposed structure(s) and lowest adjacent grade. If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and lowest adjacent grade elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(Ord. No. 8-09, Art. 5, § E, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 4-61. - Standards for accessory structures in all zones beginning with the letter "A." 
    For all accessory structures in special flood hazard areas designated "A" the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Structure must be nonhabitable; 
(2)  Must be anchored to resist floatation forces; 
(3)  Will require flood openings/vents no more than one foot above grade, total openings are to be one square inch per one square foot of floor area, at least two openings required on opposite walls; 
(4)  Built of flood resistant materials below a level 18 inches above the base flood elevation; 
(5)  Must elevate utilities above the base flood elevation; 
(6)  Can only be used for storage or parking; 
(7)  Cannot be modified for a different use after permitting. 
(Ord. No. 8-09, Art. 5, § F, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 4-62. - Critical facilities. 
    Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall not be permissible within the floodway; however, they may be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated one foot or more above the level of the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. 
(Ord. No. 8-09, Art. 5, § G, 9-14-09) 
Sec. 4-63. - Appeals and variance procedures. 
(a)  Nature of variances. The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(b)  Designation of variance and appeal board. The City Council of the City of Mayfield shall establish an appeal board consisting of the board of zoning adjustments. 
(c)  Duties of variance and appeals board. 
(1)  The appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this article and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(2)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local district court, as provided in Kentucky Revised Statutes. 
(d)  Appeals/Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this article, and the: 
(1)  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
(4)  Importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility; 
(5)  Necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront, in the case of functionally dependent facility; 
(6)  Availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(7)  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  Expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets, and bridges. 
(e)  Conditions for variances. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(1)  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood hazard. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this article. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" to afford relief considering the flood hazard. In the instance of an historical structure, a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant (as defined in this article); and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, cause extraordinary public expense, create nuisance (as defined in the definition section under "public safety and nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization of the public (as defined in the definition section) or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(5)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(6)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request 
(7)  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsection 4-63(d)(1)-(11) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
(f)  Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the City of Mayfield recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(3)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(g)  Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (see definition) upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(h)  No impact certification within the floodway. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(2)  Or, require the industry to pretreat the waste to the allowable concentration prior to discharge to the Mayfield Electric and Water Systems. 
(g)  Method of billing surcharges. The excessive strength surcharge shall be based on the following formula, with the total applied to the monthly bill of affected users: 
FORMULA 
(A(C-200) + (D-250)) X .00834 X E = Surcharge Payment ($/Mo.) 
Where formula components are as follows: 
(1)  Surcharge rate for BOD, in $/pound. 
(2)  Surcharge rate of SS, in $/pound. 
(3)  User's average BOD concentration, in mg/l. 
(4)  User's average TSS concentration, mg/l. 
(5)  User's monthly flow to wastewater works, per 1,000 gallons

(j)  The Mayfield Electric and Water Systems shall review not less often than annually the wastewater contribution of users, the total cost of OM&R of the wastewater works, debt service obligations and user charge rates. Based on such review, the Mayfield Electric and Water Systems shall revise, when necessary, the schedule of user charge rates to accomplish the following: 
(1)  Maintain an equitable distribution of OM&R costs among users of the treatment system; and 
(2)  Generate sufficient revenues to offset costs associated with the proper operation and maintenance of the wastewater system and to meet debt service requirements. 
(3)  Excessive strength and toxicity surcharges shall be reviewed at the time of and in conjunction with the review of user charges. Surcharge rates shall be revised where necessary to reflect current treatment and monitoring costs. 
(4)  Each user shall be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular bill of the rate and that portion of the total charge, which is attributable to OM&R of the wastewater system. 
(k)  All users shall be billed monthly. The due date for payment of the bill is 15 days after the date of the bill. Any payment not received by the due date shall be delinquent. 
(l)  A late penalty of five percent of the unpaid portion of the bill for residential customers or five percent of the first $250.00 for all other customers shall be added to all delinquent accounts. 
(m)  Should any bill not be paid as above, the Mayfield Electric and Water System may, upon five days' written notice to customer, discontinue service.

Sec. 9-43. - Apportionment. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, net profit shall be apportioned as follows: 
(1)  For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more than one tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in subsection (b) of this section, plus the sales factor, described in subsection (c) of this section, and the denominator of which is two; and 
(2)  For business entities with sales revenue in more than one tax district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's service is performed within the city. 
(c)  The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity everywhere during the tax period. 
(1)  The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the city if: 
a.  The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the city regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or 
b.  The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United States government. 
(2)  Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease or rental of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income- producing activity. 
(3)  Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is allocated to the tax district where the property is located. 
(d)  If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable: 
(1)  Separate accounting; 
(2)  The exclusion of any one or more of the factors; 
(3)  The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly represent the business entity's business activity in the city; or 
(4)  The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of net profit. 
(e)  When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage which the compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city bears to the total wages and compensation paid or payable. In order for the city to verify the accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this subsection, the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records. 
(f)  All partnerships, S corporations, and all other entities where income is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this article. The occupational license tax imposed in this article is assessed against income before it is "passed through" these entities to the owners. 
(g)  If any business entity dissolves, ceases to operate, or withdraws from the city during any taxable year, or if any business entity in any manner surrenders or loses its charter during any taxable year, the dissolution, cessation of business, withdrawal, or loss or surrender of charter shall not defeat the filing of returns and the assessment and collection of any occupational license tax for the period of that taxable year during which the business entity had business activity in the city. 
(h)  If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of this article on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the federal government, and shall employ the same methods of accounting required for federal income tax purposes.

Sec. 9-80. - Other conditions. 
    In addition to any other inquiries, conditions or considerations required or permitted by law: 
(1)  The city ABC administrator shall not grant any alcoholic beverage license or approve a renewal of a license until the applicant and his or her place of business shall have been approved by the city building inspector, and any and all other inspections required by the Kentucky Building Code; 
(2)  All applicants shall voluntarily submit to a criminal background check and shall sign a waiver allowing the release of this information to the city ABC administrator; and 
(3)  No license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be granted or renewed to any person who is delinquent in the payment of any taxes or fees due the city at the time of issuing the license, nor shall any license be granted or renewed to sell upon any premises or property, owned and occupied by the licensee upon which there are any delinquent taxes or fees due the city. Further, if a licensee becomes delinquent in the payment of any taxes or any fees due the city at any time during the license period, the license to sell alcoholic or malt beverages shall be subject to revocation or suspension. 
(4)  No person, whether an applicant for license, or a licensee, shall in any manner attempt to bribe, threaten, unduly influence or intimidate the city ABC administrator, or any member of his or her staff, or any state ABC administrator of staff, in any matter in which an application or proposed application for license, or procedure for revocation or suspension is pending before such officer. This division is not intended to stifle expressions of opinions; however, it is intended to make clear that the ABC administrators are public officials charged with the administration and enforcement of the law, both local and state. Any person applying for a license, or contesting the revocation or suspension of a license, who engages in attempted bribes, threats, attempted undue influence or intimidation of a city or state ABC administrator or staff shall be disqualified from receiving or retaining a license, in addition to other penalties as provided by law. The procedures for appeals shall apply to disqualifications, revocations, or suspensions under this section. This section shall not be interpreted to prohibit monetary settlements in lieu of revocation or suspension of license after a final order or revocation or suspension, where the chapter and applicable statutes allow for such payments in settlement. 
(Ord. No. 24-16, 8-8-16) 
Sec. 9-81. - Form of license.

Sec. 9-82. - Change of information. 
(a)  If after a license to individuals or to a sole proprietor has been issued, there is a change in any fact required to be set forth in the application, a verified amendment in writing giving notice of the change shall be filed with the city ABC administrator within ten days of the change. 
(b)  Since a number of licenses issued by the city are in the name of corporations or other business organizations, it is necessary that ownership changes in such organizations be reported to the city ABC administrator. The city ABC administrator can, therefore, investigate the person to whom the ownership or management is transferred in order to ascertain whether that person is precluded by statute from holding an interest in an alcoholic beverage license. 
(1)  As used with regard to a partnership, corporation, LLC or other business organization herein, the word "change" is construed to include any change in managers, partners or LLC members, directors or officers of the corporation, or change in ownership or stock whereby any person secures ten percent of the outstanding ownership or stock. Transfer of more than ten percent of the total ownership or stock shall require a new license. 
(2)  The following information will be required concerning any new manager, partner or LLC member, new director, officer, or person securing any interest in alcoholic beverage license: 
a.  Name and address; 
b.  Nature of interest;

g.  Extent of stock or company ownership; 
h.  Whether or not he or she has any interest in any license or in any LLC, corporation, partnership or other business organization holding a license in any other state or province. 
(3)  This information shall be filed with the city ABC administrator as a verified amendment of the application pursuant to which the license was granted. Filing shall be made within ten days of any change of required information. 
(Ord. No. 24-16, 8-8-16) 
Sec. 9-83. - Renewal of license. 
(a)  Every year, except in the case of temporary licenses, each licensee shall renew its license. All renewal licenses must be on file with the city ABC administrator no less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the license for the preceding license period or the same shall be canceled, except where the licensee is unable to continue in business at the same premises licensed during the preceding license period as a result of construction, act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition or threatened acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency or private organization possessing power of eminent domain, whether such acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew exiting lease; provided that said licensee shall file a written verified statement no less than 20 days from the expiration date of the license, setting forth these facts, and the city ABC administrator is hereby authorized to extend the time for filing of a renewal of such license for a reasonable length of time within the sound discretion of the city ABC administrator; provided, however, such licensee shall pay a license fee from the expiration date of the former license or licenses. Said license fee shall not be payable until application is made for the transfer of said license to a new location. 
    The renewal by the city ABC administrator of the license shall not be construed to be a waiver or acceptance of any violation which occurred prior to such renewal and shall not prevent subsequent proceedings against the licensee. 
(Ord. No. 24-16, 8-8-16) 
Sec. 9-84. - Lost or destroyed license. 
    When a license shall be lost or destroyed without fault on the part of the licensee or his or her agent or employee, a duplicate in lieu of the original license shall be issued by the city ABC administrator after the administrator shall have been satisfied as to the facts; provided, however, that the applicant for said duplicate license shall pay a fee of $10.00 for the duplicate license. 
(Ord. No. 24-16, 8-8-16) 
Sec. 9-85. - Revocation or suspension. 
(a)  Any license may be revoked or suspended by the city ABC administrator if the licensee shall have violated any of the provisions of KRS chs. 241 through 244, or any rule or regulation of the ABC board or of the department of revenue relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale and transportation or taxation of alcoholic beverages or if such licensee shall have violated or shall violate any act of Congress or any rule or regulation of any federal board, agency or commission, or this chapter now, heretofore, or hereafter in effect relating to the regulation of the manufacture, sale and transportation or taxation of intoxicating liquors or any rules or regulations of the city heretofore in existence or authorized by the terms of KRS chs. 241 through 244 to be created, irrespective of whether the licensee knew of or permitted the violation or whether the violation was committed in disobedience of his or her instructions, or any such license may be revoked or suspended for any cause which the city ABC administrator in the exercise or his or her sound discretion deems sufficient. 
(b)  A license may be revoked for any of the reasons for which the city ABC administrator would have been required to refuse a license if the facts had been known.

(4)  Willful and deliberate failure or default of a licensee to pay an excise tax or any part thereof, or any penalties imposed by or under the provisions of any statutes, this chapter or acts of Congress relative to taxation, or for a violation of any rules or regulations of the Department of Revenue made in pursuance thereof. 
(5)  Setting up, conducting, operating or keeping, on the licensed premises, any gambling game, device, machine or contrivance, or lottery or gift enterprise, or handbook or facility for betting or transmitting bets on horse races; or permitting to be set up, conducted, operated, kept, or engaged in, on the licensed premises, any such game, device, machine, contrivance, lottery, gift enterprise, handbook or facility. 
(Ord. No. 24-16, 8-8-16) 
Sec. 9-86. - Proceedings for revocation or suspension of license. 
(a)  Upon the verified complaint of any person, or on the initiative of any law enforcement officer or of the city ABC administrator, the city ABC administrator may institute proceedings to revoke or suspend any license granted under this chapter. A license may be revoked or suspended only after the licensee shall have been given written notice, by certified or registered mail, of the proposed revocation, including notice of the reasons for such proposed action. The licensee shall be given opportunity to be heard in opposition to the proposed revocation or suspension. The notice of proposed action shall advise the licensee of the date, time and place of the hearing. Notice shall be sufficient if mailed to the licensee at the address shown in the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to or in amendment of this application, whether or not the mailing is receipted for or claimed. 
(b)  The specific procedures to be followed in hearings on actions for revocation or suspension shall be those set out in the Kentucky Administrative Procedure Act (KAR Chapter 13B)

(d)  Within three days after any order of revocation or suspension of a license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once surrender his or her license to the city ABC administrator. If the revoked or suspended license is not forthwith surrendered by the licensee, the chief of police, at the request of the city ABC administrator, shall immediately cause one of his or her officers to take physical possession of the license and return it to the city ABC administrator. 
(e)  When a license has been revoked or suspended, the former licensee may, with prior approval of the city ABC administrator, dispose of and transfer his or her stock of alcoholic beverages to an appropriate entity. 
(f)  Appeal from the decision of the city ABC administrator revoking or suspending a license shall be to the ABC board. The timely filing of an appeal shall stay further proceedings for revocation. 
(g)  If a license is revoked or suspended by an order of the city ABC administrator, and the decision is not appealed, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under his or her license. Upon the entry of a final order of the ABC board sustaining or ordering revocation or suspension on appeal, the licensee shall at once suspend all operations authorized under this license. 
(Ord. No. 24-16, 8-8-16) 
Sec. 9-87. - Transfer or assignment.

Sec. 9-88. - Refusal of license; guidelines for approval of quota licenses. 
(a)  The city ABC administrator may refuse to issue or renew a license for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  Causes for refusal to issue or renew a license and for suspension or revocation of a city license shall be the same as provided for state licenses according to KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, as well as violation of any city ordinance regarding alcohol beverage licensing, sales or the administration thereof. 
(2)  If the applicant has done any act for which a revocation of license would be authorized; or 
(3)  If the applicant has made any false material statement in his or her application. 
(b)  In the case of quota licenses, before approving an application, the city ABC administrator is hereby directed to consider, in addition to the factors set out in KRS 243.450, 243.490 and 243.500, and any other factors the administrator determines in his or her discretion to be reasonable and pertinent to the license application, the following criteria: 
(1)  Ownership. The city places great value on business owners who are invested in the Mayfield community. 
(2)  Economic impact. The city desires businesses which make the most positive impact on the community, in number of jobs, payroll, property investment and revenues to the city. 
(3)  Site of business. The city is interested in serving all geographic areas of the city. Therefore, the city does not wish to cluster all licensed ABC outlets in one area.

(5)  Revitalization. The city supports the revitalization and reuse of existing buildings. 
(6)  Capital. The city values businesses that demonstrate their ability to financially support and sustain their viability. 
(7)  Public support of licensed business in the area. The city intends that public sentiment and safety be considered in deciding upon the approval of retail liquor sales licenses in any area of the city.

(a)  Applicants to whom a license is issued pursuant to this chapter shall provide periodic information demonstrating compliance with the conditions of any license, such as, but not limited to, the continuing requirement that a minimum percentage of the applicant's business income is earned from the sale of food. This documentation shall be provided on a schedule to be coordinated with the applicant's quarterly regulatory fee filings. The city shall provide the form schedule to the licensee. The licensee's acceptance of a license to manufacture or traffic in alcoholic beverages shall constitute consent to the filing of the quarterly report. In the case of caterer filing, the quarterly report shall identify each catered event by type of event, date and address of the event, and shall provide a per event breakdown of sales and the ratio of food sales to alcohol sales during the reporting period. This requirement for filing of reports notwithstanding, the city may at any time come upon the premises of any licensee and examine the books, audio and visual recordings, and records to determine whether the licensee is in compliance with all parts of this chapter. In the event the conditions of any license requirement are not met during any particular quarter, the city ABC administrator shall have discretion in determining whether revocation is appropriate or whether the licensee may be allowed a reasonable period of time to reach compliance. If a good faith effort is demonstrated by the licensee, the city ABC administrator may apply an accounting period of at least two years in determining whether or not the food sale percentage requirement has been met. 
(b)  Every licensee under this chapter shall keep and maintain upon the licensed premises adequate books and records of all transactions involved in the sale of alcoholic beverages in the same manner required by the rules and regulations of the ABC board. Such books and records shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection by the city ABC administrator and such city employees who may assist the city ABC administrator in his or her review. 
(c)  For the purpose of assisting the city ABC administrator in enforcement of this chapter, every licensee required to report to the ABC board under KRS 243.850 shall provide a copy of such report to the city ABC administrator. Copies of any and all reports and correspondences to the ABC board required by statute shall be furnished to the city ABC administrator. 
(Ord. No. 24-16, 8-8-16) 
Sec. 9-90. - Dormancy. 
(a)  It is necessary that a licensee actually conduct the business authorized by such a license or else the license will be declared dormant and become null and void after 90 days. Such is the intent of this section. Realizing that a licensee, like other business, may have his or her business interrupted by situations not under his or her control, various exceptions to the dormancy rule have been included in this section. 
(b)  Any license under which no business is transacted during a period of 90 days shall be deemed inactive and, unless the conditions set forth in subsection (c) below are proved to the satisfaction of the city ABC administrator, the license shall be surrendered to the city ABC administrator. If the license is not voluntarily surrendered, it shall be revoked by the city ABC administrator. 
(c)  The provisions of subsection (b) hereof shall not apply to any licensee who is unable to continue in business at the premises for which a license is issued due to construction, an act of God, casualty, death, the acquisition of the premises by any federal, state, city or other governmental agency under power of eminent domain, whether acquisition is voluntary or involuntary, or loss of lease through failure of landlord to renew existing lease. Prior to the expiration of 90 days of inactivity, such licensee shall furnish to the city ABC administrator a verified statement setting forth the fact that the licensee is unable to continue in business, for any of the specific reasons set forth herein, and the city ABC administrator may grant an extension of the dormancy with the license continuing to remain in effect during the license period or until same is transferred to another premises, notwithstanding the fact that no business is transacted during said period; provided, however, no such license shall be considered valid unless business is conducted there under within 12 months from the date of notice to the city ABC administrator. Such extension may not extend beyond the renewal date but may be for such times as the city ABC administrator deems appropriate in exercise of his or her sound discretion.

(d)  The council further relies on reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona - 1979; Houston, Texas - 1997; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Los Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Austin, Texas - 1986; Seattle, Washington - 1989; Tucson, Arizona - 1990; Testimony, Warner-Robins, Georgia - 2000; Newport News, Virginia - 1996; St. Cloud, Minnesota - 1994; New York Times Square study - 1994; Minnesota, State of - 1989; Phoenix, Arizona - 1995-1998; and also on findings of physical abuse from the paper entitled "Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence," by Kelly Holsopple, Program Mayor and/or City Clerk, Freedom and Justice Center for Prostitution Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Based on cases and reports such as these, the council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented adult entertainment businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, pornographic litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
(2)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, sometimes occur at unregulated adult entertainment businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths, rooms, or cubicles for view films, videos, or live sexually explicit shows, which acts constitute a public nuisance and pose a risk to public health through the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(3)  Adult entertainment businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other certain uses, such as other sexually oriented businesses and establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent a concentration of sexually oriented businesses and such uses. 
(4)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the council has a substantial government interest in abating and/or preventing in the future. 
(e)  Adult entertainment activity tends to attract an undesirable clientele which discourages neighboring residents from undertaking civic improvements, causes residents and businesses to move elsewhere and frustrates attempts to attract new residences and businesses to come into an area, all of which factors contribute to a diminution of property values and to a general deterioration of neighborhoods. 
(f)  The small closet-like rooms or booths at adult amusement arcades in Mayfield and other communities have encouraged persons to loiter for the purposes of engaging in unlawful, often anonymous, sexual conduct and have encouraged lewd conduct in public places, thereby creating public nuisances and generally unsanitary and unhealthful conditions that create dangers to the public health, welfare and safety. 
(g)  The concentration of sexually explicit movies and books and sexual paraphernalia in adult entertainment establishments which also house sexually explicit movies, as well as hotel rooms rented by the hour to couples afforded free sexually explicit movies in the hotel room, have provided prostitutes an appealing and visible meeting place to ply their trade and have created public nuisances in otherwise respectable neighborhoods. 
(h)  Children, the family environment and residential neighborhoods suffer injury from the deleterious effects and harmful consequences resulting from the distribution of, and exposure to, certain sexually explicit items and devices. This is particularly so when such items and devices are permitted to leave a business's premises and litter the immediate family environment, neighborhood and certain areas where children are likely to be. 
(i)  The noise generated by patrons coming and going from adult entertainment establishments causes a substantial disruption to nearby residents and modest curtailment of the hours during which entertainment is offered to patrons of such establishments would afford some relief to persons living in those nearby residences without significantly interfering with the availability of adult entertainment. 
(j)  Nationally, there is extensive involvement of organized crime in the business of adult bookstores and the disclosure of persons who own, as well as the names of those persons who operate adult bookstores and other adult entertainment establishments will aid law enforcement officials in the enforcement of the federal Racketeer Influences and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and the enforcement of the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, among others, prohibiting the distribution of obscene matter, the use of minors to distribute obscene matter, the advertising of obscene material, the distribution of obscene material to minors, promoting the sale of obscenity, the use of a minor in a sexual performance, the distribution of material portraying a sexual performance by a minor, the promoting of material portraying a sexual performance by a minor and the advertising of material portraying a sexual performance by a minor and the use of minors to distribute materials portraying a sexual performance by a minor. 
(k)  The council declares as a matter of public policy that in order to preserve surrounding neighborhoods, to prevent blight and the deterioration of the neighborhoods of Mayfield, protect property values, promote the return of residents and businesses to the neighborhoods, protect children from the deleterious effects of exposure to sexually explicit material and decrease the incidence of crime and juvenile delinquency, the licensing and regulation of adult entertainment establishments is a public necessity and is required in the interest of public health, safety and welfare as well as the economic and aesthetic well-being of the people. 
(l)  Purposes: 
(1)  It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Mayfield, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within Mayfield. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material; 
(2)  To prevent the unsanitary conditions which exist at adult amusement arcades and to prevent health risks, including AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, caused by illicit and unlawful sexual relations in such public establishments; 
(3)  To protect children and the family environment from the deleterious and harmful effects of exposure to certain sexually explicit items and devices; and 
(4)  To obtain the identity of persons licensed and to be licensed for the operation of establishments selling, showing, renting or offering certain sexually explicit material or entertainment to insure proper identification of those persons responsible for the operation of such businesses so as to assist in the proper enforcement of this article. 
(m)  It is not the purpose of this article to establish community standards on obscenity nor to permit persons to engage in any activity which is in violation of law, including but not limited to, state laws pertaining to the advertising, promotion, distribution or sale of obscene matter or matters portraying a sexual performance by a minor, or state laws pertaining to the use of a minor in a sexual performance or promotion of sexual performance by a minor, or the use of a minor to distribute material portraying sexual performance by a minor.

(5)  Failure to comply with the intent or provisions of this policy may be used as grounds for disciplinary action, including dismissal. 
(6)  All employee positions are subject to random drug testing as outlined in this policy. All drug-testing information will be maintained in separate confidential files. 
(d)  Prescriptions. 
(1)  Prescription and over-the-counter drugs are not prohibited when taken in standard dosage and/or according to a physician's prescription. However, any safety sensitive employee or employee with CDL, taking prescribed or over-the-counter medications will, in all cases, be responsible for consulting the prescribing physician and/or pharmacist to ascertain whether the medication may interfere with safe performance of his/her safety sensitive job duties. If, after the safety sensitive or CDL employee consults the prescribing physician or pharmacist, it is determined that the prescribed or over-the-counter medication may temporarily alter the employee's ability to perform their duties safely, it shall be the responsibility of the employee, prior to initiating usage, to submit a prescription drug notification form to their immediate supervisor who shall in turn, submit it to the city clerk or his/her authorized designee as soon as possible. 
(2)  After receiving such form, the city clerk, or his/her designee, may request written medical authorization showing the employee may possess/use such medication, that it was used in the prescribed manner and showing the employee is fit to safely perform their assigned duties. If the use of such medication could compromise the safety of the employee, fellow employees, or the public at large, it is the employee's responsibility to use appropriate personnel procedures (e.g., call in sick, use leave, request change of duty and notify his/her supervisor) to avoid unsafe workplace practices. No prescription drugs shall be brought onto city property, or consumed on city property by anyone other than the individual for whom the drugs have been prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner. The illegal or unauthorized use of prescription drugs is strictly prohibited. It is a violation of the city's drug-free workplace policy to intentionally misuse and/or abuse prescription medications. 
(3)  Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken if job performance deterioration and/or other accidents occur as the result of the intentional misuse and/or abuse of prescription medication. 
(4)  The city reserves the right to have a designated physician of the city's choosing to determine if a prescription drug or medication produces effects that would be considered unacceptable in the performance of assigned work duties. The city's physician has final determination on whether the medication will have or is having an unacceptable effect on the employee's performance of duties. In such instances of temporary impediment to safe performance of regular duties, the employee may be temporarily reassigned to duties requiring a lesser safety awareness level if such duties are available. 
(e)  Types of testing. 
(1)  Initial testing. During the first year of this policy, all employees who hold safety sensitive positions and other sensitive positions shall be required to undergo a drug and alcohol test arranged by the city. 
(2)  Pre-employment testing. All candidates for any position with the city shall be subject to a drug and alcohol test as described herein, excluding part-time/seasonal employees, only after a conditional offer of employment. 
(3)  Probationary employee testing. All probationary employees shall receive one additional drug test within 60 days prior to the end of the employee's probationary period. If a probationary employee is chosen for random testing during his or her probationary period it shall fulfill this requirement. 
(4)  Random testing. Since many city employees are in positions where the consequences of alcohol and drug use would be particularly damaging to said designated employee's safety, the safety of other employees, the security of sensitive information, or monies handled by the city, the general public and citizenry of Mayfield, or which may otherwise result in significant property loss or damage, unscheduled drug testing shall be utilized for safety sensitive and other sensitive positions. 
a.  Method of random testing. Every employee holding a safety sensitive or other sensitive position, excluding CDL employees, shall be assigned a number at random by the DATPC who shall keep said list of names and numbers confidential and on file in his office. Once during every three-month period, (January-March, etc.), the DATPC or DATF shall select approximately ten percent of city employees at random for drug and alcohol testing by a computerized random drawing from a pool consisting of all employee numbers excluding CDL employees. 
b.  CDL employees. Every CDL employee shall be assigned a number at random by the DATPC or DATF, who shall keep said list of names and numbers confidential and on file in his office. The CDL employees shall be placed in a separate pool from the other employees. During each calendar year, 50 percent of the average number of CDL employees for the year shall be selected by a computerized, random drawing, for a drug and alcohol test. This may be done in one testing event or several testing events. 
(5)  Reasonable cause/suspicion testing. Assistant department heads, department heads, mayor, or the DAPTC may require any employee to undergo drug and alcohol testing if there is a reasonable suspicion that the employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol during working hours. An assistant department head shall require approval from their department head, the mayor, or the DAPTC to require such a test. Circumstances which constitute a basis for determining "reasonable suspicion" may include, but are not limited to: 
a.  A pattern of abnormal or erratic behavior; 
b.  Information provided by a reliable and credible source; 
c.  A work-related accident; 
d.  Direct observation of drug or alcohol use; or 
e.  Presence of the physical symptoms of drug or alcohol use (i.e., glassy or blood-shot eyes, alcohol odor on breath, slurred speech, poor coordination and/or reflexes). 
Whenever reasonable suspicion testing is proposed by an assistant department head, department head, mayor, or DAPTC, they shall be required to detail in writing the specific facts, symptoms, or observations which formed the basis for their determination that reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing of the employee. This documentation shall be forwarded to the appropriate department head and/or mayor. 
When a reasonable suspicion test is ordered, the employee must submit to testing within 45 minutes of being notified that he/she will be tested. The observing supervisor and/or designee shall remain at the testing site with the employee being tested, until the collection process is completed. Any employee who is tested for reasonable suspicion shall be placed on leave with pay until the results of the test are known. After submitting to the drug/alcohol test, the employee may not return to work until the results of the test are known and only then if the results are negative. 
In order to assist department heads and assistant department heads, the mayor and the DAPTC, in recognizing and detecting the symptoms of drug and alcohol use, they shall receive training in the determination of reasonable symptoms. 
(6)  Post-accident testing. 
a.  This section shall apply only to all employees holding safety sensitive and other sensitive positions. 
b.  Employees whose performance either contributed to an accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident will be required to be tested. 
c.  Due to varying types of accident cause, all accidents categorized as a "qualifying event" may not require post-accident testing. Exceptions to the "qualifying event" for requiring post-accident drug and alcohol testing will include, but may not be limited to, the following types of accidents: 
1.  Injuries whose onset is cumulative or gradual - such as carpel tunnel syndrome, progressive hearing loss, mental disorders, dermatitis, respiratory diseases, skin disorders, etc. 
2.  Injuries where the employee can be completely discounted as the contributing factor (i.e. injuries caused by a third party or some other uncontrollable force or event, i.e. weather, insects, toxic plants, etc.) 
3.  Injuries where the employee can be completely discounted as the major contributing factor or those injuries occurring during physical fitness or a training event, in which the employee did everything within reason to avoid the injury accident, i.e. was performing training as instructed. 
d.  The employee will be tested as soon as possible, but not later than 32 hours after the accident. In the case where alcohol is suspected, such testing shall occur as soon as possible but in no case later than eight hours after the accident. 
e.  Accidents that occur while employee is not on city time are not subject to post-accident testing unless there is reason to believe that drug/alcohol misuse occurred and could have a direct effect on the employee's work behavior. 
f.  An employee involved in an accident while on an out-of-town assignment shall notify their department supervisor or the supervisor's designee as soon as possible but no later than two hours after the accident occurred. The department supervisor shall notify the mayor or his/her authorized designee to discuss possible drug/alcohol testing requirements. 
g.  All reasonable steps will be taken to obtain a urine sample from an employee after an accident. In case of a conscious but hospitalized employee, the hospital or medical facility will be required to obtain a sample and if necessary, reference will be made to DOT drug testing requirements. If an employee is unconscious or otherwise unable to evidence consent to the procedure, the medical facility shall collect the sample. 
h.  If a post-accident controlled substance/alcohol test is required, a confirmed positive test may result in the employee's immediate termination. 
(7)  Return to work testing. 
a.  This section shall only apply to all employees holding safety sensitive and other sensitive positions. 
b.  An employee who returns to work after being off for more than 30 days due to illness, work related accidents or leave of absence will be subject to testing. 
c.  An employee who returns to work after being disciplined for alcohol and/or drug abuse will be subjected to unannounced tests for a 12-month period following their return to work. These will be in addition to any of the other types of tests previously mentioned. A CDL employee must have a minimum of six tests in the first 12 months. 
In all cases, it shall be at the discretion of the city as to whether to allow an employee who has violated any provision of this policy to continue in the city's employment. In view of the fact that the use of illicit drugs is illegal, a positive test for non-prescribed controlled substances will result in the immediate termination of the employee testing positive. In the event that an employee, who has tested positive for alcohol without a valid medical reason for a positive test, as confirmed by a medical review officer of the city's choosing, is allowed to enter a controlled substance/alcohol abuse rehabilitation program, the employee may be allowed to return to work only under the following circumstances: 
1.  The employee may resume regular duties only after the employee tests negative in an alcohol test administered by the city-approved laboratory and can provide a release to return to work from an appropriate substance abuse treatment facility or confirmation of continued and on-going participation in a city-recognized alcohol abuse assistance program. 
2.  An employee must test negative within a reasonable period of time from receipt of the initial test results not to exceed 45 days. Any repeat occurrence of substance abuse or violation of any other aspect of the city's drug-free workplace policy will result in immediate termination. 
Prior to returning to work, the employee shall be required to meet with the mayor, city clerk and supervisor to receive an explanation of the terms of continued employment; and to sign a written treatment plan/return-to-work agreement, detailing the terms under which the employee will be allowed to return to work. Such agreement shall stipulate that the employee, at the city's request, may be required at any time to submit to interviews and/or evaluation by the professional staff at an appropriate chemical dependency treatment facility approved by the city's employee assistance program (EAP). The return-to-work agreement will also stipulate that the employee be required to submit to unannounced controlled substance and/or alcohol testing for up to 12 months after resuming duties. 
(8)  Other miscellaneous-type testing/checks. 
a.  A check of driver operators licenses and CDL licenses shall be made of any candidate for city employment for drug and alcohol related arrests/convictions. The same checks shall be made once annually for all full-time employees who may operate a city vehicle. Employees must sign the background check release form. 
b.  The employee shall have the responsibility for immediately notifying (within one week) his/her department head of any drug or alcohol-related arrests or convictions. 
(f)  Laboratory testing requirements. 
(1)  All drug and alcohol testing of employees and applicants shall be conducted at medical facilities or laboratories selected by the city. To be considered as a testing site, a medical facility or laboratory must submit in writing, a description of the procedure that will be used to maintain test samples. This submission will be maintained by the mayor or city clerk. Factors to be considered by the city in selecting a testing facility include: 
a.  Testing procedures which ensure privacy to employees and applicants consistent with the prevention of tampering; 
b.  Method of analysis which ensures reliable test results. Spectrometry to confirm positive and negative test results; 
c.  Chain-of-custody procedures which ensure proper identification, labeling, and handling of test samples; 
d.  Retention and storage procedures which ensure reliable results on confirmatory test of original samples. 
(2)  The testing for drugs/alcohol will be conducted in accordance with the outlines of the Controlled Substances Act and/or as outlined in 49 CFR Part 40, Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Program. 
(3)  Testing is undertaken in three phases: collection agency, testing laboratory and medical review officer. All three shall be required to comply with all methods and procedures of 49 CFR Part 40 and will provide annual reports to the city showing compliance. The city may contract with one or more agencies and/or individuals to provide services to the city. 
(4)  Testing results will be released by the medical review officer to the mayor, the department head involved, and DATPC only. 
(5)  Addresses and phone numbers of the collection agency, testing laboratory, and medical review officer will be a part of this policy by reference. 
(g)  Consent to testing. 
(1)  Refusal to consent-Applicant/candidate. A job applicant who refuses to consent to a drug and alcohol test will be denied employment with the city. 
(2)  Refusal to consent-Employee. An employee who refuses to consent to a drug and alcohol test when reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use has been identified, or when required to undergo a test, is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. The reason(s) for the refusal shall be considered in determining the appropriate disciplinary action. 
(h)  Confirmation of test results. 
(1)  An employee or job applicant whose drug test yields a positive result shall be given a second test. The second test shall use a portion of the same test sample withdrawn from the employee or applicant for use in the first test. 
(2)  If the second test confirms the positive test results, the medical review officer has the option to contact the employee/applicant for consultation on what medication he/she may be taking. Once the test has been confirmed by the medical review officer, a copy of the test results will be sent by phone and/or certified mail to the DATPC. The employee/applicant will then be notified by the city as to when and where to discuss the results of the test. 
(3)  An employee or applicant whose second test confirms the original positive test results may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a third test conducted on the same sample at a laboratory selected by the city. 
(4)  Any negative test result (on test 1, 2, or 3) will constitute a negative test and all results will be destroyed. 
(i)  Positive test results. 
(1)  Consequences of a confirming positive test result-Job applicants/candidates. Job applicants/candidates will be denied employment with the city if their initial positive test results have been confirmed. Applicants shall be informed in writing if they are rejected on the basis of confirmed positive drug results. 
(2)  Consequences of a confirming positive test result-Employees. If a current employee's positive test result has been confirmed, the employee is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Factors to be considered in determining the appropriate disciplinary response include the employee's work history, length of employment, current job performance, and existence of past disciplinary actions. No disciplinary action may be taken against employees who voluntarily identify themselves as drug users prior to being notified of an impending drug and alcohol test, obtain counseling and rehabilitation through the city's employee assistance program or other programs sanctioned by the city and thereafter refrain from violating the city's policy on drug and alcohol abuse. 
(j)  Employee assistance program (EAP). 
(1)  If an employee has a positive drug screen or positive alcohol screen, and if the employee is not terminated, the employee shall be referred to the EAP. The EAP, designated by the city may, in turn, refer the employee to another organization which specializes in rehabilitation efforts. 
(2)  Rehabilitation is the responsibility of the employee. Any employee referred to the EAP is entitled to use accumulated sick leave, vacation or compensatory time, and the medical benefits entitled him under the medical insurance plan, subject to the prohibition described below. When accumulated leave is exhausted, the employee must request to be placed on a non-pay leave of absence. If the employee is placed on such leave for a period of 80 hours or more, (112 hours equivalent for fire department employees), or is otherwise placed on an approved leave of absence, he shall contact the mayor, or his designee, to investigate procedures for continuation of his medical plan. The city will not be responsible for payment of any charges in conjunction with rehabilitation except as provided by coverage under the city's medical insurance plan or other benefit plan. To be eligible for continuation of employment, regular reports must be submitted to the mayor or his designee, by the agency conducting the rehabilitation, and the employee must submit to testing, prior to returning to work and at unscheduled intervals thereafter for one year. This shall not constitute random testing as hereinbefore set forth and shall not be subject to any limitation as to the number of times said test may be required. A positive drug or alcohol screen during this time may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Upon successful completion of treatment and testing, the employee may be returned to active status without reprisal. 
(3)  Any employee who initially rejects referral to the EAP or who leaves the EAP prior to being properly discharged therefrom will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. No employee will be eligible for a referral to the EAP more than one time. 
(4)  Any employee who has developed an addiction to, dependence upon, or problem with alcohol or drugs is encouraged to voluntarily contact the EAP for assistance. The EAP is confidential in nature. No reprisal will be taken against any employee who chooses to correct a drug or alcohol problem through voluntary participation in the EAP. However, such voluntary participation shall not be available if the employee is the subject of any type of drug and alcohol test hereunder, (i.e. notification of a test to be given). 
(k)  Record keeping. 
(1)  The city will keep or cause to be kept records of all test results in accordance with state and federal laws applicable to the preservation of records. At a minimum the following will be undertaken. 
a.  Records that demonstrate the collection process conform to all state/federal laws will be kept for three years. 
b.  Records of employee drug test results that show employees failed a drug or alcohol test; the type of test failed, and records that demonstrate rehabilitation, if any, will be kept for a period of five years. Refusals to take a drug and/or alcohol test shall also be kept five years. 
c.  Records of employee drug test results that show employees passed a drug test will be kept for one year. 
d.  A record of the number of employees that passed drug tests will be kept for five years. 
e.  Records confirming that supervisors and employees have been trained as required by this policy will be kept for three years. Training records will include copies of all training materials. 
1.  Medical and employment questionnaires or histories (including job description and occupational exposures), results of medical exams and lab tests (including chest and other x-ray exams taken for the purposes of establishing a baseline or detecting occupational illness, and all biological monitoring not defined as an "employee exposure record". Included are medical opinions, diagnoses, progress notes and recommendations, descriptions of treatments and prescriptions and employee medical complaints. Destroy 30 years after termination of employment. 
2.  All information from an employee's or applicant's drug and alcohol test is confidential and only those individuals with a need to know are to be informed of test results. Disclosure of test results to any other person, agency, or organization is prohibited unless written authorization is obtained from the employee or applicant. The results of a positive drug test shall not be released until the results are confirmed. The records of unconfirmed positive test results and negative test results shall be destroyed by the testing laboratory. 
(l)  Training. Supervisors shall receive an initial training class on this policy to include recognizing symptoms for reasonable suspicion testing.

    Underground facilities refers to utility and telecommunications facilities located under the surface of the ground, excluding the underground foundations or supports for overhead facilities. 
(b)  Franchise or license required. 
(1)  Purpose and characteristics. In order to enable the city to treat persons providing similar services equally, as may be appropriate to comply with requirements of federal law which may require the city to separate its authority over cable television systems and open video systems from its authority over other providers of telecommunications services, the city requires individual authorizations for the provision of particular services. The revocation of a franchise or license for one particular service, in and of itself, will not affect the authority of a cable television or open video system franchise or license holder to continue to occupy the rights-of-way to provide services for which it holds other authorizations. No authorization, whether in the form of a franchise or otherwise, shall be exclusive. The issuance of a franchise or license shall not affect the city's right to construct, operate, or repair any communications facility, with or without a franchise or license. 
(2)  When a franchise is required. A cable television operator must obtain a franchise prior to constructing a cable television system or providing cable television service within the city; an operator of an open video system must obtain a franchise before constructing an open video system or providing services within the city via an open video system. The fact that a particular franchised communications facility may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise or authorization for other purposes. No franchise shall become effective without the franchisee signing the ordinance which grants it the franchise. 
(3)  When a license is required. Subject to the requirements of Kentucky law, a communications facility must obtain a license prior to constructing a communications facility which passes through but does not serve any person in the city. For such facilities, the mayor and/or city clerk is authorized to issue licenses. 
(4)  Nature of grant. Neither a franchise nor a license shall convey title, equitable or legal, in the public rights-of-way. The right granted is only the right to occupy public rights-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in the franchise or license; the right may not be subdivided or subleased. Every franchise or license shall be: 
a.  Interpreted in a manner that conforms to the requirements of the City of Mayfield Code of Ordinances; 
b.  Deemed to include all the provisions that are required to be in a franchise or license under the Code of Ordinances, as if fully set forth in the franchise or license; and 
c.  Deemed to provide for forfeiture under the circumstances set forth in the Code of Ordinances, as well as under the provisions of this article and any franchise ordinance thereunder. 
1.  Municipal cable system. Should the city directly or indirectly purchase, acquire, construct, lease, control, or otherwise own a cable television system within the territorial limits of the city, then the city may not be required to submit an application for or receive a franchise in order to construct, operate, and maintain a cable television system within the territorial limits of the city. 
2.  Contravention of franchise; costs of litigation. A material breach by the franchisee of the franchise agreement, in addition to constituting a breach of contract, shall constitute a violation of this article. The cost of any litigation or other action incurred by the city to enforce this article or franchise agreement, or in relation to the cancellation or termination of a franchise, shall be reimbursed to the city by the affected franchisee if the city prevails in said litigation or action. Such costs shall include, but not be limited to, filing fees, costs of depositions, discovery, and expert witnesses, all other expenses of suit, and reasonable attorney's fees. 
(c)  Compensation required . 
(1)  Purpose. To ensure that the city, as far as possible, is compensated for the rights granted, and receives fair market value for use of property over which it exercises control, or which is held in public trust; and to ensure that the city is compensated for expenses arising from the use of that property; and to ensure that all persons providing the same services are treated equally, as far as is possible and appropriate, considering differences in circumstances; the city shall require persons using its public rights-of-way to provide cable television service or open video system services to pay compensation as provided in this article. 
(2)  Every operator must pay. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this article, every cable television operator, and every operator of an open video system must: 
a.  Pay an application fee for the consideration of an application for issuance, transfer or modification of a franchise or license in the amount of $10,000.00, which fee shall be submitted along with the application. Unused portions of the application fee shall be returned to an applicant; 
b.  Establish a fee to cover costs of issuing permits and conducting inspections related to the permits and compliance with conditions on right-of-way use, as provided in this article. 
c.  Pay a fee for the use of the public rights-of-way to conduct business (which fee is referred to below as a "license fee" or "franchise fee"). Subject to the exceptions in subsection (3), any amount paid shall be (the applicable amount) as specified in sections [14-82 and 14-83] in this article. 
(3)  Exceptions. The amounts required under sections [14-82 and 14-83] need not be paid if: 
a.  State law or city ordinances requires otherwise (or during any transition period for a current franchise or license holder. This exception shall be read narrowly; an operator that is engaged in one line of business that is subject to this exception, shall not be excused from paying the fee for its other lines of business. In cases subject to this exception, the highest permissible fee shall be paid.) 
(4)  Billable work order. Any communications facility operator who is providing services to the city for the first time, whether by license or transfer of license, shall file an annual billable work order with the Mayfield Cable Television Communications Authority (hereinafter, called the Mayfield Cable Authority [MCA]) to cover the city's actual costs of administration and inspection of the operator's physical facilities and activities in the public rights-of-way. On January 31 of each year, every communications facility operator shall deposit with the city clerk/treasurer an amount calculated by the Mayfield Cable Authority and/or the mayor to cover the cost of work likely to be performed by the city under that billable work order during the succeeding July 1 through June 30. The city may draw upon that deposit to cover its costs. The Mayfield Cable Authority at any time may require a communications facility operator to replenish the amount deposited on January 31 if it appears that the initial deposit will be exhausted during the course of the year. No permit issued shall be valid, or of any force or effect, if an operator fails to make the required deposits. The amount paid and used for the work orders may be credited against taxes owed to the city, to the extent required by state law. After a communications facility operator demonstrates financial responsibility under this section for a period of ten years, this provision may be waived by the city. 
(5)  Application to persons that provide different types of services. The fact that a fee is paid on one type of service provided over a communications facility, does not excuse an operator from its duty to pay fees on other types of services that it may be authorized to provide over that facility. (As an example, and not as a limitation of the foregoing, a cable television operator that pays a franchise fee on revenues derived from the provision of cable television services must also pay any fees that may be established by the city from time to time on use of the rights-of-way by persons providing telecommunications services, to the extent the cable television system is used for such purposes.) 
(6)  General rules for payment of fees: 
a.  Unless otherwise specified in a franchise or a license, franchise and license fees shall be paid to the city quarterly, and not later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. 
b.  Unless a franchise or license provides otherwise, each franchise or license fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the fee was calculated. 
c.  No acceptance by the city of any franchise or license fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such franchise or license fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable. 
d.  The franchise or license fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment, except as specifically provided in this article, or as required by applicable law. By way of example, and not limitation, permit fees and business license taxes are not waived and remain applicable. 
e.  Within 90 days following the end of the calendar year, each person who paid a franchise fee shall submit a statement, certified as true by an independent auditor or the chief financial officer of such person, setting forth gross revenues of the communications facility, by category, and describing what revenues were included and excluded in the fee calculation, and any adjustments made to gross revenues. If payments are late, in addition to paying any applicable penalties or damages, the person that owes the fee shall pay interest on the amount owed at the statutory interest rates applicable to judgments. 
f.  The city may, from time to time, and upon reasonable advance written notice, inspect and audit any and all books and records reasonably necessary to the determination of whether fees have been accurately computed and paid. 
g.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a person that is obligated to pay a fee ceases to provide service for any reason (including as a result of a transfer), such person shall make a final payment of any amounts owed to the city within 90 calendar days of the date its operations in the city cease, and shall provide a statement of gross revenues for the calendar year through the dates operations ceased which statement shall contain the information and certification required by this article. 
(d)  Term; renegotiation periods; and termination of franchise. 
(1)  Term. No franchise granted hereunder, or any renewal thereof, shall be for a term of more than ten years. However, the city may grant a franchise or renewal thereof for any shorter period of time it believes is consistent with the public interest and the facts before it. 
(2)  Termination and cancellation of franchise. In addition to all other rights and powers of the city granted by virtue of the franchise or this article, the city may terminate and cancel the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchisee thereunder or impose other penalty permitted by this article or the franchise agreement in the event that the franchisee either: 
a.  Violates any material provisions of the franchise agreement or this article or any legal rule, order or determination of the city made pursuant thereto; 
b.  Attempts to evade any of the provisions of this article or the franchise agreement; or 
c.  Becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, abandons the franchise, or, subject to section 14-85(i) hereof, repeatedly fails to pay the franchise fee when due. 
(3)  Notice. Before taking any action pursuant to the provisions of this article, the city shall give written notice of the event or violation to the franchisee, given by hand delivery or certified mail, return receipt requested. If the violation is not cured, or the event complained of satisfactorily explained, within 30 days of the date of receipt of said notice, the city may, if it deems the matter to be of a serious nature and that the franchisee has not diligently attempted to cure it, set a public hearing before the city council. Following the hearing, at which the franchisee shall be given an opportunity to present facts and make argument, the city council may revoke the franchise or impose other penalty permitted by this article or the franchise agreement. 
(4)  Performance evaluation provisions . 
a.  The city and franchisee may hold scheduled performance evaluation sessions within 30 days' prior to the third and seventh anniversary dates of granting a franchise or renewal of a franchise. All performance evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and will be announced by the city in a newspaper of general circulation at least five days before each session. 
b.  Special performance evaluation sessions may be held at any time during the term of the franchise provided that both the city and the franchisee shall mutually agree on the time, the place, and the topics to be negotiated. All such performance evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and announced in a newspaper of general circulation at least five days before each session. 
(e)  General conditions upon use of public rights-of-way. 
(1)  Responsibility for costs. Except as expressly provided otherwise, any act that a communications facility operator, its contractors or subcontractors are required to perform under this article shall be performed at their cost. If a communications facility operator fails to perform work that it is required to perform within the time provided for performance, the city may perform the work, and bill the communications facility operator. The communications facility operator shall pay the amounts billed within 30 days. 
(2)  Construction procedures and placement of facilities; obligation to minimize interference with use of public rights-of-way: 
a.  The construction, operation, and repair of communications facilities are subject to the supervision of all of the authorities of the city that have jurisdiction in such matters and shall be performed in compliance with all laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations and practices affecting such facilities. By way of example, and not limitation, this includes zoning codes and safety codes and city construction standards. In addition, the construction, operation, and repair shall be performed in a manner consistent with high industry standards. Persons engaged in the construction, operation, or repair of communications facilities shall exercise reasonable care in the performance of all their activities, and use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or be a nuisance to the public or to property. 
b.  Construction, operation, or repair of a communications facility shall not commence until written permits have been obtained from the proper city officials and all required permit (and associated) fees paid. In any permit so issued, the city may impose as a condition of the granting of the permit such conditions and regulations as may be necessary to the management of the public rights-of-way, including, by way of example and not limitation, for the purpose of protecting any structures in the public rights-of-way, for the proper restoration of such public rights-of-way and structures, and for the protection of the city and the public and the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
c.  Operators of communications facilities must follow city-established requirements for placement of facilities in public rights-of-way, including the specific location of facilities in the public rights-of-way, and must in any event install facilities in a manner that minimizes interference with the use of the public rights-of-way by others, including others that may also be installing communications facilities. The city may require that facilities be installed at a particular time, at a specific place, or in a particular manner as a condition of access to a particular right-of-way; may deny access if an operator is not willing to comply with the city's requirements; may remove any facility that is not installed in compliance with the requirements established by the city, or which is installed without prior city approval of the time, place, or manner of installation and charge the operator of the facility for all the costs associated with removal; and may require a person using the public rights-of-way to cooperate with others to minimize adverse impacts on the public rights-of-way through joint trenching and other arrangements. 
d.  Upon order of the mayor, all work which does not comply with the permit, the approved plans or specifications for the work, or other applicable law shall be removed. 
e.  The city may require as a condition of issuing any right-of-way permit for underground conduit, the installation of which requires excavation of or along any traveled way, that the franchisee, licensee, or holder of the right-of-way permit emplace conduit, in excess of its present and reasonably foreseeable requirements, for the purpose of accommodating other franchisees and licensees subject to a reasonable charge. 
f.  To the extent possible, operators of communications facilities shall use existing poles and conduit in installing their system. In no case may additional poles be installed in the public rights-of-way without the permission of the city and any person who is permitted to install poles must lease capacity on those poles to others, at a rate not higher than the rate that would be permitted if 47 U.S.C. § 224 applied. 
g.  Unless otherwise specified in a franchise or license all facilities shall be constructed, installed, and located in accordance with the following terms and conditions: 
1.  Communications facilities shall be installed within an existing underground duct or conduit whenever excess capacity exists within such utility facility. 
2.  Poles may not be installed without the written permission of the city. 
3.  Whenever any existing telephone, electric utility, or cable television system facilities are located underground, a person installing another communications facility must also place its communications facilities underground. 
h.  Any and all public rights-of-way, public property, or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, operation of a communications facility shall be promptly repaired by the communications facility operator that disturbed or damaged the public rights-of-way, public property or private property. 
i.  No tree trimming shall be performed without the permission of the city and other affected authorities, and any tree trimming must be performed in strict accordance with the city Code of Ordinances. 
j.  At the end of a scheduled franchise term, the poles and conduits owned by a franchisee shall become the property of the city, unless the city requires their removal; provided, however, that if a franchise is renewed pursuant to this article, the city will continue to allow a franchisee to occupy the poles and conduits at the lowest rate charged to any other commercial entity (not including rates that may be charged through a joint use agreement). If the city elects to require the removal of a franchisees poles and conduits, the city shall, within 180 days of the end of a scheduled franchise term, notify a franchisee in writing that the facilities must be removed in 180 days. 
(3)  Relocation of facilities. 
a.  A communications facility operator shall, by a time specified by the city, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its property when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions; public safety; public right-of-way construction; public right-of-way repair (including resurfacing or widening); change of public right-of-way grade; construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, railway tracks, or any other type of government-owned communications system, public work, or public facility; improvement of any government-owned utility; public right-of-way vacation; or for any other purpose where the work involved would be aided by the removal or relocation of the communications facility. Collectively, such matters are referred to below as the "public work." 
1.  Except in the case of emergencies, the city shall provide written notice describing where the public work is to be performed at least four weeks prior to the deadline by which a communications facility operator must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its facilities. A communications facility operator may seek an extension of the time to perform such tasks where they cannot be performed in four weeks, even with the exercise of due diligence, and such request for an extension shall not be unreasonably refused. 
2.  In the event of an emergency, or where a communications facility creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health safety, or property, the city may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate any or all parts of the communications without prior notice, and charge the communications facility operator for costs incurred. 
3.  If any person that is authorized to place facilities in the public rights-of-way requests another communications facility operator to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, move, or relocate its facilities to accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of such other person, the communications facility operator shall after 30 days' advance written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested. Unless the matter is governed by a valid contract or a state or federal law or regulation, or in other cases where the communications facility that is being requested to move (was not properly installed), the reasonable cost of the same shall be borne by the party requesting the protection, support temporary disconnection, removal, or relocation and performed at no charge to the city. 
b.  A communications facility operator shall, at the request of any person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings or other objects. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same. A communications facility operator shall be given not less than 14 days' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
c.  A communications facility operator may abandon any property in place upon notice to the city, unless the city determines, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion within 90 days of the notice of abandonment from the operator, that the safety, appearance, functioning or use of the public rights-of-way and facilities in the public rights-of-way will be adversely affected thereby, in which case the operator must remove its property by a date specified by the city. 
(4)  Facility subject to inspection; operator must provide information. Every communications facility shall be subject to the right of periodic inspection and testing by the city to determine compliance with the provisions of this article, a franchise agreement or license or other applicable law. The city shall have the right, upon request, to be notified and present when the communications facility is tested by the operator. Each operator must respond to requests for information regarding its system and plans for the system as the city may from time to time issue, including requests for information regarding its plans for construction, operation and repair, and the purposes for which the plant is being constructed, operated, or repaired. 
a.  Underground services alert or before you dig (BUD). Each operator of a communications facility that places facilities underground shall be a member of the regional notification center for subsurface installations (underground services alert) and shall field mark the locations of its underground communications facilities upon request. The operator shall locate its facilities for the city at no charge. 
(5)  Plans for and publicizing work. 
a.  Work shall be publicized as the city may direct from time to time. 
b.  Each communications facility shall provide the city with a plan for any initial system construction, or for any substantial rebuild, upgrade or extension of its facility, which shall include its timetable for construction of each phase of the project, and the areas of the city that will be affected. 
(6)  No discrimination. 
a.  A communications facility operator shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, programmers, or residents of the city on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, conditions of physical handicap, religion, ethnic background, or marital status. 
b.  A communications facility operator shall not discriminate among persons or the city or take any retaliatory action against a person or the city because of that entity's exercise of any right it may have, under federal state, or local law, nor may the operator require a person or the city to waive such rights as a condition of taking service. 
c.  Except as federal law prohibits enforcement of this provision, a communications facility operator shall be prohibited from denying access or levying different rates and charges on any group of potential customers because of the income of the residents or the local area in which such group resides. 
d.  A communications facility operator shall not refuse to employ, discharge from employment, or discriminate against any person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, disability, religion, ethnic background, or marital status. A communications facility operator shall comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing equal employment opportunities, as the same may be from time to time amended. 
(f)  Protection of the city and residents. 
(1)  Indemnification. 
a.  No franchise or other authorization to use the public rights-of-way issued to a communications facility operator shall be valid or effective until and unless the city obtains adequate indemnity from such operator. The indemnity must at least: 
1.  Release the city from any and all liability and responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation or maintenance of the communications facility. Each communications facility operator must further agree not to sue or seek any money or damages from the city in connection with the above mentioned matters; however, consistent with federal law, the communications facility operator may seek injunctive or declaratory relief from the city in connection with the above-mentioned matters. 
2.  Indemnify and hold harmless the city, its councilmembers, elected and appointed officers, agents, and employees, from and against any and all claims, demands, or causes of action of whatsoever kind or nature, and the resulting losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees, liabilities, damages, orders, judgments, or decrees, sustained by the city or any third party arising out of, or by reason of, or resulting from or by the acts, errors, or omissions of the communications facility operator, or its agents, independent contractors or employees related to or in any way arising out of the construction, operation or repair of the facility; and 
3.  Provide that the covenants and representations relating to the indemnification provision shall survive the term of any franchise or other authorization and continue in full force and effect as to the party's responsibility to indemnify. 
(2)  Insurance. No franchise or other authorization to use the public rights-of-way issued to a communications facility operator shall be valid or effective until and unless the city obtains assurance that such operator (and those acting on its behalf) have adequate insurance. At a minimum, the following requirements must be satisfied: 
a.  A communications facility operator shall not commence construction or operation of the facility without obtaining all insurance required under this paragraph and approval of such insurance by the mayor of the city, nor shall a communications facility operator allow any contractor or subcontractor to commence work on its contract or subcontract until all similar such insurance required of the same has been obtained and approved. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the communications facility operator has facilities in the public rights-of-way, and for a period thereafter as specified in the minimum coverages described below. If the operator, its contractors or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the city may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved. 
b.  Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required insurance, shall be filed with the city clerk. For entities that are entering the market, the certificates shall be filed prior to the commencement of construction and once a year thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage. For entities that have facilities in the public rights-of-way as of the effective date of this article, the certificate shall be filed within 60 days of the date of this article, annually thereafter, and as provided below in the event of a lapse in coverage, unless a pre-existing franchise or license provides for filing of certificates in a different manner. 
c.  These certificates shall contain a provision that coverages afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least 30 days' prior written notice has been given to the city. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Financial ratings must be no less than "A" in the latest edition of "Best's Key Rating Guide," published by A.M. Best Guide. 
d.  In the event that the insurance certificate provided indicates that the insurance shall terminate or lapse during the term of a franchise or other authorization, then in that event, the communications facility operator shall furnish, at least 30 days' prior to the expiration of the date of such insurance, a renewed certificate of insurance as proof that equal and like coverage will be in force for the balance of the period of the franchise or license under which the communications facility operates. Copies of policies will be provided. 
e.  A communications facility owner or operator, and its contractors or subcontractors engaged in work on the operator's behalf in, on, under or over public rights-of-way, shall maintain the following minimum insurance: 
1.  Comprehensive general liability insurance to cover liability for bodily injury and property damage. Exposures to be covered are: premises, operations, products/completed operations, and certain contracts. Coverage must be written on an occurrence basis, with the following limits of liability: 
i.  Bodily injury. 
A.  Each occurrence $3,000,000.00.

iv.  Completed operations and products liability shall be maintained for two years after the termination of the franchise or license (in the case of the communications facility owner or operator) or completion of the work for the communications facility owner or operator (in the case of a contractor or subcontractor). Property damage liability insurance shall include coverage for the following hazards: X - explosion, C - collapse, U - underground. 
2.  Workers' compensation insurance shall be maintained to comply with statutory limits for all employees, and in the case any work is sublet, each communications facility operator shall require the subcontractors similarly to provide workers' compensation insurance for all the latter's employees unless such employees are covered by the protection afforded by each communications facility operator. Each communications facility operator and its contractors and subcontractors shall maintain during the life of this policy employer's liability insurance. The following limits must be maintained: 
i.  Workers' compensation-Statutory. 
ii.  Employer's liability - $ 500,000.00 per occurrence. 
3.  Comprehensive auto liability. 
i.  Bodily injury. 
A.  Each occurrence $3,000,000.00. 
B.  Annual aggregate $5,000,000.00. 
iii.  Property damage. 
A.  Each occurrence $1,000,000.00. 
B.  Annual aggregate 3,000,000.00. 
Coverage shall include owned, hired and non-owned vehicles. 
f.  All insurance policies, excluding the workers' compensation insurance policy, shall name the city, its officers, elected and appointed officials, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees as additional insured persons. 
g.  Each communications facility operator shall hold the city, its agents, and employees, harmless on account of claims for damages to persons, property or premises arising out of its construction, operation or repair of its communications facility. 
h.  In every franchise or license agreement, the city shall reserve the right to require any other insurance coverage it reasonable deems necessary depending upon the exposures. 
(3)  Surety instruments. Any new communications facility operator furnishing services to the city for the first time, whether by way of license or assignment of the franchise agreement, shall establish a cash security fund, or provide the city with an irrevocable letter of credit in the same amount, to license and to pay any taxes, fees or liens owed to the city. The fund or letter of credit shall be in the initial amount of $50,000.00, unless a franchise agreement or license provides otherwise. The letter of credit shall be in a form and with an institution acceptable to the city attorney. Should the city draw upon the cash security fund or letter of credit, it shall promptly notify the communications facility operator, and the communications facility operator shall promptly restore the fund or the letter of credit to the full required amount. This security fund/letter of credit may be waived or reduced for a franchisee or licensee where the city determines in its discretion that a particular franchisee's or licensees operations are sufficiently limited that a security fund/letter of credit is not necessary to secure the required performance. 
(g)  Enforcement and remedies. 
(1)  The mayor is responsible for administration. The mayor is responsible for enforcing and administering this article, and the mayor is authorized to give any notice required by law or under any franchise or license, including by way of example and not limitation, a notice required under 47 U.S.C. § 546. The mayor is also authorized to seek information from any communications facility operator to establish forms for submission of applications and other information, and to take all other actions necessary or appropriate to the administration of this article. Franchises may only be issued or revoked by action of the city council. 
(2)  Applications for franchises and licenses: 
a.  An application must be filed for an initial franchise or license, for a transfer, or for renewal of a franchise or license. Each entity that is required to hold a franchise or license must submit an application therefore to the city in accordance with the requirements of sections 14-82-14-84. To be accepted for filing an original and six copies of a complete application for a franchise, and an original and three copies of a complete application for a license, showing the routes the applicant proposes to use, must be submitted to the city. All applications shall be available for public inspection. All applications shall include the names and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of the applicant with respect to the application. 
b.  An application may be filed by any person on that person's initiative or in response to a request for proposals. The city is authorized to issue requests for proposals from time to time. 
c.  An applicant that is awarded a franchise or license, shall, in addition to making all the other payments required herein, pay to the city a sum of money sufficient to reimburse it for all publication expenses incurred by it in connection with the granting of a franchise or license pursuant to the provisions of this article. Such payment shall be made within 30 days after the city furnishes the franchisee or licensee with a written statement of such expenses by delivery of payment to the city clerk/treasurer. 
d.  No franchise or license shall become effective until all required fees and costs are paid. 
e.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of a franchised or licensed communications facility to secure the construction, operation, or repair of the system may be made without application and without the city's prior consent; except that no such arrangement may be made if it would in any respect or under any condition prevent the communications facility operator or any successor from complying with the franchise or license and applicable law, nor may any such arrangement permit a third party to succeed to the interest of the operator, or to own or control the communications facility, without the prior consent of the city. Any mortgage, pledge or lease shall be subject to and subordinate to the rights of the city under any franchise or license, this article or other applicable law. 
(3)  Minimum contents of every franchise or license. In addition to satisfying the other applicable requirements of this section, every franchise or license for a communications facility shall contain the following provisions: 
a.  The franchise or license shall provide that neither the granting of any franchise or license, nor any provision thereof, shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power, police power, or regulatory power of the city as may exist at the time the franchise or license is issued or may thereafter be obtained. 
b.  The franchise or license shall only authorize occupancy of the public rights-of-way to provide the services and for the purposes described in the franchise or license. 
c.  A franchise or license shall be a privilege that is held in the public trust and is personal to the original franchisee or licensee. The franchise or license shall ensure that no transfer of the franchise or license may occur, directly or indirectly, without the prior consent of the city; except as contemplated by this article or as otherwise expressly provided for in this article. 
d.  The franchise or license shall ensure that any person placing communications facilities in the public rights-of-way will not discriminate in hiring, in contracting, or in the provision of services. 
e.  The franchise or license shall contain appropriate provisions for enforcement, compensation, and protection of the public which are consistent with the other provisions of this article. 
f.  The franchise or license shall be for a specified term, set forth in the franchise or license. No franchise issued under this article shall be for a term of longer than ten years; no license issued under this article shall be for a term of longer than five years. 
g.  Such other terms as are required by the city Code of Ordinances. 
(4)  Penalties and enforcement. 
a.  Pursuant to KRS 65.8801 to 65.8839, the Mayfield Cable Authority [MCA] is appointed to serve as a special code enforcement board for the purposes of enforcing this article and all other ordinances and agreements relating to open video systems (OVS) and cable television franchises issued by the City of Mayfield, Kentucky. It is the intent of the mayor and the city council that this board have the authority to issue remedial orders and impose fines in order to provide an equitable, expeditious, effective and inexpensive method of ensuring compliance with the OVS/cable television ordinances and related ordinances adopted by and franchises issued by the City of Mayfield, Kentucky. 
b.  The code enforcement board shall have the following powers and duties: 
1.  To adopt rules and regulations governing its operation and the conduct of its hearings. 
2.  To conduct hearings to determine if there has been a violation of an ordinance over which it has jurisdiction. 
3.  To subpoena alleged violators, witnesses and evidence to its hearings. Any code enforcement or peace officer may serve subpoenas issued by the board. 
4.  To take testimony under oath. The chairman shall have the authority to administer oaths for the purpose of taking testimony. 
5.  To make findings of fact and issue orders necessary to remedy any violation of a pertinent city ordinance or franchise agreement, which the board is authorized to enforce. 
6.  To impose civil fines, as authorized herein, on any person found to have violated an ordinance or agreement over which the board has jurisdiction. 
c.  The following shall govern all enforcement proceedings before the board: 
1.  Enforcement proceedings before the board shall be initiated only by the issuance of a citation by a code enforcement officer. 
2.  Except as provided herein, if a code enforcement officer believes, based on his or her observation or investigation, that a person has violated a city ordinance, he or she shall issue a notice of violation to the suspected offender allowing the accused offender a specified period of time to remedy the violation without a fine. If the accused offender fails to remedy the violation within the time specified, the code enforcement officer is authorized to issue a citation imposing a fine. 
3.  Nothing in this article shall prohibit the city from taking immediate action to remedy violation of its ordinances when there is reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or if, in the absence of immediate action, the effects of the violation will be irreparable or irreversible. 
4.  The citation issued by the code enforcement officer shall contain the following information: 
i.  Date and time of issuance; 
ii.  Name and address, if known, to whom the citation is issued 
iii.  Date and time, if known, the offense was committed or observed; 
iv.  Facts constituting the offense; 
v.  Section of the Code of Ordinances or franchise agreement that is being violated; 
vi.  Name of the code enforcement officer; 
vii.  Amount of the civil fine that will be imposed for the violation, if the accused offender does not contest the citation; 
viii.  The maximum civil fine that may be imposed if the accused offender elects to contest the citation; 
ix.  The procedure for the accused offender to follow in order to pay the civil fine or contest the citation; and, 
x.  A statement that if the accused offender fails to pay the civil fine set forth in the citation or fails to contest the action, within the time allowed, then the accused offender shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing before the board to contest the citation and that the determination that the violation was committed shall be final. 
5.  Copies of all citations shall be filed with the Mayfield City Clerk, who shall act as (or designate a representative to act as) clerk of the board. 
6.  The accused offender to whom the citation is issued shall respond within seven calendar days of the date of issuance by either paying the civil fine or requesting, in writing, a hearing before the board. If an accused offender fails to respond with seven calendar days, then the accused offender shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the determination that a violation was committed shall be considered final, in which case the board shall enter a final order determining the violation was committed and impose the civil fine set forth in the citation. A copy of the final order shall be served on the offender. 
d.  When a hearing has been requested, the board shall schedule a hearing. The hearing shall be within 14 days of the request, unless the requesting party wants or agrees to a continuance not to exceed an additional 14 days. 
e.  Not less than seven days before the date of the hearing, the Mayfield Code Enforcement Officer or the Mayfield City Clerk shall notify the requesting party of the date, time and place of the hearing. The notice may be given by certified mail, return receipt requested; by personal delivery; or by leaving a notice at the requesting party's usual place of residence with any individual residing therein who is 18 years of age or older and who is informed of the contents of the notice. 
f.  Any person requesting a hearing before the board who fails to appear at the time and place set for the hearing shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing to contest the citation and the determination that a violation was committed shall be final. The board shall enter a final order determining the violation was committed and shall impose the civil fine set forth in the citation. A copy of the final order shall be served upon the offender. 
g.  Each case before the board shall be presented by an attorney selected by the city or by a code enforcement officer for the city. The Mayfield City Attorney may either be counsel to the board or may present cases before the board; in no case shall he/she serve in both capacities. 
h.  All testimony shall be taken under oath and recorded. Testimony shall be taken from the code enforcement officer, the accused offender, and any witnesses to the violation offered by the code enforcement officer or suspected offender. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. 
i.  The board shall, based on the evidence, determine whether a violation was committed. If it determines that no violation was committed, an order dismissing the citation shall be entered. If the board determines a violation was committed, an order shall be issued upholding the citation and either imposing a fine up to the maximum authorized by this or other ordinances or requiring the offender to remedy a continuing violation or both. 
j.  Every final order of the board shall be reduced to writing, which shall include the date the order was issued. A copy shall be furnished to the offender. If the offender is not present when the final order is issued, the order shall be delivered in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 14-83(g)(4)e. 
k.  An appeal from any final order of the board may be made to the Graves County District Court within 30 days of the date the order is issued. The appeal shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint and a copy of the board's order in the same manner as any civil action under the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure. 
l.  If no appeal from a final order of the board is filed within the time period set in section 14-83(g)(4)k., the board's order shall be deemed final for all purposes. 
m.  The penalties for violation of ordinances and agreements regulating cable television franchises shall be as follows:

If any of the above violations and offenses are committed by an OVS or cable television franchisee, and the violation and offense result in a fine and penalty, the amount of the fine and penalty shall be taken and deducted from the security fund provided to the City of Mayfield by the OVS or cable TV franchisee. 
Otherwise, the city shall possess a lien on property owned by the offender found by a final order of the board, or by a final judgement of the court, to have committed a violation of a city ordinance for all fines assessed for the violation and for all charges and fees incurred by the city in connection with the enforcement of the ordinance. 
The lien shall be recorded in the office of the Graves County Clerk. The lien shall be notice to all persons from the time of its recording and shall bear interest until paid. 
The lien shall take precedence over all other subsequent liens, except state, county, school board and city taxes, and may be enforced by judicial proceedings. 
In addition to the remedy prescribed in this section, the offender found to have committed the violation shall be personally responsible for the amount of all fines and penalties assessed for the violation and for all charges and fees incurred by the city in connection with the enforcement of the ordinance. The city may bring a civil action against the offender and shall have the same remedies as provided for the recovery of a debt. 
(5)  Revocation, reduction of term, or forfeiture of franchise or license: 
a.  Licenses shall be revocable at will. 
b.  Where, after notice and providing the franchisee an opportunity to be heard (if such opportunity is timely requested by a franchisee), the city finds that the facility is being maintained or operated in violation of this article or in substantial violation of the terms of the franchise, the city may make an appropriate reduction in the remaining term of the franchise or revoke the franchise. The mayor or his designee is authorized to establish and conduct a proceeding that comports with the requirements of this article, and to issue a recommended decision, but any such decision may be appealed to the city council. Any appeal must be filed within 30 days of the decision of the mayor or it shall be deemed waived. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchise may not be revoked unless the franchisee (A) was given notice of the default; (B) given 30 days to cure the default; and (C) the franchisee failed to cure the default or to propose a schedule for curing the default acceptable to the city where it is impossible to cure the default in 30 days. The required notice may be given before the city conducts the proceeding required by this paragraph. No opportunity to cure is required for repeated violations, and fraud shall be deemed incurable. 
c.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may declare a franchise forfeited where the franchisee (A) fails to begin to exercise its rights under the franchise within a period specified in the franchise; (B) stops providing service it is required to provide in the franchise; (C) without the prior consent of the city, transfers the franchise; (D) fails to pay the fees owed hereunder, or (E) defrauds or attempts to defraud the city or the operator's customers. The city shall give a franchisee 30 days' notice of an intent to declare a franchise forfeited, and shall provide the opportunity to show cause why the franchise should not be forfeited. 
d.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any franchise or license shall be deemed revoked 120 calendar days after assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or to take over the business of the franchisee or licensee whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding. Provided, however, the franchise or license may be reinstated if, within that 120-day period: 
1.  Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or 
2.  Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise or license, and has executed an agreement, approved by a court having jurisdiction, under which it assumes and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise or license. 
3.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee or licensee, the city may revoke the franchise or license, following a public hearing before the city council, by serving notice upon the franchisee or licensee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise or license and all rights and privileges of the franchise or license will be revoked and will terminate 30 calendar days after serving such notice, unless: 
4.  The city has approved the transfer of the franchise or license to the successful bidder, and 
5.  The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise or license and this article. 
(6)  Effect of termination or forfeiture. Upon termination or forfeiture of a franchise, or termination or forfeiture of a license, whether by action of the city as provided above, or by passage of time, the franchisee or licensee shall be obligated to cease using the communications facilities for the purposes authorized by the franchise or license. The city may require the licensee or franchisee or its bonding company to remove, some or all of the licensee's or franchisee's facilities from the public rights-of-way and to restore the public rights-of-way to their proper condition. Should the franchisee or licensee neglect, refuse, or fail to remove such facility, the city may remove the facility at the expense of the franchisee or licensee. The obligation of the licensee or franchisee shall survive the termination of the franchise or license for a period of two years. This provision does not permit the city to take possession of, or require the franchisee or licensee to remove any facilities that are used to provide another service for which the franchisee or licensee holds a valid franchise or license issued by the city. Provided further, nothing in this section shall affect the city's right to take possession of abandoned facilities. 
(7)  Remedies cumulative. All remedies under this article or under any franchise or license are cumulative, unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not foreclose the use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of liquidated damages or penalties relieve a communications facility operator of its obligations to comply with its franchise or license. Remedies may be used singly or in combination; and, in addition, the city may exercise any rights it has at law or equity. Recovery by the city of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond, the security fund or letter of credit, or otherwise, does not limit a communications facility operator's duty to indemnify the city in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a communications facility operator of its obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts owed to the city, or in any respect prevent the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have. Nothing herein shall be read to authorize the double-recovery of damages. 
(8)  Access to books and records. 
a.  Each communications facility operator shall provide the city with access to all books and records related to the construction, operation, or repair of the communications facility so that the city may inspect and copy these books and records. The operator's obligation includes the obligation to produce all books and records related to revenues derived from the operation of the communications facility. An operator is responsible for obtaining or maintaining the necessary possession or control of all books and records related to the construction, operation or repair of the communications facility, so that it can produce the documents upon request. Books and records must be maintained for a period of five years, except that (A) any record that is a public record must be maintained for the period required by state law; and (B) a franchise or license may specify a shorter period for certain categories of voluminous books and records where the information contained therein can be derived simply from other materials. 
b.  For purposes of this article, the terms "books and records" shall be read expansively to include information in whatever format stored. Books and records requested shall be produced to the city at the mayor's office, unless the city directs otherwise, or by agreement pursuant to section 14-83(g)(8)c. below. 
c.  If any books and records are too voluminous or cannot be copied and moved, then a communication operator may request that the inspection take place at some other location mutually agreed to by the city and the operator provided that (A) the operator must make necessary arrangements for copying documents selected by the city after its review, and (B) the operator must pay all travel and additional copying expenses incurred by the city (above those that would have been had the documents been produced in the city) in inspecting those documents or having those documents inspected by its designee. 
d.  Without limiting the foregoing, the operator of a communications facility shall provide the city with the following within ten days of their receipt or (in the case of documents created by the operator or its affiliate) filing: 
1.  Notices of deficiency or forfeiture related to the operation of the communications facility; and 
2.  Copies of any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy by the franchisee or licensee or by any partnership or corporation that owns or controls the franchisee or licensee directly or indirectly. 
(9)  Retention of records. Each communications facility operator shall take all reasonable steps required, if any, to ensure that it is able to provide the city with all information which must be provided or may be requested under this article, a franchise, or license or applicable law, including by providing appropriate subscriber privacy notices. Each operator shall be responsible for redacting any data that applicable law prevents it from providing to the city. Nothing in this section shall be read to require an operator to violate state or federal law protecting subscriber privacy. 
(10)  Reports. The city may require operators of communications facilities to maintain records, and to prepare reports relevant to determining the compliance of the communications facility operator with the terms and conditions of this article or of a franchise or license. 
(11)  Maps. Each communications facility operator shall maintain accurate maps and improvement plans which show the location, size, and a general description of all facilities installed in the public rights-of-way and any power supply sources (including voltages and connections). Maps shall be based upon post-construction inspection to verify location. The operator of each communications facility shall provide a map to the city showing the location of its facilities, in such detail and scale as may be directed by the mayor. New maps shall be promptly submitted to the city when the facility expands or is relocated. Copies of maps shall be provided on disk in a format specified by the mayor. 
(12)  Compliance with laws. Each franchisee or licensee shall comply with all applicable laws heretofore and hereafter adopted or established during the entire term of its franchise or license. 
(13)  Reservation of authority. The city may do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this article. 
(14)  No waiver. The failure of the city to insist on timely performance or compliance by any person holding a license or franchise shall not constitute a waiver of the city's right to later insist on timely performance or compliance by that person or any other person holding a license or franchise. 
(15)  Ordinance/[article] not a contract. The city expressly reserves the right to amend this article from time-to-time in the exercise of its lawful powers. This article shall not be construed to be a contract. 
(h)  Transitional provisions. 
(1)  Persons operating without a franchise or license. The operator of any facility, the operation of which is required to be franchised or licensed under this article, shall have three months from the effective date of this article to file one or more applications for a franchise or a license under this article. Any operator timely filing such an application shall not be subject to a penalty under requirements of this article for failure to have such a franchise or license as long as said application remains pending; provided, however, nothing herein shall relieve any communications facility operator of any liability for its failure to obtain any franchise, license, permit or other authorization required under other provisions of the Code of Ordinances, and nothing herein shall prevent the city from requiring removal of any facilities installed in violation of this article. 
(2)  Persons holding franchises or licenses. Any person holding an outstanding franchise or license from the city for a communications facility to provide specified services may continue to operate under the existing franchise or license to the conclusion of its present term (but not any renewal or extension thereof) with respect to those activities expressly authorized by the franchise or license; provided, however, that such franchisee or licensee may elect at any time to apply for a superseding franchise or license under this article and must seek additional franchises or licenses to provide other services; and provided further, that such person shall be subject to the other provisions of this article to the extent permitted by law; provided further, that licenses that are revocable at will may be revoked by the city, and the licensee may be required to obtain a new license under this article. 
(3)  Persons with open pending applications. Pending applications shall be subject to this article. A person with a pending application shall be provided 30 days from the effective date of this article to submit additional information to comply with the requirements of this article governing applications. 
(4)  Transitional rules to be narrowly interpreted. It is the intent of the city to apply the provisions of this article to communications facilities operators, including local exchange carriers, that now occupy or may in the future occupy public rights-of-way, except to the extent federal or state law prevents it from doing so. 
(i)  Special rules for government entities. Nothing herein requires the city to apply the provisions of this article to the state or federal government, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, if the city determines that it is not in the public interest to do so, or that its authority to do so is not clear. The mayor and/or the Mayfield Cable Authority are authorized to enter into agreements with other governmental agencies to facilitate the city's use and management of its public rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 1-99, § 3, 7-10-00) 
Sec. 14-84. - Special rules applicable to open video systems. 
(a)  Application for a franchise or license. 
(1)  Contents of applications for initial or renewal franchise. In order to obtain an initial or renewal franchise, an operator of an open video system must apply for a franchise. The application must contain the following information, and such additional information as the city may from time to time require. 
a.  Identity of the applicant shall include the persons who exercise working control over the applicant; and the persons who control those persons, to the ultimate parent. 
b.  A proposal for construction of the open video system shall include at least the following: 
1.  A description of the services that are to be provided over the facility. 
2.  The identification of the area of the city to be served by the proposed system, including a description of the proposed franchise area's boundaries. 
3.  The location of the proposed facility and facility design including a description of the miles of plant to be installed; a description of the size of equipment cabinets, shielding and electronics that will be installed along the plant route; a description of the power sources that will be used; and a description of the noise, exhaust and pollutants, if any, that will be generated by the operation of the same. 
4.  A map of the route the facility will follow, a designation of the portions of the system that will be placed above-ground and the portions that will be placed underground, and the construction technique that the operator proposes to use in installing the system above-ground and underground; a schedule for construction of the facility, describing when and where construction will begin, how it will proceed, and when it will be completed; and the expected effect on rights-of-way usage, including information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed system, including as appropriate, given the system proposed, an estimate of the availability of space in conduits and an estimate of the cost of any necessary rearrangement of existing facilities. To the extent plans for the facility required under this subsection have not been completed, an applicant may so state, but (A) the best available equivalent must be provided and (B) no construction may begin, even if a franchise is granted, until this information has been provided to and approved by the city. Any such grant will be conditional upon receipt and approval of this information by the city. 
c.  A description, where appropriate, of how services will be converted from existing facilities to new facilities, and what will be done with existing facilities. 
d.  Proof, attested to by a certified public accountant, that the applicant has the financial resources to complete the proposed project, and to construct, operate and repair the proposed facility over the franchise term. It is not the intent of the city to require an applicant to prove that the services it proposes to offer will succeed in the marketplace. 
e.  Proof that an applicant is technically qualified to construct operate and repair the proposed facility. At a minimum, the applicant must show that it has experience or resources to ensure that work is to be performed adequately and can respond to emergencies during and after construction is complete. 
f.  Proof that the applicant is legally qualified, which proof must include a demonstration that the applicant: 
1.  Has received, or is in a position to receive, necessary authorizations from state and federal authorities; 
2.  Has not engaged in conduct (fraud, racketeering, violation of antitrust laws, consumer protection laws, or similar laws) that allows the city to conclude the applicant cannot be relied upon to comply with the requirements of a franchise, or the provisions of this article, 
3.  Is willing to enter into a franchise, to pay required compensation and to abide by the provisions of applicable law, including those regarding to the construction, operation or maintenance of its facilities, and has not entered into any agreement that would prevent it from doing so. 
g.  An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of applicable law. 
h.  An applicant may show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise under section 14-84(a)(1)f.2., by virtue of: the particular circumstances surrounding the acts or omission at issue; the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and to prevent their recurrence; and the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the acts or omissions from the operation of telecommunications facilities. 
(2)  Contents of application for initial or renewal license. In order to obtain an initial or renewal license, an operator of an open video system must apply for a license. The application must contain the information required by this article and such additional information as the city may from time to time require. 
(3)  Additional information regarding affiliates; presumptions. To the extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the financial or technical resources of another person, including another affiliate, the financial proofs required by section 14-84(a)(1)d. and section 14-85(d)(3)e. should be provided for that person as if it were the applicant. An applicant will be presumed to have the requisite financial, technical or legal qualifications to the extent such qualifications have been reviewed and approved by a state agency of competent jurisdiction; or if an applicant is a holder of a franchise or license in the city for a cable television system or open video system. An applicant may initially demonstrate its financial, technical and legal qualifications by showing that it is entitled to such a presumption. However, nothing herein prevents the city from conducting an independent review of qualifications. 
(4)  Applications for transfer. An application for a transfer of a franchise or license must contain the same information required by section 14-84(a)(1) or section 14-84(a)(2) of this article except that if the transferor submitted an application under section 14-84(a)(1) or section 14-84(a)(2), to the extent information provided by the transferor under section 14-84(a)(1) or section 14-84(a)(2) remains accurate, the transferee may simply cross-reference the earlier application. 
(5)  City review. The city may request such additional information as it finds necessary and require such modifications to the application as may be necessary in the exercise of the city's authority over open video systems. Once the information required by the city has been provided, the application shall be promptly reviewed and any approval will also be subject to a city determination that: 
a.  The applicant has the qualifications to construct, operate and repair the system proposed in conformity with applicable law; 
b.  The applicant will accept the modifications required by the city to its proposed system. This section shall not be read to authorize the city to exercise authority it does not otherwise have under applicable law; 
c.  The applicant will enter into a franchise or license and will comply with any conditions precedent to its effectiveness; 
d.  There will be no adverse effect on the public interest, or the city's interest in the franchise or license; 
1.  The transferee will agree to be bound by all the conditions of the franchise or license and to assume all the obligations of its predecessor; and 
2.  Any outstanding compliance and compensation issues have been resolved or preserved to the satisfaction of the city. 
e.  An applicant shall not be issued a franchise or license if it files or in the previous three years filed materially inaccurate or misleading information in a franchise or license application or intentionally withheld information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide. 
f.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may reject an application for a license if it deems it in the public interest to do so. 
(6)  Compensation. Subject to any exceptions in this article: 
a.  Every operator of a franchise open video system shall pay to the city a percentage of gross revenues derived from the operation of the open video system in the city each quarter equal to the gross revenue percentage paid by any cable television operator, or, if there is no cable television operator, the highest amount that could be charged consistent with federal and state law. In addition, unless a franchise provides otherwise, an open video system operator (A) shall pay to the city, at a fine directed by the city, an amount equal to the highest amount contributed by any cable television operator under its franchise for and in support of public, educational and government use (including institutional network use) of its cable television system; and (B) to the extent that a cable television operator is providing other support for public, educational or governmental use, the operator must duplicate that support in a timely manner as directed by the city, or provide a cash equivalent acceptable to the city. If there is no cable television operator, the city may require the operator to pay the highest amount that may be charged consistent with federal and state law. In applying this section, the city may take such steps as it deems appropriate to ensure that the obligations imposed upon the open video system operator are no greater or lesser than the obligation imposed upon the cable television operator providing the greatest benefits to the community. Further, the city reserves the right, to require the operator to pay additional compensation if the provisions of federal law specifying the compensation to be paid by operators changes or is declared invalid, or to ensure that the operator of an open video system pays no less than the amount paid by any cable television operator. 
b.  Every operator of a licensed open video system shall pay to the city a fee that recovers an amount equivalent to the fair market value of the property used in the city. No license may be issued without an enforceable fee. 
(Ord. No. 1-99, § 4, 7-10-00) 
Sec. 14-85. - Special rules applicable to cable systems. 
(a)  Additional definitions. The following definitions are in addition to those in this article: 
    Access channel means any capacity on a cable television system set aside by a franchise for public, educational, or governmental use. 
    Basic cable service or basic service means any service tier that includes the retransmission of local television broadcast signals. 
    Cable Act means the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47 U S.C. § 521 et seq., as amended by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, as further amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as further amended from time to time. 
    Cable operator means any person or group of persons (A) who provides cable television service over a cable television system and directly or through one or more affiliates owns a significant interest in such cable television system, or (B) who otherwise controls or is responsible for, through any arrangement, the management and operation of such a cable television system. 
    Educational access or educational use means any capacity on a cable television system set aside by a franchise for use by educational institutions. 
    Equitable price means fair market value adjusted downward for the harm to the city or subscribers, if any, resulting from a franchisees or licensee's breach of its franchise or violation of this article, and as further adjusted to account for other equitable factors that may be considered consistent with 47 U.S.C. § 547. 
    Fair market value means the price for the cable television system, valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise or license itself. 
    Government access channel means any capacity on a cable television system set aside by a franchise for government use. 
    Gross revenues means any and all cash or other consideration of any cable television operator of a cable television system in any way derived from the operation of that cable television system to provide cable television services in the franchise area. Gross revenues include, by way of illustration. and not limitation, monthly fees charged to subscribers for any basic, optional premium, per-channel or per-program service; installation, disconnection, re-connection, and change-in-service fees; leased channel fees; late fees and administrative fees; revenues received from programmers for carriage of programming on the cable television system; revenues from rentals or sales of converters or other equipment; advertising revenues; revenues from program guides; and revenues from home shopping channels. This provision shall be read broadly to prevent the avoidance of franchise fees by a cable television operator through arrangements with affiliates. Gross revenues shall not include any taxes on services furnished by a franchisee which are imposed directly on any subscriber or user by the state, city, or other governmental unit and which are collected by a franchisee on behalf of said governmental unit. Gross revenues do not include amounts booked as revenues which are bad subscriber debt, net of any collections. However, to take advantage of this bad debt exception, a franchisee must exercise due diligence and utilize all reasonable means to collect debt owed to it. Amounts received from a programmer that are provided solely for the purpose of reimbursing the operator for amounts the operator advanced to cover the programmer's share of co-op advertising costs shall not be treated as the operator's gross revenues. However, advertising costs subject to this exception do not include charges for carriage of advertising on the cable television system. 
    Non-cable service means any service that is authorized to be distributed over the cable television system, other than a cable television service. 
    Public access channel means any capacity on a cable television system set aside by a franchise for use by the general public, including groups and individuals, and which is available for such use on a non-discriminatory basis. 
    Service tier means a package of two or more cable television services for which a separate charge is made by the franchisee, other than a package of premium and pay-per-view services that is not subject to rate regulation under the Cable Act and applicable FCC regulations because those services are also sold on a true a la carte basis. 
    Subscriber means the city, any government entity or any person who legally receives any cable television service from a cable television operator delivered over that cable television operator's system.

4.  The applicant must not have submitted an application for an initial or renewal franchise to the city, which was denied on the ground that the applicant failed to propose a cable television system meeting the cable-related needs and interests of the community, or as to which any challenges to such franchising decision were finally resolved (including any appeals) adversely to the applicant, within three years preceding the submission of the application. An applicant may show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise under certain sections of this article by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the acts or omissions at issue; the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and to prevent their recurrence; and the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the acts or omissions from the operation of communications facilities. 
h.  To the extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the financial or technical resources of another person, including another affiliate, the proofs required in this article should be provided for that person.

If an applicant has no other franchise in Kentucky, it shall provide the information for its operations in other states. 
j.  An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of applicable law. 
(4)  Contents of applications for a license. Any application for a license submitted pursuant to section 14-85(d)(1) shall contain, at a minimum, the information required by this article and such additional information as the city may from time to time require. 
(5)  Procedure for applying for grant of a franchise other than an application that is subject to 47 U.S.C. § 546. 
a.  A person may apply for a franchise, or license, in response to a request for proposals issued by the city. Any response to an RFP shall contain the information required by section 14-85(d)(2) or 14-85(d)(3), and such other information as the RFP may require, and must be submitted in accordance with the provisions in the RFP. A properly filed response to an RFP shall be evaluated in accordance with this article. The city may conduct such investigations from time to time, as may be appropriate to establish RFP requirements. 
b.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, a person may apply for an initial franchise or license by submitting an unsolicited application containing the information required herein and requesting an evaluation of that application pursuant to this article. Prior to evaluating that application, the city may conduct such investigations as are necessary to determine whether the application satisfies the standards set forth in this article, including by commencing a proceeding to identify the future cable-related needs and interests of the community. It also may seek additional applications prior to evaluating the application. An applicant for an initial franchise or license shall be provided an opportunity to amend its application in light of the result of any investigation conducted by the city, prior to evaluation of that application pursuant to section 14-85(d)(5)c. 
c.  In evaluating an application for a franchise or license the city shall consider the following factors: 
1.  The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable television franchise or license for the city; 
2.  For a franchise application, whether the quality of the applicant's service under any franchise in the city, including signal quality, response to customer complaints, billing practices, and the like has been reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities served; 
3.  Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal qualifications to hold a cable television franchise or license; 
4.  Whether the application satisfies the requirements established by the city under this article, or in an RFP; 
5.  Whether the application is reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests; 
6.  Whether to the extent, not considered as part of section 14-85(d)(5)c.5., the applicant will provide adequate public, educational, and governmental channel capacity, facilities or financial support; 
7.  Whether issuance of a franchise or license is in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way and private property that would be used by the cable television system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the public rights-of-way; and the comparative superiority or inferiority of competing applications; 
d.  Whether the approval of the application may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable television service in the city. If the city finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise or license considering the factors set forth above, the city may adopt a franchise ordinance or issue a license setting forth the terms and conditions of the franchise or license, which franchise or license shall become effective upon the satisfaction of conditions precedent to effectiveness and when signed and accepted by the applicant. If the city denies a franchise or license, it will cause a written explanation of the denial to issue, which may be in any appropriate form. Without limiting its authority to deny an application for a franchise or license, the city specifically reserves the right to reject any application that is incomplete or fails to respond to an RFP. 
e.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may reject an application for a license if it deems it in the public interest to do so. 
(6)  Procedure for applying for grant of a cable act renewal franchise. To the extent required by federal law, request for renewal under the cable act will be received and reviewed in a manner consistent with Section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546. It is the proposal submitted by a franchisee under 47 U.S.C. § 546(b), and not the request for commencement of the renewal proceedings submitted under 47 U.S.C. § 546(a), that must contain the information required under this article. If neither a renewal applicant nor the city activates in a timely manner, or can activate the renewal process set forth in 47 U.S.C. § 546(a)-(g) (including, for example, if the provisions are repealed), and except as to applications submitted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546(h), the provisions of this article shall apply and a renewal request shall be evaluated using the same criteria as any other request for a franchise. The city council authorized the Mayfield Cable Authority (MCA) or its designee to hold any proceedings required under federal law and to establish procedures governing the conduct of such proceedings including, without limitation, procedures for presentation of evidence. At the conclusion of any proceeding required by federal law, the MCA shall transmit its findings, along with a recommendation, to the city council. If the MCA wishes to delegate the conduct of the proceeding required by 47 U.S.C. § 546(c) to another entity, the approval of the city is required. In any case, however, the final decision to deny or grant renewal shall remain with the city council. 
(7)  Informal applications for renewal. Notwithstanding the above, a cable television operator may submit a proposal for renewal of a franchise pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546(h). Such a proposal may be submitted at any time and the city may, after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny such proposal at any time for any reason (including after proceedings have been commenced in accordance with 47 U.S.C. §546(a)). 
(8)  Acceptance fee. The grant of an initial franchise or a renewed franchise may be subject to a franchise acceptance fee in an amount not to exceed the city's out-of-pocket costs in considering the application, less the amount of the filing fee. Within 30 calendar days of the date the resolution approving the franchise agreement, the city must notify the approved applicant of the amount of any franchise acceptance fee and its method of calculation. If the franchise acceptance fee is not paid within 60 calendar days of the date of the council resolution approving the franchise agreement, the grant will be null and void. Prior to the franchise becoming effective, the approved applicant must demonstrate compliance with the surety, insurance and similar provisions of the franchise agreement. 
(9)  Application for modification of a franchise. An application for modification of a franchise shall include, at minimum, the following information: 
a.  The specific modification requested; 
b.  The justification for the requested modification, including the impact of the requested modification on subscribers and others, and the financial impact on the applicant if the modification is approved or disapproved, demonstrated through, inter alia, submission of pro forma financial statements; 
c.  A statement indicating whether the modification is sought pursuant to Section 625 of the Cable Act 47 U.S.C. § 545, and, if so, a demonstration that the requested modification meets the standards set forth in 47 U.S.C. § 545; 
d.  Any other information that the applicant believes is necessary for the city to make an informed determination on the application for modification; and 
e.  An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or the applicant's authorized officer certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and certifying that the application is consistent with the requirements of applicable law. 
(10)  [Request for modification.] A request for modification submitted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 545 shall be considered in accordance with the requirements of that section. 
(11)  Public hearings. An applicant shall be notified of any public hearings held in connection with the evaluation of its application and shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard. In addition, prior to the issuance of a franchise, the city shall provide for the holding of a public hearing within the proposed franchise area, following notice to the public, at which each applicant and its application shall be examined and the public and all interested parties afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard. 
(e)  Purchase or transfer of a cable system by the city. 
(1)  [Franchise or a license expires.] If a franchise or a license granted under this article expires, or a licensee no longer uses its cable television system to provide service, the city may acquire ownership of or effect a transfer of the cable television system. 
(2)  Purchase option on denial of renewal. At the expiration of the term for which any franchise or license is granted, if renewal is denied, the city at its election shall have the right to purchase the cable television system or any part of it upon the payment to the franchisee or licensee of a sum equal to the fair market value of the system or the part taken (based on system value as a going concern) but with no value allocated to the franchise or license itself. 
(3)  Purchase option on other termination of the franchise or license. In the event of revocation or termination of the franchise or license, except in the circumstances described in paragraph 14-83(d)(2), the city as its election shall have the right to purchase all or any part of the cable television system upon payment to the franchisee or licensee of a sum equal to an equitable price for the system or the part taken, with no value allocated to the franchise or license itself. 
(4)  Exercise of the purchase option. Upon exercise of the purchase option by the city and its service of an official notice of such action upon the franchisee or licensee, the franchisee or licensee shall immediately transfer to the city possession and title to all of the purchased facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable television system, free of all liens and encumbrances; and the franchisee or licensee shall execute such warranty deeds or other instruments of conveyance to the city as shall be reasonably necessary for this purpose. Each contract entered into by a franchisee or licensee with reference to its system or operations under the franchise or license shall be subject to the exercise of this option by the city. 
(5)  City rights in the event of abandonment. Notwithstanding the above, if a cable television system or any part of a cable television system is abandoned by a franchisee or licensee during the franchise or license term, or if the franchisee fails to operate its system in accordance with this article during any transition period, or the franchisee or licensee otherwise terminates its franchise or license upon reasonable notice of at least 30 days and an opportunity to be heard, the ownership of the cable television system or the abandoned portions thereof in public rights-of-way shall revert to the city and the city may sell, assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the system, or the city council as its option may use or dispose of the system as it sees fit. The franchisee or licensee shall execute such quit claim deeds and other documents as may be necessary to transfer the system or affected part thereof free and clear of liens and encumbrances to the city. Each contract entered into by a franchisee or licensee with reference to its system or operations under the franchise or license shall be subject to the exercise of this right. 
(6)  No effect on the powers of eminent domain. Nothing herein in any respect affects the city's powers of eminent domain or its right to exercise these powers with respect to a cable television system. 
(f)  Construction provisions. 
(1)  System construction schedule. Every franchise or license shall specify the construction schedule that will apply to any required construction, upgrade, or rebuild of the cable television system. The schedule shall provide for prompt completion of the project, considering the amount and type of construction required. 
(2)  Use of franchisee or licensee facilities. The city shall have the right to install and maintain, free of charge upon any poles or in any conduit owned by a franchisee or licensee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable television system operations of the franchisee or licensee; provided that, if a franchisee is authorized to erect poles or place conduit, and the city uses a franchisee's conduit or poles to install a cable television system that competes with that franchisee in the provision of cable television service to residential subscribers, the franchise may provide that the franchisee may charge the city a fair market rate pursuant to that franchise for the use of the poles or conduit to provide residential cable television service. A franchisee or licensee shall notify the city when it enters into an agreement for the use of its poles and conduits. Copies of agreements for use of a franchisee's or licensee's conduits or poles in the public rights-of-way or on other public property shall be available for review upon the city's request. 
(3)  Provision of service/quality of service. In addition to satisfying such requirements as may be established in a franchise, every cable television operator holding a franchise shall operate its cable television system subject to the following conditions, except as prohibited by federal law: 
a.  It is the policy of the city to ensure that every franchisee provides service in the franchise area upon request to any person or any government building. Each franchisee shall extend service upon request within its franchise area, provided that a franchise may permit a franchisee to require a potential subscriber to contribute a fair share of the capital costs of installation or extension as a condition of extension or installation in cases where such extension or installation may be unduly expensive. Service must be provided within the time limits specified in this article. 
b.  Except as a franchise otherwise provides, a franchisee must extend service to any person or to any government building in the franchise area which requests it (A) within seven days of the request, where service can be provided by activating or installing a drop; (B) within 90 days of the request where an extension of one-half mile or less is required; or (C) within six months where an extension of one-half mile or more is required. Provided that, in cases where a franchise permits a franchisee to require a potential subscriber to bear a share of extension or installation costs, and the franchisee requires the potential subscriber to bear such costs, the time for extension shall be measured from the date the subscriber agrees to bear such costs or, if a franchisee requires prepayment of all or a portion of the estimated costs, from the date the prepayment is made. A franchisee that requires a potential subscriber to bear a portion of installation or extension costs must prepare a written estimate of extension costs within seven days of a request for an installation or extension that would be subject to cost-sharing. 
c.  A franchisee's cable television system within the city shall meet the technical standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 76.601, et seq., and any other applicable technical standards. 
d.  A franchisee shall perform all tests necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the franchise and other technical and performance standards established by applicable law. Unless a franchise or applicable law provides otherwise, all tests shall be conducted in accordance with federal rules and in accordance with the most recent edition of the National Cable Television Association's Recommended Practices for Measurements on Cable Television Systems or such other manual as may be directed under FCC regulations. A written report of any test results shall be filed with the city within seven days of a request by the city. If a location fails to meet technical or performance specifications; the franchisee, without requirement of additional notice or request from city, shall promptly take corrective action, and retest the locations. 
e.  Upon request of the city, every cable television operator shall be required to interconnect with every other cable television system and cable television operator within the city, on fair and reasonable terms, for purposes of providing PEG and institutional network services. 
(4)  System maintenance. Scheduled maintenance shall be performed by a franchised cable television operator so as to minimize the effect of any interruption of cable television service. 
(5)  Continuity of service. Each franchisee shall, during the term of the franchise, ensure that subscribers are able to receive continuous service. In the event the franchise is revoked or terminated, the franchisee may be required to continue to provide service for a reasonable period to assure an orderly transition of service from the franchisee to another entity. A franchise may establish more particular requirements under which these obligations will be satisfied. 
(g)  Operation and reporting provisions. 
(1)  Communication with regulatory agencies. If requested by the city, a franchisee shall file with the city all reports required by the FCC including, without limitation, any proof of performance tests and results, equal employment opportunity ("EEO") reports, and all petitions, applications, and communications of all types directly related to the cable television system, or a group of cable television systems of which the franchisee's cable television system is a part submitted or received by the franchisee, an affiliate, or any other person on the behalf of the franchisee, either to or from the FCC, the securities and exchange commission, or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over any matter affecting the operation of the franchisee's cable television system; provided that nothing herein requires the franchisee to produce regulatory or court filings that are treated by the agency or court as confidential. Nothing in this section 14-85(g)(1) affects any rights the city may have to obtain books and records under this article. 
(2)  Reports. 
a.  If the city should request it, a franchisee shall submit a report to the city containing the following information: 
1.  The number of service calls (calls requiring a truck roll) received by type during the prior quarter, and the percentage of service calls compared to the subscriber base by type of complaint; and

c.  Records of service calls for repairs and maintenance indicating the date and time service was requested, the date of acknowledgment and date and time (or two-hour time block) service was scheduled (if it was scheduled) and the date and time (or two-hour time block) service was provided, and (if different) the date and time the problem was solved, and 
d.  Records of installation/reconnection and requests for service extension, indicating the date of request, the date of acknowledgment, and the date and time service was extended. 
(h)  Rate regulation and consumer protection. 
(1)  Scope and applicability. The city reserves all rights to implement and impose regulation of a franchisee's rates and charges, to the maximum extent permitted by law, and may do so by amendment to this article, by separate ordinance, by amendment to a franchise, or in any other lawful manner. 
(2)  Rate regulation procedures. Rate regulation shall be performed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the FCC. The city or the Mayfield Cable Authority may take any required steps to file complaints, toll rates, issue accounting orders or take any other steps required to comply with FCC regulations. The city council shall be responsible for issuing final rate orders that establish rates or order refunds. No rate may be put into effect without the prior review and approval of the city, except as federal law may otherwise require. 
(3)  Rate discrimination prohibited. Except to the extent the city may not enforce such a requirement, a franchisee is prohibited from discriminating in its rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers; provided however, that a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts are offered on a non-discriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the franchise area; provided further that a franchisee may offer discounts for the elderly, the disabled, or the economically disadvantaged and such other discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide under federal law, if such discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. A franchisee shall comply at all times with all applicable federal, state, and city laws, and all executive and administrative orders relating to non-discrimination. 
(4)  [Franchisee must satisfy standards.] Franchisee must satisfy cable television customer service standards or consumer protection standards set out in section 14-88 of this article and its franchise agreement.

(2)  Amount of license fee. Subject to the exceptions in this article, a licensee shall pay to the city a license fee that recovers an amount equivalent to the fair market value of the property used in the city. No license may be issued without an enforceable fee. The City of Mayfield reserves the right to establish a license fee at a later date. A license fee assessment shall be in the form of an amendment to this article. 
(j)  Transfers. 
(1)  City. No transfer shall occur without prior written notice to and approval of the city council. A transfer without the prior written approval of the city shall be considered to impair the city's assurance of due performance. The granting of approval for a transfer in one instance shall not render unnecessary approval of any subsequent transfer.

Such an application shall provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical, and other qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber service.

For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a transfer, the city or its agents may inquire into all qualifications of the prospective transferee and such other matters as the city may deem necessary to determine whether the transfer is in the public interest and should be approved, denied, or conditioned as provided under section 14-85(j)(3). The franchisee or licensee and any prospective transferees shall assist the city in any such inquiry, and if they fail to do so, the request for a transfer may be denied. 
(3)  Determination by city. In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or grant subject to conditions, an application for a transfer of a franchise, the city shall consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable television system; any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber services; whether the incumbent cable television operator is in compliance with its franchise, and this article and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; whether the transferee owns or controls any other cable television system in the city, and whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable television service in the city; and whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would adversely affect subscribers, the public, or the city's interest under this article, the franchise, or other applicable law. 
(4)  Transferee's agreement. No application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this article and the franchise or license, and that it will assume the obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and omissions, known and unknown, of the previous franchisee or licensee under this article and the franchise or license, for all purposes including renewal, unless the city, in its sole discretion, expressly waives this requirement in whole or in part. 
(5)  Approval does not constitute waiver. Approval by the city of a transfer of a franchise or license does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the provisions of the franchise or license agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. 
(6)  Exception for intra-company transfers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchise or license may provide that transfers to affiliates of a franchisee or licensee shall be excepted from the requirements of this article where (1) the affiliate is wholly-owned and managed by an entity that will guarantee the performance under a franchise or license; and (2) the transferee affiliate: 
a.  Notifies the city of the transfer at least 60 days before it occurs and, at that time provides the agreements and warranties, describes the nature of the transfer, and submits complete information describing who will have direct and indirect ownership and control of the cable television system after the transfer; 
b.  Warrants that it has read, accepts and agrees to be bound by each and every term of the franchise and related amendments, regulations, ordinances and resolutions then in effect, 
c.  Agrees to assume all responsibility for all liabilities, acts and omissions, known and unknown, of its predecessor for all purposes, including renewal; 
d.  Agrees that the transfer shall not permit it to take any position or exercise any right which could not have been exercised by its predecessor; 
e.  Warrants that the transfer will not substantially increase the financial burdens upon or substantially diminish the financial resources available to the franchisee or licensee (the warranty to be based on comparing the burdens upon and resources that will be available to the transferee compared to its predecessors). 
f.  Warrants that the transfer will not in any way adversely affect the city or subscribers (including by increasing rates); 
g.  Notifies the city, in writing, that the transfer is complete within five business days of the date the transfer is completed; and 
h.  Agrees that the transfer in no way affects any evaluation of its legal, financial or technical qualifications that may occur under the franchise or license or applicable law after the transfer and does not directly or indirectly authorize any additional transfers. 
(k)  Connections to cable system; use of antennae. 
(1)  Subscriber right to attach. To the extent consistent with federal law, subscribers shall also have the right to use their own control devices and convertor; and other similar equipment except in those circumstances where electronic or physical harm would be caused by the attachment or operations of such devices or such devices may be used to assist or are intended or designed to assist in the unauthorized receipt of service. 
(2)  Removal of existing antennae. A franchisee shall not, as a condition of providing service, require a subscriber or potential subscriber to remove any existing antenna, or to disconnect an antenna except at the express direction of the subscriber or potential subscriber, provided that such antenna is connected with an appropriate device and complies with applicable law 
(Ord. No. 1-99, § 5, 7-10-00) 
Sec. 14-86. - Enforcement generally. 
    The franchisee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply promptly with any of the provisions of the franchise by any failure of the city to enforce prompt compliance. 
(Ord. No. 1-99, § 6, 7-10-00) 
Sec. 14-87. - Security fund. 
(a)  Prior to a franchise or franchise renewal becoming effective, the franchisee shall post with the city a cash security deposit in an amount as determined by the city. The deposit is to be used as a security fund to ensure the faithful performance of all provisions of law and the franchise agreement and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of the city and the payment by the franchise of any fees, claims, liquidated damages, liens or taxes due the city which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system. 
(b)  The city shall place the security deposit in an interest bearing account. The interest will accrue to the benefit of the franchisee, but may not be withdrawn during the franchise term and any renewal thereof. All interest will be added to and become a part of the original security fund during the term of the franchise and any renewal thereof. 
(c)  Within 30 days after notice to it that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the franchisee shall pay to or deposit with the city funds sufficient to restore such security fund. 
(d)  If the franchisee fails to pay the city any compensation within the time fixed herein or fails, after 30 days' notice, to pay the city any fees or taxes due or fails to pay or repay to the city within 30 days, any damages, costs or expenses which the city shall be compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of a franchisee in connection with the franchise agreement or fails, after 30 days' notice of such failure by the city, to comply with any provisions of the franchise agreement which the city reasonably determines can be remedied by an expenditure of the security, the city may immediately withdraw the amount due, with interest and any penalties, from the security fund. Upon such withdrawal, the city shall notify the franchisee of the amount and date thereof. Within 30 days of such withdrawal, the franchisee shall replenish the fund in the amount of the withdrawal. 
(e)  The security fund deposited pursuant to this section shall become the property of the city in the event the franchise agreement is canceled by reason of the default of the franchisee. The franchisee, however, shall be entitled to the return of such security fund, or portion thereof, as remains at the expiration of the term of the franchise agreement and any renewal thereof, provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part of the franchisee. Interest earned by the investment of the security fund will accrue to the franchisee. 
(f)  The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city whether reserved by this article or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the city may have. 
(g)  The franchise agreement may contain a schedule of liquidated damages, and the city may obtain reimbursement from the security fund for any unpaid liquidated damages that may exist. 
(Ord. No. 1-99, § 7, 7-10-00) 
Sec. 14-88. - Cable customer service standards for franchised cable television systems.

(3)  Provide at a non-discriminatory cost, a special closed captioned converter for the hearing-impaired; 
(4)  Provide at a non-discriminatory cost, a remote control device and/or converter for wheelchair subscribers or subscribers with a permanent medical or physical ambulatory impairment; and 
(5)  Where applicable, provide modified or special instructions for use of equipment by subscribers who have physical impairments. 
(b)  Restoration of a subscriber's property. If at any time a franchisee disturbs the yard, residence, or other real or personal property, it shall be returned, replaced, and/or restored to a condition that is comparable to its condition before the disturbance. To the extent such corrective action cannot be accomplished, the franchisee shall reimburse a subscriber, or private property owner, for any damage caused by the franchisee, subcontractor, or independent contractor, in connection with the disturbance of a subscriber's or other person's property. 
(c)  Emergency alert; standby power. 
(1)  In order that subscribers may be alerted in the event of an impending, imminent or actual, natural, manmade, or disaster emergency, the franchisee shall insure that the cable television system providing cable television service to all, or part, of the city is designed so as to be in compliance with applicable federal requirements. Moreover, the franchisee shall, in the case of a disaster emergency, make the entire cable television system available without charge to the city or to any governmental or civil defense agency that the city shall designate. 
(2)  In addition to any other requirements listed in this article, a franchisee shall: 
a.  Cooperate with the city on the use and operation of the emergency alert override system; and 
b.  Develop a plan (with the city's concurrence) on methods to provide continuity of cable television service, and response to service calls in the event of a natural, manmade, or disaster emergency. 
c.  As one method of providing continuity of services in the event of a natural, manmade, or disaster emergency, a franchisee shall, unless exempted by the city, maintain equipment capable of providing automatic standby power for a minimum of two hours strategically placed in locations along the cable television system trunkline in order to minimize the number of subscribers affected by interruption of service. 
(d)  Telephone and office availability. 
(1)  Each franchisee shall maintain an office at a location, convenient to subscribers, and shall establish a telephone system adequate to respond to subscriber inquiries. Every franchisee must at least satisfy the minimum requirements established by the Federal Communications Commission. Each franchisee shall maintain an office and telephone system in accordance with a written plan submitted by the franchisee and approved by the Mayfield Cable Authority (MCA). Failure on the part of any franchisee to have and conform to an approved plan shall constitute a substantial violation of its franchise. A franchisee may propose new plans as often an practical, however, the MCA reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted. 
Each franchisee shall perform service calls, installations, and disconnects at least ten hours per day, Monday through Saturday (except legal holidays), provided that a franchisee shall respond to system outages 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
(e)  Scheduling work. 
(1)  All appointments for service, installation, or disconnection shall be specified by date. Each franchisee shall specify a specific time at which the work shall be done, or offer a choice of time blocks, which shall not exceed two hours in length. A franchisee may also, upon request, schedule service installation calls outside normal business hours, for the express convenience of the customer. If at any time an installer or technician is running late for an appointment and believes it will not be able to make a scheduled appointment time, an attempt to contact the customer will be made prior to the time of appointment, and the appointment rescheduled at a time convenient to the customer, if rescheduling is necessary. It is the operator's burden to prove it met the appointment. 
(2)  The franchisee shall offer and fully describe to subscribers who have experienced a missed appointment (where the missed appointment was not the subscriber's fault) that the subscriber may choose between the following options: installation or service call free of charge or one month of the most widely subscribed to service tier free of charge. 
(3)  With regard to disabled or handicapped customers, upon subscriber request, each franchisee shall arrange for pickup and/or replacement of converters or other franchisee equipment at the subscriber's address or by a satisfactory equivalent (such as the provision of a postage-prepaid mailer). 
(4)  Under normal operating conditions, requests for service, repair, and maintenance must be acknowledged by a trained customer service representative within 24 hours, or prior to the end of the next business day, whichever is earlier. A franchisee shall respond to all other inquiries (including billing inquiries) within five business days of the inquiry or complaint. Under normal operating conditions, work on outages or service interruptions must begin immediately. Repairs and maintenance for outages or interruptions must be completed as soon as possible and within four hours after the outage or interruption becomes known to the franchisee where the franchisee has adequate access to facilities to which it must have access in order to remedy the problem. Under normal operating conditions, work to correct all other service problems must be begun by the next business day after notification of the service problem, and must be completed within five business days from the date of the initial request. When normal operating conditions do not exist, a franchisee shall complete the work in the shortest time possible. The failure of the franchisee to hire sufficient staff or to properly train its staff shall not justify the failure of the franchisee to comply with this provision. 
(5)  A franchisee shall not cancel a service or installation appointment with a customer after the close of business on the business day preceding the scheduled appointment. 
(6)  Under normal operating conditions, the standards of paragraphs 14-88(e)(1) and 14-88(e)(4) of this section shall be met at least 95 percent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis. 
Requests for additional outlets, service upgrades or other connections (e.g., DMX, VCR, A/B switch) separate from the initial installation will be performed within seven business days after an order has been placed. 
(f)  Notice to subscribers. 
(1)  At the time service is installed, a franchisee shall provide each subscriber with clear and accurate written information on the procedure for placing a service call, filing a complaint, or requesting an adjustment (including when a subscriber is entitled to refunds for outages and how to obtain them); showing the telephone number of the city office responsible for administering the franchise; the availability of parental control devices; the delinquent subscriber disconnect and reconnect policies and any other policies in connection with its subscribers. A franchisee shall also provide subscribers with a schedule of rates and charges, channel positions and services provided, as well as a copy of the service contract. The same information shall be provided to the subscriber annually thereafter, except another copy of the service contract need not be provided. Copies of the notices provided to the subscribers shall be provided to the city. Except as applicable federal, state and local rate regulations may provide to the contrary, a franchisee shall provide the Mayfield Cable Authority at least 60 days' notice and all subscribers at least 30 days' notice of any significant changes in the information required to be provided in this article. 
a.  Such notice shall be made in writing. 
(2)  Each franchisee shall take appropriate steps to ensure that all written franchisee promotional materials, announcements, and advertising of residential cable television to subscribers and the general public, where price information is listed in any manner, clearly and accurately discloses price terms. In the case of telephone orders, a franchisee shall take appropriate steps to ensure that price terms are clearly and accurately disclosed to potential customers in advance of taking the order. 
(3)  Each franchisee shall maintain a file open for public inspection containing all notices provided to subscribers under these customer service standards, as well as all promotional offers made to subscribers. The notices and offers shall be kept in the file for at least one year from the date of such notice or promotional offer. 
(g)  Interruptions of service. A franchisee shall provide 48 hours' prior notice to subscribers and the city before interrupting service for planned maintenance or construction; provided, however, that planned maintenance that does not require more than two hours interruption of service, and that occurs between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m., shall not require such notice to subscribers, however, notice to the city must be given no less than 24 hours prior to the anticipated service interruption. 
(h)  Billing. 
(1)  A franchisee's first billing statement after a new installation or service charge shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security deposit. 
(2)  A franchisee's billing statement must be clear, concise and understandable, must itemize each category of service and equipment provided to the subscriber, and must state clearly the charge therefor. 
(3)  A franchisee's billing statement must show a specific payment due date not earlier than the later of: (1) 15 days after the date the statement is mailed; or (2) the 15th day of the 30-day period in which the service being billed is rendered. A late fee or administrative fee may not be imposed for payments before the end of the period for which the payment is rendered. Subscribers shall not be charged a late fee or otherwise penalized for any failure by a franchisee, including failure to timely or correctly bill the subscriber, or failure to property credit the subscriber for a payment timely made. 
(4)  A franchisee's bill must permit a subscriber to remit payment by mail or in person at the franchisee's local office. 
(5)  The account of any subscriber shall be credited a prorated share of the monthly charge for the service upon subscriber request, if a subscriber is without service or if service is substantially impaired for any reason for a period exceeding four hours during any 24-hour period; or automatically, if the loss of service or impairment is for 24 hours or longer, except where it can be documented that a subscriber will obtain a refund for a loss of service or impairment which was caused by the subscriber or by subscriber-owned equipment (not including, for purposes of this section, in-home wiring installed by the franchisee). 
(6)  A franchisee shall respond to all written billing complaints from subscribers within 30 days. 
(7)  Refunds to subscribers shall be issued no later than (A) the earlier of the subscriber's next billing cycle following resolution of the refund request, or 30 days; or (B) within 30 days of the date of return of all equipment to franchisee, if cable television service has been terminated. 
(8)  Credits for cable television service shall be issued no later than the subscriber's next billing cycle after the determination that the credit is warranted. 
(i)  Disconnection/downgrades. 
(1)  A subscriber may terminate service at any time. 
(2)  A franchisee shall promptly disconnect from the franchisee's cable television system or downgrade any subscriber who so requests. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination or downgrade of cable may be required of subscribers by any franchisee. Charges for any voluntary disconnection, and any downgrade charges shall conform to applicable law. 
(3)  Any security deposit and/or other funds due a subscriber that disconnects or downgrades service shall be returned to the subscriber within 30 days or in the next billing cycle, whichever is later, from the date the disconnection or the downgrade was requested, except in cases where the subscriber does not permit the franchisee to recover its equipment in which case the amounts owed shall be paid to subscribers within 30 days of the date the equipment was recovered, or in the next billing cycle, whichever is later. 
(4)  A franchisee may not disconnect a subscriber's cable television service for nonpayment unless: 
a.  The subscriber is delinquent in payment for cable television service; 
b.  A written notice of impending disconnection, postage prepaid, has been sent to the subscriber at least 20 days' prior to the date on which service may be disconnected, at the premises where the subscriber requests billing, which notice must state the date by which disconnection may occur, and the amount the subscriber must pay to avoid disconnection; 
c.  The subscriber has failed to pay the amounts owed to avoid disconnection by the date of disconnection; and 
d.  No pending inquiry exists regarding the bill to which franchisee has not responded in writing. Payment is not delinquent until the 15th day of the month in which the service being billed for is rendered; the notice required in this article may not be sent to a subscriber prior to the delinquency date. If the subscriber pays all amounts due, including late charges, before the date scheduled for disconnection, the franchisee shall not disconnect service. After lawful disconnection (except in cases where disconnection is also subject to the requirements in this article), upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, the franchisee shall promptly reinstate service. 
(5)  A franchisee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if (A) the subscriber is damaging, destroying, or unlawfully tampering with or has damaged or destroyed or unlawfully tampered with the franchisee's cable television system; (B) the subscriber is not authorized to receive a service, and is facilitating, aiding or abetting the unauthorized receipt of service by others; or (C) subscriber-installed or attached equipment is resulting in signal leakage which is in violation of FCC rules. After disconnection, the franchisee shall restore service after the subscriber provides adequate assurance that it has ceased the practices that led to disconnection, and has paid all proper fees and charges, including any reconnect fees and all amounts owed to the franchisee for damage to its cable television system or equipment. However, a reconnect fee may not be levied where the subscriber was disconnected for signal leakage, unless the subscriber was notified of the leakage problem in writing, and the subscriber has failed to correct the leakage within three business days after receiving written notice of the problem from the franchise. 
(j)  Deposits. A franchisee may require a reasonable, non-discriminatory deposit on equipment provided to subscribers. Deposits shall be placed in an interest-bearing account, and the franchisee shall return the deposit plus interest earned to the date the deposit is returned to the subscriber, less any amount the franchisee can demonstrate should be deducted for damage to such equipment. 
(k)  Parental control option. Without limiting a franchisee's obligations under federal law, a franchisee must provide parental control devices for sale or lease at a reasonable charge to all subscribers who request them that enable the subscriber to block the video and audio portion of any channel or channels of programming. 
(l)  Voluntary disconnections. 
(1)  At any time, a subscriber may request that a particular service tier, service cluster, pay channel, premium channel, informational service, or the entire cable television service be discontinued. 
(2)  From the date that such a subscriber makes such a request, then the franchisee shall have 72 hours or three service days, whichever is longer, to disconnect the service tier, service cluster, pay channel, premium channel, informational service, or entire cable television service. In the event that a franchisee does not disconnect service within 72 hours, a subscriber's obligation to pay for such service shall cease. 
(3)  For a service tier, service cluster, premium channel, or informational service which is voluntarily disconnected, a subscriber shall pay a pro rata share of the monthly rate for such service or channel. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the above provisions, and in order to reduce subscriber abuse of this voluntary disconnection policy, a subscriber shall be charged a minimum of one month's full rate for any one service (basic, premium, informational, cluster, or tier) which is disconnected at least three times in a span of 180 days. 
(5)  Unless damage has occurred, no charge may be passed onto a subscriber for the actual disconnection of a channel or service, if the disconnection involves a single residence with fewer than five outlets. 
(6)  Any refund due a subscriber after disconnection (both for non-payment and voluntary) shall be made within 30 days after such disconnection. 
(m)  Substandard picture quality; remedies. 
(1)  A franchisee must meet all FCC technical standards that relate to picture and service quality and any such standards contained in the franchise agreement. 
(2)  If the franchisee does not correct a substandard picture or audio quality following an initial service call to the subscriber's residence, then subsequent service calls to correct the problem shall be at no charge. 
(3)  A customer shall be responsible for any damage caused to equipment rented or leased from a franchisee. 
(n)  Continuity of service. The city declares that as part of its right to establish cable television customer service guidelines, it has the duty to ensure continuity of cable television service for all subscribers. The city may take appropriate measures in order to insure that no portion of the city is threatened or faced with a disruption, interruption, or discontinuance of cable television service due to the actions of the franchisee. Whenever any situation occurs which threatens the continuity of cable television service, then the city may direct the franchisee to take certain action, reasonably within its power, to insure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted cable television service. 
(o)  Resolution of complaints/inquiries. 
(1)  A franchisee is required to develop a comprehensive complaint/inquiry resolution policy that is consistent with the policies outlined in these customer service practices. Before implementing the complaint/inquiry resolution policy, the city shall review the policy together with any amendments that might be added from time to time. 
(2)  A franchisee's resolution policy shall be reduced to writing, and such policy shall be available upon request to any person. 
(p)  Fair employment and contracting practices. A franchisee shall comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to fair employment and contracting practices. 
(q)  Construction. This article shall be construed in light of applicable Commonwealth of Kentucky and federal laws and regulations governing open video systems and cable practices in general, and open video systems and cable television consumer practices in particular. 
(r)  Effect on new and existing franchisees and licensees. 
(1)  For persons awarded a cable television or open video franchise or license after the effective date of this article, this article shall have full effect, and be enforceable in its entirety. 
(2)  For a franchisee or licensee existing on the date that this article becomes effective, then the article shall have no effect during the present franchise term to the extent it would modify contractual obligations under a pre-existing franchise or license agreement. However, concurrent with the franchisee's or licensee's executing a renewed franchise agreement, then the article shall have full effect, and be enforceable in its entirety. 
(s)  Delegation of power. Consistent with Kentucky law, the council may delegate its powers and responsibilities (except its ultimate franchising authority) hereunder with respect to cable television or open video systems to the Mayfield Cable Authority, or other duly authorized representative of the city, including the mayor, or city clerk. All filings with the city to be made by a franchisee under this article or a franchise agreement shall be made with the city clerk unless the franchisee is advised otherwise. 
(Ord. No. 1-99, § 8, 7-10-00) 
Sec. 14-89. - Relation to other standards. 
    Nothing in these standards shall be read to relieve a cable television operator of an obligation to comply with federal, state or local consumer protection laws, to relieve an operator of an obligation to comply with stricter cable television customer service standards, or to foreclose remedies that may be available to subscribers under applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 1-99, § 9, 7-10-00) 
Sec. 14-90. - Miscellaneous. 
(a)  Captions. The captions to sections throughout this article are intended solely to facilitate reading and reference to the sections and provisions of this article. Such captions shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this article.

Unless otherwise indicated, when the performance or doing of any act, duty, matter, or payment is required under this article or any franchise or license and a period of time or duration for the fulfillment of doing thereof is prescribed and is fixed herein, the time shall be computed so as to exclude the first and include the last day of the prescribed or fixed period of duration time. 
(c)  Severability. If any term, condition, or provision of this article shall to any extent, be held to be invalid or unenforceable by a valid order of any court or regulatory agency, the remainder hereof shall be valid in all other respects and continue to be effective. In the event of a subsequent change in applicable law, so that the provision which had been held invalid is no longer invalid, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect without any further action by the city and shall thereafter be binding on the franchisee by the city.

(a)  Intent. Within the districts and sections established by this ordinance, or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, uses of land, and characteristics of development which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which otherwise would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendments. 
It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but to discourage their continuation. Such nonconformities are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with otherwise lawful development in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other nonconformities prohibited elsewhere in the same district.

To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved. In no event shall the time of such construction exceed a period of one year except for a demonstrated cause approved by city council. 
(c)  Nonconforming lots of record. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory building may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.

Variance of area, width, or yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the board of adjustment. 
If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this ordinance, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this ordinance, and no said parcel shall be used which does not meet lot width and area requirements established by this ordinance nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the requirements of this ordinance. 
(d)  Nonconforming uses of land.

b.  When the characteristic equipment and the furnishings of the nonconforming use have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced by similar equipment within six consecutive months, unless other facts show intention to resume the nonconforming use, or when it has been replaced by a conforming use, or where the use is discontinued or abandoned six consecutive months or for 18 months during any three-year period. 
c.  Discontinuance or abandonment shall be determined by reviewing telephone, gas, electric, water, sewer, cable, and mail services, statements from neighbors or others to include code enforcement officers who have knowledge of such vacancies, and by the upkeep and activity at the property in question. 
(8)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structures are located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(9)  Where nonconforming status applies to a use and structure in combination, the removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming use status. Destruction for the purpose of this ordinance is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the floor area at time of destruction.

(3)  In any case where a conditional use permit has been exercised within the time limit set by the board, or within one year if no specific time limit has been set, such conditional use permit shall not revert to its original designation unless there has been a public hearing. "Exercised," as set forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts for the construction of the main building or other improvements has been let, or in the absence of contracts that the main building or other improvement is under construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial investment shall be under contract, in development, or completed. When construction is not a part of the use, exercised shall mean that the use is in operation in compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit. 
(4)  The administrative officer shall review all conditional use permits, except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the landowner is complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the conditional use permit. If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions listed on the conditional use permit, the administrative officer shall state specifically the manner in which the landowner is not complying with the conditions on the conditional use permit, and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time that it is furnished to the chairman of the board. If the board finds that the facts alleged in the report of the administrative officer are true and that the landowner has taken no steps to comply with them between the date of the report and the date of the hearing, the board may authorize the administrative officer to revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity of the land which the conditional use permit authorizes. 
(5)  Once the board has completed a conditional use permit and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be completely and permanently satisfied, the administrative officer upon request of the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions have been satisfied, and enter the facts which indicate that the conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the copy of the conditional use permit which is on file with the county clerk, as required in Kentucky Revised Statutes, section 100.329. Thereafter said use, if it continues to meet the other requirements of the regulations, will be treated as a permitted use. 
(h)  Dimensional variance: The board shall have the power to hear and decide on applications for dimensional variances where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or unusual shape of a site on the effective date of the zoning ordinance or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or some other extraordinary situation or condition of that site, the literal enforcement of the dimensional requirements (height or width of building or size of yards, but no population density) of the zoning ordinance would deprive the applicant of reasonable capacity to make use of the land in a manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same zone. The board may impose any reasonable conditions or restrictions on any variance it decides to grant. 
(i)  Findings necessary for granting variances: Before any variance is granted, the board must find all of the following, which shall be recorded along with any imposed conditions or restrictions in its minutes and records and issued in written form to the applicant to constitute proof of the dimensional variance: 
(1)  The specific conditions in detail which are unique to the applicant's land and which do not exist on other land in the same zone. 
(2)  The manner in which the strict application of the provisions of the ordinance would deprive the applicant of a reasonable use of the land in the manner equivalent to the use permitted other landowners in the same zone. 
(3)  That the unique conditions and circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the zoning ordinance. 
(4)  Reasons that the variance will preserve, not harm, the public safety and welfare and will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood. 
(j)  Variance cannot contradict zoning ordinance: The board shall not possess the power to grant a variance to permit a use of any land, building, or structure which is not permitted by the zoning ordinance in the zone in question, or to alter density requirements in the zone in question. 
(k)  Dimensional variance runs with land: A dimensional variance applies to the property for which it is granted, and not to the individual who applied for it. A variance also runs with the land and is transferable to any future owner of the land, but it cannot be transferred by the applicant to a different site. 
(l)  Recording of variances and conditional use permits: All variances and conditional use permits approved by the board of adjustment shall be recorded at the expense of the applicant in the office of the county court clerk. 
(m)  Existing nonconforming use, continuance; change: The lawful use of a building or premises, existing at the time of the adoption of the zoning ordinance affecting it, may be continued, although such use does not conform to the provisions of such regulation, except as otherwise provided herein. The board of adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at the time the ordinance, which makes its use nonconforming, was adopted. Nor shall the board permit a change from one nonconforming use to another unless the new nonconforming use is in the same or a more restrictive classification. 
(n)  Administrative review: The board shall have the power to hear and decide cases where it is alleged by an applicant that there is error in any order, requirement, decision, grant, or refusal made by an administrative official in the enforcement of the zoning ordinance. Such appeal shall be taken within 60 days. 
(o)  Procedure for all appeals to board: Appeals to the board may be taken by any persons or entity claiming to be injuriously affected or aggrieved by an official action or decision of any zoning enforcement officer. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the appellant or appellant's agent receives notice of the action appealed from by filing with said officer and with the board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, and giving notice of such appeal to any and all parties of record. Said officer shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken and shall be treated as and be the respondent in such further proceedings. At any hearing by the board any interested person may appear and enter such person's appearance, and all shall be given an opportunity to be heard. 
(p)  Public notice of appeal hearing; appeal to court: 
(1)  The board shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give public notice in accordance with KRS ch. 424, as well as written notice to the appellant and the administrative officer at least one week prior to the hearing, and shall decide it within 60 days. The affected party may appear at the hearing in person or by attorney. 
(2)  Any person or entity claiming to be injured or aggrieved by any final action of the planning commission or board of adjustment may appeal from the action to the circuit court of the county in which the land lies. All appeals shall be taken in the circuit court within 30 days after the action or decision of the planning commission or board of adjustment and all decisions which have not been appealed within 30 days shall become final. After the appeal is taken the procedure shall be governed by the rules of civil procedure. When an appeal has been filed, the clerk of the circuit court shall issue a summons to all parties, including the planning commission in all cases, and shall cause it to be delivered for service as in any other law action.

ARTICLE II. - MAJOR AND MINOR CLASSES OF SUBDIVISIONS ESTABLISHED FOR PROCESSING PURPOSES[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
State Law reference- Contents of subdivision regulations, KRS 100.281. 

Sec. 20. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish different classes of land subdivision on the basis of their importance to the overall development of the community. The classification of land subdivisions will expedite the processing of certain classes of subdivision plan preparation and approval which may vary for the different classes of subdivisions. 
Sec. 21. - Processing classes for subdivisions. 
(a)  Chapter 100, Kentucky Revised Statutes, defines a subdivision as "the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, lease, or building development, or if a new street is involved, any division of a parcel of land; provided that a division of land for agricultural purposes and not involving a new street shall not be deemed a subdivision. The term includes re-subdivision and when appropriate to the context, shall relate to the process of subdivision or to the land subdivided." 
(b)  The statutes further provide that no land shall be subdivided, transferred, or sold, or agreed to be sold until after a plat of such land is prepared and approved in conformance with the requirements established by the planning commission. Metes and bounds descriptions shall not be used for the above purposes to replace the required platting procedures, and no plat shall be accepted for recording by the county clerk until it has been approved in writing by the planning commission. 
(c)  In order to proceed toward establishing such requirements, subdivisions shall be classified as follows: 
(21.10) Major subdivision: Shall be those subdivisions of land which are generally of major significance to the future development of the community, and shall include all subdivisions which do not conform to the definitions established for minor subdivisions. Generally, major subdivisions would be those which create five or more lots for sale or building development for the establishment of residential, commercial, or industrial activities. If the commission determines that a minor subdivision is of significant importance to the development of an area, the subdivision may be treated as a major subdivision. 
(21.11) Minor subdivision: Shall be those subdivisions of land which are generally of secondary planning significance to the community's future development. Such minor subdivisions are described below, and shall conform to the requirements established in Article II or III: 
(21.111) Consolidation minor subdivision: Shall be those subdivisions characterized by the following: 
(21.1111) Adjoining properties: The subdivision shall be solely for the purpose of transferring a portion of a parcel or tract of land to an adjoining property with which it is to be consolidated. Such adjoining property shall have a common boundary with the parcel of land intended for transfer. 
(2.1112) Conformance to community plans: The subdivision shall be in conformance with community development plans, implementation devices, and other applicable regulations or ordinances; including, among other considerations, any necessary dedication for adequate street rights-of-way. 
(21.112) Building site minor subdivision: Shall be those subdivisions characterized by the following: 
(21.1121) Number of divisions: There shall be a maximum of five lots in a building site minor subdivision. 
(21.1122) Access: All lots shall abut for at least 50 feet upon a street dedicated for public use. If a new street is involved, the subdivision shall be considered a major subdivision. 
(21.1123) Conformance to community plans: The subdivision shall be in conformance with community development plans, implementation devices, and other applicable regulations or ordinances; including among other considerations, any necessary dedication for adequate street rights-of-way. 
(21.12) Trailer and/or mobile home parks: Shall be those subdivisions of land upon which two or more occupied mobile homes are placed, either free of charge or for revenue purposes. Such subdivisions shall conform to section 4.0108 of the Mayfield Zoning Ordinance as well as any other community development plans, implementation devices, and other applicable regulations or ordinances. Procedure for trailer and/or mobile home park plat approval is the same as minor subdivisions. 
ARTICLE III. - REQUIREMENTS FOR MINOR SUBDIVISION PLATS 

Sec. 30. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish special requirements to expedite the preparation and processing of minor subdivision plats.

ARTICLE IV. - PROCEDURE FOR SUBMISSION OF MAJOR SUBDIVISION PLATS 

Sec. 40. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish the procedure which shall be followed by the developer and the planning commission in preparing, reviewing, and approving all subdivision plans (except for minor subdivision plats for which different procedures and requirements are established in Article III.) 
Sec. 41. - Pre-application conference. 
(a)  The developer shall arrange a conference with the staff of the planning commission before a preliminary plat is submitted. The purpose of the conference is to afford the developer an opportunity to avail such developer's self of the assistance of the commission and its staff before such developer prepares a preliminary plan and makes formal application for its approval. This procedure will reduce the number of unnecessary and costly changes which are often required when a plat is submitted to review before the staff of the commission has had an opportunity to review it. 
(41.10) Sketch plan: The developer should have a rough sketch plan prepared before the pre-application conference to show the boundaries of the tract, the proposed street and lot arrangement, and other pertinent information. 
(41.11) Office visit: The developer should then visit the commission's office and informally discuss such developer's ideas with the commission's staff. This informal discussion shall not constitute a formal application and will be considered confidential. The developer should also consult with the utility companies and other local agencies at this time. 
(b)  If a developer does not have a sketch plan, but would like to discuss certain general ideas with the commission's staff, such developer should feel free to visit the commission's office and discuss these ideas. 
Sec. 42. - Preliminary plat procedure. 
(a)  All subdivision plats shall receive their first official consideration as preliminary plats. No developer shall proceed with any construction work including grading, before a plat has been given preliminary approval. 
(b)  The following procedures shall be required during the preliminary plat procedure: 
(42.10) Design plans: The developer shall have a registered surveyor, registered engineer, landscape architect, architect or community planner (provided that engineering data is supplied by a registered engineer or surveyor for landscape architects, architects, and community planners) prepare the preliminary plat in conformance with the forest, design, and improvement requirements of these regulations. Utility companies and other concerned city and county agencies should be consulted before the preliminary plat is prepared. 
(42.11) Formal application and submission: A completed application secured from the commission's office and six prints of the preliminary plat (including improvement drawings and other required preliminary plat information) submitted to the commission's staff shall constitute an application for formal action on the preliminary plat. For maximum assurance that a plat will receive commission consideration at a certain meeting, the plat must be submitted at least ten days before such meeting. 
(42.12) Distribution and review of plats: The commission's staff shall make copies of the preliminary plats available to all concerned city and county agencies. The plats will be reviewed and the commission's staff will summarize all recommendations for presentation to the commission. 
(42.13) Planning commission review: No preliminary plat shall be considered for action by the commission until the plats have been reviewed by the commission's staff. After review and recommendation by the staff, the commission will review all recommendations and then decide upon its own recommendation which may include approval of the plat, conditional approval with conditions noted, postponement, or disapproval. 
(42.14) Notification of action: After commission action, the staff shall mark two copies of the plat in conformance with the commission's actions. The staff shall notify the developer of the commission's action and request such developer to pick up such plat. 
(42.141) Approval: Means the developer is authorized to proceed with physical improvements in the proposed subdivision and to proceed with the preparation of the final plat. Lots shall not be sold until a final plat has been approved. Preliminary approval grants a developer a maximum time limit of 12 months during which such developer shall submit a final plat, unless a time extension is granted by the commission. During this 12 month period, no changes shall be made in the approved preliminary plat unless they are for the purpose of correcting obvious errors or omissions. 
(42.142) Conditional approval: Means the developer may proceed as outlined above in section 42.141, but only after corrected preliminary plats have been submitted to the commission's staff. 
(42.143) Postponement: Means action is delayed for definite reasons which shall be noted by the commission. 
(42.144) Disapproval: Means the denial of approval for the submitted plat. Before further action can occur, the developer must revise such developer's plat to conform to the commission's requirements. 
Sec. 43. - Final plat procedure. 
    All subdivision plats shall receive their second and last consideration as final plats. No developer shall sell or agree to sell any lot until after a final plat has been approved. The following procedure shall be required for all final plats. 
(43.10) Design plans: The developer shall have a registered supervisor or engineer prepare a final plat in conformance with the format, design, and improvement requirement of these regulations. The final plat is a legal record of the subdivision as surveyed in the field and must agree with the approved preliminary plan, except that final plans covering a portion of the approved preliminary plat may be submitted. 
(43.11) Time lapse: Unless a time extension has been requested by the developer and granted by the commission, all final plats shall be submitted within 12 months of the approval date of the preliminary plat. If a time period in excess of 12 months elapses, the preliminary plat must be re-submitted and approved before final plat approval can be considered. 
(43.12) Material to be submitted: The following final plat materials must be submitted by the developer. For maximum assurance that a plat will be considered at a certain commission meeting the plat materials must be submitted at least ten days prior to such meeting. 
(43.121) Subdivision plats: Six prints of the plat showing the manner in which the land is proposed to be subdivided and legally recorded shall be presented to the commission's staff. The plats shall be in conformance with specification outlined in Article V. 
(43.122) Bond for physical improvements: The commission shall have no obligation to allow developers to post surety bonds in lieu of completed physical improvements, but it may permit said bond if it so desires. When bonds are permitted the developer shall submit his cost estimates to the commission's staff to cover the full cost of all physical improvements. The developer shall then post a surety bond with the staff, running to the planning commission for and on behalf of the City of Mayfield. A time period of one year will be allowed for construction of improvements. 
(43.13) Distribution and review of plats: The commission's staff shall make copies of the final plat available to all concerned city and county agencies. The plat will be reviewed and the commission's staff will summarize all recommendations for presentation in the commission. 
(43.14) Planning commission review: No final plats shall be considered for action by the commission until they have been reviewed by the staff. After review and recommendations by the staff, the commission will review all recommendations and then decide upon its own recommendation which may include approval of the plat, conditional approval with conditions noted, postponement, or disapproval. 
(43.15) Notification of action: After commission action, the staff shall mark two copies of the plat in conformance with the commission's action. The staff shall notify the developer of the commission's action and request the developer to pick up such developer's plat. 
(43.151) Approval: Means the final plat has been signed by the chairman of the commission and may be recorded. After recording, the developer may sell or agree to sell lots by reference to the approved and recorded final plat. Commission approval shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the city or county of the dedication of any street or other proposed space offered for dedication, since such acceptance is the prerogative of the city and county legislative bodies. 
(43.152) Conditional approval: Means the developer may proceed as outlined above in section 43.151, but only after such developer has met the conditions attached to the approval. 
(43.153) Postponement: Means the commission has deferred action until some future commission meeting in order that certain clarification can be made in regard to the plat. 
(43.154) Disapproval: Means complete denial of the final plat. To request review and action, the developer must revise such developer's plat to conform to commission requirements and re-submit a new set of final plats. 
(43.16) Recording final plat: Within 90 days of the commission's approval, unless a time extension has been granted by the commission previous to the expiration date, a certified copy of the final plat shall be filed for recording in the Graves County Clerk's Office. The commission's action is also voided if the certified plat is altered in any manner (except for commission requirements) between the date of the commission approval and recording. 
(43.17) Release of bond: If a surety performance bond has been permitted by the commission its release shall be approved by the commission after all improvements, in the opinion of the commission's staff, have been satisfactorily completed. 
(43.18) Private engineer's inspection: Before the surety performance bond is released, the developer's engineer must certify that all physical improvements have been completed and are in full conformance with the commission's regulations.

(2)  Storm sewers and inlets. The design storm for the design of storm sewers and inlets shall be the 25-year storm/24-hour duration (TR-55 Method and Rational Method). The duration of the peak rainfall event shall be assumed to be equal to the calculated time of concentration. Storm sewers and inlets shall be checked under 25-year storm/24-hour duration (TR-55 Method and Rational Method) loading conditions for ponding limits. The ponding limit for streets with curb and gutter shall be an eight-foot spread measured from gutter to driving lane. Spread calculations shall be based upon an intensity of four inches per hour. Pipes should be sized based upon the actual time of concentration. The minimum time of concentration should be assumed to be eight minutes. 
(3)  Entrance pipes and cross drains. The design storm for the design of entrance pipes and cross drains shall be the 25-year storm/24-hour duration (TR-55 Method and Rational Method): The duration of the peak rainfall event shall be assumed to be equal to the calculated time of concentration. The minimum time of concentration shall be assumed to be eight minutes. Entrance pipes and cross drains shall be checked for overtopping of roadways and flood damage to affected areas. Situations requiring pipes larger than 36 inches shall be designed using the culvert criteria in subsection (4). 
(4)  Culverts and cross drains. The design storm for the calculation of runoff for culvert design shall be the 25-year storm. The duration of the peak rainfall event shall be assumed to be equal to the calculated time of concentration. The recommended check storm is the 100-year storm. The maximum headwater under 100-year storm conditions should not be allowed to overtop roads or increase the flooding potential in the affected areas. 
(5)  Erosion control. Plans for storm water conveyance systems shall include appropriately designed temporary and permanent erosion-control measures both for the open channel conduits and all disturbed land draining to both open and closed conduits within the system. (Best management practices for construction activities prepared by the Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet and section F [section 97] should be used as design guides for erosion and sediment control). 
(6)  Design certification. Design of all storm water conveyance facilities and storm water quality structures and facilities shall be prepared and stamped by a licensed professional engineer (Kentucky registration required). Design methods shall be in accordance with the Kentucky Department of Highways' Manual of Instructions for Drainage Design, latest edition. Storm water quality control structures and facilities shall be designed, built and maintained to treat, filter, flocculate, infiltrate, screen evapo-transpirate, harvest, and reuse storm water runoff, or otherwise manage the storm water quality for the 80 th percentile precipitation event. Green infrastructure devices may be used as water quality control structures if it meets the design criteria. 
(Ord. No. 8-14, 12-8-14) 
Sec. 94. - Stormwater management facilities design criteria. 
    As a minimum, the following criteria shall be followed when designing a storm water management facility.

(2)  The storm water discharge point onto adjoining property may not be relocated without the permission of the affected adjoining landowner and the city. 
(3)  If the storm water discharge onto adjoining property is of a sheet flow nature before development, the storm water discharge onto adjoining property after development of the property may not be changed to a concentrated discharge point without the written agreement of the affected adjoining landowner. 
(4)  The initial reference conditions for an undeveloped site shall be the conditions that existed on that site as of April, 2003. This date refers to the aerial photography on file at the city planning department and available upon request. 
(5)  When a property to be developed experiences upstream- storm water runoff onto the property the effects of that runoff under current conditions shall be included in the storm water analysis. If the off-site runoff onto the property is not isolated from the detention system, the effects of routing the off-site runoff through the detention facilities shall be included in the analysis (routed through design). 
(6)  Design storm. Storm water management facilities shall be designed to retain the difference in the pre-development and post-development 25-year, 24-hour storm event. 
(7)  Emergency spillways. Emergency spillways shall be designed to pass the 100-year storm. The effect of the 100-year storm must be considered and documented in the design of all storm water management facilities. 
(8)  Design calculations. Design calculations submitted must include, but not be limited to, the following: 
a.  Contributing drainage area, in acres. Indicate if pre-development and post-development areas differ. 
b.  A breakdown of surface type for pre-development and post-development conditions (such as grassed, paved, roofed, and the like).

(Ord. No. 8-14, 12-8-14) 
Sec. 96. - Exemptions. 
    Exemptions from the Storm water management requirement contained herein shall be granted to the following: 
(1)  All existing residentially subdivided property developments excluding sites to be used or developed as a residential planned development project. 
(2)  Residential subdivisions or residential planned development projects where minimum lot size is greater than five acres. 
(3)  Any nonresidential development for which the area paved and under roof is less than 5,000 square feet. 
a.  Construction or substantial improvements to any vehicular use area less than 2,500 sq. ft. (including gravel). 
(4)  Waivers may also be granted if, in other cases, the developer can provide sufficient documentation that the proposed development will not result in an adverse impact either upstream or downstream of the proposed site. Waivers shall be granted solely at the discretion of the city plan review staff, based upon interpretation of the documentation presented by the developer in conjunction with staff knowledge of the relationship of the proposed development to the adjacent property. 
(Ord. No. 8-14, 12-8-14) 
Sec. 97. - Design certification. 
    Design of all storm water management and conveyance facilities, as well as water quality control structures shall be prepared and stamped by a licensed professional engineer (Kentucky registration required). 
(1)  Construction certification. Prior to final approval of the development or issuance of certificate of occupancy, the licensed professional engineer must submit certification that the storm water management and conveyance facilities were constructed in accordance with the approved plan. Final approval shall also provide evidence of the recording of all storm water conveyance and management facilities deed restrictions, easements and rights-of-way. Any request for deviation from the approved plan during construction shall be submitted to the city plan review staff in writing for approval. 
(2)  Ownership, operation and maintenance of detention systems. 
a.  For commercial, industrial and multifamily residential developments, ownership and maintenance responsibilities remain with the property owner/developer. 
b.  For single family residential subdivisions, the city may, at its discretion, accept ownership and maintenance responsibilities; provided, that: 
1.  Construction and certification is in accordance to the approved plan; and 
2.  Appropriate land dedication and easements are provided, including adequate public ingress and egress from the facility to a public street. 
(Ord. No. 8-14, 12-8-14) 
Sec. 98. - Erosion control. 
(a)  Permit required. Prior to any person engaging in a land disturbance activity within the corporate boundaries of the city, they shall obtain a city issued permit for the land disturbance activity. A permit will be issued by the city once a sedimentation and erosion control plan has been submitted and approved. 
(b)  Contents of sedimentation and erosion control plan. Contents of sedimentation and erosion control plan shall include: 
(1)  The size, finished and existing slope, and location of any cut or fills. 
(2)  A general description of the predominant soil types to be disturbed as indicated by the area soil and water conservation district or other reliable sources. 
(3)  The general location and size of the land area to be disturbed and the extent to which the vegetation and topsoil will be removed. 
(4)  The general location, volume and type of soil or other materials to be used for fill in areas other than the roadway. 
(5)  Location and description of existing natural features on the site, such as contours, vegetation, and drainage ways. 
(6)  Measures that will be taken to contain the sedimentation to the subject property, both during and after construction. 
(7)  Measures that will be taken to limit erosion of the subject property both during and after construction. 
(8)  The approximate length of time that specific portions of the proposed development will lie unvegetated, including the approximate date it will be disturbed and the approximate date it will be reseeded or planted. 
(9)  The type of plant material that will be planted, the approximate time frame for planting and the persons who will be responsible for the planting. 
(c)  Review of plan. The city planner shall review the sedimentation and erosion control plan. The plan will be approved and a permit issued if it is found that it complies with the following land disturbance activity standards. 
(1)  Land disturbance activities shall be done in a manner which will minimize soil erosion: 
a.  The extent of the disturbed area and the duration of its exposure shall be kept within reasonable limits. 
b.  Cut and fill operations shall be kept to a minimum. Developments calling for excessive cutting and filling may be refused a permit if it is determined that the land use proposed for the site can be reasonable constructed with less alteration of the natural terrain. 
(2)  Land shall be developed in increments of workable size, which can be completed during a single construction season. Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be coordinated with the sequence of grading, development and construction operations. 
(3)  When feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
(4)  Topsoil shall be saved where practical and reapplied to the site after grading has been finished. 
(5)  Provisions shall be provided which minimize the damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills. 
(6)  Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as possible. 
(7)  Temporary seeding, mulching or other suitable methods of stabilization shall be used to protect exposed areas which have been disturbed longer than 30 days. 
(8)  Water runoff shall be minimized and retained on-site, wherever possible, to facilitate groundwater recharge and reduce erosion. 
(9)  Measures shall be taken to contain as much sedimentation as practical on-site: 
a.  Sedimentation shall be trapped by the use of debris, basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures approved by the city planner until the area has been stabilized. 
b.  All required sedimentation and erosion reduction measures and structures shall be in place prior to any land disturbance. 
c.  Sedimentation shall be kept out of sinkhole throats/ outlets. 
d.  All necessary soil erosion and sedimentation control measures installed shall be adequately maintained by the developer until the land has been completely stabilized as verified by the city planner. 
(d)  Techniques shall be employed to prevent the blowing of dust or sediment from the site. 
(e)  No mud, gravel, debris, etc. shall be allowed to accumulate or collect, or be deposited onto public streets or washed into storm drains. 
(f)  The type of stabilization or revegetation shall be appropriate for slope and soil type of the site. 
(g)  Provisions shall be made for reseeding areas which do not vegetate the first time. 
(h)  Difficult areas, such as ditch lines and other slopes may have to be sodded or stabilized in some other approved manner. 
    The City Planner shall review the plan within 30 days of its receipt and notify the applicant of the action. In the case of a denial, the reasons for the denial shall also be given. An applicant may appeal a denial of a permit to the planning commission. All appeals shall be made in writing within ten days of the denial and the applicant shall be entitled to a hearing before the planning commission within 30 days of the date of appeal. A land disturbance/development permit will be issued on the basis of approved plans. No fee will be charged for the permit. 
    Since land disturbance activities may negatively impact local water quality and particularly sensitive areas, the city planner may additionally require a "storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP)". In addition, the city planner may request a copy of the notice of intent (NOI) that must be filed with the Kentucky Division of Water seven days before construction begins on any project that disturbs more than one acre in the Commonwealth. 
(i)  Exemptions from this permit. The following land disturbance activities are specifically exempt from this article: 
(1)  Land disturbance associated with existing one and two family dwellings. 
(2)  Use of land for home gardening. 
(3)  Agricultural use of land which is used in accordance with a farm conservation plan approved by the local soil conservation service or which has been determined by said service that such use will not cause excessive erosion or sedimentation. 
(4)  Land disturbance activities covered under an approved subdivisions sedimentation and erosion control plan. (NOTE: Often these plans will cover only the land disturbance associated with lot arrangement and street development and not the individual lot development.) 
(5)  Existing unvegetated and eroded areas. 
Within six months of the passing of this article, all existing unvegetated areas within the city shall submit and have approved a sedimentation and erosion control plan and possess a land disturbance permit. Within 18 months of the passage of this article, all areas of the city shall be vegetated or stabilized in accordance with this article. The existing unvegetated areas shall institute measures to keep their sedimentation on-site and out of sinkhole outlet areas while the erosion control and revegetation measures are in progress. 
(Ord. No. 8-14, 12-8-14) 
Sec. 99. - Prohibition of illicit connections. 
    The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm water system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
(Ord. No. 8-14, 12-8-14) 
Sec. 100. - Penalty. 
    Any person who is subject to the regulations of this chapter shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of $250.00 per violation per day for as long as the violation continues. In addition to such penalty, the city may recover from the person reasonable attorney fees, court costs and other expensed incurred in any enforcement proceedings. The city may seek injunctive relief in court against any person violating the provisions of this article and may ask for restraint of the violator and abatement or remediation of the violation at the violator's expense.
