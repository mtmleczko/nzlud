PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Richmond, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CHARTER INDEX       CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX       CDi:1 
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publications is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of John M. Rigby and Allen Paul, Supervising Editors, and Robert McNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Karen M. Stagl, City Clerk, and former Thomas L. Treppa, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

7.  That no additional assessment for any public improvement shall be made unless such additional assessment be reviewed at a meeting of the Council for which meeting notices shall be published as provided in the case of review of the original special assessment roll. 
8.  That in any case when the main purpose of a sidewalk is to provide travel convenience to and from a school, factory, or other institution, public or private, and not for the benefit of the property in a district except incidentally, the City shall pay not less than one-half of the cost of such sidewalk. 
9.  If, under item 4. above the determination is to proceed, determining the probable life of the improvement, finally fixing the special assessment district therefor and ordering the Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll therefor; provided that if prior to the adoption of the resolution to proceed with the making of the public improvement written objections thereto have been filed by the owners of property in the district which, according to the City Manager's report will be required to bear more than fifty percent of the cost thereof, or by a majority of the owners of property to be assessed, no resolution determining to proceed with the improvement shall be adopted while such objections remain except by the affirmative vote of five members of the Council. 
10.  Publications of notices required by this section shall be given in a newspaper published in the City not less than seven days prior to the hearing to which it applies. Notice of all hearings in special assessment proceedings shall also be given by first class mail to the persons and in the manner provided in Act No. 162 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1962 (MCL 211.741 et seq.), as amended. 
11.  In the event that funds are on hand or a revolving fund exists to defray the expense of any public improvement prior to the completion thereof, the special assessment roll therefor may be made within sixty days after the improvement is completed and shall be based upon the actual cost thereof. 
(b)  When the City may by law participate in intergovernmental improvements the cost of which may be defrayed in whole or in part by special assessments, the procedure therefor shall be as provided by the law permitting the same. If such procedure is not so provided, the procedure established by and under authority of this chapter shall govern. 
Section 12.3. - Reconsideration of petitions. 
    In the event that the Council shall fail to make any public improvement petitioned for under the provisions of the special assessment ordinance during the calendar year during which any petition is filed, such petition shall be reconsidered by the Council prior to the first day of March of the succeeding calendar year for the purpose of determining whether such improvement should be made during such calendar year. 
Section 12.4. - Condemnation costs. 
    The cost of condemning or otherwise acquiring property needed for any public improvement shall constitute a part of the cost of the improvement but in no case shall the amount of such cost which is included in any special assessment for any public improvement cause the assessment to exceed the amount of the benefit received by any property assessed therefor through the making of the improvement.

Such lien shall be of the same character and effect as that which is created by the Charter for City taxes. Such special assessments or the installments thereof, as the case may be, shall be charged against the owners of the property assessed according to the records of the assessor's office at the time the special assessment or installment thereof, as the case may be, is due for payment. All special assessments or installments thereof made in any calendar year which remain unpaid on the first day of March of the succeeding calendar year together with the collection charges and interest which have accrued thereto shall be placed upon the delinquent tax roll of the City as required in Chapter XI of this Charter and shall be collected, or the collection thereof enforced, in the same manner as are delinquent taxes on the City. For this purpose, the word "assessments" used in Chapter XI shall include special assessments authorized by this chapter. 
(b)  In addition to the procedures established in subsection (a) hereof for the collection of special assessments levied against property, the City may recover them in a suit in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit, the confirmed special assessment roll upon which the special assessment concerned appears shall be prima facie evidence of the existence of the special assessment, of the regularity of the proceedings in making the special assessment, and of the right of the City to recover judgment therefor. 
Section 12.7. - Hazards and nuisances. 
    When any lot or premises, building, or structure within the City, because of age or dilapidation, the accumulation of refuse or debris, the uncontrolled growing of noxious weeds, or because of any other condition or happening, becomes in the opinion of the Council a public nuisance or hazard which is dangerous to the health, safety, or welfare of the inhabitants of the City or of those residing or habitually going near such lot or premises or such building or structure, the Council may after investigation give notice to the owner or owners of the land upon which such nuisance or hazard exists or to the owner or occupant of the land or the building or structure itself by posting notice upon the premises, by personal service, or by registered or certified mail addressed to the address set forth in the current assessment roll of the City or the records of the Assessor, specifying the nature of the nuisance or hazard and requiring such owner or occupant to alter, repair, tear down, abate or remove the nuisance or hazard within a time to be specified by the Council which shall be commensurate with the nature of the nuisance or hazard. If at the expiration of the time limit in said notice the owner has not complied with the requirements thereof or in any case where the owner of the land or of the building or structure itself is not known or cannot be found, the Council may order such nuisance or hazard to be abated by the proper department or agency of the City which is qualified to do the work required or may do the work by contract or by hire, and the cost of such abatement may be assessed against the lot, premises, or description of real property upon which such nuisance or hazard is located by special assessment. 
Section 12.8. - Boulevard lighting. 
    The Council may provide a system of boulevard lighting for the City or any part or parts thereof, and may assess the cost thereof on any street for which such lighting is provided against the lands abutting thereon if the property owners of a majority of the frontage on such streets or part thereof so to be improved shall petition therefor.

    Moneys raised by special assessment for any public improvement shall be credited to a special assessment account and shall be used to pay the special assessment portion of the cost of the improvement for which the assessment was levied and of expense incidental thereto, including the repayment of the principal of and interest on money borrowed therefor, and to refund excessive assessments if refunds be authorized. 
Section 12.11. - Certain postponements of payments. 
    The Council may provide that any person who in the opinion of the assessor and Council by reason of poverty is unable to contribute toward the cost of the making of a public improvement by special assessment, may execute to the City an instrument creating a lien for the benefit of the City on all or any part of the real property owned by him and benefited by any public improvement, which lien will mature and be effective from and after the execution of such instrument, shall be recorded with the Register of Deeds of Macomb County, and shall not be discharged or released until the terms thereof are met in full.

Such bonds or other evidence of indebtedness shall include, but not be limited to the following types: 
1.  General obligation bonds for the payment of which the full faith and credit of the City is pledged.

(b)  Whenever any portion of public improvements shall be assessed by or charged to the City at large and the balance of such cost assessed against the property benefitted, the Council may provide for the payment of the City's portion of such cost in installments. In such case, bonds may be issued in anticipation of the payment of the amount assessed against the City at large, the same as they may be issued in anticipation of the payments of the amount assessed against the benefitted property. In such case, the Council shall appropriate in each fiscal year an amount which is sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds which are required to be paid during that year. Such bonds may be included as a part of a total issue of bonds for the public improvement to which they apply and need not be separated from bonds issued in anticipation of the payment of special assessments assessed against the benefitted property. 
(c)  Bonds may be issued in anticipation of the collection of special assessments levied with respect to two or more public improvements, but no special assessment district shall be required to pay the obligation of any other special assessment district and the ordinance or resolution authorizing such bond issue shall so provide. 
(d)  All collections on special assessment rolls or on any combination of such rolls shall be set apart in a separate fund and shall be used for the purpose for which levied, and for the payment of the principal of and interest on bonds issued in anticipation of such special assessments.

(e)  Each bond or other evidence of indebtedness shall contain on its face a statement specifying the purpose for which the same is issued, and the proceeds thereof shall not be used for any other purpose except that whenever the proceeds of any bond issue or a part thereof remain unexpended and unencumbered for the purpose for which said bond issue was made, the Council may, by the confirming vote of not less than five members, authorize the use of such unexpended and encumbered [unencumbered] funds: 
1.  For the retirement of such bond issue, or 
2.  If such bond issue has been fully retired, then for the retirement of other bonds or obligations of the City provided for by this section provided that in the case of special assessment bonds, such funds shall be refunded to the owners of property against which special assessments therefor were made, or placed in the general fund of the City in accordance with the provision of Section 12.2 of this Charter, and

4.  If such funds cannot be so used, then in any manner approved by the vote of not less than five members of the Council. 
(f)  No bond or other evidence of indebtedness, regardless of type or purpose, shall bear interest at a rate exceeding that fixed by law. 
(g)  All bonds and other evidences of indebtedness shall be signed by the Mayor and countersigned by the Clerk under the seal of the City. Interest coupons may be executed with the facsimile signatures of the Treasurer. A complete and detailed record of all bonds and other evidence of indebtedness shall be kept by the Treasurer.

After all of the bonds of any issue have been paid, they may be destroyed by cremation with a proper certificate of such destruction filed in the office of the Clerk.

The resources of any debt retirement or sinking fund pledged for the retirement of any outstanding bonds which are subject to the debt limitation herein established shall also be deducted from the amount of the bonded indebtedness. 
(b)  No bonds shall be sold to obtain funds for any purpose other than that for which they were specifically authorized and, if such bonds are not sold within two years after authorization, such authorization shall be null and void except when delay is caused by litigation or when a bond issue has been authorized to be issued in two or more parts or series.

In the case of a contract agreement obligating the City for periodic payments in future fiscal years, such certificate need not cover those payments which will be due in future fiscal years but this exception shall not apply to a contract for the purchase or construction of a public improvement.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 150-2, §§ I-VII, adopted August 21, 2006, repealed the former Art. VII, §§ 46-151-46-157, and enacted a new Art. VII as set out herein. The former Art. VII pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 150, §§ I-VII, 1-21-02; Ord. No. 150-1, §§ I-VII, 7-1-02. 

Sec. 46-151. - Introduction. 
    The City of Richmond, Macomb County recognizes: (a) that residents of the City of Richmond rely exclusively on groundwater for a safe drinking water supply, and (b) that certain land uses (particularly those located within the wellhead protection area (WHPA) that use hazardous substances) can contaminate groundwater. 
    The purpose of the WHPA ordinance is to protect water quality, to keep pollutants from entering surface and groundwater, to reduce the danger of contamination, and to protect potable water supplies. It is the intent of the City of Richmond to protect the WHPA, as much as possible, through public education and securing public cooperation. Where new uses or modifications to existing uses are proposed, it is important that every precaution be taken to secure the city's future water supply. Consequently, appropriate land use regulations will be imposed in addition to those imposed in the zoning ordinance or in other city, county, state or federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. 150-2, § I, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 46-152. - Definitions. 
    Aquifer: A geological formation, group of formations, or part of a formation capable of storing and yielding groundwater to wells and springs.

[Defined by reference on a map approved by the MDEQ.] 
(Ord. No. 150-2, § II, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 46-153. - General provisions. 
    Property owners and facility operators of all newly proposed projects within the wellhead protection area must comply with the design and performance standard requirements of this article and with the requirements of all state, federal, county, and other local regulations. 
    Wellhead protection area boundaries. Wellhead protection area boundaries are on the wellhead protection area map that is part of this article. This area may be periodically updated without modification to the ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 150-2, § III, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 46-154. - Design and performance standards. 
    The purpose of design and performance standards is to protect water quality, to keep pollutants from entering surface and groundwater, to reduce the danger of contamination, and to protect potable water supplies. Performance standards regulate development within the WHPA by enforcing specific standards for facility design and construction. They allow for aggressive protection of the WHPA by striving for quality development within the WHPA. 
    Performance standards can be complex to administer. They require considerable evaluation and analysis to determine the relative impact to the WHPA. All design and performance standards should be prepared by registered professional engineers. 
    The following standards will apply to uses in the WHPA. 
(1)  Cooling systems. Any cooling water from solvent recovery systems should be free of contamination from solvent, metals or other pollutants, and should not be discharged to the ground. Closed-loop cooling systems are encouraged to eliminate cooling water discharges. Cooling water may be discharged into a storm sewer, sanitary sewer, or stream, provided all federal, state, and local requirements are met. 
(2)  Construction activities. Appropriate maintenance and equipment storage areas must be identified on the site plan where possible, before any construction is done on the site. 
If construction equipment is to be stored in an open area (i.e., temporary storage): 
 The site should not be within the drip line of trees. 
 The site should not be within 100 feet of a watercourse or wetland. Runoff should be diverted away from watercourses and wetlands. 
 Special measures must be taken to prevent excess solids, suspended in storm water, from being discharged from the site. 
 All applicable state and local soil erosion requirements must be met. 
 The maintenance, repair, cleaning, and storage of construction machinery, vehicles, and equipment should be confined to areas specifically designed and designated for that purpose. This practice includes both open and covered equipment maintenance and storage areas, and emphasizes the importance of controlling runoff from both kinds of storage areas. This practice should be implemented at all equipment maintenance and storage areas, and whenever construction will be ongoing long enough that construction equipment will need to be stored, serviced, maintained, or repaired on a construction site. Appropriate equipment maintenance and storage sites should be identified before any actual construction begins. Heavy equipment should be well maintained to prevent leaks. 
 Make sure waste materials are properly disposed of. 
 Outside equipment/maintenance storage areas should be inspected daily to ensure equipment isn't being stored within the drip line of trees and to ensure the vehicles and equipment aren't leaking. Periodic checks of the equipment wash area should also be done to ensure it is not failing. Additional stone may be needed to maintain the wash area. 
 Construction sites must provide facilities for containing any accidental losses of oil or other polluting substances, and comply with the approved equipment maintenance and storage areas, as identified on the site plan. 
 At the conclusion of construction, stabilize the surrounding area. 
(3)  Cross-connections. Cross-connections, such as sanitary discharges to storm sewers, storm water discharges to sanitary sewers, or floor drain discharges to storm sewer systems, are prohibited. 
(4)  Debris. No potentially polluting material such as garbage, trash, refuse, junk vehicles, junk appliances, or toxic substances may be dumped or stored outside a protected structure or container within the WHPA. 
(5)  Floor drains. Floor drain discharges to the ground, septic systems (except in sanitary facilities), storm sewers, or any surface water body, from any location in the facility, is prohibited. 
Floor drains in bathrooms, kitchens, and other sanitary facilities must either discharge to a septic system, a municipal sanitary sewer, or a holding tank, which is periodically pumped out. 
Floor drains in work areas must be connected either to a holding tank with a gravity discharge pipe, or to a collection sump which discharges to a holding tank. 
Floor drains are prohibited in rooms where boilers or emergency generators are housed. 
(6)  Holding tanks. Interior hazardous substance storage tanks should have 110 percent secondary containment, double-walled construction, alarms, and overfill protection. Interior storage tanks should be installed in an enclosed area isolated from floor drains, storm water sewers, or other conduits which may cause a release into the environment. 
For flood control, all exterior aboveground tanks will include, but not be limited to, a monitoring system and secondary standpipe above the 100-year flood control level, for monitoring and recovery. All aboveground tanks must have an impervious dike, above the 100-year flood level, capable of containing 110 percent of the largest volume of storage and be provided with an overflow recovery catchment area or sump. 
Fill-pipe inlets should be above the elevation of the top of the storage tank. 
Tanks and associated appurtenances should be tested periodically for structural integrity. 
(7)  Liquid waste ponds. Open liquid waste ponds are prohibited. 
(8)  Loading and unloading areas. Areas where hazardous substances and waste materials are loaded and unloaded should be enclosed or roofed areas with secondary containment should be isolated from floor drains to prevent potential spills from contaminating storm water or discharging to the ground. Loading and unloading areas must have impervious surfaces and be designed to prevent releases from incidental handling. 
(9)  Material handling and storage areas. Material handling and storage areas for hazardous substances and waste materials should be permanently roofed, completely confined within secondary confinement berms, isolated from floor drains, have sealed surfaces, and should not be accessible to unauthorized personnel. 
Compatible drum and container storage areas should be located together for better control of hazardous substances and waste inventory. 
(10)  Parking lots. This design standard is intended to provide review criteria for parking areas, so that approved construction techniques will prevent solids and contaminates from reaching groundwater and is applicable for nearly all parking areas. The primary purpose for proper performance of parking lot design is to reduce peak runoff and provide some flood storage. This helps reduce surface flushing and subsequent contamination. 
Parking lots can essentially function as specialized detention basins. As such, they should comply with the design and performance standards described under storm water management. 
(11)  Secondary containment. Any facility involving the collection, handling, manufacture, use, storage, transfer, or disposal of any solid or liquid material or wastes, which has the potential to contaminate groundwater, must have a secondary containment system whose purpose is to intercept any leak or release from the primary containment vessel or structure. Containment systems must be accessible to allow for easy inspection. 
Secondary containment must be equivalent to 110 percent of the maximum amount of materials to be stored and be sufficient to retain the substance for the maximum anticipated time necessary for recovery and cleanup. 
Underground tanks or buried pipes, carrying such materials, must have double walls and inspectable sumps. 
(12)  Septic systems and dry wells. Leach fields must be sized according to soil characteristics and hydraulic and pollutant loadings. Excessively sized septic system leach fields may cause reduced effectiveness, if normal flows are inadequate to maintain a biologically active clogging layer throughout the leach field. 
Septic systems are not recommended in areas with karst, fractured, cavernous, volcanic, or any other highly permeable subsurface formation. 
Additional detention times for septic tanks, and larger buffer zones around leach fields should be considered in septic system design. 
All septic tank installations should be designed with provisions for sampling at the outlet baffle. Gas baffles should be installed at the outlet. 
Dry wells are prohibited, unless they are only clean water discharges that meet all established minimum contaminant levels promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and other state and federal standards for drinking water, and meets all other state and local requirements. 
Flow restrictions and low-flow faucets for sinks and spray nozzles should be installed to minimize hydraulic loading to subsurface disposal systems. 
(13)  Site design. The project and related improvements must be designed to protect the natural environment. There must be no impairment, pollution, and/or destruction of water, natural resources, and the public trust. 
Earthen berms should be used to limit contact with the ground in spill-prone areas. 
Specific areas should be designated and maintained for employee parking. 
If equipment is to be stored in an open area (i.e., temporary storage): 
 The site should not be within the drip line of trees. 
 The site should not be within 100 feet of a watercourse or wetland. Runoff should be diverted away from watercourses and wetlands. 
If equipment is to be maintained and stored in a permanent structure (i.e., building), the building should not be located within 100 feet of a watercourse or wetland. 
Under no circumstances should buildings or equipment be located in flood plains, stream beds, or the channel of any watercourse. 
Equipment wash areas should discharge into a holding tank or sanitary sewer line. Depending on the amount of oil, grease, and other pollutants, pretreatment of wastewater may be needed before it enters the sanitary sewer. 
Wash areas should be constructed of two- to three-inch stone or other approved material, with a minimum six-inch base. They should be underlain with geotextile materials, and protected using berms or diversions to prevent the runoff water from leaving the site. 
Secondary containment should be incorporated into the design of the maintenance/storage facility to contain spills from all hazardous materials. 
Buildings should be clustered, as much as possible, to retain open space, surrounding vegetation, tree cover, and to minimize changes in topography. 
Minimum setback distances should be established between limits of septic systems, dry wells, holding tanks, leach fields, and wellheads. Distances should be based on information such as percolation tests, zones of influence of leachate mounding, wellhead protection areas, and time of travel. 
(14)  Storm water management. Storm water management must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements. 
Storm water management and drainage facilities require special design requirements for high-risk areas such as WHPAs. They must be designed to take advantage of existing natural retention and storage capacity of wetlands and water bodies or water courses, and not increase flooding, or the potential for environmental contamination. 
The preferred strategy for storm water management is storage, treatment, and controlled surface water discharge. Treatment and infiltration may be employed as a storm water strategy, if the site constraints prohibit the uses of the preferred strategy. Treatment refers to the planned use of natural and man made mechanisms to purify storm water through settling out of solids, separation and capture of oil and grease, absorption of particulates, and uptake of dissolved solids. Treatment of storm water is required prior to infiltration or controlled surface water discharge. A surface water outlet is recommended, when available. 
The preferred management strategy consisting of storage, treatment, and controlled surface water discharge includes dual cell onsite detention basins, extended dual cell detention basins, or wet dual-cell detention basins. 
The secondary management strategy consisting of treatment and infiltration includes discharge to storm sewers, catch basins, oil and grit separators, infiltration trenches, lined grass swales, or dual cell infiltration basins. 
Storm water contact with hazardous substances and waste materials must be avoided to the greatest extent possible. Storage of hazardous substances and waste materials should be isolated in roofed or enclosed areas to prevent contact with precipitation. If exposure of storage areas to the elements is allowed, uncovered storage areas should have a separate storm water collection system which discharges to a holding tank. 
Storm water from building roofs may be discharged to the ground. However, if solvent distillation equipment or vapor degreasing is used, with a vent that exhausts to the roof, then roof leaders may become cross contaminated with solvent. These potential sources of cross contamination must be avoided. 
Cross-connections, such as sanitary discharges to storm sewers, storm water discharges to sanitary sewers, or floor drain discharges to storm sewer systems, are prohibited. Water from floor sumps may not be discharged to a storm sewer or stream. 
Runoff from equipment maintenance/storage areas should be directed to stabilized outlets designed to assimilate the volume and type of pollutants discharged to them. 
(15)  Underground storage tanks. Underground storage tanks must comply with all applicable federal and state requirements. Underground storage tanks should not be used, unless explicitly required by fire codes or other federal, state, or local regulations. 
Where underground tanks are required, they should have double-walled construction or secondary containment, such as a concrete vault lined or sealed with an impermeable material and filled with sand. Both types of tanks should have appropriate secondary containment monitoring, high level and leak sensing audiovisual alarms, level indicators, and overfill protection. If a dip stick is used for level measurements, there should be a protective plate or basket where the stick may strike the tank bottom. 
For flood control, all underground facilities will include, but not be limited to, a monitoring system and secondary standpipe above the 100-year flood control level, for monitoring and recovery. 
(16)  Utilities. Where piping for utilities, conduits, ducts, etc., extend through the floor, of any floors at or below grade, the openings must be sealed with chemical resistant, non cracking caulk. 
(17)  Waste stream. Waste management techniques must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements. 
Waste-generating operations should be physically segregated from other operations, and preferably be located within a confinement area with sealed floors and with no direct access outside the facility. This reduces the total work area exposed to solvents, facilitates waste stream segregation and efficient material and waste handling, and minimizes cross contamination with other operations and potential pathways for release into the environment. 
Waste collection stations should be provided throughout work areas for the accumulation of spent chemicals, soiled rags, etc. Each station should have labeled containers for each type of waste fluid. This provides safe interim storage of wastes, reduces frequent handling of small quantities of wastes to storage areas, and minimizes the overall risk of a release into the environment. 
(18)  Work areas. Sealed floors are easier to clean without the use of solvents. All floors should be constructed of cement or other impervious materials to prevent contaminants from leaching into the soils or groundwater. Floor surfaces in work areas and chemical storage areas should be sealed with an impermeable material resistant to acids, caustics, solvents, oils, or any other substance which may be used or generated at the facility. 
Work area floors should be pitched to appropriate floor drains. If floor drains are not used, or if they are located close to entrance ways, then entrances must be designed to prevent storm water runoff from entering the building. 
Curbing and internal floor berms should be used to isolate floor drains from spill-prone areas. 
(Ord. No. 150-2, § I, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 46-155. - Site plan review standards. 
    The public service director is hereby appointed the WHPA administrator to administer and implement the provisions of the City of Richmond WHPA ordinance. 
    The public service director is responsible for reviewing site plans within the WHPA for compliance with the provisions of the WHPA ordinance. The public service director will review the plans in regards to WHPA design and performance standards, and may request any information or revisions required to meet those standards. 
    Upon application for a site plan review for a use within the WHPA, the public service director may employ such technical expertise as needed to ensure compliance with the provisions of these regulations. All reasonable costs, as determined by the City of Richmond, incurred in the compliance review process shall be passed through to the applicant, and shall be in addition to those fees normally charged to review an application for site plan reviews required by the zoning ordinance. 
    In addition to existing site plan application forms, the applicants must complete and submit the site plan review environmental checklist as required by the city's wellhead protection plan. 
    In addition to the site plan requirements of the zoning ordinance, site plans for sites within the WHPA must also provide the following: 
(1)  Secondary containment is required in all site areas where businesses, industry, and government agencies store, handle, or use hazardous materials in operational processes. 
(2)  Floor drains are allowed only when connected to a publicly approved wastewater treatment system, on-site holding tanks, or other type of system approved by the municipality. 
(3)  Storm water management plans must incorporate effective containment measures. 
(4)  Special attention should be given to proper storm water and soil erosion control so that the removal of storm water will not increase off-site sedimentation or otherwise adversely impact neighboring properties, flood, or degrade water resources. 
(5)  Parking areas must be designed to reduce non-point discharge of runoff and contain sediment traps to prevent contaminants from reaching groundwater. 
(6)  All storage areas for chemicals, liquids, and underground facilities must be identified as such on the plans. 
    After site plan approval, no modifications can be made without review and approval, as though it were a new application. Modified review procedures may be considered for project amendments. It is equally important that projects be inspected regularly during construction to ensure that the project is being constructed as approved. Performance guarantees should be required in the amount of all required improvements. 
    Additional requirements. Best management practices are intended to provide a measure of operational integrity. These can be implemented in the form of an agreement at the beginning of a project or through an inspection program. Essentially, the owner is expected to maintain a high level of site maintenance and uphold certain operational requirements. 
(Ord. No. 150-2, § I, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 46-156. - Appeals.

(e)  There shall be a fee for a hearing before the WHPA appeals board. Said fee shall be set by the city council by resolution. 
(f)  Any request for a hearing before the WHPA appeals board must be submitted no later than 30 days following the decision of the WHPA administrator for which the request is being submitted. 
(g)  The WHPA appeals board shall render a decision on an appeal no later than 30 days following an appeals hearing. The decision shall state the board's finding of fact and the reason for the board's decision. 
(h)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of WHPA appeals board may appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 150-2, § I, 8-21-06) 
Sec. 46-157. - Liability and enforcement. 
(a)  Liability. Nothing in this article will be construed to imply that the City of Richmond has accepted any of an owner/developer's liability if a permitted facility or use contaminates groundwater in any aquifer. 
(b)  Civil enforcement. 
(1)  The public service director or authorized representative, bearing proper identification, shall be permitted to enter private property, at any reasonable time, with reasonable cause, or with prior notification, for such purposes as inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and records examination pertaining to the requirements of this section. Upon request of the entity which is the object of the inspection, and if permitted by the state public records law, information obtained as a result shall be maintained as confidential. If the owner or tenant does not consent to the entry of the public service director, the public service director may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction of an appropriate warrant or other authority to enter said property, but no consent is necessary for entry into areas then open to the public or to customers. 
(2)  Any person may submit to this jurisdiction a verbal or written complaint alleging a violation of this article.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 136, adopted Aug. 21, 1995, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, inclusion of §§ 1-3 as a new art. V, §§ 90-91-90-93, was at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 90-91. - Declaration of purpose. 
    The city finds that a significant number of the traffic arrests and traffic accidents in the city involve drivers operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of both. Furthermore, the city finds that there is a greater likelihood of personal injury or property damages in accidents involving a driver operating under the influence of an intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of both. As a result, the city finds that a greater operational and financial burden has been placed on the city's public safety services by persons operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, and that it is necessary to recover these increased emergency response costs.

The city council shall establish by resolution the fee for removing and replacing disputed water meters, except that a customer shall not be charged for such meter removal and replacement if it is determined that the utility billing dispute was the result of a meter over-reading actual usage. In such cases where it is determined by city administration that a utility customer's billing dispute is the result of a water leak which is the responsibility of the customer and which did not result in water discharging to the sanitary sewer system, city administration may provide an adjustment to the sanitary sewer portion of the billing based upon the customer's usage records. The city manager is authorized to approve reasonable payment arrangements for a customer who, because of water leaks or other unusual circumstances beyond the control of the customer resulting in a substantial increase in the amount of the subject quarterly utility billing, claims financial difficulty in paying such billing.

In the case of platted subdivisions, the developer shall pay the cost of main extension and shall reimburse the city for its actual costs incurred in making or causing to be made inspections thereof, and in the case of unplatted lands main extensions shall be financed by special assessment against the benefited property, provided that the assessment shall not exceed the actual cost of the extension plus engineering and administrative costs, and further provided that a corner lot shall be assessed only its fair share of the cost of extending the main that actually serves or is intended to serve it; corner lots shall participate only in the cost of the main installed along one side of the lot, not in the cost of the main which may be installed along a side of the lot but which is not intended to serve that lot. The cost for this latter main shall be divided proportionately among the benefiting properties which it is intended to serve. 
(c)  For any main extension made to serve any lot or parcel which is separated from the existing system by vacant property, the developer or owner shall enter into a water or sewer main extension contract with the city and shall pay the entire cost of the original construction of the main extension through the vacant land. As the property abutting such water main is developed and connections are made to it, the city may collect, but has no obligation to collect, a charge per front foot based upon the original construction cost, and if so collected, shall reimburse the developer to the extent of the collection so made less ten percent for administrative expense, provided that the developers right to reimbursement under a water or sewer main extension contract shall in no event exceed a period of five years from the date of the execution of said contract and all payments shall cease at that time regardless of the amount that has at that time been received by the developer. In no instance shall the actual amount paid to the developer by the city exceed the original cost of the extension. 
(d)  All water and sewer mains or extensions thereof shall be installed only in dedicated public streets, alleys, or rights-of-way, or in easements which grant the city rights at least equal to the right it would enjoy in dedicated streets, alleys, or rights-of-way, and shall become the property of the city at the time of connection to the city system. 
(e)  Plans for main extensions must be prepared by a Michigan licensed professional engineer and submitted to the city manager or the city engineer for review and approval prior to commencement of construction thereof.

(c)  All sewers shall be constructed in accordance with the latest edition of the "Ten State Standards" and the City of Richmond Engineering Standards. 
(Ord. No. 149, § VII, 10-15-01) 
Sec. 94-113. - Use of the public sewers. 
(a)  General discharge prohibitions. No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all such users of a POTW whether or not the user is subject to the national categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. The city may refuse to accept any wastes which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES discharge limits. A user may not contribute the following substances to any POTW: 
(1)  Any liquids, solids or gases, including but not limited to waste streams with a closed cup flash point of less than 140°F, which by reason of their nature and quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides. 
(2)  Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to: grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes. 
(3)  Any wastewater having a pH less than 6.0 or greater than 9.5, or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, or personnel of the POTW. 
(4)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. This prohibition of toxic pollutants will conform to section 307(a) of the Act. 
(5)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair, including pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
(6)  Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. 
(7)  Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit or the receiving water quality standards. 
(8)  Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(9)  Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW which exceeds 40°C (104°F). 
(10)  Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference to the POTW. 
(11)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the city manager in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(12)  Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance. 
(13)  Any unpolluted water including, but not limited to stormwater, groundwater, roof water, or noncontact cooling water. 
(14)  Any waters or wastes containing suspended solids or any constituent of such character and quantity that unusual attention or expense is required to handle such materials at the sewage treatment plant. 
(15)  Any sludge, precipitate or congealed substances resulting from an industrial or commercial process, or resulting from the pretreatment of wastewater or air pollutants. 
(16)  Any trucked or hauled wastewater, except as specifically allowed by the city manager. 
(b)  National categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the promulgation of the national categorical pretreatment standards for a particular subcategory, the pretreatment standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article and shall be considered part of this article. The city manager shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements. 
    Existing users subject to new national categorical pretreatment standards shall achieve compliance within three years of the date the standard is promulgated, unless a shorter compliance schedule is specified in the standard. New sources subject to national categorical pretreatment standards shall install, have in operating condition, and have started up all pretreatment equipment required to achieve compliance before beginning to discharge; and shall meet all applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time, but not to exceed 90 days after beginning to discharge. 
(c)  State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this article. 
(d)  City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section 94-106 of this article. 
(e)  No user shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, water from footing drains, or roof water to any sanitary sewer or sewer connection. Any premise connected to a storm sewer shall comply with county, state and federal requirements as well as those of the city. 
    Downspouts and roof leaders shall be disconnected from sanitary sewers within six months of the date of this article. If this is not done, the city shall perform this work and bill the user. 
    Stormwater, ground water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designed as combined sewers or storm sewers. Discharge of cooling water or unpolluted process water to a natural outlet shall be approved only by the Michigan Water Resources Commission. 
(f)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of the city manager they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand and other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable covers, which when bolted in place shall be gastight and watertight. 
(g)  Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the owner, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. 
(h)  The city may prohibit the admission into the public sewers or any waters or wastes as follows: 
(1)  Five-day BOD greater than 250 parts per million by weight; or 
(2)  Containing more than 250 parts per million by weight of suspended solids; or 
(3)  Containing more than five parts per million by weight of phosphorus; or 
(4)  Containing more than 100 parts per million by weight of fats, oil and grease; or 
(5)  Containing more than 40 parts per million by weight of total Kjeldahl nitrogen or 25 mg/L of ammonia nitrogen; or 
(6)  Containing detectable levels of mercury; or 
(7)  Containing any quantity of substances having the characteristics described in section 94-113(a)(1) or 94-133(a)(2); or 
(8)  Having an average daily flow greater than two percent of the average daily sewage flow of the city, or having a rate of flow (gallons per day) greater than ten percent of the average daily city flow for a period of one hour or more, shall be subject to review and approval of the city manager. 
Where necessary in the opinion of the city, the owner shall provide at his expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to reduce the five-day BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus, and n total Kjeldahl nitrogen or ammonia-nitrogen to the concentrations listed in section 94-113(h)(1)-(4) above; or to reduce objectionable characteristics of constituents to within the maximum limits provided for in section 94-113(a), or control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes. 
(j)  Where the strength of sewage from an industrial, commercial or institutional establishment exceeds (1) 250 parts per million of biochemical oxygen demand or (2) 250 parts per million by weight of suspended solids or (3) five parts per million by weight of phosphorus or (4) 100 parts per million by weight of fats, oil and grease or (5) 40 parts per million by weight of total Kjeldahl nitrogen or 25 parts per million ammonia-nitrogen and where such wastes are permitted to be discharged to the sewer system by the city manager, an added charge, as noted below, will be made against such establishment according to the strength of such wastes. The strength of such wastes shall be determined by composite samples taken over a sufficient period of time to insure a representative sample. The cost of taking and making the first of these samples shall be borne by the city. The cost of any subsequent sampling and testing shall be borne by the industry or establishment, whether owner or lessee. Tests shall be made by an independent laboratory or at the city wastewater treatment plant. 
    Added charges shall be determined by the city. These charges shall be based on the cost of operation, maintenance, and equipment replacement for the sewage works. 
(k)  When required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial non-domestic sanitary wastes shall install a suitable sampling manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(l)  All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water to which reference is made in subsections (a) and (h) of this section, shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition at the time of "Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Sewage," and shall be determined at the sampling manhole provided for in subsection (e), section 94-110, or upon suitable samples taken at said sampling manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
    Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether grab samples should be taken. The responsibilities of the industry are further defined below: 
(1)  One person from each industry shall be delegated the authority to be responsible for industrial wastes admitted to the municipal sewers. Such person would be involved with maintaining the pretreatment facility operations and assuring a continual high level of performance. In case no pretreatment is provided such person would be involved with the prevention of accidental discharges of process wastes admitted to the sanitary sewer system. Such person must become aware of all potential and routine toxic wastes generated by their industry. Such person must also be informed of all process alterations which could, in any manner, increase or decrease normal daily flow or waste strength discharged to the sanitary sewers. 
(2)  This industrial representative must catalog all chemicals stored, used, or manufactured by their industry. Such a listing should include specific chemical names, not manufacturer's codes. Those wastes admitted to the sanitary sewer are a prime concern; however, all discharges should be cataloged. An estimate of daily average flows and strengths must be made including process, cooling, sanitary, etc. Such a determination should separate the flows according to appropriate categories. The aforementioned flow and chemical listing is to be sent to the city. 
(3)  The industrial representative shall determine whether or not large process alterations will occur during the next few years; one year, two years, and five years. Management should be consulted to determine if such alterations are scheduled and forthcoming. 
(4)  A sketch of the plant building(s) must be made, including a diagram of process and chemical storage areas. Location of any pretreatment equipment should be indicated and floor drains located near process and storage areas should be noted. Manhole and sewer locations at the industry's point of discharge into the municipal collection system should be included on the plant layout sketch. 
(5)  There must be separation of spent concentrations from the sanitary sewer to prevent toxic wastes from upsetting the wastewater treatment plant. Supervision and operation of the pretreatment equipment for spent concentrations as well as all toxic wastes and high strength organic wastes to an acceptable level as detailed in this article is the responsibility of the industrial representative. All sludges generated by a such treatment process must be handled in an acceptable manner, such as designated areas of a sanitary landfill or by a licensed waste hauler. Adequate segregation of those waters and wastes to be pretreated to meet discharge limits is a vital portion of the industrial effort to prevent operational problems at the wastewater treatment plant. 
(6)  Throughout the industry, adequate secondary containment or curbing must be provided to protect all floor drains from accidental spills and discharges to the receiving sewers. Such curbing should be sufficient to hold 150 percent of the total process area tank volume. All floor drains found within the containment area must be plugged and sealed. Spill trough and sumps within the containment area must be plugged and sealed. Spill trough and sumps within process areas must discharge to appropriate pretreatment tanks. Secondary containment should be provided for storage tanks which may be serviced by commercial haulers and for chemical storage areas. 
(7)  An adequate sampling vault or manhole must be provided in an accessible place for the wastewater treatment plant personnel to obtain samples and flow measurement data. The complexity of the vault will vary with the sampling requirements the city determines necessary to protect the treatment plant and receiving stream. Should the city desire continual flow recording and long duration, 24-hour composite sampling, then a more complex manhole would be mandatory complete with 110 volt AC. Samples collected could be divided between the industry and city for analysis if so desired by the industry. The sampling vault should be located so as to give access by city personnel without entering the industrial property. 
(8)  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processing or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. When requested by the person furnishing the report, the portion of the report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article. The national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit, and/or the pretreatment programs; wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. Information accepted by the city as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the city until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user. 
Industrial cooling water containing such pollutants as insoluble oils or grease or other suspended solids shall be pretreated for removal of the pollutants and then discharged to a MDEQ approved drainage outlet. 
Agents of the city, county health department, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality or U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, shall have the right to enter all properties for the purpose of inspecting, measuring, sampling and testing the wastewater discharge and copying applicable pretreatment records. 
(m)  To determine the sewage flow from any establishment, the city manager may use one of the following methods: 
(1)  The amount of water supplied to the premises by the city or a private water company as shown upon the water meter if the premises are metered; or 
(2)  If such premises are supplied with river water or water from private wells, the amount of water supplied from such sources as estimated by the city manager from the water, gas or electric supply; or 
(3)  If such premises are used for an industrial or commercial purpose of such a nature that the water supplied to the premises cannot be entirely discharged into the sewer system, the estimate of the amount of sewage discharged into the sewer system made by the city manager from the water, gas or electric supply; or 
(4)  The number of gallons of sewage discharged into the sewer system as determined by measurements and samples taken at a manhole installed by the owner of the property served by the sewer system at his own expense in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit issued by the city manager pursuant to section 94-112; or 
(5)  A figure determined by the city manager by any combination of the foregoing or by any other equitable method. 
(n)  Excessive discharges. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable national categorical pretreatment standard, no user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state. 
(o)  Accidental discharge. Where required, a user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. The city will evaluate, at least once every two years, whether a user without said protection will be subjected to these requirements. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All required users shall complete such a plan within 180 days after the adoption of this article. If required by the city a user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this article shall not be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(1)  Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the city manager a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(2)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees of whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(p)  Upset provision. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense by users in unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable national categorical pretreatment standards or pretreatment requirements, provided it can be proved that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3)  The user submitted the following information to the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
a.  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
In any enforcement proceedings, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(q)  Bypass provision. Bypass producing a discharge which violates applicable national categorical pretreatment standards or pretreatment requirements is prohibited, and the city may take enforcement action against a user for such bypass, unless: the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime (except where adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to operate during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance); and the user submitted required notices. 
    If the user knows in advance of the need for bypass, a prior notice shall be submitted to the city at least ten days before the date of the bypass. The city may approve or disapprove this anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects. 
    A user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment requirements to the city within 24 hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. Unless waived by the city, a written submission shall then be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
(r)  No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any person, firm or corporation whereby waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city, subject to payment therefor by the person, firm or corporation, provided such waste will not damage the sanitary sewer or storm sewer or sewage treatment plant or the receiving waters. 
(Ord. No. 149, § VIII, 10-15-01) 
Sec. 94-114. - Discharge of detectable mercury prohibited; exceptions. 
    Discharge of detectable mercury shall be prohibited except as follows: 
(1)  Each discharger or suspected discharger of detectable mercury shall have a city-accessible monitoring point for the net "process" effluent. All costs for installation of this monitoring point shall be the discharger's responsibility. 
(2)  Each discharger of detectable mercury shall routinely self-monitor its effluent for mercury using a composite sample collected over the period of normal discharge, a detection level of 0.2 ug/L (EPA Method 245.1), and a frequency to be established by the city. At the city's discretion, samples may be required to be analyzed at a detection level of 0.5 ng/L (0.0005 ug/L) using EPA Method 1631. While the discharger may contract with the city or an outside consultant/laboratory to conduct this sampling and analytical testing, all associated costs shall be the discharger's responsibility. 
(3)  At its discretion, the city may collect additional samples from each discharger of detectable mercury. If the discharger uses an outside consultant/laboratory to perform the self-monitoring, the city will perform a surveillance sampling at least annually. All associated costs shall be the discharger's responsibility. If the city is contracted to perform the self-monitoring, this annual surveillance requirement will be waived. 
(4)  Each discharger of detectable mercury shall develop and implement a mercury minimization plan. The purpose of this plan shall be to establish actions and an implementation schedule to minimize mercury entering the collection system. The plan, which will be subject to review and approval by the city or MDEQ, shall address the following: 
a.  Treatment system for removal of mercury from the discharged wastewater; 
b.  Written procedures for disposal of mercury-contaminated wastes; 
c.  New employee training, as well as refresher training for current employees; 
d.  Review of purchased materials to ensure they are mercury free; and 
e.  Other activities deemed appropriate by the discharger. 
(5)  Failure to comply with these conditions may result in termination of sewer service. If the city determines that all reasonable and cost-effective actions based on economic, technical, and treatability considerations have been implemented, a discharge containing detectable mercury may be accepted on the condition that the mercury minimization plan continue to be actively administered. 
(Ord. No. 149, § IX, 10-15-01) 
Sec. 94-115. - Fees. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the recovery of costs from users of the wastewater treatment works for the implementation of the pretreatment program established herein. The applicable charges or fees shall be set forth in the city's schedule of charges and fees resolution. 
(b)  Description of charges and fees. 
(1)  For reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the pretreatment program; 
(2)  For monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures; 
(3)  For reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(4)  For filing appeals; 
(5)  For permit applications or transfers; 
(6)  For consistent removal by the city of pollutants otherwise subject to federal pretreatment standards; and 
(7)  Others as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. 
(8)  Additional surcharges may be made by the city to compensate the city for the cost of treatment of pollutant loadings not normally treated at or in excess of those treated by the POTW. 
(9)  There shall be additional charges for laboratory testing of wastewater. The laboratory charge shall be for the cost thereof and will be determined for each industrial user. 
The charges and fees for the services provided by the system shall be levied upon any user which may have any sewer connections with the POTW and which discharges industrial waste to the POTW or any part thereof. Such charges shall be based upon the quantity and quality of industrial wastewater used thereon or therein. 
(Ord. No. 149, § X, 10-15-01) 
Sec. 94-116. - Protection from damage. 
    No unauthorized person shall enter or maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the municipal sewage works. 
(Ord. No. 149, § XI, 10-15-01) 
Sec. 94-117. - Power and authority of inspectors. 
    The city manager and other duly authorized employees of the city acting as his duly authorized agent, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter upon such properties as may be necessary for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 149, § XII, 10-15-01) 
Sec. 94-118. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Wastewater discharges. It is unlawful to discharge to the waters of the state within the City of Richmond, or in any area under the jurisdiction of said city, and/or to the POTW any wastewater except as authorized by the city manager in accordance with the provisions of this article except as provided by an NPDES permit. 
(b)  Administrative remedies general. The city may suspend wastewater treatment services to any user when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, causes or may cause interference to the POTW, or causes or may cause the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. 
    The city may seek to terminate the wastewater treatment services to any user which (a) fails to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; (b) fails to report significant changes in wastewater constituents or characteristics; (c) refuses reasonable access to the user's premises by representatives of the city for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or (d) violates the conditions of this article or any final judicial order entered with respect thereto. 
(c)  Administrative notices and orders. 
(1)  Whenever the city finds that any user has violated any provision of this article, industrial waste permit or order issued hereunder, or other pretreatment standard or requirement, or any prohibition, limitation of requirements contained herein, the city manager will issue a notice of violation to formally document the noncompliance. This document will specify the nature of the violation, establish a date by which the violation shall be corrected, and notify the affected user that failure to correct the violation would constitute a further violation which may result in additional enforcement action. A notice of violation will be sent via first-class mail or personally served on an authorized representative of the user. Within 30 days of the date of notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user. Receipt, or non-receipt, of a notice of violation shall in no way relieve the affected user of any and all liability associated with the violation. Issuance of a notice of violation shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, any other enforcement actions by the city against the affected user. 
(2)  When the city finds that a user has violated any provision of this article, industrial waste permit or order issued hereunder, or other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may issue an administrative order to show cause requiring the affected user to appear at a hearing to demonstrate why escalated enforcement action should not be pursued. This document will specify the nature of the violation, establish the time and place for the hearing, and notify the affected user that failure to comply would constitute a violation of this article which may result in additional enforcement action. An order to show cause will be issued at least ten days prior to the hearing, and will be sent via certified mail/return receipt requested or personally served on an authorized representative of the user. 
Receipt, or non-receipt, of an order to show cause shall in no way relieve the affected user of any and all liability associated with the violation. Issuance of an order to show cause or conducting of the show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, any other enforcement actions by the city against the affected user. 
(3)  When the city and an affected user agree to a violation and to the remedial solution, the city manager may issue an order of consent or similar document to formally establish such agreement. This document will specify the nature of the violation and required actions such as compliance schedules, stipulated fines, additional self-monitoring, and improvements to treatment facilities or management practices designed to control the user's discharge to the sewer. 
An order of consent will be sent via certified mail/return receipt requested, or personally served on an authorized representative of the user, and will require signatures of representatives from both the city and the affected user. 
An order of consent or similar document shall have the same force and effect as other administrative orders issued by the city pursuant to this article, shall be judicially enforceable, and shall not modify the requirements or extend the deadline for compliance established by a pretreatment standard or requirement. Receipt, or non-receipt, of an order of consent or similar document shall in no way relieve the affected user of any and all liability associated with the violation. Issuance of a consent order or similar document shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, any other enforcement actions by the city against the affected user. 
(4)  When the city and affected user do not agree to the violation or to the remedial solution, the city manager may issue an order to achieve compliance. This document will specify the nature of the violation and include required actions such as compliance schedules, stipulated fines, additional self-monitoring, and improvements to treatment facilities or management practices designed to control the user's discharge to the sewer. An order to achieve compliance will be issued unilaterally in that terms need not be agreed to by the affected user, and will be sent via certified mail/return receipt requested, or personally served on an authorized representative of the user. 
An order to achieve compliance shall have the same force and effect as other administrative orders issued by the city pursuant to this article, shall be judicially enforceable, and shall not modify the requirements or extend the deadline for compliance established by a pretreatment standard or requirement. Receipt, or non-receipt, of an order to achieve compliance shall in no way relieve the affected user of any and all liability associated with the violation. Issuance of an order to achieve compliance shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, any other enforcement actions by the city against the affected user. 
(5)  When the city finds that a user has violated and continues to violate any provision of this article or order issued hereunder, or other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager and city attorney may jointly issue a cease and desist order requiring the affected user to eliminate the violation within 24 hours or face suspension of sewer service. This document will specify the nature of the violation, and require that the violation cease. If the violation has not been corrected within 24 hours following issuance of the order, the city may suspend sewer service without further notice until such time as the affected user is able to demonstrate to the city that it can comply with the discharge requirements. A cease and desist order will be personally served on an authorized representative of the user. 
Receipt, or non-receipt, of a cease and desist order shall in no way relieve the affected user of any and all liability associated with the violation. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, any other enforcement actions by the city against the user. 
(6)  Whenever the city finds that a user's discharge is in violation of any provision of this article and that the violation creates or threatens to create an emergency situation such as damage to the sanitary sewer system, pass-through or interference to the wastewater treatment plant, hazard to Fistler Drain, endangerment to the public health and safety, or violation of any condition of the NPDES permit issued to the city, the city manager and city attorney will jointly issue an emergency cease and desist order notifying the affected user to eliminate the violating discharge immediately or face service severance via a temporary plug in its sewer connection at any time and without further warning. This document will specify the nature of the violation, and require that the violating discharge cease until such time as the affected user is able to demonstrate to the city that it can comply with the discharge requirements. This document will also establish the time and place for a hearing where the affected user shall present a written statement regarding the causes of the violation and measures taken to prevent future occurrences, and further will notify the affected user of its liability for any costs incurred by the city to conduct this enforcement action. An emergency cease and desist order will be personally served to an authorized representative of the user, or may be delivered verbally via telephone to an authorized representative of the user and then served personally. 
Receipt, or non-receipt, of an emergency cease and desist order shall in no way relieve the affected user of any and all liability associated with the violation. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, any other enforcement actions by the city against the affected user. 
(7)  Except for emergency situations covered under subparagraph (b)(6) of this section, whenever the city finds that a user's continuing violation warrants revocation of its privilege to discharge into the wastewater system, the city manager and city attorney will jointly issue a notice of termination to warn of the impending suspension of the sewer service up to and including severance via temporary plug in the affected user's sewer connection. This document will specify the date and the time of scheduled service suspension in order to allow the affected user to either voluntarily cease the violating discharge or arrange appropriate actions such as production shut-down or alternative means of wastewater disposal. This document will also establish the time and place for a hearing where the affected user shall present a written statement regarding the causes of the violation and measures taken to prevent future occurrences, and further will notify the affected user of its liability for any costs incurred by the city to conduct this enforcement action. A notice of termination will be personally served on an authorized representative of the user at least ten days before the scheduled service suspension. 
Receipt, or non-receipt, of a notice of termination shall in no way relieve the affected user of any and all liability associated with the violation. Issuance of a notice of termination shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, any other enforcement actions by the city against the affected user. 
(8)  In addition to the sanctions, orders, liabilities, and other remedies prescribed under subparagraphs (b)(1) through (b)(7) in this section, a user shall be liable to the city for any and all fines, penalties, and associated legal and other costs incurred or expended by the city as the result of any violation of the city's NPDES permit that is attributable, in whole or in part, to the user's violation of this article. 
(d)  Administrative fines. When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, an industrial waste permit or order issued hereunder, or other pretreatment standard or requirement, an administrative fine may be assessed against the affected user in an amount up to $500.00 per violation. Each day during which the violation occurred or continues to occur may be deemed a separate violation and, in the case of a violation of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, the fine may be assessed for each day during the period of averaging. 
    Receipt, or non-receipt, of an administrative fine shall in no way relieve the affected user of any and all liability associated with the violation. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, any other enforcement actions by the city against the affected user. 
(e)  Rights of appeal. Except for emergency situations covered under subparagraph (b)(6) of this section, any user desiring to dispute a notice of violation or order of the city, pursuant to this article, including but not limited to fines, may present a written request for reconsideration. Such a request shall be submitted to the city manager within ten days of first being notified of the corresponding order for all but a notice of termination, where such a request shall be submitted within five days of notification. If, in the opinion of the city manager, the request has merit, he will convene a hearing on the matter as soon as possible to collect testimony of appropriate persons, take evidence, and render a final determination. In the event the affected user's appeal is unsuccessful, any original fine will become immediately due and the city may also add any additional costs incurred to administer this appeal. Further appeal of the city manager's final determination shall be governed by applicable state law. 
    Submittal of an appeal shall in no way relieve the affected user of any and all liability associated with the violation. An appeal shall not stay the corresponding order, or limit any other enforcement proceedings by the city against the affected user. 
(f)  Judicial penalties. When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article or order issued hereunder, or other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city attorney may petition the Circuit Court of Macomb County for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief. 
(1)  Injunctive relief. A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article or order issued hereunder, or other pretreatment standard or requirement will be liable to issuance of a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction, or both as may be appropriate. This action will be sought to restrain or compel activities on the part of the affected user. 
A petition for injunctive relief shall in no way relieve the affected user of any and all liability associated with the violation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, any other actions by the city against the affected user. 
(2)  Civil penalties. A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article or order issued hereunder, or other pretreatment standard or requirement will be liable for a civil penalty of up to $500.00 per violation. Each day during which the violation occurred or continues to occur may be deemed a separate distinct violation and, in the case of a violation of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, the penalty may be assessed for each day during the period of the averaging. The affected user will also be liable for all costs incurred by the city for associated enforcement action such as reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, additional sampling and monitoring expenses, as well as costs of any environmental damage and any fines imposed upon the city for NPDES permit violations that result in whole or in part from the user's violation and expenses associated with remediation of sites thereby contaminated. The city attorney may petition the court to impose, assess, and recover sums up to this limit of liability. In determining the appropriate amount of civil penalty to seek, the city may take into account all relevant circumstances including but not limited to the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained by the affected user as a result of the violation, corrective actions implemented or proposed to be implemented by the affected user, and history of compliance or noncompliance by the affected user. 
A suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, any other actions by the city against the affected user. 
(3)  Criminal prosecution.

    All users subject to this article shall retain and preserve for no less than three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries thereto, relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analyses made by or in behalf of a user in connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the city pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved by the user until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired. 
(Ord. No. 149, § XIV, 10-15-01) 
Sec. 94-120. - User charge system. 
(a)  Established basis for computations. Revisions to the rates for total sewer service charges are to be established by resolution of the city council, which may be enacted apart from the published ordinances as necessary to ensure sufficiency of revenues in meeting operation, maintenance and replacement costs, as well as debt service. User charges for operation, maintenance and replacement shall be subject to the annual review of the user charge system. User charges shall be the same for all customers of the system regardless of geographical boundaries. Such charges and rates shall be made against each lot, parcel of land or premises which may have any sewer connections with the sewer system of the city, or which may otherwise discharge sewage or industrial waste, either directly or indirectly, into such system or any part thereof. Such charges shall be based upon the quantity of water used thereon or therein. 
(b)  Amounts, billings, sewer service charges. The rates and charges for service furnished by such system shall be levied upon each lot or parcel of land, building or premises, having any sewer connection with such system, on the basis of the quantity of water used thereon or therein as the same is measured therein used, or in the absence thereof, by such equitable method as shall be determined by the city, and shall be collected in accordance with the city's water/sewer operation and administration ordinance except in cases where the character of the sewage from a manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that unreasonable additional burden is placed upon the system, greater than that imposed by the normal domestic sewage delivered to the system plant, the additional cost of treatment created thereby shall be an additional charge over the regular rates hereinafter set forth; or the city may, if it deems it advisable, compel such manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises, to treat such sewage in such manner as shall be specified by the city before discharging such sewage into the sewage disposal system. Rates for all users obtaining all or part of their water supply from sources other than the city water system may be determined by gauging or metering the actual sewage entering the system or by metering the water used by them, in a manner acceptable to the city. 
(c)  Annual audit. The rates hereby fixed are estimated to be sufficient to provide for the expenses of operation, maintenance and replacement of the system as are necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order. Such rates shall be fixed and revised from time to time as may be necessary to produce these amounts. An annual audit shall be prepared. Based on said audit, rates for sewage services shall be reviewed annually and revised as necessary by the city council by resolution to meet system expenses and to insure that all user classes pay their proportionate share of operation, maintenance and equipment replacement cost. 
(d)  No free service. No free service shall be allowed for any user of the wastewater treatment works. 
(e)  Billing. Billing for wastewater service shall be the city's responsibility. All water meters shall be read and bills rendered in accordance with the city's water/sewer operation and administration ordinance. 
(f)  Termination of service for nonpayment. If payment is not received or satisfactory arrangements have not been made by 30 days after due date, an additional charge of ten percent of the total unpaid balance shall be added. 
    If payment is not received or satisfactory arrangements have not been made within 30 days of the due date on the bill, a shut-off notice will be sent by first class mail to inform the user that failure to respond will result in termination of sewer service. If payment is not received or satisfactory arrangements have not been made within seven days after the shut-off notice is sent to the user, the sewer service shall be shut off. No sewer service that has been discontinued due to nonpayment shall be restored until all past-due bills are paid or satisfactory arrangements for such payment are made. 
    For the purposes of this section, termination of the water service supply shall be considered the same as termination of the sewer service supply. 
(g)  Collection of delinquent accounts. Unpaid charges for sewage disposal service furnished to any premise within the city shall be a lien against the premise. Enforcement of this lien shall be made pursuant to city code and/or statute. This lien remedy does not preclude any other remedy provided by law. Those premises outside the city that are served by the city's wastewater treatment works that have delinquent bills will be certified to their governmental unit for collection as provided in the contract between the city and the governmental unit. 
(Ord. No. 149, § XV, 10-15-01) 
Sec. 94-121. - Variance. 
    Any person, upon written application to the city manager's office within 90 days after the effective date of this article, who shows, in the case of the activity being conducted or operated, that compliance with section 94-113 of this article would either be impossible or constitute an undue hardship because of time limitations, may be granted a variance by the city manager for a reasonable time, not to extend beyond two years from the effective date of this article, as amended, at which date all variances shall terminate and after which date no new variances will be granted. Any variance granted by the city manager within six months from the date of the granting of the variance shall make reports to the city manager periodically as to the progress being made toward compliance with section 94-113 of this article. A variance will not be granted under the provisions of this section where a person applying therefor is causing a public nuisance or other injury to the general public, or is subject to a national categorical standard, and any such variances shown to have been granted under these circumstances shall be immediately terminated. Any variance granted under the provisions of this section shall not be construed to relieve the person who shall receive it from any liability or penalties imposed by other law for the commission or maintenance of a nuisance.

ARTICLE IV. - WOODLANDS AND TREE PRESERVATION 

Sec. 98-81. - Woodlands and tree protection findings; purpose; definitions. 
(a)  Findings. The City of Richmond finds that rapid growth, the spread of development and increasing demands upon natural resources have had the effect of encroaching upon, despoiling, or eliminating many of the trees, woodlands and other forms of vegetation and natural resources and processes associated therewith which if preserved and maintained in an undisturbed and natural condition, constitute important physical, aesthetic, recreational, health, and economic assets to existing and future residents of the city. Specifically, the city finds: 
(1)  That trees and woodlands protect public health through the absorption of air pollutants and contamination, by the reduction of excessive noise and mental and physical damage related to noise pollution, and through their cooling effect in the summer months; 
(2)  That trees and woodlands are an essential component of the general welfare of the city by maintaining natural beauty, recreational opportunities, wildlife habitat, and irreplaceable heritage for existing and future city residents; 
(3)  That trees and woodlands play an important role in filtering waste water which passes through the ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers; 
(4)  That trees and woodlands, through their root systems, stabilize the soil and play an important and effective part in city-wide soil conservation, erosion control, and flood control; 
(5)  That trees and woodlands appreciably reduce the carbon dioxide content and increase the oxygen of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air; 
(6)  That the protection of such natural resources is a matter of paramount public concern, as provided by Article IV, Section 52 of the Constitution of the State of Michigan and the Michigan Environmental Protection Act MCL 324.1701 et seq. 
(b)  Purposes. The purposes of this section are:

4.  Performance guarantees shall continue until such time as the city notifies the surety that the conditions imposed upon the development have been met. The surety shall not release the performance guarantee until the zoning official is satisfied that the conditions for such action have been met. 
5.  As work progresses, the city may rebate cash deposits in reasonable proportion to the ratio of work completed on the required improvements. Ten percent of the guarantee shall be retained by the city pending a successful final inspection by the zoning official of all required improvements.

ARTICLE 2. - ZONING DISTRICTS AND MAP 
DIVISION 1. - PURPOSE OF DISTRICTS 

Sec. 2.101 - Zoning districts. 
    For the purpose of this ordinance, the City of Richmond is hereby divided into districts as follows: 
DISTRICT NAME SYMBOL Single-family residential districts R-1, R-2, and R-3 Two-family residential district R-T Multiple-family residential district RM-1 Manufactured housing park district R-4 Office district O Local business district B-1 Downtown business district B-2 General business district B-3 Limited industrial district I-1 General industrial district I-2 Public/semi-public services district PSP  
Sec. 2.102. - Zoning map. 
    The city is hereby divided into districts, with the district areas and boundaries as shown on the official city zoning map, along with all proper notations, references and explanatory matter. The official zoning map shall be adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. This map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor and attested by the city clerk, and bearing the seal of the city under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of the City of Richmond, effective as of _______, the ___ day of ________, ___." 
    If in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official zoning map, such changes shall be entered on the map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the city council. No changes of any nature shall be made on the official zoning map, except in conformity with the amendment procedures set forth in section 25.03 (amendments), or in conformity with the procedures set forth in the City and Village Zoning Act (P.A. 207 of 1921, as amended) for adoption of a new official zoning map. The official zoning map shall be kept in the office of the city clerk, and shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land, water areas, and structures in the city. 
Sec. 2.103. - Single-family residential (R-1, R-2 and R-3) districts. 
    The single-family residential (R-1, R-2, and R-3) districts are hereby established for the purpose of providing a range of housing choices, encouraging the development and maintenance of suitable neighborhoods for families and children, and limiting uses that would adversely impact residential neighborhoods. The intent of these districts is to provide for an environment of predominantly single-family detached dwellings, along with other associated uses and facilities that serve residents in the district (including educational, cultural and religious land uses, parks and playgrounds). 
    It is the further intent of these districts to prohibit or restrict any land use that would substantially interfere with development or continuation of single-family detached dwellings in the district, would generate traffic on minor or local streets in excess of normal traffic serving the residences on those streets, or would, because of its character or size, create requirements and costs for public services (such as fire and police protection), water supply or sewerage, substantially in excess of such requirements and costs if the district were developed solely for single-family dwellings. 
Sec. 2.104. - Two-family residential (R-T) district. 
    The two-family residential (R-T) district is hereby established for the purpose of providing a range of housing choices, encouraging the development and maintenance of suitable neighborhoods for families and children, prohibiting uses of land that would adversely impact residential neighborhoods, creating a buffer or transition zone between single family residential districts and other more intensive land uses, and discouraging uses that would generate traffic on local streets in excess of normal traffic generated by the neighborhood. The intent of the district is to provide for an environment of predominantly detached and attached single-family dwellings and two-family (duplex) dwellings, along with other associated uses and facilities that serve the residents in the district, including but not limited to educational, cultural and religious land uses, parks and playgrounds. 
    It is further the intent of this district to recognize that some larger houses in certain older neighborhoods have been converted from single-family use into a two-family dwelling to extend the economic life of the structure and allow the owner to justify substantial renovation or modernization costs. The construction of new two-family dwellings and attached single-family dwellings at planned locations in the city shall also be permitted in the district to meet the needs of the different age and family groups. 
    Uses in this district shall be subject to appropriate design, density and development standards (including density, bulk, setback and separation standards, and provisions for sufficient light, air, privacy and recreation areas). The standards of this district are intended to prevent congestion on public streets, reduce hazards to life and property, provide adequate recreation areas and basic amenities, and ensure compatibility with adjacent single-family residential districts. 
Sec. 2.105. - Multiple-family residential (RM-1) district. 
    The multiple-family residential (RM-1) district is hereby established to promote a harmonious mixture of higher density housing options (such as apartments, townhouses, condominiums and stacked flats) at planned locations in the community to meet the needs of the different age and family groups. Associated uses and facilities that serve the residents in the district (including educational, cultural and religious land uses, parks and playgrounds) shall also be provided within a primarily residential environment. 
    The multiple family residential district is further intended to serve as a transition zone between non-residential districts and lower density residential districts. Uses in this district should be located near streets with adequate planned capacity to accommodate the traffic volumes typically generated by higher density development, and shall be served by public water and sewerage systems and other appropriate urban facilities and services. 
    Development in the multiple family residential district shall be subject to appropriate design, density and development standards (including density, bulk, setback and separation standards, and provisions for sufficient light, air, privacy and recreation areas) that are intended to prevent congestion on public streets, reduce hazards to life and property, provide adequate recreation areas and basic amenities, and ensure compatibility with adjacent single-family residential districts. 
Sec. 2.106. - Manufactured housing park (R-4) district. 
    The manufactured housing park (R-4) district is hereby established to provide for the location and regulation of manufactured housing parks (formerly known as "mobile home parks"), as defined by the Mobile Home Commission Act, P.A. 96 of 1987 (as amended), and the Manufactured Housing Commission General Rules. It is intended that manufactured housing parks be provided with necessary community services and other associated uses and facilities that serve the residents in the district (including educational, cultural and religious land uses, parks and playgrounds) in a setting that provides a high quality of life for residents. In accordance with the purpose of this district, manufactured housing parks shall be located in areas where they will be compatible with adjacent land uses. 
    The regulations and rules established by the State of Michigan (Mobile Home Commission Act, P.A. 96 of 1987, as amended) and the Manufactured Housing Commission govern all manufactured housing parks. Where regulations in this article and ordinance exceed the state law or general rules, they are intended to promote the health, safety and welfare of the city's residents, and to insure that manufactured housing parks are developed and maintained in a manner equivalent to the standards established by this ordinance for comparable residential developments in the city. Further, the district is intended to meet the needs of the different age and family groups in the community, prevent congestion on the public streets, minimize hazards to life and property, and ensure sufficient provisions for light, air, privacy, recreation areas and basic amenities to serve the residents of the district. 
Sec. 2.107. - Office (O) district. 
    The office (O) district is hereby established for the purpose of accommodating various types of executive, administrative, business, medical, governmental and professional offices, and associated business services. A limited range of convenience retail, restaurant and personal service businesses shall also be permitted for the benefit of office personnel and visitors, provided that offices remain the predominant use within the district. The office (O) district is intended to be located along major streets, in close proximity to commercial and institutional uses, serving as a transition zone between these more-intensive land uses and less intensive residential uses. Those types of retail uses and other activities that typically generate large traffic volumes, substantial parking requirements, or other impacts shall be prohibited. 
Sec. 2.108. - Local business (B-1) district. 
    The local business (B-1) district is hereby established to provide for local service and convenience shopping facilities to meet the day-to-day needs of persons residing in nearby residential areas. It is the intent of the local business district to encourage concentrations of complementary businesses in a manner harmonious with the character of the neighborhood and surrounding uses, and to the mutual advantage of neighborhood residents and district merchants. The intended potential customer base for these uses would be the residential neighborhoods immediately adjacent to district. 
    Uses which would create hazards, offensive and loud noises, vibration, smoke, glare, heavy traffic or late hours of operation are prohibited, and building sizes for permitted uses are limited to promote such appropriately scaled business development in the district. Automotive-related services and other uses that would typically interfere with the continuity of retail frontage, hinder pedestrian circulation, disrupt the functioning of this district, or create hazards, offensive or loud noises, vibration, smoke, glare or heavy traffic shall also be prohibited. 
Sec. 2.109. - Downtown business (B-2) district. 
    The downtown business (B-2) district is hereby established for the purpose of promoting the orderly development, expansion and continuation of the city's downtown commercial core, which serves the comparison, convenience, service, and cultural needs of city residents, visitors and surrounding rural areas for convenience and durable goods, personal services, food, entertainment, shopping and related activities. The B-2 district boundaries are intended to include both historic nodes of business activity in the city identified in the master plan; the "Richmond Granary District" and the "Historic Richmond Business District." 
    It is the intent of the downtown business district to preserve the existing downtown character, strengthen and extend the historic development pattern, and promote a highly concentrated and pedestrian-accessible mix of complementary retail, restaurant, entertainment, office and service uses. Building owners in the downtown business district are encouraged to provide retail or personal service uses at the street level. In buildings without such uses, other active uses of visual interest to pedestrians should be displayed, including office or lobby areas, showrooms, classrooms, kitchens, or similar activities. 
    These objectives shall be accomplished through land use, site and building layout standards, and careful coordination of vehicular and pedestrian circulation. Uses in the downtown business district are encouraged to provide or enhance public spaces, contribute to centralized parking arrangements and develop innovative combinations of permitted uses that allow for the rehabilitation of existing historic structures or the creation of new structures that complement the architectural character and composition of the District's historic buildings. 
    Parking facilities in the district shall be designed to serve the area rather than individual businesses. Uses which would create hazards, offensive and loud noises, vibration, smoke, glare, heavy traffic or late hours of operation are prohibited, and building sizes for permitted uses are limited to promote such appropriately scaled business development in the district. Automotive-related services and other uses that would typically interfere with the continuity of retail frontage, hinder pedestrian circulation, disrupt the functioning of this district, or create hazards, offensive or loud noises, vibration, smoke, glare or heavy traffic shall be prohibited. 
Sec. 2.110. - General business (B-3) district. 
    The general business (B-3) district is hereby established to permit a wide range of business and entertainment activities, including uses of a larger size, scale or intensity than those found in other business or office districts (such as "big-box" retail uses). The intended potential customer base for permitted uses in this district would be the entire city, plus surrounding communities in the southeastern Michigan region. This district is further intended to provide opportunities for automobile-related businesses, uses that generate large traffic volumes or require substantial off-street parking facilities, and other uses incompatible with the pedestrian-oriented character, scale and mix of permitted uses in the local or central business districts. Accordingly, this district should be generally located near major streets and thoroughfares to prevent potential nuisances and use conflicts. 
    Because of the types of uses permitted in the general business district, detailed attention must be focused on relationships with adjacent areas, site layout, building design, and vehicular and pedestrian circulation. Development in the district shall be compatible in design with the overall city character, designed in coordination with adjoining sites, buffered from or located away from residential areas, and served by major streets or thoroughfares. 
Sec. 2.111. - Limited industrial (I-1) district. 
    The limited industrial (I-1) district is hereby established for the purpose of permitting certain industries of a light manufacturing, research, warehousing or wholesaling character to locate in planned areas of the city where such uses will not have a detrimental impact on surrounding neighborhoods. This district is not intended for the processing of raw materials for bulk shipment or use in industrial operations at other locations. 
    It is further intended that the limited industrial district provide specific use and site development standards designed to promote the creation of high quality office, research, warehousing, wholesaling and manufacturing facilities. To meet the purpose and intent of this district, certain land uses are prohibited, including, but not limited to uses that would create excessive or unusual danger of fire, explosion, toxicity, or exposure to radiation or other unusually noxious, offensive, unhealthy and harmful odors, fumes, dust, smoke, light, waste, noise or vibration. 
Sec. 2.112. - General industrial (I-2) district. 
    The general industrial (I-2) district is hereby established for the purpose of permitting a wide range of office, research, industrial and manufacturing uses and facilities in planned areas of the city where such uses and facilities would not have a detrimental impact on surrounding neighborhoods or the city as a whole. The intent of the general industrial district is to promote the creation of high quality industrial, research and manufacturing jobs, and permit more intensive, large-scale or specialized industrial operations requiring special sites or public and utility services. Reasonable regulations and limitations apply to these more intense uses to minimize any adverse effects on other areas of the city. 
    The further intent of the general industrial district is to: 
1.  Primarily accommodate wholesale activities, warehouses, and industrial operations whose external, physical effects are restricted to the area of the district. 
2.  Provide sufficient space to meet the city's expected future needs for additional research, manufacturing and related industrial uses. 
3.  Promote manufacturing development that is free from danger of fire, explosions, toxic and noxious matter and other hazards, and from offensive noise, vibration, smoke, odor and other objectionable influences. 
4.  Protect the character and established pattern of adjacent development, conserve the value of land and structures, and enhance the city's tax base. 
Sec. 2.113. - Public/semi-public services (PSP) district. 
    The public/semi-public services (PSP) district is hereby established for the purpose of accommodating dedicated areas of open space, government buildings and uses, institutional and recreational uses, and similar uses of a public service or institutional character, including areas for off-street parking as an accessory use to serve an abutting district that has developed without adequate off-street parking facilities. 
DIVISION 2. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS 

Sec. 2.201. - Principal uses and special condition uses. 
    In all districts, no structure or land shall be used or occupied, except in conformance with section 4.02 (table of permitted land uses by district), and as otherwise provided for in this ordinance.

DIVISION 2. - RESIDENTIAL USES 

Sec. 6.201. - Accessory dwelling units. 
    It is the intent of this section to permit apartments accessory to and within principal single-family dwellings in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 districts for the purpose of accommodating the desire of some senior citizens, family groups, and other persons with special needs for private housing close to relatives, and to extend the economic life of some larger houses in certain older neighborhoods by allowing the owner to justify substantial renovation or modernization costs. 
    It is further the intent of this section to permit apartments accessory to and within principal buildings occupied by office and service uses or commercial uses in the B-1 (local business) and B-2 (downtown business) districts, subject to specific standards designed to preserve the predominantly commercial character of these districts. 
    The standards of this section are designed to prevent the undesirable proliferation of multiple-family buildings in predominantly single-family neighborhoods, and to preserve the character and appearance of principal buildings that include one or more accessory dwelling units. 
A.  Accessory to detached single-family dwellings. The following shall apply to dwelling units accessory to detached single-family dwellings: 
1.  All accessory dwelling units shall be located entirely within the principal building. Accessory dwelling units shall be prohibited in any detached accessory structures. 
2.  The exterior of the principal building shall remain unchanged, so that it does not give the appearance of being divided into separate units. Access to an accessory dwelling unit shall be limited to a common front foyer, or a separate entrance door on a side wall. The use of exterior stairways to provide access to upper floor accessory dwellings shall be prohibited. 
3.  Each accessory dwelling unit shall have a minimum gross floor area of 450 square-feet, and accessory dwelling units not occupy more than 25 percent of the principal building's gross floor area. 
4.  The principal building shall be the primary and permanent legal residence of the owner(s) of the property. The owner(s) of the property shall occupy a minimum of 1,500 square feet of gross floor area within the principal building. Permitted accessory dwelling units shall be clearly secondary to the use of the dwelling as a residence. 
B.  Accessory to office and services uses or commercial uses. The following shall apply to dwelling units accessory to office and services uses or commercial uses: 
1.  Accessory dwelling units shall be contained entirely within the principal building, and shall occupy no more than 50 percent of the gross floor area of the building. 
2.  Accessory dwelling units shall not be located on the ground floor or basement of the principal building. 
3.  Each accessory dwelling unit shall have separate kitchen, bath, and toilet facilities and a private entrance. Where there is more than one accessory dwelling unit in a building, such entrances may be provided from a common hallway. 
Sec. 6.202. - Adult foster care large group homes, and other managed or state-licensed residential facilities. 
    The following regulations shall apply to adult foster care large group homes, and other managed or state-licensed residential facilities: 
1.  Licensing. In accordance with applicable state laws, such uses shall be registered with or licensed by the State of Michigan, and shall comply with the standards outlined for such facilities. 
2.  Separation requirements. New adult foster care large group homes and other managed or state-licensed residential facilities shall be located a minimum of 1,500 feet from any other state licensed residential facility, as measured between the nearest points on the property lines of the lots in question. The planning commission may permit a smaller separation between such facilities upon determining that such action will not result in an excessive concentration of such facilities in a single neighborhood, or in the city overall.

Sec. 8.202. - Procedures for determining compliance. 
    In the event that the city receives complaints or otherwise acquires evidence of possible violation of any of the performance standards set forth in section 8.201 (performance standards), the following procedures shall be used to investigate, and if necessary, resolve the violation: 
A.  Official investigation. Upon receipt of evidence of possible violation, the city planner or designated city consultant shall make a determination whether there is reasonable cause to suspect the operation is indeed in violation of the performance standards. The city planner may initiate an official investigation in order to make such a determination. 
Upon initiation of an official investigation, the city planner is empowered to require the owner or operator of the facility in question to submit data and evidence deemed necessary to make an objective determination regarding the possible violation. Failure of the owner or operator to supply requested data shall constitute grounds for taking legal action to terminate the use or deny or rescind any permits required for continued use of the land. Data which may be required includes, but is not limited to the following: 
1.  Plans of the existing or proposed facilities, including buildings and equipment. 
2.  A description of the existing or proposed machinery, processes, and products. 
3.  Specifications for the mechanisms and techniques used or proposed to be used to control emissions regulated under the provisions of this section. 
4.  Measurement of the amount or rate of emissions of materials purported to be in violation. 
B.  Method and cost of determination. The city planner or designated city consultant shall take measurements and complete investigation necessary to make an objective determination concerning the purported violation. Where required measurements and investigation can be accurately using equipment and personnel normally available to the city without extraordinary expense, such measurements and investigation shall be completed before notice of violation is issued. If necessary, skilled personnel and spec equipment or instruments shall be secured to make the required determination. 
If the alleged violation is found to exist in fact, the costs of making such determination shall be charged against those responsible, in addition to such other penalties as may be appropriate. If it is determined that no substantive violation exists then such costs shall be paid by the city. 
C.  Appropriate remedies. If, after appropriate investigation, the city planner or designated city consultant determines that a violation does exist, the city planner shall provide written notice of the violation to the owners or operators of the facility deemed responsible, and shall request that the violation be corrected within a specified time limit. 
1.  Correction of violation within time limit. If the alleged violation is corrected within the specified time limit, the city planner shall note "violation corrected" on the city's copy of the notice, which shall be retained on file. 
2.  Violation not corrected and no reply from owner or operator. If there is no reply from the owner or operator within the specified time limits and the alleged violation is not corrected, then the city planner shall take such action as may be warranted to correct the violation. In accordance with the regulations set forth in this section. 
3.  Reply requesting time extension. If a reply is received within the specified time limit indicating that an alleged violation will be corrected, but that more time is required, the city planner may grant an extension upon determining that the extension is warranted because of the circumstances in the case and will not cause imminent peril to life, health, or property. 
4.  Reply requesting technical determination. If a reply is received within the specified time limit request further review and technical analysis even though the alleged violations continue, then the city planner may call in properly qualified experts to complete such analysis and confirm or refute the initial determination of violation. 
D.  Costs and penalties incurred. If expert findings indicate that violations do exist in fact, the costs incurred in making such a determination shall be paid by the persons responsible for the violations in addition to other applicable penalties under this ordinance. Such costs shall be billed to those owners or operators of the use deemed responsible for the violation. 
If the bill is not paid within 30 days, the city may take necessary action to recover such costs, or may charge such costs against the property where the violation occurred.

Sec. 9.09. - Modification of standards. 
    Limited modifications to the standards of this article shall be permitted, subject to the following: 
A.  Special parking districts. Special parking districts may be established by the city council, with recommendation from the planning commission. The purpose of such districts is to define areas of the city within which a reduction of off-street parking requirements for individual uses shall be permitted due to the availability of public parking lots owned or operated by the city, on-street parking, and similar public parking facilities. The boundaries of areas classified as special parking districts shall be delineated on the official zoning map. 
Individual uses within the boundaries of a special parking district shall not be required to construct or maintain private off-street parking facilities, provided that the use is located within 750 feet of an existing or planned off-street public parking lot. 
B.  Off-site parking facilities. Required parking facilities accessory to non-residential uses in any zoning district may be located off-site (on other than the same zoning lot as the use served), subject to the following: 
1.  Required parking shall be located within 500 feet of a principal building entrance for the use. 
2.  Use of off-site parking spaces within a residential zoning district shall be prohibited. 
3.  A written agreement shall be drawn to the satisfaction of the city attorney and executed by all parties concerned assuring the continued availability of the off-site parking facilities for the use they are intended to serve. 
C.  Exceeding maximum number of required spaces. The planning commission may require any use to provide parking spaces above the required minimum, up to the maximum permitted by this section. Exceeding the maximum parking space requirements shall be prohibited, except where the planning commission determines that additional parking is necessary to accommodate the use on a typical day of operation, based upon evidence supplied by the applicant. 
D.  Deferment of parking spaces. Where an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the planning commission that the minimum required number of parking spaces is excessive, the planning commission may approve the construction of a lesser number of parking spaces, provided that the deferred parking is shown on the site plan and set aside as open space. Deferred parking spaces shall be constructed in accordance with the approved site plan upon written request by the city after the city planner has documented three incidents of problem parking on the site. 
E.  Modification of loading space requirements. The planning commission may modify or waive the requirement for off-street loading areas, upon determining that adequate public or private loading space is available to serve the building or use, or that provision of such loading space is unnecessary or impractical to provide. 
F.  Other circumstances. The planning commission may modify or waive off-street parking requirements under any of the following circumstances: 
1.  A combination of off-street parking spaces and on-street spaces adjacent to the lot can effectively accommodate the parking needs of a given use without negatively impacting traffic safety or adjacent uses. 
2.  Sufficient evidence has been provided by the applicant to demonstrate that an alternative parking standard would be more appropriate for the type, scale or intensity of the use. 
Sec. 9.10. - Maintenance. 
    All parking and loading areas shall be maintained in accordance with the provisions of this article, an approved site plan and the following: 
1.  Alterations to an approved parking or loading facility that are not in accordance with an approved site plan shall be considered a violation of this ordinance. 
2.  All parking areas, perimeter landscaped areas, and required screening shall be kept free from tall grass, weeds, trash, and debris. Surfacing, curbing, lighting fixtures, signage, and related appurtenances shall be kept in good repair.

ARTICLE 10. - ACCESS MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 10.01. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to protect the substantial public investment in the city's street system by preserving the traffic capacity of existing streets. It is the further intent of this article to promote safe and efficient travel within the city; minimize disruptive and potentially hazardous traffic conflicts; establish efficient standards for driveway spacing and the number of driveways; and ensure reasonable vehicular access to properties, though not always the most direct access. 
    The standards are specifically designed for public streets classified as collector streets, arterials or thoroughfares in the master transportation plans for the city, county or state road authorities, whose primary function is the movement of through traffic. 
Sec. 10.02. - Scope. 
    The standards of this article shall apply to all sites, uses, and developments subject to planning commission review that abut a public street classified as a collector or thoroughfare in the master transportation plans for the city, county or state road authorities. This article shall not apply to sites, uses, and developments exclusively abutting local streets whose primary function is to provide vehicular access to abutting lots. 
    The provisions of this article shall be applied to the extent determined reasonable and appropriate by the planning commission, in addition to any requirements of the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) or county road authorities. If a conflict arises in the application of these provisions in conjunction with county or state road authority requirements, the more stringent standard shall apply. 
Sec. 10.03. - Number of permitted driveways. 
    The number of non-residential driveways permitted per zoning lot shall be the minimum necessary, as determined by the planning commission, to provide reasonable access for regular traffic and emergency vehicles, while preserving traffic operations and safety along the public roadway. Such determinations shall be based on the street frontage of the zoning lot and the provisions of section 10.04 (driveway offsets and spacing standards), and the following: 
1.  Where an existing site includes driveways that are not in conformance with the standards of this article, the planning commission may require the closing of one or more nonconforming driveways as part of any site plan approval. 
2.  Where feasible, new vehicular access to a site shall be provided by a shared driveway, cross-access drive or service drive in accordance with section 10.05 (shared access). 
3.  Additional driveways may be permitted where determined by the planning commission to adequately accommodate traffic or ensure public safety. 
Sec. 10.04. - Driveway offsets and spacing standards. 
    Driveways along collector streets, arterials or thoroughfares accessory to multiple-family and non-residential uses and developments shall be located so as to minimize interference with the free movement of traffic, to provide adequate sight distance, and to provide the most favorable driveway grade. Vehicle access from public streets classified as a collector or thoroughfare in the master transportation plans for the city, county or state road authorities shall be subject to the following:. 
A.  Driveway offsets along public rights-of-way. Where feasible, new driveways shall be aligned with existing driveways or streets on the opposite side of an collector or thoroughfare (see illustration). 
1.  If such alignment is not feasible, new driveways shall be offset from existing driveways or streets a minimum of 250 feet along arterials or thoroughfares, and 150 feet along collector streets. 
2.  Greater offsets may be required in accordance with the findings and recommendations of a traffic impact study conducted in accordance with section 10.06 (traffic impact studies). 
3.  The planning commission may modify these standards based upon site and use locations and conditions. 
B.  Driveway spacing standards. The minimum spacing between driveways and street intersections, and between separate driveways without traffic lights, shall be determined based upon the posted speed limit of the abutting collector street or thoroughfare. 
The following minimum spacing standards are based on Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) standards and shall be measured from the centerlines of the driveways or street right-of-way: 
POSTED SPEED LIMIT MINIMUM DRIVEWAY SPACING 25 mph 130 feet 30 mph 185 feet 35 mph 245 feet 40 mph 300 feet 45 mph 350 feet 50+ mph 455 feet  
Where a site has insufficient street frontage to meet the above standards, the planning commission may approve any of the following alternatives: 
1.  The closing of at least one existing nonconforming driveway on the site, or construction of a new driveway access on an abutting local street. 
2.  Location of a new driveway at a point that maximizes driveway spacing and separation distance. 
3.  Indirect access via a shared driveway, service drive, or cross-access connection with an adjacent lot or use. 
Sec. 10.05. - Shared access. 
    The development and use of shared driveways, cross-access drives, service drives, and similar means of shared access connecting two or more lots or uses shall be encouraged, in accordance with the purpose of this article. Upon determination that the number of vehicular access points along a collector street or thoroughfare is excessive based on the standards of this article, the planning commission may require the use of a shared driveway, cross-access drive or service drive to provide primary or secondary vehicular access as part of a site plan approval. 
A.  Location. New shared driveways, cross-access drives, and service drives shall be aligned with existing drives on adjacent lots where feasible, and parallel or perpendicular to the street right-of-way. 
B.  Cross-access easement. Shared driveways, cross-access drives, and service drives shall be located within a dedicated access easement that permits traffic circulation between lots, which shall be recorded with the county register of deeds office. 
C.  Construction and materials. Shared driveways, cross-access drives, and service drives shall be paved with concrete, bituminous asphalt or similar hard-surfacing materials, in accordance with the construction and design standards established by the city. The grade of such drives shall be coordinated with existing or planned drives on adjacent lots. 
D.  Temporary access. The planning commission may approve temporary driveways on the arterial street or thoroughfare as part of a site plan approval where continuation of shared access is not currently feasible, but is anticipated to be constructed within the next five years. 
A performance guarantee shall be submitted by the applicant in accordance with section 1.06 (performance guarantees), to ensure closure and removal of the temporary access when the new shared access is constructed. 
E.  Maintenance. The easement area shall remain clear of obstructions, and shall not be used for parking unless otherwise approved by the planning commission. Each property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of the shared access. A maintenance agreement may be required by the planning commission, subject to review and approval by the city attorney. 
Sec. 10.06. - Traffic impact studies. 
    Where authorized by this ordinance or determined necessary by the planning commission, a traffic impact study (TIS) shall be prepared by an applicant to determine the potential future traffic conditions on the adjacent roadways once a proposed use is established or development is completed. The city may utilize its own traffic consultant to review the TIS, with the cost of the review being borne by the applicant per section 1.05 (fees). 
    The results of the TIS shall be used in the final design of access points and internal circulation and may identify necessary off-site road improvements. At a minimum, the TIS shall meet standards of the Southeastern Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) and Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) handbook entitled Evaluating Traffic Impact Studies. The planning commission may modify the TIS requirements or scope based upon site and use location and conditions. 
    At a minimum, the TIS shall include the following: 
1.  An analysis of existing traffic conditions and/or site restrictions using current data. 
2.  Projected trip generation at the subject site or along the subject service drive based on the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation manual. The city may approve use of other trip generation data if based on recent studies of at least three similar uses within similar locations in Michigan. 
3.  Illustrations of current and projected turning movements at access points, including identification of potential impacts of the development on the operation of the abutting streets. Capacity analysis shall be based on the most recent edition of the of the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual , and shall be provided in an appendix to the TIS. 
4.  Description of the internal vehicular circulation and parking system for passenger vehicles and delivery trucks, as well as the circulation system for pedestrians, bicycles and other users. 
5.  Prediction of the peak-hour operational conditions at site driveways and road intersections affected by the development. 
6.  Justification of need, including statements describing how any altered or additional access points will meet the intent of this article, preserve public safety and road capacity, and be consistent with the adopted master transportation plans for the city, county or state road authorities. 
7.  Qualifications and documented experience of the author in preparing traffic impact studies in Michigan. The preparer shall be either a registered traffic engineer (P.E.) or a transportation planner, with at least three years of experience preparing traffic impact studies in Michigan. If the TIS includes geometric design, the study shall be prepared or supervised by a registered engineer with adequate experience in traffic engineering.

Sec. 10.07. - Gratiot Avenue Corridor Overlay Zone. 
A.  Intent. The intent of the Gratiot Avenue Corridor Overlay Zone is to improve traffic operations and reduce potential for crashes through regulations on the number, spacing, placement and design of access points. Numerous published reports and recommendations by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and other transportation organizations have identified a direct correlation between the number of access points and the number of crashes. Those studies also demonstrate that appropriate standards on the number and placement of access points (driveways and side street intersections) can preserve the capacity of a major corridor, like Gratiot Avenue, whose primary function is to move traffic, with a secondary function to provide reasonable access to properties along the road. The standards herein are based on recommendations published by various national and Michigan agencies that were refined during preparation of the Gratiot Avenue Corridor Improvement Plan. 
Further, these regulations are intended to protect the substantial public investment in the road system and helps avoid the need for costly reconstruction, which causes traffic congestion with associated emissions and disrupts businesses. The procedures outlined in this section are intended to promote a more coordinated and expedited development review and approval process for site plans and access permits by the city, MDOT and the Road Commission of Macomb County (RCMC). 
B.  Definitions. 
1.  Access management: The process of providing and managing reasonable access to land development while preserving the flow of traffic in terms of safety, capacity, and speed on the abutting road system. 
2.  Intersection: The junction where one road crosses another or where one road terminates into another approximately perpendicular road. Intersections, as referred to in this section, shall mean those both signalized and non-signalized. 
3.  Reasonable access: The minimum number of access connections, direct or indirect, necessary to provide safe access to and from a public road. Reasonable access does not necessarily mean direct access. 
C.  Applicability. 
1.  The standards of this section shall apply to all land with frontage along Gratiot Avenue and all parcels that have all or a portion of its land within 500 feet of the Gratiot Avenue right-of-way. The access standards of this section do not apply to access that serves a single-family home, duplex or essential service facility structure. 
2.  The regulations herein apply in addition to, and simultaneously with, the other applicable regulations of the zoning ordinance. 
3.  The following applications must also comply with the standards in this section. 
a.  New or enlarged building or structure. No new principal building or structure, nor the enlargement of any principal building or structure by more than 25 percent, shall be erected unless the regulations in this overlay zone are met and maintained in connection with such building, structure, or enlargement. 
b.  Reconstruction. No enlargement or reconstruction of on-site parking facilities by more than 25 percent shall be approved unless in compliance with this overlay zone. (This does not apply to milling and resurfacing). 
c.  Land division, subdivision or site condominium. No land division or subdivision or site condominium project within the overlay zone shall be approved unless it is demonstrated access to the site is in compliance with the standards herein. 
d.  Change in use or intensity of use. Any change in use, intensity of use or increase in vehicle trips generated on a site that does not meet the access standards of this overlay zone shall be required to submit a site plan for approval by the planning commission and submit information to the MDOT and/or RCMC to determine if a new access permit is required. 
e.  Extension of site plan approval. In the event that a site plan extension request is made, planning commission shall determine the extent to which the standards apply. Planning commission's decision may be based on considerations such as the number of previous extensions granted to the site plan and the feasibility of accommodating the standards. 
4.  The approval of a land division or site plan application does not negate the responsibility of an applicant to subsequently secure access permits from the road agency (MDOT along Gratiot Avenue or any state trunkline and the appropriate road commission or the City of Richmond). 
5.  Where conflict occurs between the city regulations and road agency regulations, the more restrictive regulations shall apply. 
D.  Submittal information. In addition to the submittal information required for site plan review in section 18.02 (required information for site plans), the following shall be provided with any application listed in subsection C. above: 
1.  Existing access points. Existing access points within 500 feet along both sides of the road frontage and along both sides of any adjoining intersecting roads shall be shown on the site plan, aerial photographs or on a plan sheet. 
2.  Existing and proposed driveways. Dimensions shall be provided for existing and proposed driveways (width, radii, throat length, length of any deceleration lanes or tapers, pavement markings and signs) and all curb radii within the site. Dimensions must also be provided between the existing and proposed driveways within the site and access points within 500 feet along both sides of the Gratiot Avenue frontage and, for corner lots, those along both sides of any adjoining intersecting roads. 
3.  Sites not otherwise subject to planning commission review. Where site access is being reviewed due to a change in use or intensification of use or traffic generated, the city may allow submittal of a sketch plan that contains only the information necessary to review such access. At a minimum, the information required by items 1.-3. above must be provided on a scaled drawing of the overall site conditions. 
E.  Access management standards. The regulations of this section shall be considered by the planning commission during review of access points, streets, private roads and driveways subject to review according to this section. 
1.  Compliance with Corridor Plan. Where property is illustrated in the Gratiot Avenue Corridor Improvement Plan, or other corridor plan, such access shall be provided as shown to the extent possible, as determined by the planning commission. 
2.  Review coordination. The city may contact MDOT and/or RCMC for the opportunity to provide input on the city's decisions on access. Any access permit from the road agency shall be consistent with the city's decision on a site plan or special land use application. An access permit may not be approved by a road agency until the land division or site plan is approved by the city. 
3.  Number of access points. The number of access points, either existing or proposed, shall be the fewest necessary to provide motorists reasonable access to the site. Each lot shall be permitted one access point. Depending on site conditions, this access point may consist of an individual driveway, a shared access with an adjacent use, or access via a service drive. 
4.  Additional access point. An additional access point may be permitted by the planning commission upon finding that one or more of the following, as applicable, are met: 
a.  A need for an additional access point has been demonstrated, and the additional access point will not create negative impacts on through traffic flow or operations. The planning commission may require the submittal of a traffic impact study, prepared in accordance with subsection G. below, to demonstrate the need; and 
b.  A poor level of service will result if access is provided that meets the location and spacing standards and the additional driveway will improve the overall level of service both within the site and on the road. 
OR 
a.  The site has adequate frontage to meet the spacing standards between access points listed below, and the additional access will not prevent adjacent lands from complying with the access spacing standards when such lands develop or redevelop in the future; and 
b.  The additional access point will not create conflicts with access points on adjacent properties or median crossovers, will not create a nonconforming situation for an existing or expected access for an undeveloped site, or it will make an existing nonconforming situation more conforming; and 
c.  If necessary, the site plan includes facilities (such as easements or access agreements) that will allow future shared access to neighboring properties or will implement existing opportunities to provide shared access when the driveway is constructed; and 
d.  The additional driveway is a necessity rather than just a convenience; and 
e.  The additional access is acceptable to the MDOT along Gratiot Avenue or any state trunkline and the RCMC for other roads. 

5.  Spacing of access points on same side of road. Access points shall provide the following spacing from other access points along the same side of the public street (measured from centerline to centerline as shown on the figure), based on the posted speed limit along the abutting road segment, according to the following table. 
Posted Speed limit Along Gratiot Ave* Along other Roads 35 mph or less* 245 ft. 150 ft. 40 mph 300 ft. 185 ft. 45 mph 350 ft. 230 ft. 50 mph 455 ft. 275 ft. 55 mph 455 ft. 350 ft. * unless greater spacing is required by MDOT or required to meet other standards herein  

6.  Offset from access points on opposing side of road. Access points shall be aligned with driveways on the opposite side of the road or offset a minimum of 250 feet (measured from centerline to centerline). The planning commission may reduce this to not less than 150 feet where each of the opposing access point generates less than 50 trips (inbound and outbound) during the peak hour or where existing driveways or sight distance limitations exist. 
7.  Spacing from intersections. Minimum spacing of access points from signalized intersections (measured from road edge to road edge) shall be at least 300 feet from an intersection along Gratiot Avenue. 
8.  Consideration of adjacent sites. Where the subject site adjoins land that may be developed or redeveloped in the future, the access shall be located to ensure the adjacent site(s) can also meet the access location standards in the future. 

9.  Shared driveways and service drives. Where direct access consistent with the above regulations cannot be achieved, access should be provided via a shared driveway or service drive. In particular, the planning commission may require development of service drives where such facilities can provide access to signalized locations, minimize the number of driveways, or provide an efficient means of ingress and egress. 
Service drives shall be constructed in accordance with the following standards: 

(i)  Service drives shall generally be parallel or perpendicular to the front property line and may be located either in front of, adjacent to, or behind, principal buildings. In considering the most appropriate alignment for a service road, the planning commission and the RCMC and/or MDOT shall consider the setbacks of existing buildings and anticipated traffic flow for the site. 
(ii)  The service drive shall be located within an access easement permitting traffic circulation between properties. This easement shall be approved by the city and the RCMC/MDOT and recorded with the Macomb County Register of Deeds. The required width shall remain free and clear of obstructions, unless otherwise approved by the planning commission. Each property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of the easement and service drive. 
(iii)  A minimum of 20 feet shall be maintained between the road right-of-way and the pavement of the service drive, with at least 60 feet of throat depth provided at the access point, where practical, measured between the road right-of-way and the intersecting service drive. 
(iv)  Service drives shall have a minimum pavement width of 24 feet and be constructed of either concrete or asphalt with curb and gutter. The planning commission may modify these standards based upon site conditions, anticipated volumes and types of automobile and truck traffic. 
(v)  Where a service drive is stubbed or intended to be extended onto an adjacent property in the future, the site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the service drive at the property line so that the city can maintain a record of all service road elevations and their grades can be coordinated with future developments. 
(vi)  In cases where a shared access facility is recommended, but is not yet available, temporary direct access may be permitted, provided the plan is designed to accommodate the future service drive, and a written agreement is submitted that the temporary access will be removed by the applicant, when the alternative access system becomes available. The planning commission may require posting of a financial performance guarantee to ensure compliance with such agreement. 
(vii)  If, during redevelopment of existing sites, it is not possible to develop separate service drives, the planning commission and RCMC/MDOT may instead require a drive connecting parking lots with adjacent sites. 
10.  Sight distance. Driveways shall be located to provide safe sight distance, as determined by the staff of MDOT and/or RCMC. 
F.  Modification of access standards. Modifications to the standards herein may be permitted by the planning commission according to the following procedure: 
1.  Allowed modifications. The planning commission may, after considering the criteria in #2 below, modify the standards of this section in the following situations: 
a.  The modification will allow an existing driveway to remain that does not meet the standards of this section but that has, or is expected to have very low traffic volumes (less than 50 in- and out-bound trips per day) and is not expected to significantly impact safe traffic operations. 
b.  The use is expected to generate a relatively high number of trips and an additional driveway will improve overall traffic operations. 
c.  Practical difficulties exist on the site that make compliance unreasonable (sight distance limitations, existing development, topography, unique site configuration or shape), or existing off-site driveways make it impractical to fully comply with the standards. 
d.  Because of restricted turning movements or presence of a median that restricts turning movements, the driveway does not contribute to congestion or an unsafe situation. 
2.  Modification criteria. The planning commission may waive certain requirements of this section upon consideration of the following: 
a.  The proposed modification is consistent with the general intent of the standards of this overlay zone, the recommendations of the Gratiot Avenue Corridor Improvement Plan, and published MDOT guidelines. 
b.  MDOT staff endorse the proposed access design. 
c.  Driveway geometrics have been improved to the extent practical to reduce impacts on traffic flow. 
G.  Traffic impact studies. Where required by this ordinance or determined necessary by the planning commission, a traffic impact study (TIS) shall be prepared by an applicant to determine the potential future traffic conditions on the adjacent roadways once a proposed use is established or development is completed. The city may utilize its own traffic consultant to review the TIS, with the cost of the review being borne by the applicant. 
The results of the TIS shall be used in the final design of access points and internal circulation and may identify necessary off-site road improvements. At a minimum, the TIS shall meet standards of the Southeastern Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) and Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) handbook entitled Evaluating Traffic Impact Studies. The planning commission may modify the TIS requirements or scope based upon site and use location and conditions. 
Traffic impact studies shall contain the following minimum information: 
1.  An analysis of existing traffic conditions and/or site restrictions using current data. 
2.  Projected trip generation at the subject site or along the subject service drive based on the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation manual. The city may approve use of other trip generation data if based on recent studies of at least three similar uses within similar locations in Michigan. 
3.  Illustrations of current and projected turning movements at access points, including identification of potential impacts of the development on the operation of the abutting streets. Capacity analysis shall be based on the most recent edition of the of the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual, and shall be provided in an appendix to the TIS. 
4.  Description of the internal vehicular circulation and parking system for passenger vehicles and delivery trucks, as well as the circulation system for pedestrians, bicycles and other users. 
5.  Prediction of the peak-hour operational conditions at site driveways and road intersections affected by the development. 
6.  Justification of need, including statements describing how any altered or additional access points will meet the intent of this article, preserve public safety and road capacity, and be consistent with the adopted master transportation plans for the city, county or state road authorities. 
7.  Qualifications and documented experience of the author in preparing traffic impact studies in Michigan. The preparer shall be either a registered traffic engineer (P.E.) or a transportation planner, with at least three years of experience preparing traffic impact studies in Michigan. If the TIS includes geometric design, the study shall be prepared or supervised by a registered engineer with adequate experience in traffic engineering.

ARTICLE 11. - LANDSCAPING, SCREENING AND BUFFERING 

Sec. 11.01. - Purpose. 
    Landscaping, greenbelts, screening and land use buffers are necessary for the protection and enhancement of the environment, and for the continued vitality of all land uses in the city. Landscaping and greenbelts are capable of enhancing the visual environment, preserving natural features, improving property values, and alleviating the impact of noise, traffic, and visual disruption related to intensive uses. Landscape features contribute to a healthy development pattern, and increase the level of privacy for residential uses in the city. The purpose of this article is to: 
1.  Protect the character, appearance and value of land and neighborhoods through the use of landscaping, screening and buffering techniques that present a finished and aesthetically pleasing appearance, preserve environmental quality, and enhance the appearance of the city, thereby reducing conditions that may lead to blight. 
2.  Protect the health, safety and welfare of motorists and pedestrians by establishing landscaping design standards that guide and orient traffic flow within a site, and separate and protect pedestrian areas from vehicular encroachment. 
3.  Encourage creativity, innovation, and incorporation of existing vegetation, topography and other site features into the design and placement of landscaping. 
4.  Buffer the visual impact of parking lots, storage areas and similar activities from street rights-of-way and adjacent properties, provide adequate protective screening for residential uses adjacent to or near non-residential zoning districts or uses, and establish minimum standards for the design, installation, and maintenance of landscaping, screening and buffer areas between uses. 
5.  Establish realistic and achievable objectives for the screening or buffering of uses of a significantly different scale or character, and the enhancement of individual sites, street rights-of-way and other areas of the city through appropriate landscaping. 
The standards of this article are considered the minimum necessary to achieve these purposes. 
Sec. 11.02. - Objectives. 
    Consideration by the planning commission of site landscaping, screening and buffering shall reflect the purpose of this article and the following objectives: 
1.  Site landscaping shall be innovative and creative in design, and shall reflect the unique conditions of the site, and accommodate the specific circumstances of the use. 
2.  At the time of installation, landscaping, screening and buffering elements shall be immediately effective in meeting the objectives of this article, and shall maintain that effectiveness as the plant materials mature. 
3.  Significant natural, historical and cultural site features, including but not limited to large trees, hedgerows, and woodlands; waterbodies and wetlands; steep slopes; archeological sites; and historic elements shall be preserved where feasible. 
4.  Where existing sites have been developed without adequate landscaping, screening or buffering, the purpose of this article shall be achieved through improvements that are in reasonable proportion to the scale and construction cost of proposed building improvements, expansions, or other site improvements.

A.  Awnings. Awnings accessory to buildings in the B-1 and B-2 districts shall be subject to the following (see illustration): 
1.  Use. Awnings shall be primarily designed to protect pedestrians, display windows, and public entrances from the weather; and to add color and visual interest to the street level facade. 
2.  Maintenance. Awnings shall be kept in good repair to maintain the original appearance and ensure public safety. 
3.  Materials. The awning shall be constructed of durable, fire-resistant materials. The use of vinyl, plastic, rigid fiberglass or metal panels as covering materials shall be prohibited. 
4.  Secured to building. All awnings shall be securely attached to the building. 
5.  Consistency. Awnings shall be consistent with the character of historic buildings and shape of the facade's architectural elements, and shall not obscure architectural details. Where adjacent awnings conform with this ordinance, new awnings shall be consistent with the existing awnings in terms of appearance, scale, height, projection, and location. 
6.  Projections and clearance. Awnings shall not project more than eight (8) feet into a street right-of-way, and shall be set back a minimum of six feet from a curb line or 18 feet from a non-curbed edge of pavement. A minimum eight-foot clearance shall be maintained under the awning. Awnings proposed to project or overhang into a public right-of-way shall require city council approval prior to installation. 
7.  Awning signs. Signs on awnings shall comply with the standards of section 13.05 (building-mounted signs). 
B.  Building entrances. All buildings shall have at least one public entrance that faces a public street right-of-way. Additional public entrances shall be permitted on the rear or side facade, including primary access to other uses in a multi-tenant building. 
C.  Expression line. The street level facade of any building shall be distinguished from the remainder of the building with a horizontal expression line on the facade located between the highest point of the street level and the bottom edge of any second floor windows (see illustration): 
1.  Permanent design element. The expression line shall be incorporated into the facade as a permanent design element, and shall be created by a change in building material, architectural design, setback, recess, projection, cornices, belt courses, corbelling, molding, stringcourses or other sculptured design element. 
2.  Consistency with adjacent buildings. Where the planning commission determines that a consistent expression line has been established on adjacent buildings, it shall be continued on any new construction or expansion, or the commission may require a transitional design element (such as columns, piers, bays or changes in facade materials) between the existing and proposed expression lines. 
D.  Windows and facade transparency. Buildings with frontage on a public or private right-of-way, street, sidewalk, public park, or plaza shall be designed to encourage and complement a pedestrian-scale environment, with window openings and facade transparency subject to the following (see illustration): 
1.  Street level facade. A minimum of 40 percent and maximum of 75 percent of the street level facade shall be transparent.

d.  The planning commission may permit the use of shutters or spandrel glass to form a false window opening needed to complete an established window pattern, upon determination that the interior layout or other conditions prevent the inclusion of a clear glass window. 
5.  Consistency with adjacent buildings. Consistent window patterns or arrangements established on adjacent buildings shall be continued or extended as part of any new construction or expansion. Architectural elements (columns, piers, bays or similar elements) shall be incorporated into the facade where necessary to form a transition between contrasting window patterns or arrangements. 
E.  Demolition. Existing buildings in the B-1 and B-2 districts shall not be moved or demolished unless the building official has ordered the demolition for safety reasons, or the planning commission has approved a plan for re-development of the lot. 
F.  Facade preservation. Significant architectural details on existing buildings in the B-1 and B-2 districts shall not be destroyed or obscured during facade renovations, which shall be further subject to the following: 
1.  The pattern and proportions of existing window and door openings, vertical lines of columns and piers, and horizontal lines of spandrels, cornices, and other primary structural elements shall be maintained. 
2.  Only that portion of an existing building proposed to be altered shall be subject to the standards of this article, provided that the planning commission shall consider the proposed alteration within the context of the overall building architecture, the character of adjacent buildings, and the purpose of this article.

ARTICLE 13. - SIGNS 

Sec. 13.01. - Purpose. 
    The primary function of signage, as it relates to this ordinance, is to identify a particular use or business occupying a zoning lot or building in the city. The city further finds that reasonable use of signage promotes commerce, and that failure to regulate the size, location, and construction of signs in the city may adversely impact the promotion of commerce, lead to poor identification of businesses, and contribute to deterioration of the city's business districts and neighborhoods. 
    Unrestricted signage does not benefit individual businesses or property owners, or the community as a whole, because a proliferation of signs in the city would unduly distract motorists and pedestrians: create traffic hazards: restrict light and air: harm the city's appearance: contribute to blighting: negatively impact property values; and reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct and warn the public. Reasonable regulation of signs is necessary to minimize hazards and distractions for motorists and pedestrians, and to preserve the city's character and appearance. 
    The provisions of this article shall be considered to be the minimum necessary to promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, morals, and convenience. The further purposes of this article are to: 
1.  Encourage free expression of ideas and dissemination of messages, regardless of content, using signs that are compatible with their surroundings and legible under the circumstances in which they are designed to be seen. 
2.  Regulate the construction, alteration, repair, and maintenance of all signs with respect to safety, location, sign type, dimensions, height, and method of illumination. 
3.  Prohibit signs and the proliferation of visual clutter that would confuse, distract or mislead motorists; endanger the public health or safety; obstruct vision; or potentially harm business opportunities or community appearance. 
4.  Protect public and private investment in buildings, businesses, and land; and prevent the placement of signs that would conceal or obscure traffic control devices, official markers or signs advertising adjacent uses. 
5.  Protect the general public from damage and injury caused by distractions, hazards or obstructions caused by poorly designed or improperly constructed signage. 
6.  Preserve the appearance of the city by preventing the placement of oversized signs that are out of scale with surrounding buildings and uses. 
7.  Seek the removal of unlawful and abandoned signs, and encourage the replacement or removal of nonconforming signs that are incompatible with the purpose of this article. 
Sec. 13.02. - General standards. 
    The following general standards shall apply to signs in all zoning districts: 
A.  Standards of measurement. Dimensional standards and measurements for signs shall be subject to the following (see illustration): 
1.  Sign area. The surface area of a sign shall be measured and defined by the area of a rectangular or circular figure that encloses the extreme limits of individual letters, words, symbols or message of the sign together with any frame. 
a.  Where two sign faces with identical sign areas are placed back to back within two feet of one another, then the sign area shall equal the area of one face. 
b.  Where two sign faces with different sign areas are placed back to back within two feet of one another, then the sign area shall equal the area of the larger face. 
c.  Where two or more sign faces are placed more than two feet from one another at any point, then the sign area shall equal the total area of all sign faces. 
2.  Sign height. The distance from the average level of the ground or pavement directly below the sign to the highest point of the sign structure, including any supportive or decorative elements (see illustration). 
3.  Sign setback. Setbacks shall be measured from the closest street right-of-way or front lot line to the nearest edge of the sign. 
4.  Signable area. The signable area of a building shall equal the area of the building's street level facade (see illustration). 
a.  Multiple uses. Where more than one business or use occupies space on the street level facade, the total signable area allowed for the building shall be divided among the businesses or uses in proportion to the size of each occupied space. 
b.  Corner lots. Where a building has two or more street level facades (such as on a corner lot), the signable area shall equal the area of the largest street level facade. 
B.  Construction and maintenance. All signs shall be constructed or installed in compliance with the State Construction Code, and other applicable building, fire, and electrical codes enforced by the city; shall be maintained in good repair and working order; and shall present a neat and orderly appearance. Non-galvanized or corrosion-prone materials shall be painted as necessary to prevent corrosion. 
All sign faces shall be smooth, and no nails, tacks or wires shall be permitted to protrude from any sign. This shall not exclude the use of block letters, decorative elements or other devices that may extend over the top or in front of the sign structure. 
C.  Placement requirements. 
1.  No sign may extend above any parapet or be placed upon any roof surface. For purposes of this article, roof surfaces constructed at an angle of 75 degrees or more from horizontal (such as mansard roofs) shall be regarded as wall space. 
2.  No sign attached to a building, other than a permitted awning or projecting sign, may project more than one foot from the building wall. 
3.  Signs shall not be located within nor extend over any street right-of-way or corner clearance area, except where specifically authorized by this article. This restriction shall include any future planned rights-of-way identified in the master transportation plans for the city, county or state road authorities. 
D.  Hazards and obstructions. Signs shall not be designed or maintained in a manner that would confuse or mislead motorists or pedestrians, create traffic or pedestrian hazards, obstruct free and clear vision or interfere with any traffic control device. No sign shall be erected or maintained so as to prevent ingress or egress from any door, window or fire escape. No sign of any kind shall be attached to a standpipe, fire escape or other means of ingress or egress. 
All signs shall be located at least ten feet from any utility pole, overhead wire, transformer or streetlight. The building official may waive this requirement upon determination that no good purpose would be served by the required setback. 
E.  Use. Signs shall not impair the use of adjacent properties. All signs shall be accessory to the principal use of the lot where the sign is located, unless specifically permitted by this article as a non-accessory sign. Any sign permitted by this article may contain a non-commercial message. A changeable copy area shall be allowed as part of a permitted sign, provided the changeable copy area shall not exceed 50 percent of the total sign area. Text and images within a changeable copy area shall be static and not cycle more frequently than once every six seconds. Animated copy (flashing, moving, or revolving text and images) is prohibited due to public safety concerns. 
F.  Illumination. Internal and external sign illumination shall be permitted, subject to the standards of article 14 (exterior lighting) and the following (see illustrations): 
1.  External sign illumination. External illumination of signs shall be permitted in any zoning district, provided that the light source(s) shall be fully-shielded, directed towards the sign face, and designed to concentrate all light on the sign copy area. 
2.  Internal sign illumination. Signs accessory to non-residential uses in any zoning district may be internally illuminated, provided that the sign faces are more than 50 percent covered by semi-opaque colors and materials with a color value and saturation of 50 percent or higher (see illustration). Internal illumination of signs accessory to residential uses shall be prohibited. 
3.  Hours of illumination. Illuminated signs shall be equipped with a functional timer control. Such signs shall not be illuminated after 11:00 p.m., or one-half hour following the close of the business day, whichever is later. 
Such signs shall not be illuminated before sunrise, or one-half hour prior to the beginning of the business day, whichever is earlier. 
4.  Other limitations. Sign illumination shall be further limited as follows: 
a.  Sign illumination shall be provided solely by electrical means or devices, and shall not be of a flashing, intermittent, moving or animated type. 
b.  Luminous tube lighting (neon, fluorescent or similar) shall not be directly visible from any street right-of-way or adjacent lot. Such lighting may be used as an indirect light source, or if shielded by translucent panels or similar methods. 
c.  Illumination of temporary signs shall be prohibited.

Sec. 13.07. - Billboards. 
A.  Findings. The city has made the following determinations related to billboard signs: 
1.  The placement of billboard signs on lots or buildings in the city would result in visual pollution and obstructions of light and air for adjoining lots and uses. 
2.  Billboard signs are not appropriate in areas zoned for residential uses, or in adjoining office (O) or local business (B-1) districts that serve as a transitional zone for the residential districts, because of the intense commercial nature of the advertising activity, which would be harmful to residential property values and incompatible with the quality of life in residential areas. 
3.  Billboard signs are not appropriate in the B-2 (central business) district, because such signs would be out-of-scale with the pedestrian-oriented character of the downtown area, incompatible with the historic character of downtown buildings, and harmful to the promotion of commerce in the district. 
4.  Billboard signs are not appropriate in areas along Main Street (M-19), Gratiot Ave., 32 Mile Road, and other arterial streets and thoroughfares in the city, because a proliferation of billboard signs would create additional visual clutter and compete for the visual attention of motorists. These road corridors have been developed with multiple existing curb cuts, driveways and intersections; and numerous businesses that experience a high volume of employee, customer, and client traffic. Location of billboard signs in these areas would create or exacerbate visual diversions and hazards for motorists and pedestrians. 
5.  The placement of new billboard signs in the city is contrary to the purpose of this article, and the goals and objectives of the city's master plan. 
B.  Billboards prohibited. In accordance with the above findings, billboard signs are hereby prohibited within the City of Richmond. 
C.  Existing billboards. Billboard signs lawfully existing in the city on the date of adoption of this ordinance shall be permitted to continue, subject to the provisions of section 13.10 (nonconforming signs). The city planner shall be responsible for maintaining an inventory of the location and condition of all existing billboard signs in the city. 
Sec. 13.08. - Prohibited signs. 
    The following types of signs are prohibited in all districts: 
1.  Signs that resemble and could be confused with an official highway, traffic or government sign, signal or traffic control device; or that obscure a sign, signal or traffic control device displayed by public authority to provide traffic instruction, direction or public information. 
2.  Signs painted on or attached to trees, utility poles, streetlights, fences, streetlights or similar locations. 
3.  Signs placed upon or across any public right-of-way or upon any city property, except as expressly authorized by this article or the city council. 
4.  Signs that incorporate string lights; flashing, moving or intermittent lights of changing degrees or intensity; exposed incandescent bulbs; animation; or unshielded luminous tube lighting. 
5.  Exterior string lights accessory to a non-residential use, other than holiday decoration or when used as an embellishment to landscape plant materials. 
6.  Signs that have any visible moving parts, mechanical movement, rotation, or other apparent visible movement achieved by electrical or mechanical means or by action of normal wind currents; and signs that discharge any audible sound, odor or visible matter.

ARTICLE 17. - SPECIAL CONDITION USES 

Sec. 17.01. - Purpose. 
    Special condition uses include those uses that serve an area, interest or purpose that extends beyond the borders of the city, create particular problems of control in relation to adjoining uses or districts, have detrimental effects upon public health, safety or welfare, or possess other unique characteristics that prevent such uses from being classified as principal permitted uses in a particular zoning district. 
    This article sets forth review procedures and standards for planning commission review and approval of special condition uses. These procedures are instituted to provide an opportunity to use a lot or structure for an activity that, under usual circumstances, could be detrimental to other permitted land uses. Such uses may be permitted under circumstances particular to the proposed location, subject to specific conditions or limitations that provide protection to adjacent land uses. 
    These procedures are adopted to provide a consistent and uniform method for review of special condition use applications, ensure full compliance with the standards contained in this ordinance, achieve efficient use of land, prevent adverse impacts on neighboring properties and districts, preserve the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare, and facilitate development in accordance with the land use objectives of the master plan. 
Sec. 17.02. - Application requirements. 
    Special condition use applications shall be submitted in accordance with the following procedures and requirements, which provide for review and action by the planning commission: 
1.  Eligibility. The application shall be submitted by the owner of an interest in land for which special condition use approval is sought, or by the owner's designated agent. The applicant or agent shall be present at all scheduled review meetings. 
2.  Requirements. Special condition use applications shall be submitted to the city at least 45 calendar days prior to a planning commission meeting at which review is sought, and shall include the following information: 
a.  Contact information for the applicant and property owner, and proof of ownership. If the property is leased by the applicant, a copy of the lease shall be provided, along with the owner's signed authorization for the application. 
b.  Address, location and tax identification number of the property. 
c.  A detailed description of the proposed use. 
d.  A site plan, if requested by the planning commission or required by article 18 (site plan review). 
e.  Appropriate review fees, as determined by city council. 
f.  Any other information deemed necessary by the planning commission to determine compliance with this ordinance. 
Sec. 17.03. - Special condition use review. 
    After a complete and accurate application has been received and review fees paid, the application shall be reviewed in accordance with following procedures: 
A.  Coordination with site plan review. A site plan associated with a special condition use shall not be approved unless the special condition use has first been approved. The planning commission may, at its discretion, consider special condition use and site plan applications at the same meeting, or may require the site plan to be submitted for review following approval of the special condition use. 
B.  Technical review. Prior to planning commission consideration, the application materials shall be distributed to appropriate city officials and staff for review and comment. The city planner may also submit the application materials to applicable outside agencies and designated city consultants for review. 
C.  Public hearing. A public hearing shall be held for all special condition uses consistent with state law and section 1.12 (public hearing procedures). 
D.  Planning commission consideration. Subsequent to the hearing, the planning commission shall review the application for special condition use approval, together with any reports and recommendations from staff, consultants and other reviewing agencies, and any public comments. The planning commission shall make the final determination on the application, based on the requirements and standards of this ordinance, including section 17.08 (standards for special condition use approval). The planning commission is authorized to postpone, approve, approve subject to conditions or deny the special condition use as follows: 
1.  Postponement. Upon determination by the planning commission that a special condition use application is not sufficiently complete for approval or denial, or upon a request by the applicant, the planning commission may postpone consideration until a later meeting. Failure of the applicant, or the applicant's designated representative, to attend a meeting shall be grounds for the planning commission to postpone consideration of the special condition use. 
2.  Denial. Upon determination that a special condition use application is not in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, including section 17.08 (standards for special condition use approval), or would require extensive modifications to comply with said standards and regulations, the special condition use may be denied. If a special condition use is denied, a written record shall be provided to the applicant listing the reasons for such denial. Failure of the applicant, or the applicant's designated representative, to attend two or more meetings shall be grounds for the planning commission to deny the special condition use. 
3.  Approval. The special condition use may be approved by the planning commission upon determination that it is in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, including section 17.08 (standards for special condition use approval). Upon approval, the special condition use shall be deemed a conforming use permitted in the district in which it is proposed, subject to site plan approval, and any conditions imposed on the use. Such approval shall affect only the zoning lot, lot of record or portion thereof upon which the use is located. 
4.  Approval subject to conditions. The planning commission may approve a special condition use subject to reasonable conditions: 
a.  Designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety, welfare, and social and economic well-being of users or patrons of the use under consideration, residents and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed use, or the community as a whole; 
b.  Related to the valid exercise of the police power, and the impacts of the proposed use; or 
c.  Necessary to meet the intent and purpose of this ordinance, related to the standards established in this ordinance for the special condition use under consideration, and necessary for compliance with those standards. 
Examples of such conditions include limitations on hours of operation or scope of permitted activities, requirements for periodic review or renewal, or automatic expiration of approval if the use ceases. 
5.  Recording of special condition use action. Planning commission action on the special condition use shall be recorded in the planning commission meeting minutes, stating the name, description and location of the proposed use, and the grounds for the planning commission's action. At least one copy of the written record shall be kept on file in the city, and one copy shall be forwarded to the applicant as evidence of special condition use approval. 
Sec. 17.04. - Special condition use resubmission. 
    A special condition use application that has been denied shall not be resubmitted for a period of 365 days from the date of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of changed conditions found by the planning commission to be valid. 
Sec. 17.05. - Appeals. 
    The board of zoning appeals shall not have the authority to consider appeals of special condition use determinations by the planning commission. 
Sec. 17.06. - Special condition use expiration. 
    Special condition use approval shall expire 365 days after the date of approval, unless the use has been established on the site, or the construction plan associated with the special condition use has been submitted for review. Special condition use approval shall also expire upon expiration of the approved construction plan associated with a special condition use. 
    Upon written request received by the city prior to the expiration date, the planning commission may grant one extension of up to 365 days, provided that the approved special condition use conforms to current zoning ordinance standards. 
Sec. 17.07. - Rescinding approval of special condition uses. 
    Approval of a special condition use may be rescinded by the planning commission upon determination that the use has not been improved, constructed or maintained in compliance with this ordinance, approved permits, site plans, or conditions of site plan or special condition use approval. Such action shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Public hearing. Such action may be taken only after a public hearing has been held in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 1.12 (public hearing procedures), at which time the owner of an interest in land for which special condition use approval was sought, or the owner's designated agent, shall be given an opportunity to present evidence in opposition to rescission. 
2.  Determination. Subsequent to the hearing, the decision of the planning commission with regard to the rescission shall be made and written notification provided to the owner or designated agent. 
Sec. 17.08. - Standards for special condition use approval. 
    Approval of a special condition use shall be based upon the determination that the proposed use complies with all applicable requirements of this ordinance, and all of the following standards as deemed applicable to the use by the planning commission: 
1.  A documented need exists for the proposed use. A documented and immediate need exists for the proposed use within the community. 
2.  Compatibility with adjacent uses. The special condition use is compatible with adjacent uses and the existing or intended character of the surrounding neighborhood, and will not have an adverse impact upon or interfere with the development, use or enjoyment of adjacent properties, or the orderly development of the neighborhood. 
3.  Compatibility with the master plan. The special condition use location and character is consistent with the general principles, goals, objectives and policies of the adopted master plan. 
4.  Compliance with applicable regulations. The proposed special condition use is in compliance with all applicable provisions of this ordinance and other county, state, and federal requirements. 
5.  Impact upon public services. The special condition use upon public services will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services, and will not exceed the existing or planned capacity of such services. For purposes of this section, such services shall include, but are not limited to police and fire protection, drainage and stormwater management facilities, municipal water and sanitary sewer facilities, refuse disposal, and educational services. 
6.  Traffic impacts. The special condition use is designed and located in a manner that minimizes any adverse traffic impacts caused or exacerbated by the use. 
7.  Environmental and public health, safety, welfare impacts. The location, design, activities, processes, materials, equipment, and operational conditions of the special condition use will not be detrimental or injurious to the environment or the public health, safety, and welfare by reason of traffic, noise, vibration, smoke, fumes, odors, dust, glare, light, drainage, topographic changes or other adverse impacts. 
8.  Isolation of existing uses. Approval of the special condition use location will not result in a small residential or non-residential area being substantially surrounded by incompatible uses. 
Sec. 17.09. - Compliance required. 
    It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property and the operator of the use for which special condition use approval has been granted to develop, improve, operate and maintain the use, including the site, structures and all site elements, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance and all conditions of special condition use approval until the use is discontinued. Failure to comply with the provisions of this article shall be a violation of the use provisions of this ordinance and shall be subject to the same penalties appropriate for a use violation. 
    The city planner may make periodic investigations of developments for which a special condition use has been approved. Noncompliance with ordinance requirements or conditions of approval shall constitute grounds for the planning commission to rescind special condition use approval. 
ARTICLE 18. - SITE PLAN REVIEW 

Sec. 18.01. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish procedures and standards that provide a consistent method for review of site plans, and to ensure full compliance with the standards contained in this ordinance and other applicable Codes and Ordinances. 
    Flexible review standards have been established to ensure that the type of review and amount of required information is directly proportional to the project's scale and use intensity. It is the further purpose of this article to protect natural, cultural and civic resources, minimize adverse impacts on adjoining or nearby properties, encourage cooperation and consultation between the city and the applicant, and facilitate development in accordance with the city's master plan. 
Sec. 18.02. - Site plan review required. 
    Two separate review processes have been established in accordance with the purpose of this article, as follows: 
A.  Uses Subject to planning commission review. The following types of uses, as specified in article 4 (land use tables) are subject to review and approval of a detailed site plan by the planning commission: 
1.  All animal and agricultural uses, with the exception of farms and riding stables. 
2.  All residential uses, with the exception of foster family homes, family child day care homes, home occupations, and one detached single family, two-family or duplex dwelling on a single zoning lot. 
3.  All office and service uses, community uses, commercial uses and industrial, research and laboratory uses. 
4.  All temporary, special event and other uses, with the exception of accessory structures and uses specified in article 7, construction buildings and uses, garage sales, estate sales, and private auctions. 
Such exceptions shall not be subject to plan review, but shall be subject to zoning permit approval in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
B.  Projects eligible for administrative review. The following development projects, uses and other activities have been determined to be appropriate for a less intensive site plan review. Such uses are subject to administrative review and approval of a site plan by the city planner: 
1.  A change in use to a similar or less intense use, as determined by the city planner, provided that significant site changes are not required. 
2.  Construction buildings and uses, and minor changes during construction due to unanticipated site constraints or outside agency requirements. 
3.  Multiple-family and non-residential accessory structures and uses, as specified in article 7 (accessory structures and uses).

ARTICLE 20. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) OVERLAY DISTRICT 

Sec. 20.01. - Intent. 
    The provisions of this article outline the standards for the submission, design, review and approval of planned unit development (PUD) projects subject to approval of an overlay zone. The intent of this district is to provide areas within which several land use types can be developed through innovative and thoughtful land use design. While traditional height, area, and bulk requirements may be modified in a PUD in order to achieve particular design objectives, any such development shall adhere to all applicable health and building codes and clearly demonstrate a commitment to maintaining a balance between residential and non-residential land use, between public open space provided and private land set aside, and in accordance with the ability of the remainder of the city to absorb and effectively deal with the attendant growth. Planned unit developments are encouraged to: 
1.  Foster innovation in land use planning, development, and redevelopment. 
2.  Encourage assembly of lots and redevelopment of inefficient land uses, outdated structures, and Brownfield sites. 
3.  Support in-fill development on sites that would be difficult to develop according to conventional standards because of the shape, size, abutting development, accessibility, environmental status or other unique features or conditions related to the site. 
4.  Provide enhanced housing, employment, and shopping opportunities. 
5.  Create a development framework that promotes appropriate business activity and enhances the economic viability of the city. 
6.  Allow for unique development projects consistent with the city's master plan objectives for land use, transportation, and community facilities. 
7.  Provide for a network of pedestrian pathways, usable open spaces, and recreation areas within the city. 
8.  Promote a development pattern that preserves and utilizes natural topography and features, scenic vistas, existing vegetation, and existing historical elements. 
The provisions of this article are intended to result in land development substantially consistent with the master plan and surrounding neighborhood, with modifications and departures from generally applicable requirements made in accordance with standards provided in this article to ensure appropriate, fair and consistent decision-making. 
Sec. 20.02. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this article may be applied to any parcel of land located in any zoning district and which is under single ownership, subject to a determination that the proposed project and site satisfy section 20.03 (eligibility criteria). The provisions of this article may also be applied to any site designated as a Brownfield by state or federal law. 
    These regulations are not intended as a device for ignoring the more specific standards of the city, or the planning upon which the standards are based. 
Sec. 20.03. - Eligibility criteria. 
    To be eligible for planned unit development (PUD) approval, the applicant shall demonstrate that the following criteria will be met: 
1.  Availability and capacity of public services. The proposed type and density of use shall not exceed the existing or planned capacity of existing public services, facilities, and utilities. For purposes of this section, such services shall include, but are not limited to police and fire protection, drainage and stormwater management facilities, municipal water and sanitary sewer facilities, refuse disposal, and educational services. 
2.  Compatibility with the master plan. The proposed development shall be consistent with the city's master plan. 
3.  Compatibility with PUD intent. The proposed development shall be consistent with the intent and spirit of these regulations, as stated in section 20.01 (intent). 
4.  Economic impact. The proposed development shall not impede the continued use or development of surrounding properties for uses that are permitted in the zoning ordinance, or planned in the adopted city master plan. 
5.  Unified control. The entire area of the proposed development shall be under single ownership or unified control, such that there is a single entity having responsibility for completing the entire project. This provision shall not prohibit a transfer of ownership or control, provided that notice of such transfer is given in advance to the city planner and a unified ownership remains. 
6.  Public benefit. A recognizable and material benefit will be realized by both the future residents and the city as a whole, where such benefit would otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely. 
7.  Preservation of site features. Long-term conservation of natural, historical, architectural or other significant site features or open space will be achieved, where such features would otherwise be destroyed or degraded by development as permitted by the underlying zoning district(s). 
8.  Sufficient land area for proposed uses. Sufficient land area has been provided to comply with all applicable regulations of this ordinance, to adequately serve the needs of all permitted uses in the PUD project, and to ensure compatibility between uses and the surrounding neighborhood. 
Sec. 20.04. - PUD project use standards. 
    A planned unit development (PUD) project shall be consistent with the following use standards: 
A.  Permitted uses. Uses within a PUD project shall be regulated by the restrictions of the underlying zoning district, except as specifically modified through the PUD approval process. To achieve superior design and land use compatibility, the city council, upon recommendation by the planning commission, may include or exclude specific land uses from a PUD project or from specific portions of the PUD project, regardless of the provisions of the underlying zoning district(s). To support the inclusion of a specified use in a PUD project, the applicant may be required to provide evidence (such as a professional market study) that a demand exists for the proposed use within the local market area. 
Notwithstanding the flexibility provided above, industrial, research and laboratory uses, as specified in article 4 (land use tables), shall be excluded from all PUD projects that have a residential component. Industrial, research and laboratory uses shall only be permitted in a non-residential PUD project. 
B.  Residential use and density. The planning commission may require that a variety of housing types be provided as part of a residential PUD project, including detached and attached single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, townhouses, and other multiple-family dwellings. 
The number of dwelling units permitted within a PUD project shall be determined through review of a parallel plan prepared by the applicant. The parallel plan for the project shall be consistent with state, county, and city requirements and design criteria for the type of dwelling unit proposed. The parallel plan shall meet all standards for lot size, lot width, and setbacks normally required for such development. The parallel plan shall also provide sufficient area for storm water detention. Lots in a parallel plan shall provide sufficient building size without impacting wetlands regulated by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). 
The planning commission shall review the design and determine the number of dwelling units that could feasibly be constructed and economically viable following the parallel design. This number, as determined by the planning commission, shall be the maximum number of dwelling units allowable in the PUD project, except where additional dwelling units are permitted by the planning commission per subsection 20.04.C. (exemplary project density bonus). 
C.  Exemplary project density bonus. A density bonus may be permitted for an exemplary project, at the discretion of the planning commission, based upon a demonstration by the applicant of design excellence for the PUD. The planning commission shall consider the following elements when determining the appropriate density bonus: 
1.  An integrated mixture of housing types and densities, including but not limited to attached housing, housing for the elderly, and or detached housing. 
2.  Provision of a perimeter transition along the roadway and on all other sides of the development. The transition area shall utilize a variety of landscape plantings, berming, and or decorative fencing/walls. The transition area's depth and location shall be subject to planning commission approval, based upon site conditions and adjacent land uses. 
3.  Incorporating active recreation areas. 
4.  Extensive clean-up of a blighted site, including clean up of contamination. 
5.  Utilizing creative architectural design that establishes a distinctive unity where all homes share a thematic character. The following shall be incorporated: 
a.  Roof types. To provide a variation on facades of the structures, peaked rooflines shall be a minimum four to 12 pitch. Architectural accents such as cupolas, cross gables, and dormers are encouraged. 
b.  Doors and windows. The location, orientation, and proportion of doors and windows should be used to define the character and enhance the building facade. 
c.  Porches. Front porches shall be provided for individual units as a semi-public living place on the street wall of the building. Various designs of front porches, covered patios, stoops, balconies, and terraces are encouraged. 
d.  Garages. A mixture of recessed front-entry, side-entry, and detached garages shall be provided. Detached garages shall be located to the rear of the principal building. Front-entry garages shall be setback at least five feet from the front building line, exclusive of any porch. Front-entry garages shall be limited to a maximum capacity of two vehicles and shall include separate overhead doors for each interior parking space. 
6.  Additional elements as determined by the planning commission to provide a material benefit to all residents of the development. 
D.  Nonresidential uses and density. Office and service uses, community uses, commercial uses, and industrial, research and laboratory uses, as specified in article 4 (land use tables), shall be accessed by public streets and sited in such a manner as to not encourage through traffic in existing residential neighborhoods or any potential residential area within the PUD. Such non-residential uses may occupy up to ten percent of the gross area of a residentially zoned parcel. 
Sec. 20.05. - PUD project design standards. 
    A planned unit development (PUD) project shall be consistent with the following general standards for the type, bulk, design and location of structures, common space, and public facility requirements. The planning commission shall have the authority to waive or modify these requirements, upon determination that an alternative standard would be in accordance with the intent of this article. 
A.  Setbacks and buffering. 
1.  Interior. The setback requirements of the underlying zoning district(s) shall establish the required interior setbacks for the PUD. These requirements may be modified within the PUD project, subject to approval by the planning commission. 
2.  Perimeter. The proposed location and arrangement of structures shall not be materially detrimental to existing or prospective adjacent structures or to existing or prospective development of the neighborhood. There shall be a perimeter setback and landscaping and/or berming, as recommended by the planning commission, for the purpose of buffering the adjacent properties from the planned unit development. The setback distance and buffering treatment need not be uniform at all points on the perimeter of the development. However, in cases where nonresidential uses in the PUD are adjacent to residentially zoned property, such uses shall be visually screened by a landscape berm, evergreen screen, or a decorative wall. 
B.  Access and circulation. The internal circulation system shall provide adequate systems for vehicular and non-vehicular circulation, subject to the following: 
1.  Streets. The proposed development shall provide logical extensions of existing or planned streets in the city, and shall provide suitable street connections to adjacent parcels, where applicable. Streets shall be designed to meet the city's engineering design standards, and shall be dedicated to the public. Curb cuts and driveway access shall comply with the standards of article 10 (access management). 
2.  Sidewalks and pedestrian paths. Pedestrian circulation shall be provided within the site and shall interconnect all use areas. The pedestrian system shall provide for a logical extension of pedestrian ways outside of the PUD where applicable. 
3.  Parking and loading. Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided in accordance with article 9 (off-street parking and loading). 
4.  Traffic impacts. Traffic to, from, and within the site shall not be hazardous or inconvenient to the project or to the neighborhood. In applying this standard, the planning commission shall consider, among other things, convenient routes for pedestrian traffic, relationship of the proposed project to main thoroughfares and street intersections; and the general character and intensity of the existing and potential development of the neighborhood. A traffic impact study may be required by the planning commission, per section 10.06 (traffic impact studies). 
C.  Common open space. Common open space and other common areas and facilities shall be so planned to achieve a unified design, subject to the following: 
1.  Minimum area. A minimum of 20 percent of the PUD shall be designated and maintained as common open space readily accessible and available to the residents of the PUD project. Up to 25 percent of the required common open space area may be occupied by wetlands, floodplains or open water areas. 
2.  Dedication. The applicant shall provide for a conservation easement or similar device satisfactory to the city attorney to ensure that public and common areas will be or have been irrevocably committed for that purpose. Provisions shall be made to provide for financing of improvements and maintenance for open spaces and other common areas. 
3.  Continuity. The design of such common areas and facilities shall be coordinated with surrounding uses and lands, as well as the natural characteristics of the project site. 
4.  Not included as open space. Open space areas shall not include the following: 
a.  The area of any street right-of-way proposed to be dedicated to the public. 
b.  The area utilized for off-street parking and vehicular circulation. 
c.  Any portion of the project used for non-residential purposes. 
d.  The required transition and buffering areas. 
e.  Required yard setbacks on individual single-family residential lots or units. 
D.  Recreational uses. Public and private recreational uses, including but not limited to golf courses, riding stables, swim clubs, and tennis clubs (including accessory structures and uses) may be incorporated within residential areas of a PUD project. Developed recreational uses such as tennis clubs, swim clubs, golf courses, riding stables, and the like, may be used to satisfy 50 percent of the common open space requirement, provided such uses are integrated into the overall PUD project. 
E.  Infrastructure and other site improvements. Road, drainage and utility design shall meet or exceed the applicable city and county requirements. All utilities shall be installed underground. Drainage structures (detention/retention basins, swales) shall be designed to blend with the site's natural features. Stormwater basins shall be designed to emulate a naturally formed or free form depression. Basins shall be designed to avoid the need for perimeter fencing. Where such fencing is necessary, it shall be decorative, in the determination of the planning commission. 
Project lighting, signs, exterior building materials and design, landscaping and other features shall be designed and constructed with the objective of creating and identifiable design character that is consistent with the overall character of the community, adjacent existing and planned land uses, and the site's natural features. 
F.  Other impacts. The planning commission shall determine, where applicable, that noise, odor, light, or other external effects that may be associated with any proposed use will not adversely affect adjacent and neighboring lands and uses. 
Sec. 20.06. - Project phasing. 
    Where a planned unit development (PUD) project is proposed to be constructed in phases, the project shall be so designed that each phase shall be complete in terms of the presence of services, construction, facilities, and open space, and shall contain the necessary components to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the users of the PUD, and the residents of the city. If a project will be constructed in phases, the following shall apply: 
1.  A minimum of 50 percent of the total number of residential dwelling units in any planned unit development shall be constructed and be ready for sale prior to the construction of any commercial portion of the planned unit development, except that site grading, road construction, and utility installations related to the commercial portions of the planned unit development may be undertaken concurrent with the development of residential units and public or private recreation uses. The planning commission may authorize the construction of commercial uses prior to the completion of 50 percent of the total number of residential dwelling units, based on supportive evidence provided by a professional market study. 
2.  A narrative description of the phased process that describes all work to be done in each phase shall be submitted to the planning commission. 
3.  A phase shall not be dependant upon subsequent phases for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access, open spaces or recreation facilities. Each phase shall be designed to provide a proportional share of the common open space required for the entire project. 

Sec. 20.07. - Preliminary PUD review procedures. 
    The application of a planned unit development (PUD) overlay district shall be achieved through the submission and approval of a PUD plan that controls the development of a specific site and may modify the uses permitted by the underlying zoning district. The application shall be processed as outlined herein. With the approval of a PUD overlay district, the underlying zoning district(s) shall remain undisturbed and regulate the future use of land, except as provided in the PUD agreement.

ARTICLE 22. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 22.01. - Intent and purpose. 
    It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this ordinance lots, structures, sites and uses which were lawful prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but that would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendments. Such uses are declared to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is the intent of this ordinance to permit such nonconformities to continue until they are removed. 
    This article is hereby established to: 
1.  Regulate the use and development of nonconforming lots, completion, alteration or reconstruction of nonconforming structures, re-development or improvement of nonconforming sites, and maintenance, extension or substitution of nonconforming uses. 
2.  Specify the limited conditions and circumstances under which nonconformities shall be permitted to continue. 
3.  Establish standards for determining whether a use is nonconforming, and whether a nonconforming use has ceased to occupy a particular zoning lot. 
4.  Recognize that certain nonconformities may not have a significant adverse impact upon nearby properties, or the public health, safety and welfare. Accordingly, this article establishes a "preferred class" of nonconforming uses, which distinguishes between nonconforming uses that are not desirable and should be eliminated as rapidly as possible, and those that may be designated to be perpetuated and improved in a manner that protects adjacent properties and the character of the neighborhood. 
Sec. 22.02. - Nonconforming structures. 
    Nonconforming structures shall be allowed to continue after the effective date of this ordinance or amendments thereto, subject to the following conditions: 
A.  Expansion restricted. A nonconforming structure may be altered in a manner that does not increase or intensify its nonconformity. Alterations to a nonconforming structure that increase or intensify a nonconformity shall be prohibited. 
B.  Normal repairs and maintenance. This article shall not prevent work required for compliance with the provisions of the state construction code enforced by the city. Normal repair, maintenance or replacement of interior non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, plumbing or heating and cooling systems in nonconforming structures may be permitted in accordance with applicable code requirements, provided that such improvements do not result in an enlargement of a nonconforming structure, and provided that the cost of such improvements does not exceed the state equalized value of the structure at the time such work is proposed. 
C.  Buildings under construction. Nothing in this article shall require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building or structure for which construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance and diligently carried on until completion. 
D.  Damaged or unsafe structures. Nonconforming structures that are damaged or destroyed by any means to an extent that the repair cost exceeds the state equalized value of the property shall not be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformance with the standards of this ordinance. Nonconforming structures that are declared to be physically unsafe by the building official shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt. 
E.  Exemption for certain residential dwellings. Nonconforming single-family and two-family (duplex) dwellings and customary accessory structures are exempt from this section, provided that application for a building permit shall be made within 365 days from the date of damage or destruction. 
F.  Nonconforming signs. See section 13.10 (nonconforming signs). 
Sec. 22.03. - Nonconforming lots. 
    Existing lots of record that are not in compliance with the dimensional requirements of this ordinance shall only be used, developed, or improved in accordance with the following: 
A.  Lot division and combination. A lot of record shall not be divided in a manner that would increase its nonconformity, cause an existing structure or site improvement to become nonconforming, or create one or more nonconforming lots. Where feasible, nonconforming lots of record shall be combined to create lots that comply with the dimensional requirements of this ordinance. 
B.  Use of nonconforming lots. Use of a nonconforming lot of record shall be subject to the regulations of this ordinance for the district where it is located, and the following: 
1.  Single-family residential districts. A single-family dwelling and customary accessory structures may be erected on a lot of record in a single-family residential district that is nonconforming with respect to minimum lot area or lot width requirements. Such structures shall conform with all other dimensional standards for the district. 
2.  Contiguous lots. Two or more contiguous, nonconforming lots of record with continuous frontage under single ownership shall be considered an undivided parcel for purposes of this ordinance. No portion of said parcel that does not meet lot width and area requirements of this ordinance shall be used or occupied, nor shall any division be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below ordinance requirements. 
Sec. 22.04. - Nonconforming sites. 
    The purpose of this section is to encourage improvements to existing sites in the city that were developed before the site design standards of this ordinance were established or amended. This section establishes standards for prioritizing improvements to existing sites that are intended to gradually bring the site into compliance with current ordinance standards. Nonconforming sites may be improved or modified without a complete upgrade of all site elements, subject to the following conditions: 
1.  A nonconforming site shall not be improved or modified in a manner that increases its nonconformity. 
2.  The proposed site improvements shall resolve public safety deficiencies, including building and fire code violations, emergency access and pedestrian/vehicle conflicts. 
3.  The proposed site improvements shall include exterior lighting, landscaping, screening and building improvements that are in reasonable proportion to the scale and construction cost of proposed building improvements, expansions or other improvements, as determined by the planning commission. 
4.  The proposed site improvements shall include the installation, restoration or expansion of sidewalks within and through the site, where appropriate. 
5.  A reasonable timeline for completion of site improvements to a nonconforming site may be approved as part of any plan approval. Failure to complete improvements in accordance with an approved timeline shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance. 
Sec. 22.05. - Nonconforming uses. 
    All nonconforming uses that have been designated as "preferred class" by city action shall not be subject to the requirements of this section, but rather shall be subject to the provisions of section 22.06 (preferred class designations). Nonconforming uses not designated as "preferred class" shall be allowed to continue after the effective date of this ordinance or amendments thereto, subject to the following: 
A.  Compliance with other applicable standards. Nonconforming uses shall be maintained in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, regulations and codes, other than the specific use regulations for the zoning district where the use is located. 
1.  The owner, operator or person having beneficial use of land or structures occupied by a nonconforming use shall be responsible for demonstrating compliance with this requirement. 
2.  Failure to do so, or failure to bring the use into compliance with current laws, ordinances, regulations and codes within 180 days of their effective date, shall constitute grounds for the city to seek court approval to terminate or remove the use at the owner's expense. 
B.  Expansion prohibited. Nonconforming uses shall not be enlarged, increased in intensity, extended to occupy a greater area of land or floor area, or moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or structure. 
C.  Cessation. A nonconforming use that ceases for a period of more than 365 days or is superseded by a conforming use shall not be resumed. If a structure associated with a nonconforming use is removed, or damaged by any means to an extent that the repair cost exceeds the state equalized value of the property, the nonconformity shall be deemed removed. All subsequent uses shall conform to the use provisions of this ordinance. 
Sec. 22.06. - Preferred class designations. 
    It is the intent of this section to establish a "preferred class" designation that the planning commission may approve for certain nonconforming uses, subject to the following: 
A.  Procedure. The procedure for considering all preferred class nonconforming designations shall be as follows: 
1.  Application. Applications for consideration of a preferred class designation for a nonconforming use may be initiated by the city, or the owner, operator or person having beneficial use of the lot occupied by the nonconforming use. The application shall include a detailed description of the use, and the reasons for the request. 
2.  Public hearing. A public hearing shall be held for all requests for a preferred class nonconforming designation in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 1.12 (public hearing procedures). 
B.  Conditions for approval of a preferred class designation. Subsequent to a public hearing, the planning commission may grant a preferred class designation upon finding that all of the following conditions exist: 
1.  Use standards. 
a.  The nonconformity does not significantly depress the value of nearby properties. 
b.  The use does not adversely impact the public health, safety, and welfare. 
c.  The use does not adversely impact the purpose of the district where it is located. 
d.  No useful purpose would be served by the strict application of requirements for such a nonconformity under this ordinance. 
2.  Signage. If the application was initiated by the owner or person having beneficial use of the lot occupied by the nonconforming use, the planning commission may require that signage associated with the use be brought into compliance with article 13 (signs). 
3.  Plan for site improvements. If the application was initiated by the owner or person having beneficial use of the lot occupied by the nonconforming use, the planning commission may require that a site plan be submitted for review that addresses the site improvement priorities listed in section 22.04 (nonconforming sites). 
4.  Other conditions. The planning commission may attach conditions to the approval to assure that the use does not become contrary to the purpose of this article and ordinance, or the public health, safety and welfare. 
C.  Effect of approval of a preferred class designation. Preferred class nonconformities shall be permitted to be perpetuated and expanded in accordance with an approved site plan, subject to the provisions of this section and any conditions of approval. Preferred class nonconforming structures shall be permitted to be perpetuated, expanded, improved or rebuilt if damaged or destroyed in accordance with an approved site plan, subject to the provisions of this section and any conditions of approval. 
D.  Effect of denial of a preferred class designation. An application for a preferred class designation that has been denied by the planning commission may not be appealed to the board of zoning appeals, but may be resubmitted for planning commission consideration after a minimum of 365 days have elapsed from the date of denial. 
E.  Cessation of preferred class nonconforming uses. The preferred class designation shall be deemed removed when the primary structure occupied by a preferred class nonconforming use is permanently removed, or when a preferred class nonconforming use is replaced by a conforming use. All subsequent uses shall conform to the use provisions of this ordinance. 
F.  Rescinding approval of a preferred class designation. Failure of the owner, operator or person having beneficial use of a lot occupied by a preferred class nonconforming use to maintain the use or improve the site in accordance with the provisions of this section, an approved site plan or any conditions of approval shall be grounds for the planning commission to rescind the preferred class designation. Such action shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Public hearing. Such action may be taken only after a public hearing has been held in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 1.12 (public hearing procedures), at which time the owner, operator or person having beneficial use occupied by a preferred class nonconforming use shall be given an opportunity to present evidence in opposition to rescission. 
2.  Determination. Subsequent to the hearing, the decision of the commission with regard to the rescission shall be made, and written notification provided to said owner, operator or person having beneficial use occupied by a preferred class nonconforming use. 
G.  Existing residential dwellings in non-residential districts. Single-family and two-family (duplex) dwellings that are so existing and used in non-residential zoning districts before the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, are hereby designated as preferred class nonconforming uses. Such dwellings and accessory structures may be used, repaired, expanded, altered or replaced if destroyed, subject to the following conditions: 
1.  Use, repair, expansion, alteration, or replacement of the dwelling or accessory structures shall conform with all applicable lot, yard and setbacks requirements of this ordinance, as follows: 
a.  Single-family dwellings and accessory structures shall conform to the requirements of the R-3 district. 
b.  Two-family (duplex) dwellings and accessory structures shall conform to the requirements of the R-T district. 
2.  The use, dwelling and accessory structures shall be maintained in conformance with all other applicable federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, regulations and codes. 
Sec. 22.07. - Nonconforming use determinations. 
    This section is intended to provide reasonable standards for determining whether a use is nonconforming, and whether a nonconforming use has been removed, discontinued or otherwise ceased to occupy the land or structure in question. When there is a question or dispute about the status of a particular use, such determinations shall be made in writing by the city planner, with specific findings identified and a copy placed in the property file. Such determinations shall be subject to the following: 
A.  Standards for determining that a use is nonconforming. The city planner shall determine that a use is nonconforming upon finding that the following three statements are true: 
1.  The use does not conform with the purpose and use regulations of the district where it is located. 
2.  The use is in compliance with all other applicable federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, regulations and codes. 
3.  Evidence from a minimum of three of the following sources demonstrates that the use was lawfully established prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance: 
a.  Local, county or state government files or records, including but not limited to permits, inspection reports, dated photographs or notarized statements of government officials, agents, representatives or employees. 
b.  Dated telephone directories, or similar dated records that provide information about the occupants or uses located on a street by address or lot number. 
c.  Utility records, including but not limited to providers of water, sewer, electric, natural gas or telecommunications service.

f.  Other relevant information, including but not limited to date-stamped photographs, diary or log entries, affidavits or notarized statements. 
B.  Standards for determining that a nonconforming use has ceased. The city planner shall determine that a nonconforming use has been removed, discontinued or otherwise ceased to occupy the land or structure in question upon finding that a minimum of three of the following six statements are true: 
1.  Local, county or state government files or records show that the nonconforming use has ceased. Such evidence may include, but shall not be limited to permits, inspection reports, dated photographs or notarized statements of government officials, agents, representatives or employees. 
2.  Dated telephone directories, or similar dated records that provide information about the occupants or uses located on a street by address or lot number, show that the nonconforming use has ceased. Such evidence may include, but shall not be limited to entries that show the address associated with the use as vacant or occupied by another use, or show the telephone number associated with the use as disconnected or in use at another location. 
3.  Utility records, including, but not limited to providers of water, sewer, electric, natural gas or telecommunications service, show that the nonconforming use has ceased. Such evidence may include, but shall not be limited to records indicating that the address of the use is vacant or occupied by another use, the utility service associated with the use has been disconnected or the business, organization or individual associated with the use has moved to another location. 
4.  Dated advertising or other information published in a newspaper or magazine show that the nonconforming use has ceased. Such evidence may include, but shall not be limited to advertisements, articles, features or photographs that address the use of the land in question. 
5.  Dated aerial photos from Macomb or St. Clair counties, the Southeastern Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) or other sources as accepted by the city planner show that the nonconforming use has ceased. 
6.  Other relevant information shows that the nonconforming use has ceased. Such evidence may include, but shall not be limited to date-stamped photographs, diary or log entries, affidavits or notarized statements. 
Sec. 22.08. - Unlawful uses. 
    Any use that is not a conforming use in the district where it is located, or determined to be a nonconforming use, shall be considered an unlawful use established in violation of this ordinance. 
Sec. 22.09. - Change of tenancy or ownership. 
    There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of any existing nonconforming lot, structure, site or use. 
Sec. 22.10. - Cessation of a nonconforming use by city action. 
    The elimination of nonconforming structures and uses shall be considered to be for a public purpose and for a public use. The city council shall have the authority to institute and prosecute proceedings for the condemnation of nonconforming uses and structures under the power of eminent domain, in accordance with the Charter of the City of Richmond. The city council may, at its discretion, acquire private property by purchase, condemnation or otherwise for the purpose of removing a nonconforming use or structure, provided that the cost of acquiring such private property be paid from general funds or assessed to a special district established for that purpose.

B.  Determinations of similar uses. In recognition that every potential use cannot be addressed in this article, the BZA shall have the authority to determine whether a proposed use not listed in this article is similar to a principal or special condition use permitted by this article, subject to the following: 
1.  Prior to making such a determination, the BZA must find that the principal or special condition use closely resembles the proposed use in terms of characteristics, intensity, nature and other applicable common elements of such uses. 
2.  The BZA may determine that the use is (or is not) similar to a use listed in this article, or may recommend to the city council that the proposed use be addressed through an amendment to this article. 
3.  If it is determined that there is no similar use listed in this article, the use shall be prohibited. 
4.  If it is determined that the proposed use is similar to a use listed in this article, the proposed use shall comply with any conditions or special condition use standards that apply to the listed use. 
5.  The BZA may impose additional conditions or limitations upon the proposed use necessary to satisfy the intent and purposes of this article, to protect the health, safety, or welfare, or to preserve the social and economic wellbeing of adjacent residents and landowners, or the city as a whole. 
(Ord. No. 156-14, 3-17-14) 
Sec. 24.09. - Variances. 
    The board of zoning appeals shall have the authority to grant variances from specific requirements of this article in accordance with the City and Village Zoning Act (Public Act 207 of 1921, as amended) and the provisions of this article. 
The BZA shall state the grounds upon which it justifies the granting or denying of a variance, and may consider lesser variances than that requested by an applicant. In granting a variance, the BZA may impose conditions or limitations as it may deem reasonable in furtherance of the intent and purposes of this article. 
A.  Dimensional variances. The granting of a variance from particular area, setback, frontage, height, bulk, density or other dimensional (non-use) standards of this article shall require a finding of practical difficulties, based upon the following criteria: 
1.  Strict compliance with the specified dimensional standard(s) will deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners in the same zoning district, create an unnecessary burden on the applicant, or unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose. 
2.  The variance will do substantial justice to the applicant, as well as to other property owners, and a lesser variance than requested will not give substantial relief to the applicant or be consistent with justice to other property owners. 
3.  The need for the variance is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the land or structures involved, that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district. 
4.  The problem and resulting need for the variance has not been self-created by the applicant or the applicant's predecessors. 
5.  The variance will not cause significant adverse impacts to adjacent properties, the neighborhood or the city, and will not create a public nuisance or materially impair public health, safety, comfort, morals or welfare. 
6.  The alleged hardship and practical difficulties that will result from a failure to grant the variance include substantially more than mere inconvenience, or an inability to attain a higher financial return. 
B.  Use variances. The granting of a variance from the use provisions of this article shall require a finding of unnecessary hardship, based upon the following criteria: 
1.  The current zoning ordinance prohibits the property owner from securing any reasonable economic return or making any reasonable use of the property. Under this standard, the BZA must find that the property (land, structures and other improvements) is not suitable for uses permitted in the zoning district. 
2.  The landowner's plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not to general neighborhood conditions. Circumstances common to the larger neighborhood may reflect the unreasonableness of the zoning itself, which should be addressed through a rezoning or other legislative action. 
3.  The use variance, if granted, would not alter the essential character of the neighborhood. This standard requires consideration of whether the intent and purpose of the ordinance and zoning district will be preserved, and the essential character of the area will be maintained. 
4.  The hardship is not the result of the applicant's actions. Under this standard, the BZA must determine that the hardship that led to the use variance request was not self-created by the applicant. Purchase of a property with a pre-existing hardship does not constitute a self-created hardship. Financial hardships that would prevent reasonable use of the property shall be considered, but shall not be the only determining factor in granting a use variance. 
(Ord. No. 156-14, 3-17-14) 
Sec. 24.10. - Exceptions. 
    To hear and decide requests for exceptions and other matters upon which this article specifically authorizes the board of zoning appeals to act. Any exception shall be subject to such conditions as the BZA may require to preserve and promote the purpose of this article, and the character of the zoning district in question.
