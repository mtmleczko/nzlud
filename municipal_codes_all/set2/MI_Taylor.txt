PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Taylor, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1987 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1987 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and D.J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mary Ann Rilley, City Clerk; Michael Hurley, City Attorney; Sage Pare', Deputy City Clerk; and Lora Fell, Planning and Zoning Supervisor; for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

b.  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
1.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, except as provided in the plan, distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 701/2, if later.

3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death.

If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (c)(6)b.1 of this section), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.

The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bimonthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date.

b.  No designated beneficiary. If the member dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, distribution of the member's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
c.  Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. If the member dies before the date distribution of the member's interest begins, and the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member, except that the time by which distributions must begin will be determined without regard to subsection (c)(6)b.1 of this section.

An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more, and any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under IRC § 401(a)(9). For purposes of the direct rollover provision, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in IRC § 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified plan described in IRC § 401(a) or 403(b) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.

An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in IRC § 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in IRC § 408(a), an annuity plan described in IRC § 403(a), an annuity contract described in IRC § 403(b), an eligible plan under IRC § 457 which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan or a qualified trust described in IRC § 401(a), that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a domestic relations order. 
(3)  Distributee. A distributee includes a member or former member. In addition, the member's or former member's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the surviving spouse. 
(4)  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the retirement system to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(e)  Maximum annual earnings. For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, and before July 1, 1996, the annual compensation of each participant (member) taken into account for determining all benefits provided under the plan for any determination period shall not include any amounts in excess of the annual compensation limit provided for in IRC § 401(a)(17) prior to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA '93") and adjusted for inflation in the manner provided by IRC § 401(a)(17).

This limit may be adjusted as required by federal law for qualified government plans and shall be further adjusted for inflation in the manner provided by IRC § 401(a)(17). Annual compensation means compensation during the plan year or such other consecutive 12-month period over which compensation is otherwise determined under the plan. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year.

Actuarial assumptions that will be used to determine the amount or level of any optional benefit forms will be the actuarial equivalent of the normal retirement benefit. Optional benefits provided under the plan shall be actuarially adjusted in relation to the straight life annuity option. For purposes determining the IRC § 415 limitations, the interest rate assumption will not be less than the greater of five percent or the rate specified in the plan for determining actuarial equivalence for the particular form of retirement benefit. The actuarial early retirement reduction and reduction of the dollar limit if the member has less than ten years of participation under IRC § 415 do not apply to income received as a pension or annuity as a result of a member's personal injury, sickness or death and shall be administered in accordance with IRC § 415(b)(2), as amended. 
(g)  Forfeitures. Upon a member's separation of employment, the value of any forfeitable accrued benefit shall be forfeited by the member as of the member's last date of employment. The value of such forfeitures shall be used to reduce the employer's future contributions under the plan in accordance with IRC § 401(a)(8). No forfeitures under the plan shall be applied to increase the benefits that any member or beneficiary would otherwise receive at any time prior to the time when the plan may be terminated. If a member whose employment has terminated does not retain a vested benefit under the plan, they shall no longer be a member or retain or earn credited service under the plan unless and until they again become an employee. 
(h)  Military service. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and credited service with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with IRC § 414(u) and regulations. 
(i)  Forfeitability of accrued benefits. A member's right to their normal retirement benefit is nonforfeitable on the attainment of their normal retirement age as defined in IRC § 411(d)(3) and as defined and protected by article IX, section 24 of the state Constitution. In the event of termination or partial termination of the plan, a member's interest is nonforfeitable to the extent funded in conformity with applicable sections of this Code and any regulations. 
(j)  Prohibition against reversion. The retirement system and trust have been created for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries as set forth herein. The funds thereof have been established for the benefit of the members and for the operation of the retirement system.

(k)  Vesting. A member shall be 100 percent vested in their accrued benefit when they attain normal retirement age in accordance with IRC § 411(e) as in effect in 1974. 
(l)  Actuarial reports. Annually, or more frequently, the board shall obtain actuarial computations from an enrolled actuary as to the contributions necessary to fund the benefits provided by the plan on a reasonable basis in accordance with any applicable regulations, and such actuary shall certify such amounts to the employer. Contributions accumulated under the plan, along with the earnings thereon, will be distributed in accordance with the terms of the plan. 
(m)  Assignment of benefits. None of the benefits, payments, proceeds, claims, or rights of any participant (member) or their beneficiary hereunder shall be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law, or other process of law, nor shall any participant (member) or beneficiary have any right to transfer, assign, encumber, or otherwise alienate, any of the benefits or proceeds which the participant (member) may expect to receive, contingently or otherwise under the plan, except as provided under a domestic relations order.

(2)  Where the costs result from a charge, invoice, or other expense to the city for an emergency response by any other governmental or intergovernmental entity at the request or direction of the city pursuant to a mutual aid agreement. 
(3)  Where the costs result from a hazardous substances incident, subject to subsection (6) below. 
(4)  Where the costs result from a violation of law for which the responsible party has been convicted or found responsible in a court of law. 
(5)  Where the costs result for a large-scale incident. 
(6)  In the event of an emergency incident that involves a hazardous substances incident, to the extent the Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (being MCL 324.20101 et seq.) or any other law preempts the cost recovery provisions of this article, the liability for and recovery of costs of the emergency response shall be governed by the Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act or such other law, and the city may pursue collection of such costs of the emergency response in a civil action, pursuant to said laws.

Promptly after receipt of the animal by the second animal control shelter or animal protection shelter, the person to whom the animal was released shall provide the first animal control shelter or animal protection shelter with a written statement by the second animal control shelter or animal protection shelter containing a description of the dog, cat or ferret and acknowledging its receipt on a date specified in the statement.

Chapter 11 - MEDICAL MARIHUANA 
ARTICLE I. - GENERAL 

Sec. 11-1. - Purpose. 
    The City of Taylor recognizes that the citizens of the State of Michigan, by initiative, approved the medical use of marihuana and the possession of marihuana for such purposes by persons suffering from debilitating conditions defined in the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act, MCL 333.26421 et seq., (the "MMMA"). In addition, the MMMA authorizes registered qualifying patients to be assisted in such use by registered primary caregivers. It is in the public welfare to establish local standards to ensure that the procedures utilized to help the seriously ill with medicinal marihuana are compatible with the character of the community. The neighborhoods must be protected from any residual odors or dangerous conditions that are associated with marihuana cultivation and processing, including, but not limited to, explosions and fires caused by the grow process. This chapter is intended to impose local requirements for those individuals registered as "qualifying patients" and "primary caregiver" as defined under the MMMA, to contain growth of medical marihuana to specifically zoned areas within the city, and to restrict presence in neighborhoods only to those qualifying patients and/or caregivers who take safety measures to prevent hazards and odors associated with the growth and processing of marihuana. This chapter is intended to preserve the character of the community, and protect the citizens from any disruption, traffic, offensive odors or nuisance due to the growth, processing and distribution of medical marihuana, and to protect against dangerous conditions for the safety of the community.

(6)  On-site lighting in rooms with windows where medical marihuana is grown shall employ shielding methods between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., without alteration to the exterior of the residence, to prevent ambient light spillage that may create a disturbance for neighboring property. 
(7)  Information and records obtained through the registration process with the city that are deemed confidential under the MMMA shall be withheld from public disclosure, unless disclosure is compelled by law. 
(8)  All discarded marihuana and all by-products associated with the growth, processing and cultivations of medical marihuana must be disposed of in a way that prevents persons or animals from accessing the discarded materials.

Any such appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed with the city clerk within 30 days of the date of the invoice for said service fee.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2012-472, § 3, adopted June 19, 2012, set out provisions intended for use as div. 6, §§ 32-511-32-516. Due to said sections already existing, at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as div. 6, §§ 32-516-32-521. 

Sec. 32-516. - Findings, intent and purpose. 
(a)  The city finds that synthetic marijuana, consisting of plant or other material treated with chemicals or other substances that have not been approved for human consumption, is being marketed and sold as herbal incense and is being used in the same manner and for the same purposes as marijuana, with that use having become increasingly popular, particularly among teens and young adults. 
(b)  The city further finds based on information and reports from poison control centers, hospitals, emergency room doctors, and police agencies, that individuals who use synthetic marijuana experience dangerous side effects including convulsions, tremors, seizures, hallucinations, unconsciousness, anxiety attacks, dangerously elevated heart rates, increased blood pressure, vomiting, and disorientation, evidencing that these herbal incense products are harmful if consumed and present an imminent and significant public health danger to persons consuming such products and other persons coming in contact with them. 
(c)  The city further finds that, notwithstanding the high potential for abuse, and lack of any accepted medical use, the ability of the state to prohibit all forms of synthetic marijuana as a controlled substance has been frustrated due to the changing nature of the chemicals used in the manufacturing process. 
(d)  The city further finds that in addition to synthetic marijuana, there may be other products or materials containing chemicals or substances, that while not approved for human consumption, are or may be marketed and sold in a form that allows for such consumption and which, upon consumption, may result in the same serious side effects and public health dangers as synthetic marijuana. 
(e)  Based on these findings, this division is adopted for the purpose and with the intent to protect the public health and safety of the city and it residents from the threat posed by the availability and use of synthetic marijuana and other dangerous products by prohibiting persons from trafficking in, possessing, and using them in the city.

If the assessment exceeds the amount necessary by more than five percent, the entire excess shall be credited to owners of property as shown by the city assessment roll upon which such assessment has been levied, pro rata according to the assessment; provided, however, that no refunds of special assessments may be made which impair or contravene the provision of any outstanding obligation or bond secured in whole or part by such special assessments. When any special assessment roll shall prove insufficient to meet the cost of the improvement for which it was made, the city council may make an additional pro rata assessment, but the total amount assessed against any one parcel of land shall not exceed the benefits received by the lot or parcel of land.

All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be made in the manner as provided for the original assessment. If any portion of the original assessment shall have been collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount reassessed shall have been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the person making such payment.

ARTICLE VI. - UTILITIES USE OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY 

Sec. 44-159. - Legislative findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city presently has and in the future may permit additional utilities including, but not limited to, natural gas and electrical power (utilities) to enter into city-owned public rights-of-way, for construction, installation, operation and maintenance of, by way of example, conduits, access manholes, rights-of-way, poles, wires, pipes, mains, conductors or lines of pipe or other devices, appliances and appurtenances. 
(b)  The city has the authority to manage its public rights-of-way and to grant permits, licenses, and franchises for utilities using or crossing public rights-of-way in the city. This article is intended to minimize the disruption to the public rights-of-way and to require those who seek to construct utilities to cooperate in the construction and the restoration of public rights-of-way and of both overhead and underground lines. The city finds that it has too many unsightly overhead lines and poles in some sections of the city and that they are proliferating, adversely affecting the public safety, detracting from property values and reaching maximum safe capacity of poles and underground spaces. The city further finds that public health, safety and welfare is better served by requiring installation of new utility lines and wires in underground conduit wherever practical. 
(c)  The city has the authority under federal and state law to require fair and reasonable compensation, fees and charges for the use, access, operation and maintenance of its public rights-of-way and for the fixed and variable costs associated with site specific construction work including, but not limited to, inspections, approvals, permitting and utility staking.

ARTICLE IX. - RESIDENTIAL PARKING 

Sec. 48-211. - Purpose and intent. 
    The City of Taylor enacts this article to: 
(a)  Regulate and limit non-resident on-street parking in certain resident only parking zones; 
(b)  Promote efficient utilization of on-street parking in certain resident only parking zones; 
(c)  Protect the safety and welfare of residential neighborhoods within the city; and 
(d)  Provide enforcement of on-street parking regulations in certain residential only parking zones. 
(Ord. No. 2017-494, § 1, 5-16-2017) 
Sec. 48-212. - Legislative findings. 
    The city council finds that the continued vitality of the city depends on the preservation of safe, healthy, and attractive neighborhoods. The city council further finds that one factor that threatens the safety, health, viability and attractiveness of some of the city's neighborhoods is the excessive use of on-street parking by non-residents in certain residential neighborhoods. The number of non-resident motor vehicles using on-street parking in certain residential parking zones often exceeds the number of available on-street parking spaces and prevents residents from being able to utilize on-street parking. A parking system creating residential only parking zones, where appropriate, that limits non-resident motor vehicles from parking in those designated areas will reduce the burden to residents unable to find on-street parking in their residential zone and promote the general welfare of the City of Taylor and its residential neighborhoods.

The information supplied by the applicant for water service and service connections shall be considered as authoritative and final. If any error in such application shall cause the installation of a service connection that is improper, either in size or location, the cost of all changes required shall be borne by the applicant. 
(c)  Debt service on service connection. The water and sewer division shall under no circumstances finance service connections. However, as to previous financing of service connections, no more than an amount as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time for each service connection could be financed. All additional charges on connections longer than 70 feet were required to be paid at the time application for service was made. The service connection charge for connections installed under the revenue system covering all mains in the city at the time of adoption of this article shall be as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time per billing or fraction thereof, the first payment being paid at the time of applying for water service and the next on the regular water bill. 
(d)  Requirements for financing debt service charges. Only under previous ordinances was financing allowed. It was permitted under the following conditions:

(e)  Compliance with city ordinances. Unless otherwise permitted, no water connection shall be made and no water served to any premises in which plumbing and sewer fixtures do not comply fully with city ordinances. 
(f)  Temporary service connections. 
(1)  The term "temporary service connections" is applied to a connection installed to serve an individual, firm or corporation for a definite temporary period for such purposes as supplying water to a construction project or to a temporary structure. The department of public works reserves the right to refuse to install a temporary service connection for any reason deemed by it to be sufficient. Charges for temporary service connections are payable in advance and at the time that the application for service is made. The charge for a temporary service connection shall be the same as the charge for a permanent service connection; however, in addition to the connection charge, the applicant shall be required to pay in advance and at the time that the application is made the sum as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time to cover the cost of removing the temporary connection.

The location and size of the water meters shall be consistent with the nature, conditions and circumstances of the individual connection under consideration. The charge for unmetered water service for construction service and purposes shall be known as a construction service charge and shall be at a flat rate based upon the size of the water meter. The charge shall be collected in advance and at the time the service connection is discontinued. This charge is to cover the period of unmetered water service from the date of service of installation to the date of issuance of the occupancy permit by the building department. 
(4)  Whenever, in the opinion of the department of public works, unmetered water service is used for a purpose or in a manner contrary to the normal usage for which the flat rate was computed, the department of public works may elect that a meter be installed and that the charge for service rendered be at the regular metered rate. 
(g)  Cross connections. No cross connection between pipes connected with the water supply system and another source of water supply shall be permitted for any purpose whatsoever. 
(h)  Manifold service connections. In all cases where manifold service connections are desired in buildings divided into separate business places, permits for such connection may be issued only after approval by the water and sewer commission. In every case of a manifold connection, there must be a master stop for each branch thereof. 
(i)  Disconnecting unused service lines. The department of public works reserves the right to disconnect from the main any unused and non-revenue-producing service connection if the cost of maintenance of such service connection becomes excessive or for such other reasons as are deemed sufficient by the department of public works and the fee for such disconnection of unused service lines shall be charged to the property and if unpaid, become a lien thereon as of the date of disconnection. In case water service is desired at the same location at some later date, application for water service and for a service connection shall be required. The charge for the installation for the new service connection shall be at that regular rate. 
(j)  Turning water service on and off. Upon request, water shall be promptly turned on or off by the department of public works, provided that all rules of the department have been met.

(k)  Collection of delinquent accounts. Whenever the rates or charges fixed for services rendered are not paid, shut off of water and collection procedures shall be enforced in accordance with the laws of the state and provisions of city ordinances. 
(l)  Shutoff notice. Customers whose bills remain unpaid on the due date may be forwarded a shutoff notice. If bills are not paid within 30 days after the date of the shutoff notice, the customer's service may be turned off without further notice. 
(m)  Charges for turning water off and on. All charges for turning water off and on shall be set by city council resolution from time to time. 
(n)  Interruption of service and damage to property. The department of public works will exercise reasonable diligence and care to deliver a continuous and sufficient supply of water to the consumer as is furnished to the city by the Detroit Water Board or its successor under the supply contract in force. The department of public works shall attempt to avoid any shortage or interruption or insufficiency of the supply. However, the department of public works assumes no liability for any loss or damage occasioned by an insufficient supply of water. 
(o)  Advance notice of interruption of service. Whenever the department of public works finds it necessary to interrupt water service to any district or section served by it, it will, when practicable, give advance notice to affected customers. 
(p)  Extension of service lines beyond property limits. Except in those cases where a contrary authorization is granted by the department of public works, no extension shall be made to a service line or water pipe for the purpose of conveying water to a point beyond the limits of the existing structure or proposed structure for which the water line was installed. A determination of the limits of the property to which water has been supplied is to be made by reference to the original application for water services. Service connections between the city water main and the location of the water meter are hereby expressly prohibited. 
(q)  Persons authorized to turn on water service. Water service shall not be turned on by anyone other than an employee of or a duly appointed agent of the department of public works. 
(r)  Resale or redistribution of water. No water shall be resold or redistributed by the recipient thereof from the water supply system to any premises other than that for which the application was made and the water meter was installed. Exceptions to this rule may be allowed in emergency situations. 
(s)  Conformity to specifications. No water service shall be provided unless it conforms to approved specifications. A copy of those specifications shall be kept on file with the city and shall be available to any interested person. 
(t)  Withholding water supply. The supply of water may be withheld from premises when the ordinances of the city or the rules and regulations of the water and sewer division have been in any manner violated. If any person shall, after the water supply has been shut off to any premises, cause such premises to be supplied with water from the water and sewer division without its permission, such premises shall be disconnected from the distribution pipe of the water and sewer division.

(Ord. No. 09-434, § 3.03, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 3.04. - Open space preservation (cluster) development. 
(a)  Intent. This section permits, by special land use approval, residential development which, through innovative design, will encourage creative development benefiting the total community by preserving desirable open space in the form of woodlands, wetlands and other natural assets, or providing useable open space as an integral part of the residential living environment. This development option is also intended to be applied to infill parcels or sites exhibiting unusual characteristics or land use relationships. These provisions are not intended to result in an increase in density, but rather to allow for a more creative distribution of the permitted number of dwelling units on designated portions of the site. 
(b)  Qualification of parcel. At least one of the following qualifications must be demonstrated to approve an open space preservation development: 
(1)  The parcel contains natural assets, supported by documented evidence, which will be preserved through as an integral part of the design. These assets may include natural stands of large trees, land which serves as a natural habitat for wildlife, wetlands, steep topography, bodies of water (e.g., streams or ponds), or other natural features that should be preserved. 
(2)  The parcel contains floodplain or wetlands that would be preserved as undeveloped common open space. 
(3)  At least 20 percent of the site will be set aside as open space for conservation or active recreational purposes. 
(4)  Unusual physical characteristics, such as size or shape of the parcel, are present that reasonably prevent using conventional development. 
(5)  Conventional development would result in a substantial number of the lots abutting a major or secondary thoroughfare and be subjected to disturbance by vehicular traffic, noise and lights. 
(6)  The adjoining or adjacent land uses warrant a creative development alternative to facilitate a suitable transition between uses. 
(c)  Density. The number of dwelling units allowable within an open space preservation development shall be determined through preparation of a alternate conventional development plan. The alternate conventional development plan shall show how the site would be developed with a conventional subdivision based upon the existing zoning district. The alternate conventional development plan is intended only to illustrate the allowable density for a site based upon the existing zoning district and is not an approved development plan. 
(1)  The applicant shall present to the planning commission for review, an alternate conventional development plan for the project that is consistent with state, county, and city requirements and design criteria for a tentative preliminary plat. The alternate conventional development plan shall include sufficient right-of-way for roadways, common park area, and contain sufficient area for stormwater detention. 
(2)  The alternate conventional development plan shall provide lots meeting all dimensional standards of the zoning district. Lots may include wetlands or other unbuildable land provided that a buildable area for each lot is available. 
(3)  Once the allowed density is determined, then the same number of units shall be used for the open space preservation development. 
(d)  Dwelling unit type. Detached and attached single-family units are permitted. The maximum number of attached units permitted in a single building is four. 
(e)  Placement and building requirements for attached units. All attached units shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  All principal buildings shall be set back at least 35 feet from all perimeter lot lines of the development site, including major streets. Accessory buildings, common parking areas and driveways may be located a minimum of ten feet from any adjoining lot line, except a street right-of-way. 
(2)  Buildings shall be set back at least 25 feet from the internal street right-of-way line. For private streets where there is no public right-of-way or access easement, the required front yard setback shall be measured from a parallel line 30 feet from the centerline of the street. 
(3)  A setback of at least 15 feet shall be provided between the sides of buildings. There shall be at least 40 feet between the backs of residential buildings. 
(4)  The minimum required floor area shall be as required by the applicable district within which the parcel is located. 
(5)  No dwelling unit shall exceed a height of 25 feet. 
(6)  Variety in the design of individual groups of units shall be provided through the use of design details to avoid a continuous or repetitious appearance. 
(f)  Placement standards for detached units. 
(1)  To achieve the minimum open space requirement, lot areas and widths may be reduced below the district requirements; provided that an area equal to or greater than the total net area of lot reduction for the development shall be set aside as common open space. 
(2)  The setback requirements of the district may be reduced by up to 25 percent. The setbacks may be further reduced by the planning commission upon a specific finding that it will result in enhanced buffering from adjacent land uses or public rights-of-way, or preservation of additional natural features. 
(3)  The maximum building height shall meet the requirements of the district. 
(4)  The minimum dwelling unit floor area shall meet the requirements of the district. 
(g)  Open space. 
(1)  A minimum of 20 percent of the site shall be set aside as common open space for conservation or recreational purposes. At least one-half of the required open space shall be useable for recreation. 
(2)  The open space preservation development shall meet all of the design standards required by the city subdivision regulations. 
(3)  The master deed shall provide that all designated open space will be irrevocably dedicated for that purpose and shall prohibit use of the open space for future development. The city may require that conveyances or other documents be placed in escrow to accomplish this purpose. The master deed required by this section shall be reviewed and approved by the city, at the applicant's cost. A performance guarantee in accordance with section 25.08, performance guarantees may be required. 
(h)  General development requirements. 
(1)  At least two deciduous trees per dwelling unit meeting the size requirements of section 16.02, landscaping, shall be planted along internal streets and throughout the development portion of the site. 
(2)  A greenbelt in accordance with table 16.02.a shall be provided, in addition to any rear yard setback, along any part of the property that abuts a major street. The greenbelt or an equivalent natural buffer shall be landscaped with an undulating landscaped berm. Berms shall be planted with grass and slopes shall be gentle enough to avoid erosion. Berm locations shall be designed so that the view of oncoming traffic is not obscured. 
(3)  Sidewalks are required along all streets in accordance with the city's subdivision regulations and section 16.04, sidewalks. A pedestrian circulation plan shall be submitted and approved by the planning commission for the lands included in the open space. 

(i)  Review procedures. Applications for residential open space preservation developments shall reviewed in accordance with the following process: 
(1)  Special land use and preliminary plan review. 
a.  In submitting an application for qualification of a parcel for open space preservation development to the planning commission, the petitioner shall include documentation substantiating one or more of the characteristics outlined in section 3.04(b), qualification of parcel. The qualification approval shall remain valid for a period of 18 months from the date of the special land use and concept plan approval. 
b.  The application shall include an aerial photograph depicting the entire site and a concept plan (drawn to scale) showing how the petitioner intends to develop the site. At a minimum the concept plan shall include the following: 
1.  Outline of the property showing the relationship of abutting properties and/or structures. 
2.  Placement and basic configuration of buildings. 
3.  Circulation patterns. 
4.  Preservation/open space areas. 
5.  Density calculations and number of units proposed. 
6.  Buffering/screening techniques to be used. 
c.  The petitioner shall also submit a tentative preliminary plat or a preliminary condominium site plan with the special land use for concurrent review. Tentative preliminary plat applications shall meet all of the requirements of the city subdivision regulations. Tentative preliminary condominium plans shall meet all of the requirements of article 23, condominiums. 
d.  Upon receipt of the completed application, the request shall be given to the planning commission for placement on an agenda as a special land use as provided in article 21, special land use review. Following the public hearing, the planning commission shall take action on the special land use and make a recommendation to the city council on the tentative preliminary plat or condominium, as applicable. 
e.  Once the city council approves the tentative preliminary plat or condominium, as applicable, the approved plan shall become the basis for the final approval process. 
f.  Substantial departures from the tentative preliminary plat or condominium shall require a public hearing and approval of a new plan following the process above. 
(2)  Final plan review. Following approval of the special land use and tentative preliminary plat approval or site condominium, as applicable, the applicant shall prepare detailed plans for final approval. Final plans along with a draft of the master deed and bylaws or restrictive covenants shall be submitted for approval of the final preliminary plat or final condominium site plan in accordance with the applicable process under the city subdivision regulations or article 23, condominiums. All final preliminary plats or condominium plans shall conform with the tentative preliminary plan, all conditions attached to the special land use approval, and the other requirements of this ordinance. 
(j)  Appeals. The zoning board of appeals (ZBA) shall not have the authority to hear appeals of the planning commission's decision to approve or deny a special land use for an open space preservation development, nor to grant variances to the specific standards of this section or any conditions imposed on preliminary approval. The ZBA may hear requests for variances to dimensional requirements of individual lot owners following approval of the final site plan for the development.

ARTICLE 04. - MULTIPLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 

Sec. 4.01. - Intent. 
(a)  The R-2 Townhouse Residential District is designed as an intermediate density zoning district that allows a variety of housing types, including the single-family attached dwelling commonly termed the townhouse. It is intended that this district be used primarily on collector streets on smaller land parcels and in situations where the close proximity of single-family detached housing developments would be adversely influenced by the higher density traditional multiple family complex. It is intended to encourage development which, though multiple-family in nature, is closer in character or scale to single-family development, with duplexes and attached townhouses, each having individual entrances, yards, driveways and garages. 
(b)  The RM-1 Low Rise Multiple-Family Residential District is intended to provide sites for multiple-family dwellings of low-rise construction and residentially-related uses that serve the residents in the district. This district is intended to provide a proper environment for families that are smaller in size than those living in single-family dwellings, who wish to live in low-rise multiple-family dwellings. The RM-1 district is designed to furnish sites for various types of attached single-family and multiple-family dwelling structures and may serve as a transition between nonresidential districts and lower density single-family residential districts. 
(c)  The RM-2 High Rise Multiple-Family Residential District is intended to provide sites for multistory multiple-family dwelling structures primarily for the elderly. These structures shall serve the residential needs of elderly persons desiring multiple-family accommodations with central services.

ARTICLE 06. - BUSINESS AND OFFICE DISTRICTS 

Sec. 6.01. - Intent. 
(a)  The B-1 Local Business District is intended to meet the day-to-day convenience shopping and service needs of persons residing in adjacent residential areas. B-1 district designations are located within close proximity to areas planned for large residential populations, and are intended to serve the immediate vicinity so as not to create unnecessary additional traffic. In order to promote business development compatible with nearby residential, uses are prohibited that would create hazards, offensive and loud noises, vibration, smoke, glare, heavy truck traffic, or late hours of operation. 
(b)  The B-2 Regional Business District is intended to serve a larger population than is serviced by a B-1 district. The district is general characterized by an integrated or planned cluster of establishments serviced by a common parking area and generating a large volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The intent of this district is also to encourage the concentration of regional business areas to the mutual advantage of both the consumers and merchants and thereby to promote the best use of land at certain strategic locations and to avoid encouraging marginal strip, business development along arterial streets. Special attention must be focused on site layout, building design, vehicular and pedestrian circulation and coordination of site features between adjoining sites. 
(c)  The B-3 General Business District is intended to provide for retail commercial services dependent on major street traffic. The uses in the B-3 district will be more automotive oriented and serve a market that includes city residents and residents from surrounding communities. The permitted uses would be located at the juncture of principal streets and are generally not appropriate immediately adjacent to residential zoning districts. Special attention must be focused on site layout, building design, vehicular circulation and buffering from other nearby uses. 
(d)  The O-1 Office District is intended to accommodate uses such as offices for professional and business services, planned office developments, as well as appropriately located related and ancillary services and uses. The O-1 district is intended to permit those office and personal service uses which will establish an appropriate district for uses which do not generate large volumes of traffic, traffic congestion, and parking problems, and which will promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with the master plan. The O-1 district is further intended to provide a buffer or zone of transition between residential and commercial districts and between residential districts and arterial streets. 
(e)  The O-2 Regional Office District is designed and intended to accommodate large office buildings and restricted related retail and service establishments which service large numbers of people. The O-2 district is intended to permit those office and personal service uses which will provide office buildings in landscaped settings to create office parks or landmark office buildings.

ARTICLE 07. - MIDTOWN DISTRICTS 

Sec. 7.01. - Intent. 
    The MT-1 Midtown Taylor Office/Institutional District and MT-2 Midtown Taylor Mixed Use Commercial District, are intended to promote the development of a pedestrian oriented and accessible, central commercial service district in which a variety of retail, commercial, office, civic and residential uses are permitted consistent with the City of Taylor Master Plan. Each use shall be complimentary to the stated function and purpose of the district and shall not have adverse impact upon adjacent street capacity and safety, utilities, and other city services. The MT-1 and MT-2 districts are further intended to: 
(a)  Encourage traditional, pedestrian-oriented commercial/mixed use developments in a walkable main street environment. 
(b)  Extend greater opportunities for greater traditional community living, working, housing, and recreation to all citizens and residents of the city. 
(c)  Encourage a more efficient use of land and of public services and to reflect changes in technology of land development, by directing new development in a traditional pattern of mixed use and varied commercial styles. 
(d)  Create a community center that is pedestrian, and transit-friendly, which supports a healthier and more sustainable community. 
(e)  Reduce the excess sprawl of development and the segregation of land uses that cause increased vehicle travel and traffic congestion. 
(f)  Discourage the development of separate off-street parking facilities for each individual use, and to encourage the development of off-street parking facilities to accommodate the needs of several individual uses. 
(g)  Prohibit the development of drive-through facilities, which degrade the pedestrian environment, contribute to traffic congestion and create a nuisance to residential uses in the type of compact mixed use environment desired for the Midtown area. 
(h)  Prohibit uses that are disruptive to pedestrian activities and have as their principal function the sale and services of motor vehicles, such as automobile service stations, auto parts retail stores, carwashes, new and used motor vehicle sales or service establishments, drive-in restaurants and restaurants with drive-through facilities, business with drive-through facilities such as, but not limited to banks, credit unions, pharmacies, etc. 
(i)  Promote the creation of urban places, which are orientated to the pedestrian, thereby promoting citizen security and social interaction. 
(j)  Promote developments where the physical, visual and spatial characteristics are established and reinforced through the consistent use of compatible urban design and architectural design elements. Such elements shall relate to the design characteristics of an individual structure or development of other existing and planned structures or developments in a harmonious manner (architectural texture or pattern), resulting in coherent overall development patterns and streetscape. 
(k)  Discourage commercial and business uses that create noise, glare or odors, which are a nuisance in a mixed use environment. 
(l)  More efficiently provide for parking through shared parking and on-street parking where appropriate.

ARTICLE 08. - INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS 

Sec. 8.01. - Intent. 
(a)  The purpose of the TRO Technology-Research-Office District, is to provide an environment where high tech uses and functions such as engineering, design, research and development, computer assisted design, robotics research, prototype development and limited manufacturing, telecommunications, and related storage, warehousing and limited assembly operations associated with principal permitted uses can be located. Advances in industry, technology, and office research facilities, have created uses which are related to industry and office uses, but may not be appropriate or function adequately in a typical industrial or office zoning district. These uses have been identified as high tech uses. The TRO district will be located in a campus-type environment and so situated that uses will be developed without being negatively impacted by elements and conditions which are commonly found in an industrial zoning district. 
(b)  The I-1 Light Industrial District is designed so as to primarily accommodate wholesale activities, warehouses, and industrial operations whose external, physical effects are restricted to the area of the district and in no manner affect in a detrimental way any of the surrounding districts. The I-1 district is so structured as to permit, along with any specified uses, the manufacturing, compounding, processing, packaging, assembly, and/or treatment of finished or semi-finished products from previously prepared materials. It is further intended that the processing of raw material for shipment in bulk form, to be used in an industrial operation at another location, not be permitted. Uses in this district must have less of an impact on surrounding uses and generate less truck traffic than the other industrial developments. Limitations regarding the degree of noise, smoke, glare, odor, and vibration are placed upon such uses to preclude any adverse effects upon nearby commercial or residential districts. It is intended that this district act as a transition between heavier industrial uses and residential or commercial areas. The general goals of this use district include, among others, the following specific purposes: 
(1)  To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations, to meet the needs of the city's expected future economy for the types of manufacturing and related uses described herein. 
(2)  To protect abutting residential districts by separating them from manufacturing activities, and by prohibiting the use of such industrial areas for new residential development. 
(3)  To promote manufacturing development which is free from danger of fire, explosion, toxic and noxious matter, radiation, and other hazards, and from offensive noise, vibration, smoke, odor, and other objectionable influences. 
(4)  To promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with a well considered plan. To protect the character and established pattern of adjacent development, and in each area to conserve the value of land and buildings and other structures, and to protect the city's tax revenue. 
(c)  The I-2 General Industrial District is designed primarily for manufacturing, assembling, and fabrication activities including large scale or specialized industrial operations, whole external physical effects will be felt to some degree by surrounding districts. The I-2 district is so structured as to permit the manufacturing, processing, and compounding of semi-finished or finished products from raw materials as well as from previously prepared material. The I-2 district is further designed to provide areas within the city where heavy industrial uses can most efficiently utilize major streets, utilities and other infrastructure while minimizing any incompatible aspects with neighboring districts.

(k)  Wireless communication facilities and services. 
(1)  Purpose and intent. The regulations of this section are intended to conform with federal laws and administrative rules governing facilities needed to operate wireless communication systems and to set forth procedures and standards for review and approval for the location of such facilities within the City of Taylor. It is the city's intent to reasonably regulate the location and design of such facilities to retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character, property values and aesthetic quality of the city and to also ensure compliance with FAA height restrictions in the vicinity of the Detroit/Wayne County Metro Airport. Given the increase in the number of wireless communication facilities requested as a result of the new technology and the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the policy of the city that all users should co-locate on attached wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures. Collocation is proposed in order to assure the most economic use of land and to prevent the proliferation of duplicative services. In recognition of the city's concern that technological advances may render certain wireless communication facilities obsolete or unnecessary in the future, requirements are set forth for the removal of unused or unnecessary facilities in a timely manner and provide security for removal. 
(2)  Use requirements. Wireless communication facilities may be located within the city in accordance with table 13.12.

(6)  Collocation. 
a.  Statement of policy. It is the policy of the City of Taylor to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless communication support structures within the city and to encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communication facilities. If a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or controlled by it, where collocation is feasible, the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be required, in contradiction with city policy. Collocation shall be required unless an applicant demonstrates that collocation is not feasible. 
b.  Feasibility of collocation. Collocation shall be deemed feasible for the purpose of this section where all of the following are met: 
1.  The wireless communication provider or property owner where collocation is proposed will accept market rent or other market compensation for collocation and the wireless communication provider seeking the facility will pay such rates. 
2.  The site on which collocation is being considered, taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is able to provide structural support. 
3.  The collocation being considered is technically reasonable, e.g. the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate physical and other adjustments in relation to the structure, antennas and the like. 
(7)  Nonconforming facilities and penalties for not permitting collocation. If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication support structure shall fail or refuse to alter a structure to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible collocation, such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be altered, expanded or extended in any respect. In addition, if a party refuses to allow collocation in accordance with the intent of this section, and this action results in construction of a new tower, the city may refuse to approve a new wireless communication support structure from that party for a period of up to five years. Such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning board of appeals (ZBA) if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which, in this context, shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five-year prohibition would unreasonably burden some providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication services, or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services. 
(8)  Variances. The ZBA may consider a variance from the standards of this section, based upon a finding that one or more of the following factors exist, as appropriate for the type of variance requested: 
a.  For location, the applicant has demonstrated that a location within a district or location in accordance with the standards of this section cannot reasonably meet the coverage or capacity needs of the applicant. 
b.  For no collocation the applicant has demonstrated that a feasible collocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs because existing structures cannot support the facility, that collocation would result in unreasonable interference, or that reasonable financial terms are not available for collocation. 
c.  For setback, the applicant has provided engineering information that documents that the tower is self collapsing and that the setback area provided shall accommodate the structure should it fall or break and provide a reasonable buffer in the event the structure fails. 
d.  For all, the applicant has proposed means to mitigate any negative impacts through provision for future collocation, if found to be appropriate by the city, and special design of the facility and site. 
e.  For all, the wireless communication and accessory facilities shall be designed to be compatible with the existing character of the proposed site, neighborhood and general area.

e.  Where street traffic noises directly adjacent to the boundary line exceed these maximum permitted levels, the intensity levels permitted may then exceed those levels specified in the tables but may not exceed the level of the subject adjacent street traffic noises. For those areas in which the existing background noise levels exceed the maximum permitted levels, the noise levels at the boundary line may not exceed the background noise levels. In such cases, a study shall be made to determine the character of the background noise to include sources, levels and duration. 
f.  Sounds of an intermittent nature or characterized by pure tones may be a source of complaints even if the measured level does not exceed that specified. In such cases, the complaints shall be investigated to determine the nature of and justification for the complaint and possible corrective action. If the complaints are not resolved within 60 days, the development services department may then proceed to take steps to enforce the terms of the zoning ordinance in accordance with the remedies provided herein. 
(2)  Drifted and airborne matter generally. The drifting or airborne transmission beyond the lot line of dust, particles or debris shall be unlawful and shall be summarily caused to be abated.

ARTICLE 17. - OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING, ACCESS AND CIRCULATION REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 17.01. - Off-street parking, loading, access and circulation requirements. 
(a)  Applicability of parking requirements. For all buildings and uses established after the effective date of this ordinance, off-street parking shall be provided as required by this article. 
(1)  Whenever use of a building or lot is changed to another classification of use, off-street parking facilities shall be provided as required by this article. 
(2)  If the intensity of use of any building or lot is increased, through the addition of floor area, increase in seating capacity or other means, additional off-street parking shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use. 
(3)  Off-street parking facilities in existence on the effective date of this ordinance shall not be reduced below the requirements of this article. 
(4)  An area designated as required off-street parking shall not be changed to another use, unless equal facilities are provided elsewhere in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Collective or shared parking. Two or more buildings or uses may use a common parking facility provided that the number of parking spaces provided is equal to the required number of spaces for all of the uses computed separately. Cumulative parking requirements for mixed use developments or shared facilities may be reduced by the planning commission where it can be determined that one or more of the factors listed in subsection (d) below apply. Where uses are on separately owned lots, a legal agreement for shared parking shall be recorded and a copy provided to the city before a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
(c)  Reduction of parking requirements. The planning commission may reduce the parking requirements based upon a finding that there will be a lower demand for parking due to one or more of the following: 
(1)  Shared parking by multiple uses where there will be a high proportion of multi-purpose visits or uses have peak parking demands during differing times of the day or days of the week. Pedestrian connections shall be maintained between the uses. For separate lots, they shall be adjacent each other, with pedestrian, and vehicular connections maintained between the lots. Shared parking agreements shall be filed with the Wayne County Register of Deeds and the city clerk after approval by the planning commission before a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
(2)  Convenient municipal off-street parking or on-street spaces located along the site's frontage. 
(3)  Expectation of walk-in business due to sidewalk connections to adjacent residential neighborhoods or employment centers. In allowing a parking space reduction the site design shall incorporate pedestrian connections to the site and on-site pedestrian circulation providing safe and convenient access to the building entrance. 
(4)  Availability of other forms of travel such as transit. In allowing a parking space reduction the planning commission may require the site design incorporate transit stops, pedestrian connections to nearby transit stops or bicycle parking facilities. 
(5)  Where the applicant has provided a parking study, conducted by a qualified traffic engineer, that demonstrates that another standard would be more appropriate based on actual number of employees, expected level of customer traffic or actual counts at a similar establishment. The planning commission may require a parking study to document that any one of the criteria subsection (c)(1) through (4) above would be met. 
(d)  Maximum allowed parking. In order to minimize excessive areas of pavement which reduces aesthetic standards and contribute to high rates of stormwater runoff, exceeding the minimum parking space requirements by more than ten percent shall only be allowed with approval by the planning commission. In granting such additional space, the planning commission shall determine that such parking will be required, based on documented evidence, to accommodate the use on a typical day. The planning commission may require that additional spaces be constructed with alternative paving materials, such as permeable/grass pavers or pervious concrete. 
(e)  Banked parking. 
(1)  Where a reduction in the number of parking spaces is not warranted but an applicant demonstrates that the parking requirements for a proposed use would be excessive, the planning commission may defer some of the parking. The site plan shall designate portions of the site for future construction of the required parking spaces, which shall be maintained in a landscaped appearance and not occupy required greenbelts, or parking lot setbacks or be used for any other purpose. Landscaping, such as parking lot trees that would otherwise be required for the banked parking, shall be installed in the area of the banked parking. 
(2)  The banked parking shall be required to meet ordinance requirements if constructed. Construction of the deferred parking area to add parking spaces may be initiated by the owner or required by the development services department, based on parking needs or observation, and shall require administrative approval of an amended site plan. The development services department may request a performance guarantee to cover the cost of developing the deferred parking lot. 
(f)  Residential parking. 
(1)  Single-family residential parking spaces shall consist of a parking strip, driveway, garage, or combination thereof, and shall be located on the premises they are intended to serve. 
(2)  Single-family residential parking spaces shall be located on hard or pervious concrete, asphalt or permeable/grass pavers. Lawn and yard areas, other than designated parking areas, shall not be utilized for off-street parking. Driveways shall be required to be concrete if the adjoining street is concrete. 
(3)  A minimum three-foot wide lawn or landscape strip shall be required between the edge of parking area pavement and all lot lines to provide adequate room for drainage, snow storage and privacy screening. 
(4)  Circular drives shall be prohibited unless driveway access points are separated by an interior distance of 70 feet. A minimum lot width of 100 feet shall be required. 
(5)  Carports and garages for multiple-family dwellings shall be calculated as parking spaces on a 1:1 ratio basis. Carports and garages in multiple-family dwelling developments shall be designed and located in accordance with the following: 
a.  A maximum height of 14 feet, measured from the grade to the peak of the structure. 
b.  Be enclosed or screened at least 25 percent along sides visible from public streets, single-family residential districts or vehicular drives within the site. 
c.  Not permitted in the front yard. 
d.  Location shall be approved by the fire marshal for emergency vehicle circulation.

1 Major streets are defined in article 28, definitions. 
2 For sites with insufficient street frontage to meet the above criterion, the planning commission may require construction of the driveway on a side street, a shared driveway with an adjacent property, construction of the driveway along the lot line farthest from the intersection, or require a service street. 
(2)  Minimum spacing between two driveways shall be determined based upon posted speed limits along the parcel frontage. The minimum spacing indicated in table 17.05.b. are measured from centerline to centerline on the same side of the street. 
(3)  To reduce left-turn conflicts, new driveways shall be aligned with those across the street where possible. If alignment is not possible along major streets, driveways shall be offset from those on the opposite side of the street as follows:

a.  If the proposed drive is offset such that vehicles turning left into driveways do not pass prior to reaching the driveways, the minimum spacing shall be 150 feet. 
b.  If the proposed drive is offset such that vehicles turning left into driveways will pass prior to reaching the driveways, the minimum spacing shall be as follows: 

TABLE 17.05.C. OPPOSING DRIVEWAY OFFSET REQUIREMENTS 
Peak Hour Trip Generation of Use Minimum Driveway Offset Less than 200 trips 150 feet 200-300 trips 250 feet More than 300 trips 400 feet  

(4)  In the case of expansion, alteration or redesign of an existing development where it can be demonstrated that preexisting conditions prohibit adherence to the minimum driveway spacing standards, the planning commission may modify the driveway spacing requirements. Such modifications shall be the minimum necessary, but in no case shall spacing of a full-access driveway be less than 60 feet, measured centerline to centerline. 
(c)  Number of driveways. 
(1)  The number of driveways serving a property shall be the minimum number necessary to provide reasonable access and access for emergency vehicles, while preserving traffic operations and safety along the public street. 
(2)  Access shall be provided per separately owned parcel. This access may be an individual driveway, shared driveway or via a service drive. Additional driveways may be permitted for property meeting the following requirements: 
a.  One additional driveway for properties with a continuous frontage of over 300 feet, and one additional driveway per additional 300 feet of frontage, if the Planning commission determines there are no other reasonable access opportunities. 
b.  A traffic impact study determines additional access is justified without compromising traffic operations along the public street. 
c.  Two one-way driveways may be permitted where the frontage is at least 125 feet. 
(d)  Driveway design. 
(1)  All driveways shall be designed according to the standards of the city, county or MDOT, as appropriate. Driveways shall have a maximum width of 30 feet, excluding tapers or curb radii. Wider driveways shall be allowed for locations with large volumes of truck traffic in accordance with section 17.04, truck maneuvering, access and circulation standards. 
(2)  For high traffic generators, or for driveways along streets experiencing or expected to experience congestion, the planning commission may require two egress lanes. 
(3)  For a boulevard entrance, a fully curbed island, at least 180 square feet in area, shall separate the ingress and egress lanes. The radii forming the edges on this island shall be designed to accommodate the largest vehicle that will normally use the driveway. The planning commission may require landscaping tolerant of street conditions on the section outside the public right-of-way. 
(e)  Shared driveways, frontage streets and service drives. 
(1)  The number of access points may be reduced where the planning commission determines that there may be a beneficial effect on traffic operations and safety, while preserving the property owner's right to reasonable access. In this case, a shared driveway, frontage street or rear service drive connecting two or more properties or uses may be required. Service streets may be required near existing traffic signals or near locations having potential for future signalization; along major streets with high traffic volumes; and where there are a relatively high number of accidents or limited sight distance. Shared access or cross access shall be required between all sites that are in the same or similar zoning district (i.e., between all adjacent commercially zoned properties). 
(2)  Shared driveways and service streets shall be within an access easement recorded with the Wayne County Register of Deeds. A draft of the access easement shall be provided to the city for review and approval prior to filing. 
(3)  Service street and shared driveway design standards. 
a.  Location. Service streets shall generally be parallel or perpendicular to the front lot line and may be located either in front of, adjacent to, or behind, principal buildings. The planning commission shall determine the most appropriate alignment, taking into account setbacks of existing buildings and anticipated traffic flow for the site and the corridor. 
b.  Access easement. The service street shall be within an access easement permitting traffic circulation between properties. This easement shall be a minimum of 40 feet wide. The required width shall remain free and clear of obstructions, unless otherwise approved by the planning commission. 
c.  Construction and materials. Service streets shall have a base, pavement and curb with gutter in accordance Wayne County standards for public streets, except the width of the service street shall have a minimum pavement width of 26 feet or as approved by the city engineer. 
d.  Parking. The service street is intended to be used exclusively for circulation, not as a parking maneuvering aisle. The planning commission may require the posting of no parking signs along the service street by the property owner/developer at the property owner's/developer's expense. The planning commission may permit temporary parking in the easement area where a continuous service street is not yet available, provided that the layout allows removal of the parking in the future to allow extension of the service street. 
e.  Access to service street. The planning commission shall approve the location of all accesses to the service street, based on the driveway spacing standards of this section. The planning commission may allow additional driveways if recommended by the city engineer, county or MDOT, and consistent with purpose of this section. 
f.  Temporary access. The planning commission may approve temporary accesses where a continuous service street is not yet available and a performance guarantee is provided to assure elimination of temporary access when the service street is continued. Building permits shall not be issued until monies have been deposited with the city. 
g.  Elevation. The site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the service street at the lot line. The city shall maintain a record of all service street elevations so that their grades can be coordinated. 
h.  Landscaping. The area between a service street and the public street right-of-way shall be planted as a landscaped greenbelt as specified in section 16.02(c), greenbelts. 
i.  Maintenance. Each property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of the easement and service drive.

State Law reference- Highway advertising act, MCL 252.301 et seq. 

Sec. 18.01. - Intent. 
    The intent of this article is to regulate signs within the City of Taylor. The regulations and standards of this article are intended to be content neutral and are considered the minimum amount necessary to achieve a substantial government interest for public safety, aesthetics, and protection of property values. These objectives are accomplished by establishing the minimum amount of regulations necessary concerning the size, placement, construction, illumination and other aspects of signs in the city so as to: 
(a)  Protect the public right to receive or convey messages and information protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
(b)  Maintain and improve the image of the city by encouraging signs of consistent size which are compatible with and complementary to related buildings and uses, and harmonious with their surroundings. 
(c)  Recognize that the proliferation of signs is unduly distracting to motorists and nonmotorized travelers, reduces the effectiveness of signs directing and warning the public, causes confusion, reduces desired uniform traffic flow, and creates potential for accidents. 
(d)  Recognize that the principal intent of commercial signs is for identification of an establishment on the premises, and not for advertising off-premises activities. 
(e)  Enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities without excessive difficulty and confusion by restricting the number and placement of signs. 
(f)  Prevent placement of signs which will conceal or obscure signs of adjacent uses.

A comparison of the number of trips expected to be generated during the a.m. peak hour, p.m. peak hour and on a typical weekday for any existing use of the subject site, representative uses permitted under current zoning and representative uses permitted under the requested zoning. For projects where the comparison yields a difference greater than 50 directional trips during a peak hour or 500 trips on a typical weekday, a traffic impact assessment shall be performed. 
(2)  Traffic impact assessment. An analysis that evaluates current and future inbound and outbound traffic operations at site access points shall be required for projects expected to generate either 50 through 99 directional trips during a peak hour or 500 through 750 trips during a typical day. 
(3)  Traffic impact study. An analysis that evaluates current, background, and future traffic operations at site access points and major signalized or nonsignalized intersections in proximity to the site shall be required for any proposed development which would be expected to generate over 100 directional trips during the peak hour of the traffic generator or the peak hour on the adjacent streets, or over 750 trips in an average day. Intersections to be evaluated in the traffic impact statement shall be established by the city. 
(4)  Updates. A traffic impact study or assessment shall also be required for new phases, expansions or changes to a development that requires site plan review, based on the thresholds established above, except where such report was approved (date of site plan approval) within two years of the new site plan submittal date, and a demonstration by the applicant's traffic engineer that traffic volumes have not increased by over two percent annually. 
(b)  Required contents. The following information is required for both traffic impact assessments and traffic impact studies unless otherwise specified: 
(1)  Existing site conditions. Illustrations and a narrative which describes the characteristics of the site and adjacent street system (planned and existing right-of-way, functional classification, lane configuration, speed limits, any sight distances limitations, locations and potential conflicts with operations at existing access points or intersections within 275 feet of the site's frontage, or greater based upon MDOT access management guidelines, current traffic conflicts, etc.). This description should include surrounding land uses, expected development in the vicinity which could influence future traffic conditions, special site features and a description of any committed street improvements. The study should define and justify the study area selected for analysis.

a.  Street alignment, including any problems with sight distance, number of lanes, lane width and lane configurations; 
b.  Posted speed limits for various segments; 
c.  Existing traffic control; 
d.  Existing signal timing, as applicable; 
e.  Existing peak-hour weekday traffic volumes (and daily volumes or peak period counts (7-9 a.m. to 4-6 p.m.) to support the selection of the evaluated peak hour (if applicable) on streets adjacent to the site. For uses with weekend peak characteristics, the city may require new counts be taken on typical weekend days during the anticipated peak hours of the proposed use. All counts shall be collected using accepted practices and shall not be over two years old; 
f.  For projects that require a traffic impact study, existing counts and levels of service for intersections in the study area shall be performed; and 
g.  For a traffic impact study, crash data shall be provided and analyzed for the most recent three-year period upon which information is available for sites in close proximity to intersections identified as either a "critical crash location" or a "fatality" location, for projects that generate 500 or more peak hour trips. SEMCOG data or UD-10 reports should be used in the analysis. Critical crash locations should be identified using SEMCOG's critical crash thresholds. The city engineer may waive this requirement upon a finding that the crash potential would not be significantly impacted by the proposed project. Crash data shall also be obtained and analyzed if a signal warrant analysis must be performed where existing or projected level of service is D or worse for unsignalized intersections. The signal warrant analysis should contain, at a minimum, warrants 1, 2, 6, 9 and 11. 
(3)  Background traffic conditions. Projects that are not expected to be completed and occupied within one year of site plan approval shall provide a separate evaluation of background traffic for the expected completion date of the proposed development. This background traffic shall be based on historic counts to acknowledge general growth trends in the area, plus traffic associated with approved developments either currently under construction or approved (and would be operational before the build-out year of the proposed project), in the project area. The background traffic shall be evaluated based on the existing street system plus programmed improvements where funding has been committed. A level of service analysis shall be preformed for each intersection in the study area. Unfunded mitigation that is not programmed by Wayne County, the city or included in the SEMCOG five-year TIP shall not be provided under the background conditions. Background traffic turning movements shall be illustrated in the report. 
(4)  Proposed use or future conditions. For a site plan review, mobile home park, condominium project, a subdivision plat, planned development, or special land use: a description of factors that relate to project trip generation such as the number and types of dwelling units, the gross and usable floor area, the number of employees and shift change factors shall be provided. Intended phasing or future expansion shall be noted. For a rezoning, a description of the potential representative uses which would be allowed, compared to representative uses allowed under current zoning. Representative uses shall include the most intense traffic generation use allowed under current zoning in compliance with all city site development regulations. 
(5)  Trip generation forecast. Forecasted trip generation of the proposed use for the a.m. peak hour, the p.m. peak hour and average day shall be provided for the overall project and each phase. The forecasts shall be based on the data and procedures outlined in the most recent edition of trip generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The applicant may use other commonly accepted and published sources of data or supplement the standard data with data from at least three similar projects in Michigan. 
(6)  Trip reduction. Any trip reduction for pass-by trips, transit, ride-sharing, other modes and internal capture rates shall be based both on ITE findings and documented survey results acceptable to the city. 
(7)  Trip distribution. The projected traffic generated shall be distributed (inbound v. outbound, left turn v. right turn) onto the existing street network to project turning movements at site access points, and nearby intersections where required. Projected turning movements shall be illustrated in the report. A description of the application of standard engineering procedures for determining the distribution should be provided such as trip distribution model, market studies or counts at existing driveways. 
(8)  Access point level of service. A level of service or capacity analysis is required at the proposed access points using the procedures outlined in the most recent edition of the Highway Capacity Manual published by the transportation research board. The capacity analysis should be provided in the appendix of the report. 
(9)  Intersection level of service. Traffic impact studies shall provide capacity analyses for all nearby street intersections identified by the city under the following conditions: 
a.  Existing traffic under existing street conditions.

c.  Future traffic, including project and background, under background street conditions. Background street conditions shall include the existing street system plus programmed improvements where funding has been committed. 
(10)  Warrant analysis. A traffic signal warrant analysis based on the procedures outlined in the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices shall be performed for unsignalized intersections identified with an existing level of service D or worse for existing conditions. The signal warrant analysis should contain, at a minimum, warrants 1, 2, 6, 9 and 11. For un-signalized intersections projected to operate at level of service D or worse under background or future conditions, an assessment using the peak hour (warrant 11) shall be provided. At least two traffic signal warrants should be met to warrant a signal. 
(11)  Access design. The report shall include a map and description of the location and design of proposed access (driveways or new street intersections) including: 
a.  Sight distance limitations and sketches from field notes. 
b.  Dimensions from adjacent driveways and intersections within 275 feet on either side of the main street, or greater based upon MDOT access management guidelines. 
c.  Potential for shared access facilities. 
d.  Data to demonstrate that the number of driveways proposed is the fewest necessary. 
e.  Support that the access points will provide safe and efficient traffic operation and be in accordance with the standards of section 17.05, driveway access management, and the applicable road agency. 
f.  Comments shall also be provided on internal circulation design such as the adequacy of queuing (stacking) at site access points and other features that may affect traffic operations and safety. 
(11)  Nonmotorized transportation. The report shall include an analysis of nonmotorized facilities, including pedestrian and bicycle. Pedestrian level of service shall consider the presence of sidewalks, width of sidewalks, buffers between sidewalks and motor vehicle travel lanes, presence of barriers within the buffer area, crosswalks and driveway frequency. Bicycle level of service shall consider the presence of bike lanes or paved shoulders, proximity of bicyclists to motorized vehicles, motorized vehicle volume, speed, and percentage of trucks and pavement condition. 
(12)  Mitigation. The study shall outline mitigation measures and demonstrate any changes to the level of service achieved by these measures for the proposed future conditions. 
a.  Mitigation shall be provided to ensure that all intersections operate at a level of service D or better during the peak hours of the day. The mitigated capacity analysis should be provided in the appendix of the report. Any alternatives or suggested phasing of improvements should be described and illustrated. The mitigation measures may include items such as, but not limited to, street widening, change to street intersection alignment or grades, need for bypass lanes or deceleration tapers/lanes, changes to signalization, relocation change in design, or reduction in number of access points, or a reduction in the proposed density of intensity of use. Sketches should be provided of suggested mitigation. Any mitigation that involves changes to optimize signal timing must demonstrate that such changes will benefit the overall operations and will be acceptable to the applicable road agency. Proposed mitigation measures should be discussed with Wayne County and MDOT, as applicable. The responsibility and timing of street improvements shall be described. 
b.  Mitigation shall also include measures to improve nonmotorized safety and level of service. All developments shall include walkable design elements such as sidewalks, design that favors pedestrians over autos within the site, safe and dedicated pedestrian access from the public sidewalk to the building entrance and links to adjacent land uses. This may also include improvements to the pedestrian system that will enhance the level of service for pedestrians using the site, such as improved streetscape along sidewalk, convenient access to transit stops, enhanced crosswalks and filling in gaps in the pathway system. Bike amenities would include upgrades to bike paths along a site's frontage or the provision of bike facilities onsite, such as bike racks.

The preparer shall have at least three years of recent experience in the preparation of traffic impact studies, provide evidence of ongoing experience and familiarity with the Highway Capacity Manual and other traffic operation evaluation techniques, be an associate (or higher) member of one or more professional transportation-related organizations, and be either a registered engineer (PE) or a planner with AICP or PTP certification. Any study involving street or traffic signal design work shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a registered engineer (PE) with specific training in traffic engineering. 
(d)  Procedures. 
(1)  The applicant shall submit a traffic impact questionnaire, on a form provided by the city. In addition to completing the questionnaire, the applicant must include a description of the proposed development, the ITE trip generation land uses, and the anticipated number of directional trips generated during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours of the traffic generator or the a.m. and p.m. peak hours on the adjacent streets, as well as for an average day. The city engineer shall review the traffic impact questionnaire and determine the level of traffic impact analysis required (i.e., traffic impact comparison, traffic impact assessment or traffic impact study) and establish the study intersections based on the proposed development and size. 
(2)  Once the applicant has complete and submitted the traffic impact analysis to the city, it is distributed to Wayne County, the city engineer, and MDOT, if appropriate. The study is to be submitted at a minimum of 45 days prior to the planning commission meeting at which the proposed development is to be considered. 
(3)  If the city or Wayne County determines there are deficiencies in the traffic impact analysis, a report of such deficiencies shall be provided to the applicant and the applicant shall be required to revise and resubmit the traffic impact analysis. Any traffic impact analyses with noted deficiencies will not be re-reviewed until all elements have been addressed. All partial resubmittals will be rejected. 
(4)  The city engineer, Wayne County and other review agencies shall provide the planning commission with comments on the traffic impact analysis prior to any consideration of the proposed development. 
(5)  The planning commission, the planning commission shall approve or deny the traffic impact study based upon the recommendation of the city engineer, and Wayne County and compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
(e)  Waiver of requirements. The requirement for a traffic impact study, or the specific study elements required may be waived or modified by the city. Reasons for the waiver or modification shall be documented. Factors to be considered include: 
(1)  Street improvements are programmed to be constructed prior to completion of the proposed development which are expected to mitigate any impacts associated with the proposed project. 
(2)  The existing level of service along the street is not expected to drop below D due to the proposed project. 
(3)  The existing level of service is not expected to be significantly impacted by the proposed project due to specific conditions at this location. 
(4)  A similar traffic study was previously prepared for the site and is still considered applicable.

ARTICLE 20. - REGULATED USE REVIEW 

Sec. 20.01. - Intent. 
(a)  It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote and protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Taylor and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent a concentration of regulated uses within the city. These regulations are intended to control the negative secondary impacts such businesses have been documented to have on the surrounding area and the community. 
(b)  The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses in any one area (i.e., not more than one such uses within 1,000 feet of another regulated use) or within a 1,000-foot radius of a residential district or within a 1,000-foot radius of any nursery, primary, or secondary school. It is further the intent of these regulations that these uses only be permitted as special land uses. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 20.01, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 20.02. - Locational requirements for regulated uses. 
(a)  The establishment of a regulated use listed below (whether the use is primary, secondary, or accessory) is prohibited if the use will be within a 1,000-foot radius of another regulated use: 
(1)  Adult regulated uses, as listed in subsection 20.05(c), classification. 
(2)  Firearms dealers (where over ten percent of the business revenues are generated by the sale of firearms) distributors, repair shops, firing ranges (only in an enclosed building), and similar establishments. 
(3)  Pawn shops. 
(4)  Tattoo parlor. 
(5)  Precious metal and gem dealers purchasing from the general public. 
(6)  Resale shops. 
(b)  The establishment of a regulated use listed in subsection (a) above (whether the use is primary, secondary, or accessory) is prohibited if the use will be within 1,000 feet of any of the following: 
(1)  Church, religious institution, or building used primarily for religious worship and related religious activities. 
(2)  Public or private elementary or secondary school, vocational school, special education school, junior college or university. 
(3)  Any single-family residential district, multiple-family residential district or Midtown district. 
(4)  Lot or parcel in residential use.

The distance between any two regulated uses shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects from the site or property boundary in which each business is located. Access easements or portions of the parcel that are exclusively used to provide access to the site of the adult regulated uses shall be excluded from the parcel boundary in determining whether the site complies with the required separation. The intent of this exclusion is to allow adult regulated uses to comply with the separation requirement from major streets by means of an access easement or access strip of land from the site to the street. 
(d)  A person is in violation of this ordinance if they cause or permit the operation, establishment, substantial enlargement, or transfer of ownership or control of a regulated uses within 1,000 feet of another regulated use. 
(e)  A person is in violation of this ordinance if they cause or permit the operation, establishment or maintenance of more than one regulated uses in the same building, structure or portion thereof or the substantial enlargement of any regulated uses in any building, structure or portion thereof containing another regulated use. 
(f)  Any business now classified as a regulated uses lawfully operating on the date of adoption of the ordinance that is in violation of this section shall be deemed a nonconforming use. 
(g)  A regulated use shall only be located within a zoning district where it is listed. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 20.02, 1-20-2009; Ord. No. 13-474, § 1, 2-19-2013) 
Sec. 20.03. - Procedures. 
(a)  Application. Application to establish any of the above adult regulated uses (principal or accessory) shall be made to the planning commission. Applications shall require special land use and site plan approval under the regulations of article 19, site plan review, and article 21, special land use review, in addition to the regulations of this article. The planning commission shall not approve any regulated use if the separation requirements of section 20.02, separation requirements, above are not met. 
(b)  Separation. The separation requirements may be modified as provided for in section 20.04, appeals and waivers. 
(c)  More than one use. If there is more than one regulated use proposed for a zoning lot that shall be indicated on the petition and submitted as part of the same application package. The requirements pertaining to the principal use shall prevail when reviewing the request. 
(d)  Conditions of approval. The planning commission may impose such conditions or limitations upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance or operation of the regulated uses, as shall, in its judgment, considering the standards set forth in this ordinance, be necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, welfare and interest, except that any conditions imposed on a adult regulated use shall be limited to those conditions necessary to assure compliance with the standards and requirements in section 20.05. Any evidence and guarantee may be required as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection with the establishment, maintenance and operation of a adult regulated use shall be fulfilled. 
(e)  Time limits for review. An application for special land use approval of a regulated use shall proceed before the planning commission for final decision. Applications for special use approval of a regulated use, with the exception of an adult regulated use as provided for in subsection (f) below, shall be processed in the normal course. 
(f)  Time limits for adult regulated use review. An application for special land use approval of an adult regulated use shall proceed before the planning commission for final decision. The following time limits shall apply to the review of an application by the planning commission for special land use approval of an adult regulated use: 
(1)  The planning commission will publish notice and hold a public hearing as required for special land use review within 60 days of receiving a technically complete special land use and site plan application as required by article 19, site plan review, and article 21, special land use. 
(2)  The planning commission will make its decision regarding the special land use application for an adult regulated use at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the planning commission following the public hearing held to review the application, unless additional information is required from the applicant. If additional information is required, the planning commission will make its recommendation at the next regularly scheduled meeting after receipt of the requested additional information, provided the additional information is received no later than 15 days prior to the meeting. 
(3)  Failure of the city to act within the above specified time limits shall not be deemed to constitute the grant of special land use to the adult regulated use. 
(g)  Effect of denial. An application for a regulated use that has been denied shall not be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of changed conditions. 
(h)  Revocations. In any case where a building permit for a regulated use is required and has not been obtained within six months after the granting of the special land use by the planning commission, the grant of special land use shall become null and void. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 20.03, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 20.04. - Appeals and waivers. 
(a)  Waivers. The planning commission may waive the restrictions set forth in section 20.02, separation requirements, above for regulated uses provided all of the following findings are made: 
(1)  That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or interfere with the use and enjoyment of nearby properties. 
(2)  That the proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development of a "skid row" area in which the homeless, unemployed, transients or others may loiter or congregate for no gainful purpose. 
(3)  That the establishment of an additional regulated use in the area will not be contrary to any program of neighborhood conservation nor will it interfere with any program of urban renewal. 
(4)  That all applicable regulations of the ordinance will be observed. 
(5)  The locational requirements for adult regulated use may not be waived. 
(b)  Notice and public hearing. Prior to granting waiver of the locational restrictions set forth above, the planning commission shall conduct a public hearing on the waiver. Notification of the public hearing shall be in accordance with section 25.09, public hearings. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 20.04, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 20.05. - Adult regulated uses. 
(a)  Intent. It is recognized that there are some uses which, because of their nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable, operations characteristics, thereby having deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. It is also recognized when several of these uses are concentrated in close proximity, they begin to dominate the character of an area and create a synergy that compounds their deleterious effect on other uses. Special regulations of these uses are therefore necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting, deteriorating, and/or down grading of the area and the adjacent areas. These special regulations are itemized in this ordinance. Prior to adopting these regulations, the city reviewed studies prepared on these uses, reviewed ordinances and regulations prepared by other municipalities, and reviewed applicable federal and state case law. Based on evidence of the adverse effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of Pap's AM v. City of Erie, 529 US 277 (2000); Deja Vu of Nashville v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, 466 G3d 391 (6th Cir 2006); Sensations, Inc. v.

(b)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate adult regulated uses to promote and protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Taylor and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent a concentration of adult regulated uses within the city. These regulations are intended to control the negative secondary impacts such businesses have been documented above to have on the surrounding area and the community. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Likewise, it is not the intent of this ordinance to legitimize activities which are prohibited by city ordinance or state or federal law. 
(c)  Classification. The following uses are considered adult regulated uses under this article, as defined in article 28, definitions: 
(1)  Adult arcades. 
(2)  Adult book, novelty, retail or video store stores. 
(3)  Adult cabarets. 
(4)  Adult massage parlors. 
(5)  Adult mini-motion picture theaters.

ARTICLE 21. - SPECIAL LAND USE REVIEW[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
State Law reference- Special land uses, MCL 125.3502 et seq. 

Sec. 21.01. - Intent. 
(a)  The formulation and enactment of the zoning ordinance is based upon the division of the city into zoning districts, in each of which are permitted specified uses which are mutually compatible. In addition to permitted compatible uses there are certain other uses which may be necessary or desirable to allow in certain locations within certain districts; but because of their actual or potential impacts on neighboring uses or public facilities, there is a need to carefully regulate them with respect to their location for the protection of the city. These uses, due to their peculiar locational need or the nature of the service offered, may be established in a district where they cannot be reasonably allowed as a permitted use, but may be allowed on a case-by-case basis as special land uses. 
(b)  Special land uses are uses considered to be more intense, or potentially more disruptive, compared to the various uses permitted by right in a particular zoning district. The uses classified as special land uses vary by district and are listed in the regulations of each zoning district. The special land use procedures and standards are intended to: provide a procedure by which special land uses can be evaluated to determine their potential impacts; ensure impacts can be accommodated within the environmental, infrastructure, and public services capacities of the area; and, provide site design, and operational standards to minimize any negative impact on adjoining or nearby properties. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 21.01, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 21.02. - Scope. 
    Prior to the establishment of a special land use, the city shall follow special procedures and carefully review the proposed use so as to minimize potential conflicts with the uses in conformance with this article. 
(a)  The planning commission shall have the sole authority to approve, approve with conditions or disapprove all special land uses. 
(b)  The planning commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the requirements of section 25.09, public hearings. If the proposed special land use meets the requirements and standards of the zoning ordinance, the planning commission shall approve the use. Approval shall be granted only for those uses specified in the application and shown on the site plan. 
(c)  A site plan conforming to the requirements and procedures of article 19, site plan review, is required for all special land uses which shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission concurrently with the special land use. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 21.02, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 21.03. - Procedures. 

(a)  Application. An application for the approval of a special land use shall be made by an owner, lessee, or other person with a legal interest in the property who has the owner's written consent to file the application. All of the following shall be submitted with the application for a special land use permit: 
(1)  A complete site plan in accordance with the requirements of article 19, site plan review. 
(2)  An application fee determined by the city council shall be made payable to the City of Taylor. 
(3)  For uses that require an environmental impact statement (EIS) under article 13, use requirements, the EIS shall be submitted to the planning commission at the time of its review of the special land use. If a traffic analysis, community impact report or environmental impact report is required by the city, it shall be submitted to the planning commission at the time of review of the special land use. 
(4)  The owner, developer, or their agent may submit additional information or exhibits in support of their application. 
(b)  Planning commission. 
(1)  The planning commission shall hold a public hearing and request recommendations from city staff. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in accordance with section 25.09, public hearings. 
(2)  The planning commission shall review the application and approve, deny, or approve with conditions, the application. 
(3)  In reaching its decision the planning commission shall consider the application, staff reports, and other relevant materials. 
(4)  Upon a finding that the application meets the general standards of section 21.04, review standards, and the specific standards for that use contained in the use regulations of article 13, use requirements, the planning commission may approve the special land use. Upon approval the planning commission may attach those conditions it deems necessary, in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(5)  If the planning commission determines that the application for the requested special land use does not meet the standards and requirements of this ordinance, it shall deny the application setting forth the reasons for the denial. 
(c)  Conditions. Reasonable conditions may be imposed by the planning commission upon any use of land requiring special land use approval. Any such conditions shall be: 
(1)  Designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety, and welfare and the social and economic well-being of those who will use the land use or activity under consideration, residents, and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and the community as a whole; 
(2)  Related to the valid exercise of the police power and purposes which are affected by the proposed use or activity; and 
(3)  Necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance, be related to the standards established in the ordinance for the land use or activity under consideration and be necessary to ensure compliance with those standards. 
(d)  Site plan approval. The site plan for the special land use shall be approved by the planning commission. The site plan shall be approved concurrently with the special land use. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 21.03, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 21.04. - Review standards. 
    The planning commission shall permit any special land use under the terms of this ordinance if such use meets the various specific standards set forth in the various sections of this ordinance pertaining to uses allowed after special approval and if the planning commission finds the proposed use requiring special land use approval is: 
(a)  Compatible with adjacent uses of land. The proposed special land use shall be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be compatible with uses on surrounding land. The site design of the proposed special land use shall minimize the impact of site activity on surrounding properties. In determining whether this requirement has been met, consideration shall be given to: 
(1)  The location and screening of vehicular circulation and parking areas in relation to surrounding development. 
(2)  The location and screening of outdoor storage, outdoor activity or work areas, and mechanical equipment in relation to surrounding development. 
(3)  The hours of operation of the proposed use. Approval of a special land use may be conditioned upon operation within specified hours considered appropriate to ensure minimal impact on surrounding uses. 
(4)  The bulk, placement, and materials of construction of the proposed use in relation to surrounding uses. 
(b)  Not injurious to adjacent property, surrounding neighborhoods, or the community as a whole. The proposed special land use shall not involve any activities, processes, materials, equipment, or conditions of operation, and shall not be located or designed so as to be detrimental to public health, safety, and welfare. In determining whether this requirement has been met, consideration shall be given to the production of traffic, noise, vibration, smoke, fumes, odors, dust, glare, and light. 
(c)  Enhancement of surrounding environment. The proposed special land use shall provide the maximum feasible enhancement of the surrounding environment, and shall not unreasonably interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of the adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably affect their value. 
(d)  Provision of landscaping and other site amenities. Provision of additional landscaping over and above the requirements of this ordinance may be required as a condition of approval of a special land use to buffer higher impact uses or screen views. 
(e)  Compatibility with the master plan and zoning ordinance. The proposed special land use shall be compatible with and in accordance with the general principles and objectives of the master plan and shall promote the intent and purpose of this ordinance. 
(f)  Compatible with the natural environment. The proposed special land use shall not have an unacceptable significant adverse effect on the quality of the natural environment in comparison to the impacts associated with the district's permitted uses. The planning commission may require a quantitative comparison of the impacts of typical permitted uses and the special land use to assist in making this determination (such as an overlay of conceptual development plans, on a natural features map, illustrating other site development options to demonstrate the impacts have been minimized to the extent practical). If the cumulative impact creates or contributes to a significant environmental problem, mitigation shall be provided to alleviate the impacts associated with the requested use (i.e., ensure the end result is at least similar to the preexisting conditions). 
(g)  Compatible with the capacities of public services and facilities. The proposed special land use shall be located so as to be adequately served by essential public facilities and services, such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage systems, water and sewage facilities, and schools. 
(h)  Impact of traffic. The location of the proposed special land use within the zoning district shall minimize the impact of traffic generated by the proposed use. In determining whether this requirement has been met, consideration shall be given to the following: 
(1)  Proximity and access to major streets. 
(2)  Estimated traffic generated by the proposed use. 
(3)  Proximity and relation to intersections. 
(4)  Adequacy of driver sight distances. 
(5)  Location of and access to off-street parking. 
(6)  Required vehicular turning movements. 
(7)  Provision for pedestrian and nonmotorized travel. 
(i)  Isolation of existing uses. The location of the proposed special land use shall not result in a small residential area being substantially surrounded by nonresidential development, and further, the location of the proposed special land use shall not result in a small nonresidential area being substantially surrounded by incompatible uses. 
(j)  Enhance the social and economic welfare. The approval of a special land use provision is a privilege granted when it can be demonstrated that there is an overriding and compelling benefit that is in the best interest of the city as well as the petitioner. The petitioner must demonstrate that the proposed use will enhance the social and economic welfare of the city. 
(k)  Other studies. The planning commission shall have the authority to require other studies and materials be submitted to confirm compliance with the standards of this section including, but not limited to, traffic impact studies, market studies, environmental assessments or utility capacity analysis. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 21.04, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 21.05. - Validity of permit. 
(a)  Start of construction. Special land use approval is valid for a period of 18 months from the date of planning commission approval. A building permit must be issued and physical construction on structures must commence within that period. In the case of a reoccupancy of an existing building, the use must be established within 18 months. 
(b)  Extensions. Upon written application filed prior to the termination of the 18-month period as provided above, the planning commission may authorize a single extension of the time limit for a further period of not more than one year. Such extension shall be granted only based on evidence from the applicant that the development has a reasonable likelihood of commencing construction within the one year extension. The planning commission may require compliance with any amendments to the zoning ordinance since the special land use was originally approved. 
(c)  Expiration of special land use permit. Where actual construction of a substantial nature of structures authorized by a special land use permit has not commenced within 18 months of issuance, and a written application for extension of the approval has not been filed as provided below, the special land use permit shall become null and void and all rights there under shall terminate. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 21.05, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 21.06. - Amendments, expansions and change in use. 
(a)  Amendments. The property owner shall notify the development services department of any desired change in an approved special land use. The development services department shall determine whether the proposed amendment constitutes a minor or major amendment, based on the total cumulative expansion since the original special land use approval as follows: 
(1)  Changes increase the buildings usable floor area by more than 20 percent. 
(2)  Parking lots are expanded by more than 20 percent. 
(3)  The occupancy, capacity or membership of the use is increased by more than 20 percent. 
(4)  The use is expanded to occupy an additional 20 percent or more land area. 
(5)  The expansion will result in a 20 percent or more increase in traffic generation based upon the latest edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers Trip Generation Manual or will change the number or location of driveway access points. 
(6)  Any change affecting any previous approved special use condition imposed by the city. 
(b)  Major amendments. Any major amendment to an approved special land use by the amounts in subsection (a) above or greater shall require a new special land use permit and shall be reviewed using the procedures and requirements of this article. 
(c)  Minor amendment. Minor amendment to an approved special land use less than the amounts noted in subsection (a) above does not require submittal of a new application for a special land use, but shall still be subject to the site plan review requirements of article 19, site plan review. 
(d)  Change in use. Change to another type of special land use shall require submission of a new application for a special land use following the review procedures contained in this article. A change in use that is still the same type of use shall not require a new special land use, unless it involves a major expansion. A change in ownership shall not constitute a change in use. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 21.06, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 21.07. - Revocation of an approved special land use. 
    The planning commission shall have the authority to revoke any special land use approval after the applicant has failed to comply with any of the applicable requirements of this article, other applicable sections of this ordinance, or conditions of the special land use approval. Prior to any action, the planning commission shall conduct a public hearing following the notification process for the original approval. The applicant shall be provided an opportunity to present information and to answer questions. The planning commission may revoke any previous approval if it finds that a violation exists and has not been remedied. The special use permit may be suspended or revoked according to the following procedure: 
(a)  Conditions which may give rise to a suspension or revocation proceeding include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  The special land use was not constructed in conformance with the approved plans, or the property is not being used in conformance with the approval special land use; 
(2)  Compliance with the special land use permit and any conditions have not been consistently demonstrated, and administrative attempts to secure compliance have been unsuccessful;

ARTICLE 22. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUDS)[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
State Law reference- Planned unit development, MCL 125.3503. 

Sec. 22.01. - Intent. 
    The planned unit development (PUD) is intended as a development option to provide a degree of flexibility in the regulation of land development and the arrangement of uses. Through this option, more creative approaches to development can be utilized which take better advantage of the special characteristics of the land than would be possible through the strict enforcement of this ordinance. The specific objectives of this article are to: 
(a)  Encourage innovation in land use and variety in design, layout and type of structures constructed. 
(b)  Achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy, and the provision of public services and utilities. 
(c)  Permit flexibility in the placement, lot area and building type regulations, and combination of uses while assuring the application of sound site planning standards. 
(d)  Encourage the provision of useful open space and more extensive landscaping. 
(e)  Provide opportunities for improvements to public streets or facilities, pathways and natural stormwater systems. 
(f)  Promote the development of walkable, mixed use developments that will result in more sustainable and healthy neighborhoods. 
(g)  Achieve consistent and coordinated site design (e.g., lighting, signs, building design, etc.), and high quality architectural design and materials. 
(h)  Encourage the use, reuse, and improvement of existing sites. 
(i)  Encourage the use and improvement of land where site conditions make development under conventional zoning difficult and less desirable. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 22.01, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 22.02. - Qualifying conditions. 
(a)  Ownership. An application for the approval of a PUD shall be made by an owner, lessee, or other person with a legal interest in the property who has the owner's written consent to file the application. 
(b)  Public utilities. The PUD site shall be serviced by public sewer and water systems. The proposed type and density of use shall not result in an unreasonable increase in the use of public services, public facilities, and utility capacities. 
(c)  Recognizable and substantial benefits. The PUD application shall demonstrate that the project will result in recognizable and substantial benefits to the residents, users, visitors, adjacent neighbors, and the city overall that would not be available under the existing, underlying zoning classification. Benefits beyond those otherwise required by this ordinance include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Preservation of significant natural features. 
(2)  A complementary mixture of uses. 
(3)  Extensive open space and recreational amenities. 
(4)  Open space greenways to link to adjacent greenway corridors. 
(5)  Transition areas from adjacent land uses. 
(6)  Preservation of historical buildings or site features. 
(7)  Improvements to the public street system to mitigate traffic impacts or other public facility improvements to mitigate impacts of development. 
(8)  Pedestrian and transit oriented development. 
(9)  Coordinated development of multiple assembled small parcels. 
(10)  Removal or renovation of blighted buildings or sites or cleanup of site contamination. 
(d)  Consistency with the master plan. The PUD shall be compatible with the overall goals and recommendations as proposed in the City of Taylor Master Plan. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 22.02, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 22.03. - Permitted uses. 
    Uses permitted in a PUD are based on the underlying zoning district. All permitted uses of the underlying zoning district shall be permitted and all special land uses of the underlying zoning district shall be allowed with special land use approval. Additional uses may be allowed in a PUD as follows: 
(a)  Residential PUD. The PUD may provide for a variety of permanent housing types, including single-family detached, townhomes or multiple-family residential. 
(1)  Where the underlying zoning is single-family residential, a minimum of 80 percent of the dwellings shall be detached single-family dwellings and up to 20 percent may be townhomes. 
(2)  Where the underlying zoning is multiple-family, any mixture of single-family, townhouses and multiple-family is permitted. 
(b)  Mixed use residential PUD. For a PUD in a residential district that has an area of at least 20 acres, commercial uses allowed in the B-1 district may occupy up to ten percent of the gross site area. Planned commercial sites are to be located at an intersection of two major streets or a major street. 
(c)  Mixed use/nonresidential PUD. For a PUD in a nonresidential district, residential uses may be permitted in a mixed use PUD in addition to the uses allowed by the underlying zoning district. Other uses may be allowed where the planning commission determines them to be consistent with surrounding uses and the future land use plan of the City of Taylor Master Plan. 
(d)  Industrial PUD. For a PUD in an I-1, I-2 or TRO district, uses allowed by the underlying zoning district shall be allowed. Other commercial uses that provide services to businesses and employees in the immediate area, such as convenience retail, restaurants, business services and hotels, may be permitted where the planning commission determines the uses contribute towards an integrated mixed use employment district. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 22.03, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 22.04. - Residential density. 
(a)  Single-family residential. Where the underlying zoning is single-family, residential density shall be determined by a parallel plan that illustrates how the site could be developed as a conventional subdivision or site plan, meeting all applicable city zoning and subdivision requirements. The city shall review the design and determine the number of buildable lots that could be feasibly constructed, taking into consideration any wetlands or other nonbuildable land. This number shall be the maximum number of dwelling units allowable for the PUD. 
(b)  Multiple-family residential or commercial. Where the underlying zoning is multiple-family, density shall be determined based upon the underlying zoning district and the definition of density. Where the underlying zoning is nonresidential, density shall be determined based upon the RM-1 district. 
(c)  Change in underlying zoning. Where the master plan recommends a different zoning district than the current zoning, a rezoning of the underlying zoning district consistent with the master plan may be considered concurrently with the PUD. 
(d)  Density bonus. The city council may grant a density bonus of up to ten percent, where the planning commission finds that the development provides extraordinary benefits and furthers smart growth principals by meeting all of the following: 
(1)  The project will provide a wide range of housing opportunities and choices through varied housing types, varied dwelling sizes and variable lot sizes, or the project will provide a mixture of compatible and complementary residential and nonresidential land uses; 
(2)  The project will create a walkable neighborhood with a continuous pedestrian circulation system that links all areas of the development, links the development to other destinations in the surrounding area and is designed to facilitate a variety of transportation choices by providing alternatives to automobile travel; 
(3)  The project takes advantage of compact design through clustering development into a walkable scale neighborhood and preserving significant open space, and natural features; and 
(4)  The project is consistent with the Taylor Master Plan, furthers the stated goals of the plan and provides extraordinary benefits to the city. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 22.04, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 22.05. - Dimensional requirements. 
(a)  Base zoning regulations. All zoning ordinance requirements for the underlying zoning district shall remain in full force, except as modified under this section. 
(b)  Regulatory flexibility. To encourage flexibility and creativity, the planning commission may recommend the city council grant specific departures from the requirement of the zoning ordinance as a part of the approval process. Lot area, width, setback, height and parking standards may be modified, provided that such modifications result in preservation of open space, enhanced buffering from adjacent land uses, screening along major streets, preservation of natural features, pedestrian-oriented development, a more efficient use of land or improved compatibility with adjacent land uses. 
(c)  Approval of modifications. Any regulatory modification shall be approved through a recommendation by the planning commission stating that the deviation shall result in a higher quality of development than would be possible using conventional zoning standards. 
(d)  Table of modifications.

3.  By reason of the use or development of the property immediately adjoining the property in question; whereby the literal enforcement of the requirements of this ordinance would involve practical difficulties. 
b.  Substantial justice. Compliance with the strict letter of the restrictions governing area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk, density or other dimensional provisions would unreasonably prevent the use of the property. Granting of a requested variance or appeal would do substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners in the district and such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and in the vicinity. Any variance granted shall be the minimum necessary to allow the preservation of these substantial property rights. The possibility of increased financial return shall not of itself be deemed sufficient to warrant a variance. 
c.  Impact on surrounding neighborhood. The variance will not be detrimental to adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood or interfere with or discourage the appropriate development, continued use, or value of adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhood as compared to other uses in the neighborhood. 
d.  Public safety and welfare. The granting of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety, comfort, morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the city. 
e.  Not self-created. The immediate practical difficulty causing the need for the variance request was not self-created by the applicant. 
(g)  Use variances. 
(1)  Application requirements. In addition to the information required for other variance requests, an application for a use variance shall include a plan drawn to scale detailing the specific use and improvements proposed by the applicant, and a summary of the facts which support each of the following conclusions: 
a.  Applicant's property cannot be used for the purposes permitted in the zoning district; 
b.  Applicant's plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to his property and not to general neighborhood conditions; 
c.  Applicant's suggested use would not alter the essential character of the area; 
d.  Applicant's problem has not been self-created; 
e.  Unavailability of administrative relief which may afford reasonable use of applicant's property; 
f.  At the end of each statement in subsections (g)(1)a through e above, identify all persons who will testify at the hearing with respect to each of the facts and, separately, identify all persons who will testify at the hearing relative to the respective conclusion (and if any person is to be offered as an expert witness, include with the application a resume which shows the education and experience of such person within the particular area of expertise). 
(2)  Use variance, prehearing conference. 
a.  Prior to the scheduling of a hearing, the applicant shall contact the development services department for the purpose of scheduling a prehearing conference. 
b.  The purposes of the pre-hearing conference shall be to: 
1.  Review the procedure for the hearing and identify all persons who will testify (directly or through affidavit) and the evidence to be offered on behalf of the applicant; 
2.  Attempt to secure a statement of agreed-upon facts to be used to narrow the matters of dispute and shorten the hearing; 
3.  Explore a means of providing relief to the applicant by way of nonuse variance from the ZBA, or other relief which may require action by persons or bodies other than the ZBA which will afford an adequate remedy for the applicant; 
4.  Discuss the need, desirability, and the terms of providing a verbatim record of the hearing. 
c.  The development services department shall determine who should be present at the prehearing conference based upon the application submitted, and taking into consideration the discussion with the applicant or the applicant's representative. 
d.  The prehearing conference shall be scheduled and conducted on an expeditious basis so as to avoid unreasonable delay to the applicant. Sufficient time shall be taken, however, to achieve the purposes of the pre-hearing conference stated above. 
(3)  Use variance, hearing procedure. 
a.  The applicant will have the burden of proof. In order to be entitled to relief, the applicant must demonstrate each of the five factors in subsection (g)(5) of this section. 
b.  Manner of presentation. 
1.  Community representatives shall present an overview of the zoning regulations involved. This may include an indication of the objectives sought to be achieved in the zoning district, and any planning, engineering, financial, environmental or other considerations which are generally relevant within the zoning district and/or in the general area of the property at issue. 
2.  The applicant may present witnesses, including the applicant, or may submit affidavits, for the purpose of attempting to prove facts or conclusions. The applicant shall be provided with the opportunity to present all testimony and evidence proposed to be presented at the pre-hearing conference, either through witnesses or affidavits; however, the chairperson of the ZBA may restrict testimony and evidence which would result in unreasonable duplication. In addition, by motion made on its own or at the request of a person at the hearing, the ZBA may require the presence of any witness who has offered either testimony by affidavit on a material question of fact or testimony of an expert nature, with the view of permitting members of the ZBA to ask questions of such witnesses. 
3.  At the conclusion of the applicant's presentation, interested persons attending the hearing shall be provided with the opportunity to present testimony and evidence in the same manner and subject to requiring the presence and questioning of witnesses, as provided above for the applicant. 
c.  When interested persons have completed their presentations, at the same meeting and/or at an adjourned meeting date, testimony and evidence may be presented on behalf of the community in the same manner, and subject to requiring the presence and questioning of witnesses, as provided above for the applicant. The purpose of such presentation shall be to ensure that a full picture, including all relevant information, is before the ZBA for consideration as it relates to the specific application presented. 
d.  If testimony or evidence has been offered by or on behalf of interested persons and/or the community, the applicant shall have the opportunity to make a responsive presentation, restricted to answering the points raised by interested persons and community representatives. The manner of presenting witnesses, and requirement of their presence and questioning, shall be the same as provided above for the applicant's principal case. 
e.  At the hearing, the ZBA may determine to establish other rules of procedure, such as meeting hours on any given day, procedure for presentations by interested persons and/or on behalf of the community, or other rules found to be necessary or appropriate by the board. When questions of procedure arise during the hearing, the chairperson of the ZBA may solicit the recommendation of the representatives of both the applicant and the community. 
f.  If a hearing is not completed at a given meeting within the time period allowed by the ZBA, the board shall adjourn the hearing to a date certain for continuation. 
(4)  Use variance, decision of the zoning board of appeals. 
a.  The ZBA may deem it appropriate in any given case to provide an opportunity for anyone presenting testimony or evidence to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions. 
b.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the ZBA may make its decision at that meeting, or it may adjourn the hearing to a new date for the purpose of reviewing the testimony and evidence, and reviewing proposed findings and conclusions submitted by hearing participants, in preparation for making its decision. 
c.  If the ZBA determines to grant variance relief, it shall be the minimum relief required to allow reasonable use of the property, while maintaining the essential character of the area. Such relief may be in the form of one or more nonuse variances and/or in the form of a use variance. The motion may include conditions that are authorized by law. 
d.  If the ZBA adopts a motion to grant variance relief, such motion may be made as a tentative grant of relief, subject to review by the planning commission, planning director/consultant, engineer or other person or official with expertise, with a view of obtaining recommendations on any conditions that may be relevant and authorized by law, and for the further purpose of ensuring that the grant of relief would not violate applicable law. If such a tentative grant of relief is approved, the ZBA shall request the completion of all reviews by other boards or persons by a specific date, so that relief may be expeditiously finalized. 
(5)  Use variance standards for review. A use variance may be allowed by the ZBA only in cases where the applicant has shown a unnecessary hardship in the official record of the hearing. The applicant must prove that all of the following conditions have been met: 
a.  Hardship. The applicant has demonstrated that the site cannot reasonably be used for any of the uses allowed within the current zoning district designation. The ZBA may require submission of documentation from professionals or certified experts to substantiate this finding. 
b.  Unique circumstances. That the condition or situation of the specific parcel of property or the intended use of such property for which the variance is sought is unique to that property and not commonly present in the general vicinity or in the zone district. The applicant must prove that there are certain features or conditions of the land that are not generally applicable throughout the zone and that these features make it impossible to earn a reasonable return without some adjustment. Such unique conditions or situations include: 
1.  Exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific property on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
2.  Exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation on the land, building or structure. 
3.  The use or development of the property immediately adjoining the property in question. 
4.  Any other physical situation on the land, building or structure deemed by the ZBA to be extraordinary. 
c.  Character of neighborhood. The use variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or the intent of the comprehensive development plan, or be a detriment to adjacent properties. 
d.  Capacity of roads, infrastructure and public services. The capacity and operations of public roads, utilities, other facilities and services will not be significantly compromised. 
e.  Not self-created. The immediate practical difficulty causing the need for the variance request was not self-created by the applicant. 
(h)  Sign variance. Any party who has been refused a sign permit for a proposed sign may file an appeal with the ZBA. In determining whether a variance is appropriate, the ZBA shall study the sign proposal, giving consideration to any extraordinary circumstances, such as those listed below, that would cause practical difficulty in complying with the sign standards. 
(1)  Permitted signage could not be easily seen bypassing motorists due to the configuration of existing buildings, trees, or other obstructions. 
(2)  Permitted signage could not be seen bypassing motorists in sufficient time to permit safe deceleration and exit. 
(3)  Existing signs on nearby parcels would substantially reduce the visibility or advertising impact of a conforming sign on the subject parcel. 
(4)  Construction of a conforming sign would require removal or severe alteration to natural features on the parcel, such as removal of trees, alteration of the natural topography, filling of wetlands or obstruction of a natural drainage course. 
(5)  Construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the vision of motorists or otherwise endanger the health or safety of passersby. 
(6)  Variance from certain sign regulations would be offset by increased building setback, increased landscaping or other such enhancements, so that the net effect is an improvement in appearance of the parcel, compared to the result that would be otherwise achieved with construction of a conforming sign. 
(7)  A sign which exceeds the permitted height or area standards of this ordinance would be more appropriate in scale because of the large setback of the building. 
(Ord. No. 09-434, § 26.03, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 26.04. - Decisions. 
(a)  Voting. A concurring vote of a majority of the members of the ZBA shall be required to decide any appeal, interpretation, variance or other ZBA decision. 
(b)  Conditions. In authorizing an action within its authority, the ZBA may attach any conditions deemed necessary, provided any conditions comply with all of the following standards: 
(1)  Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety and welfare, as well as the social and economic well-being of those who will use the land use or activity under consideration, residents and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or activity and the community as a whole. 
(2)  Be related to the valid exercise of the police power and purposes which are affected by the proposed activity. 
(3)  Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning regulations; be related to the standards established in this ordinance for the land use or activity under consideration; and be necessary to ensure compliance with those standards. 
(c)  Approval period. 
(1)  Approval of a dimensional variance by the ZBA shall be valid for a period not longer than 18 months, unless a building permit for the construction or alteration is obtained and construction or alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of the permit and the requirements of the ZBA. 
(2)  Any variance may be revoked and declared invalid, following notice and a public hearing, if any of the requirements of this ordinance or conditions attached to a variance by the ZBA are not complied with. 
(d)  One year to rehear decision. When any application made under the provisions of this ordinance has been denied by the ZBA, not less than one year must intervene before a new application of the same tenor, and relating to the same property or proposed use, may be accepted or acted upon by the development services department or by any other city employee or authority, unless a positive finding is made by the development services department that the facts of the case have substantially changed since its previous consideration. 
(e)  Reconsideration. The ZBA shall have the authority to rehear a prior decision on its own motion in instances where new information is presented that could change the findings of fact used to reach the original decision. Where the ZBA passes a motion to reconsider a decision based upon the new information provided, it shall set a new public hearing, noticed in the same manner as required for the original hearing.

(Ord. No. 09-434, § 27.04, 1-20-2009) 
Sec. 27.05. - Conditional rezoning. 
(a)  Applicant may volunteer for conditional rezoning. An applicant requesting a rezoning may voluntarily offer a conditional rezoning along with an application for rezoning. An election to submit a conditional rezoning agreement shall be pursuant to the zoning act and this section. 
(1)  The conditional rezoning shall be in writing, executed by the applicant and the city and recorded with the Wayne County Register of Deeds. All costs associated with the review and approval of the conditional rezoning agreement shall be the responsibility of the applicant. 
(2)  The conditional rezoning may include limitations on the uses permitted on the property in question, specification of lower density or less intensity of development and use, or may impose more restrictions on the location, size, height, or other measure for buildings, structures, improvements, setbacks, landscaping, buffers, design, architecture and other features. 
(3)  The conditional rezoning shall not authorize uses or developments of greater intensity or density, or which are not permitted in the proposed zoning district; nor may a conditional rezoning agreement permit variations from height, area, setback or similar dimensional requirements that are less restrictive than the proposed zoning district. 
(4)  The conditional rezoning may include conditions related to the use and development of the property that are necessary to: 
a.  Serve the property with improvements, including but not limited to, the extension, widening, or realignment of streets; construction, or extension of utilities, or other infrastructure improvements serving the site; or the construction of recreational facilities. 
b.  Minimize the impact of the development on surrounding properties and the city overall. 
c.  Preserve natural features and open space beyond what is normally required. 
(b)  Content of agreement. In addition to any limitations on use or development of the site, preservation of site features or improvements described above, the conditional rezoning agreement shall also include the following: 
(1)  An acknowledgement that the conditional rezoning agreement was proposed voluntarily by the applicant. 
(2)  A statement that the property shall not be developed or used in any manner that is not consistent with the conditional rezoning agreement. 
(3)  A statement that the approval of the rezoning and the conditional rezoning agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the property owner and the city, and also their respective heirs, successors, assigns, receivers or transferees. Where the applicant for rezoning is acting on behalf of the landowner through some form of purchase agreement or other mechanism, then the landowner must also consent and sign the agreement. 
(4)  A statement that, if a rezoning with a conditional rezoning agreement becomes void in accordance with this section, that no further development shall take place and no permits shall be issued. 
(5)  A statement that no part of the conditional rezoning agreement shall permit any activity, use, or condition that would otherwise violate any requirement or standard that is otherwise applicable in the new zoning district. 
(6)  A legal description of the land to which the agreement pertains. 
(7)  Any other provisions as are agreed upon by the city and applicant. 
(c)  Process. The conditional rezoning agreement shall be reviewed concurrently with the petition for rezoning following the process in section 27.02, application procedure, and the following: 

(1)  The conditional rezoning agreement may be submitted prior to planning commission making its recommendation on the rezoning to the city council. The conditional rezoning agreement shall be reviewed by the city attorney, at the expense of the applicant, to determine that the conditional rezoning agreement conforms to the requirements of this section and the zoning act and shall confirm that the conditional rezoning agreement is in a form acceptable for recording with the Wayne County Register of Deeds. 
(2)  Following the public hearing for a proposed zoning amendment, the planning commission shall make a recommendation to the city council based upon the criteria listed in section 27.04, criteria for amendment of the official zoning map (rezoning). In addition, the planning commission shall consider whether the proposed conditional rezoning agreement: 
a.  Is consistent with the intent of this ordinance. 
b.  Bears a reasonable and rational connection or benefit to the property being proposed for rezoning. 
c.  Is necessary to ensure that the property develops in such a way that protects the surrounding neighborhood and minimizes any potential impacts to adjacent properties. 
d.  Is necessary to allow the rezoning to be approved, in that the property could not or would not be rezoned without the proposed conditional rezoning agreement. 
e.  Leads to a development that is more compatible with abutting or surrounding uses than would have been likely if the property had been rezoned without a conditional rezoning agreement, or if the property were left to develop under the existing zoning classification. 
f.  Is in the public interest and is consistent with the recommendations of the master plan. 
(3)  If a conditional rezoning agreement has been offered by the applicant and recommended for approval by the planning commission, the city council may approve the conditional rezoning agreement as a condition to the rezoning if it meets all requirements of subsection (c) above. The conditional rezoning agreement shall be incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable part of the ordinance adopted by the city council to accomplish the requested rezoning. 
(4)  If the rezoning and conditional rezoning agreement are approved, the zoning classification of the rezoned property shall consist of the district to which the property has been rezoned, and a reference to the conditional rezoning agreement. The zoning map shall specify the new district, plus the acronym "C" to indicate that the property is subject to a conditional rezoning agreement (i.e., R-1A through C). The city clerk shall maintain a listing of all properties subject to conditional rezoning agreements and shall provide copies of the agreements upon request. 
(5)  The approved conditional rezoning agreement shall be recorded with the Wayne County Register of Deeds. 
(6)  Any uses proposed as part of a conditional rezoning agreement that would otherwise require approval of a special land use or site plan approval shall be subject to the applicable review and approval requirements of article 19, site plan review, and article 21, special land use review. 
(d)  Expiration. 
(1)  The rezoning and conditional rezoning agreement shall expire 18 months after adoption of the rezoning and conditional rezoning agreement, unless substantial construction on the approved development of the property pursuant to building and other required permits issued by the city commences within the 18 month period and proceeds diligently to completion, unless extended by the city council for good cause. 
(2)  In the event that substantial construction on the approved development has not commenced within the aforementioned 18 months, the conditional rezoning agreement shall be void and of no effect. 
(3)  Should the conditional rezoning agreement become void, all development on the property shall cease, and no further development shall be permitted. Until action satisfactory to the city is taken to bring the property into compliance with the conditional rezoning agreement, the city may withhold or, following notice to the applicant and being given an opportunity to be heard, revoke permits and certificates. This shall be in addition to or in lieu of any other lawful action to achieve compliance, including rezoning. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the above, if the property owner applies in writing for an extension of the conditional rezoning agreement at least 30 days prior to the expiration date, the city council may grant an extension of up to one year where the city council determines that the landowner has made diligent effort towards completing the conditions of the agreement. 
(e)  Reversion of zoning. If the rezoning and conditional rezoning agreement becomes void as outlined above, then the land shall automatically revert back to its original zoning classification as set forth in the zoning act. The development services department will advise the landowner and/or developer, by registered letter, of the reversion of zoning. The city shall take affirmative action to rezone the property. 
(f)  Continuation. Provided that all development and/or use of the property in question is in compliance with the conditional rezoning agreement, a use or development authorized there under may continue indefinitely, provided that all terms of the conditional rezoning agreement continue to be met. 
(g)  Amendment. The conditional rezoning agreement may be amended by the city council with the landowner's consent in the same manner as was prescribed for the original rezoning and conditional rezoning agreement. 
(h)  Violation of agreement. Failure to comply with the conditional rezoning agreement at any time after approval will constitute a breach of the agreement and also a violation of this ordinance and further use of the property may be subject to legal remedies available to the city. 
(i)  Subsequent rezoning of land. Nothing in the conditional rezoning agreement, nor any statement or other provision, shall prohibit the city from later rezoning all or any portion of the property that is the subject of the conditional rezoning agreement to another zoning classification. Any rezoning shall be conducted in compliance with this ordinance and the zoning act. 
(j)  Failure to offer conditions. The city shall not require an owner to offer conditions as a requirement for rezoning. The lack of an offer of conditions shall not affect the owner's rights under this ordinance. 
(k)  City not obligated. The city is not required or obligated to accept any or all conditions offered by a developer on a rezoning application. In no way is an offer of a conditional rezoning agreement the basis for requiring the city to approve a rezoning application.

easements, wetlands and stormwater management areas shall not be considered as
recreation areas.
(6) The recreational area shall be well drained, graded, seeded or sodded, safe from hazard,
accessible to all dwellings. Preserved natural features on the site may be counted toward
meeting the open space requirement if improvements are provided that allow passive
recreation use such as pathways, gazebos and picnic areas. At least half (1/2) of the
required recreation area shall be developed for active recreational use.
(7) Recreational areas shall be irrevocably reserved for this use and required maintenance
shall be the responsibility of the homeowners association unless otherwise approved by the

Section 3.04 Open Space Preservation (Cluster) Development
(a) Intent. This section permits, by special land use approval, residential development which,
through innovative design, will encourage creative development benefiting the total community
by preserving desirable open space in the form of woodlands, wetlands and other natural
assets, or providing useable open space as an integral part of the residential living
environment. This development option is also intended to be applied to infill parcels or sites
exhibiting unusual characteristics or land use relationships. These provisions are not intended
to result in an increase in density, but rather to allow for a more creative distribution of the
permitted number of dwelling units on designated portions of the site.
(b) Qualification of Parcel. At least one (1) of the following qualifications must be demonstrated
to approve an open space preservation development:
(1) The parcel contains natural assets, supported by documented evidence, which will be
preserved through as an integral part of the design. These assets may include natural
stands of large trees, land which serves as a natural habitat for wildlife, wetlands, steep
topography, bodies of water (i.e. streams or ponds), or other natural features that should be
preserved.
(2) The parcel contains floodplain or wetlands that would be preserved as undeveloped
common open space.
(3) At least twenty percent (20%) of the site will be set aside as open space for conservation or
active recreational purposes.
(4) Unusual physical characteristics, such as size or shape of the parcel, are present that
reasonably prevent using conventional development.
(5) Conventional development would result in a substantial number of the lots abutting a major
or secondary thoroughfare and be subjected to disturbance by vehicular traffic, noise and
lights.
(6) The adjoining or adjacent land uses warrant a creative development alternative to facilitate
a suitable transition between uses.
(c) Density. The number of dwelling units allowable within an open space preservation
development shall be determined through preparation of a alternate conventional development
plan. The alternate conventional development plan shall show how the site would be
developed with a conventional subdivision based upon the existing zoning district. The
alternate conventional development plan is intended only to illustrate the allowable density for a
site based upon the existing zoning district and is not an approved development plan.
Single-Family Residential Districts
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 3-8
03
(1) The applicant shall present to the planning commission for review, an alternate
conventional development plan for the project that is consistent with state, county, and City
requirements and design criteria for a tentative preliminary plat. The alternate conventional
development plan shall include sufficient right-of-way for roadways, common park area, and
contain sufficient area for storm water detention.
(2) The alternate conventional development plan shall provide lots meeting all dimensional
standards of the zoning district. Lots may include wetlands or other unbuildable land
provided that a buildable area for each lot is available.
(3) Once the allowed density is determined, then the same number of units shall be used for
the open space preservation development.
(d) Dwelling Unit Type. Detached and attached single-family units are permitted. The maximum
number of attached units permitted in a single building is four (4).
(e) Placement and Building Requirements for Attached Units. All attached units shall comply
with the following requirements:
(1) All principal buildings shall be set back at least thirty-five (35) feet from all perimeter lot
lines of the development site, including major streets. Accessory buildings, common
parking areas and driveways may be located a minimum of ten (10) feet from any adjoining
lot line, except a street right-of-way.
(2) Buildings shall be set back at least twenty-five (25) feet from the internal street right-of-way
line. For private streets where there is no public right-of-way or access easement, the
required front yard setback shall be measured from a parallel line thirty feet (30) from the
centerline of the street.
(3) A setback of at least fifteen (15) feet shall be provided between the sides of buildings.
There shall be at least forty (40) feet between the backs of residential buildings.
(4) The minimum required floor area shall be as required by the applicable district within which
the parcel is located.
(5) No dwelling unit shall exceed a height of twenty-five (25) feet.
(6) Variety in the design of individual groups of units shall be provided through the use of
design details to avoid a continuous or repetitious appearance.
(f) Placement Standards for Detached Units
(1) To achieve the minimum open space requirement, lot areas and widths may be reduced
below the district requirements; provided that an area equal to or greater than the total net
area of lot reduction for the development shall be set aside as common open space.
Single-Family Residential Districts
Page 3-9 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
03
(2) The setback requirements of the district may be reduced by up to twenty-five percent
(25%). The setbacks may be further reduced by the planning commission upon a specific
finding that it will result in enhanced buffering from adjacent land uses or public right-ofways,
or preservation of additional natural features.
(3) The maximum building height shall meet the requirements of the district.
(4) The minimum dwelling unit floor area shall meet the requirements of the district.
(g) Open Space
(1) A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the site shall be set aside as common open space
for conservation or recreational purposes. At least one-half (½) of the required open space
shall be useable for recreation.
(2) The open space preservation development shall meet all of the design standards required
by the City subdivision regulations.
(3) The master deed shall provide that all designated open space will be irrevocably dedicated
for that purpose and shall prohibit use of the open space for future development. The City
may require that conveyances or other documents be placed in escrow to accomplish this
purpose. The Master Deed required by this section shall be reviewed and approved by the
City, at the applicants cost. A performance guarantee in accordance with Section 25.08
Performance Guarantees may be required.
(h) General Development Requirements
(1) At least two (2) deciduous trees per dwelling unit meeting the size requirements of Section
16.02 Landscaping shall be planted along internal streets and throughout the development
portion of the site.
(2) A greenbelt in accordance with Table 16.02.a shall be provided, in addition to any rear yard
setback, along any part of the property that abuts a major street. The greenbelt or an
equivalent natural buffer shall be landscaped with an undulating landscaped berm. Berms
shall be planted with grass and slopes shall be gentle enough to avoid erosion. Berm
locations shall be designed so that the view of oncoming traffic is not obscured.
(3) Sidewalks are required along all streets in accordance with the Citys subdivision
regulations and Section 16.04 Sidewalks. A pedestrian circulation plan shall be submitted
and approved by the planning commission for the lands included in the open space.
Single-Family Residential Districts
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 3-10
03
(i) Review Procedures. Applications for residential
open space preservation developments shall
reviewed in accordance with the following process.
(1) Special Land Use and Preliminary Plan

Single-Family Residential Districts
Page 3-11 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
03
take action on the special land use and make a recommendation to the City Council on
the tentative preliminary plat or condominium, as applicable.
e. Once the City Council approves the tentative preliminary plat or condominium, as
applicable, the approved plan shall become the basis for the final approval process.
f. Substantial departures from the tentative preliminary plat or condominium shall require
a public hearing and approval of a new plan following the process above.
(2) Final Plan Review. Following approval of the special land use and tentative preliminary
plat approval or site condominium, as applicable, the applicant shall prepare detailed plans
for final approval. Final plans along with a draft of the master deed and bylaws or restrictive
covenants shall be submitted for approval of the final preliminary plat or final condominium
site plan in accordance with the applicable process under the City subdivision regulations or

Section 4.01 Intent
(a) The R-2 Townhouse Residential District is designed as an intermediate density zoning district
that allows a variety of housing types, including the single-family attached dwelling commonly
termed the townhouse. It is intended that this district be used primarily on collector streets on
smaller land parcels and in situations where the close proximity of single-family detached
housing developments would be adversely influenced by the higher density traditional multiple
family complex. It is intended to encourage development which, though multiple-family in
nature, is closer in character or scale to single-family development, with duplexes and attached
townhouses, each having individual entrances, yards, driveways and garages.
(b) The RM-1 Low Rise Multiple-Family Residential District is intended to provide sites for multiplefamily
dwellings of low-rise construction and residentially-related uses that serve the residents
in the district. This district is intended to provide a proper environment for families that are
smaller in size than those living in single-family dwellings, who wish to live in low-rise multiplefamily
dwellings. The RM-1 District is designed to furnish sites for various types of attached
single-family and multiple-family dwelling structures and may serve as a transition between
non-residential districts and lower density single-family residential districts.
(c) The RM-2 High Rise Multiple-Family Residential District is intended to provide sites for multistory
multiple-family dwelling structures primarily for the elderly. These structures shall serve
the residential needs of elderly persons desiring multiple-family accommodations with central
services.

open space shall be in addition to that required under R 125.1946, Rule 946 and R
125.1941 and R 125.1944, Rules 941 and 944 of the Michigan Administrative Code.
(2) There shall be not less than seven hundred twenty (720) square feet of floor area within
each manufactured home. The floor area of any porch, sun deck, or other structure shall
not be used to meet this requirement.
(3) The placement of manufactured homes within a manufactured home park shall meet the
following internal setback requirements.
a. Twenty (20) feet from any part of an attached or detached structure or an adjacent
manufactured home that is used for living purposes.
b. Ten (10) feet from an on-site parking space of an adjacent manufactured home site.
c. Ten (10) feet from an attached or detached structure or accessory building of an
adjacent manufactured home which is not used for living purposes.
d. Fifty (50) feet from a permanent building.
e. Ten (10) feet from the edge of an internal street.
f. Seven (7) feet from a parking bay.
g. Seven (7) feet from a common sidewalk.
(4) Manufactured home parks shall be landscaped as follows:
a. If the manufactured home park abuts an existing residential development, the park shall
be required to provide landscape screening along the park boundary abutting the
residential development.
b. If the park abuts a non-residential development, the park need not provide landscape
screening.
c. In all cases, however, a park shall provide landscape screening along the park
boundary abutting a public right-of-way.
d. The landscaping screening shall consist of evergreen trees or shrubs of a minimum
three (3) feet in height, which are spaced so they provide a continuous screen at
maturity. Alternative screening devices subject to prior approval may be utilized if they
conceal the manufactured home park as effectively as the required landscaping
described above and provided the screening is kept in good repair.
e. Exposed ground surfaces in all parts of the manufactured home park shall be paved or
covered with stone or other solid material or protected with grass, trees, or shrubs that
are capable of preventing soil erosion. The ground surface in all parts of every
manufactured home park shall be graded and equipped to drain all surface water in a
safe, efficient manner.
Manufactured Home Park Districts

such well shall be provided with a separate storm sewer connection which shall be
adequate to drain any storm water which might enter the well into the park's storm
sewerage system.
b. All storm sewers shall be constructed in accordance with parts 2-4 of the Michigan
Department of Public Health manufactured home park standards, by the developer.
(10) Site built single-family dwellings may be located in a manufactured home park as
permitted by the Mobile Home Commission.
(i) General Requirements for Manufactured Home Parks

Business and Office Districts
Page 6-2 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance

Section 6.01 Intent
(a) The B-1 Local Business District is intended to meet the day-to-day convenience shopping and
service needs of persons residing in adjacent residential areas. B-1 District designations are
located within close proximity to areas planned for large residential populations, and are
intended to serve the immediate vicinity so as not to create unnecessary additional traffic. In
order to promote business development compatible with nearby residential, uses are prohibited
that would create hazards, offensive and loud noises, vibration, smoke, glare, heavy truck
traffic, or late hours of operation.
(b) The B-2 Regional Business District is intended to serve a larger population than is serviced by
a B-1 District. The district is generally characterized by an integrated or planned cluster of
establishments serviced by a common parking area and generating a large volume of vehicular
and pedestrian traffic. The intent of this district is also to encourage the concentration of
regional business areas to the mutual advantage of both the consumers and merchants and
thereby to promote the best use of land at certain strategic locations and to avoid encouraging
marginal strip, business development along arterial streets. Special attention must be focused
on site layout, building design, vehicular and pedestrian circulation and coordination of site
features between adjoining sites.
(c) The B-3 General Business District is intended to provide for retail commercial services
dependent on major street traffic. The uses in the B-3 District will be more automotive oriented
and serve a market that includes City residents and residents from surrounding communities.
The permitted uses would be located at the juncture of principal streets and are generally not
appropriate immediately adjacent to residential zoning districts. Special attention must be
focused on site layout, building design, vehicular circulation and buffering from other nearby
uses.
(d) The O-1 Office District is intended to accommodate uses such as offices for professional and
business services, planned office developments, as well as appropriately located related and
ancillary services and uses. The O-1 District is intended to permit those office and personal
service uses which will establish an appropriate district for uses which do not generate large
volumes of traffic, traffic congestion, and parking problems, and which will promote the most
desirable use of land in accordance with the master plan. The O-1 District is further intended to
provide a buffer or zone of transition between residential and commercial districts and between
residential districts and arterial streets.
(e) The O-2 Regional Office District is designed and intended to accommodate large office
buildings and restricted related retail and service establishments which service large numbers
of people. The O-2 District is intended to permit those office and personal service uses which
will provide office buildings in landscaped settings to create office parks or landmark office
buildings.

Section 7.01 Intent
The MT-1 and MT-2 Midtown Districts are intended to promote the development of a pedestrian
oriented and accessible, central commercial service district in which a variety of retail, commercial,
office, civic and residential uses are permitted consistent with the City of Taylor Master Plan. Each
use shall be complimentary to the stated function and purpose of the district and shall not have
adverse impact upon adjacent street capacity and safety, utilities, and other City services. The MT-
1 and MT-2 Districts are further intended to:
(a) Encourage traditional, pedestrian-oriented commercial/mixed-use developments in a walkable
"Main Street" environment.
(b) Extend greater opportunities for greater traditional community living, working, housing, and
recreation to all citizens and residents of the City.
(c) Encourage a more efficient use of land and of public services and to reflect changes in
technology of land development, by directing new development in a traditional pattern of mixed
use and varied commercial styles.
(d) Create a community center that is pedestrian, and transit-friendly, which supports a healthier
and more sustainable community.
(e) Reduce the excess sprawl of development and the segregation of land uses that cause
increased vehicle travel and traffic congestion.
(f) Discourage the development of separate off-street parking facilities for each individual use, and
to encourage the development of off-street parking facilities to accommodate the needs of
several individual uses.
(g) Prohibit the development of drive-through facilities, which degrade the pedestrian environment,
contribute to traffic congestion and create a nuisance to residential uses in the type of compact
mixed-use environment desired for the Midtown area.
(h) Prohibit uses that are disruptive to pedestrian activities and have as their principal function the
sale and services of motor vehicles, such as automobile service stations, auto parts retail
stores, car washes, new and used motor vehicle sales or service establishments, drive-in
restaurants and restaurants with drive-through facilities, business with drive-through facilities
such as, but not limited to banks, credit unions, pharmacies, etc.
(i) Promote the creation of urban places, which are orientated to the pedestrian, thereby
promoting citizen security and social interaction.
(j) Promote developments where the physical, visual and spatial characteristics are established
and reinforced through the consistent use of compatible urban design and architectural design
elements. Such elements shall relate to the design characteristics of an individual structure or
development of other existing and planned structures or developments in a harmonious
manner (architectural texture or pattern), resulting in coherent overall development patterns
and streetscape.
Midtown Districts
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 7-3

(k) Discourage commercial and business uses that create noise, glare or odors, which are a
nuisance in a mixed-use environment.
(l) More efficiently provide for parking through shared parking and on-street parking where
appropriate.

(c) Modifications. The planning commission may modify the area, height, and placement
requirements where strict adherence would serve no good purpose or where the overall intent
of the District would be better served by allowing an alternative setback provided all of the
conditions below are found to exist.
(1) That a modification in setback will not impair the health, safety or general welfare of the City
as related to the use of the premises or adjacent premises.
(2) That the setback shall be consistent with the building lines of adjacent buildings and not be
setback a greater distance from the street than adjacent buildings.
(3) The building will still be oriented towards the street, provide pedestrian connections
between the building, and the sidewalk along the street and maintain or enhance the
continuity of the pedestrian-oriented environment.
(4) That waiver of the setback along a common parcel line between two (2) premises would
result in a more desirable relationship between a proposed building and an existing
building.
(5) The adherence to a minimum required setback would result in the establishment of nonusable
land area that could create maintenance problems.

Section 8.01 Intent
(a) The purpose of the Technology-Research-Office District, T-R-O District, is to provide an
environment where high tech uses and functions such as engineering, design, research and
development, computer assisted design, robotics research, prototype development and limited
manufacturing, telecommunications, and related storage, warehousing and limited assembly
operations associated with principal permitted uses can be located. Advances in industry,
technology, and office research facilities, have created uses which are related to industry and
office uses, but may not be appropriate or function adequately in a typical industrial or office
zoning district. These uses have been identified as "high tech" uses. The T-R-O District will be
located in a campus-type environment and so situated that uses will be developed without
being negatively impacted by elements and conditions which are commonly found in an
industrial zoning district.
(b) The I-1 Light Industrial District is designed so as to primarily accommodate wholesale activities,
warehouses, and industrial operations whose external, physical effects are restricted to the
area of the district and in no manner affect in a detrimental way any of the surrounding districts.
The I-1 District is so structured as to permit, along with any specified uses, the manufacturing,
compounding, processing, packaging, assembly, and/or treatment of finished or semi-finished
products from previously prepared materials. It is further intended that the processing of raw
material for shipment in bulk form, to be used in an industrial operation at another location, not
be permitted. Uses in this district must have less of an impact on surrounding uses and
generate less truck traffic than the other industrial developments. Limitations regarding the
degree of noise, smoke, glare, odor, and vibration are placed upon such uses to preclude any
adverse effects upon nearby commercial or residential districts. It is intended that this district
act as a transition between heavier industrial uses and residential or commercial areas. The
general goals of this use district include, among others, the following specific purposes:
(1) To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations, to meet the needs of the City's
expected future economy for the types of manufacturing and related uses described herein.
(2) To protect abutting residential districts by separating them from manufacturing activities,
and by prohibiting the use of such industrial areas for new residential development.
(3) To promote manufacturing development which is free from danger of fire, explosion, toxic
and noxious matter, radiation, and other hazards, and from offensive noise, vibration,
smoke, odor, and other objectionable influences.
(4) To promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with a well considered plan. To
protect the character and established pattern of adjacent development, and in each area to
conserve the value of land and buildings and other structures, and to protect the City's tax
revenue.

(c) The I-2 General Industrial District is designed primarily for manufacturing, assembling, and
fabrication activities including large scale or specialized industrial operations, whole external
physical effects will be felt to some degree by surrounding districts. The I-2 District is so
structured as to permit the manufacturing, processing, and compounding of semi-finished or
finished products from raw materials as well as from previously prepared material. The I-2
District is further designed to provide areas within the City where heavy industrial uses can
most efficiently utilize major streets, utilities and other infrastructure while minimizing any
incompatible aspects with neighboring districts.
Section 8.02 Schedule of Uses

(k) Wireless Communication Facilities and Services
(1) Purpose and Intent. The regulations of this section are intended to conform with federal
laws and administrative rules governing facilities needed to operate wireless
communication systems and to set forth procedures and standards for review and approval
for the location of such facilities within the City of Taylor. It is the Citys intent to reasonably
regulate the location and design of such facilities to retain the integrity of neighborhoods
and the character, property values and aesthetic quality of the City and to also ensure
compliance with FAA height restrictions in the vicinity of the Detroit/Wayne County Metro
Airport. Given the increase in the number of wireless communication facilities requested as
a result of the new technology and the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the
policy of the City that all users should co-locate on attached wireless communication
facilities and wireless communication support structures. Collocation is proposed in order
to assure the most economic use of land and to prevent the proliferation of duplicative
services. In recognition of the Citys concern that technological advances may render
certain wireless communication facilities obsolete or unnecessary in the future,
requirements are set forth for the removal of unused or unnecessary facilities in a timely
manner and provide security for removal.
(2) Use Requirements. Wireless communication facilities may be located within the City in
accordance with Table 13.12.

other submittal requirements for site plan, as required in Article 19 Site Plan Review:
a. Signed certification by a professional engineer licensed by the state of Michigan with
regard to the manner in which the proposed structure will fall in the event of damage,
accident or injury (i.e. fall zone), and that the setback area provided shall
accommodate the structure should it fall or break and provide a reasonable buffer in the
event the structure fails.
b. A description of performance guarantee to be posted at the time of receiving approval
for the facility to ensure removal of the facility when it is abandoned or is no longer
needed. The applicant shall demonstrate that funds will be available to the City for
removal of any structure used for wireless communication in an amount which
reasonably reflects the cost of removal of the facility and restoration of the property or
structure upon which the facility is located or placed. Adequate funds shall also be
provided to cover the City's administrative costs in the event that the applicant or its
successor does not remove the wireless communication facility in a timely manner and
the City chooses to undertake removal of the facility. The City may choose to use
outside contractors for such purposes.
c. The security shall, at the election of the City, be in the form of cash or irrevocable letter
of credit to remove the facility in a timely manner as required under this section of the
ordinance. It shall further be provided that the applicant, owner or successor, shall be
responsible for payment of any costs or attorney fees incurred by the City in securing
removal.
d. A map that illustrates existing and known proposed wireless communication facilities
within the City of Taylor and adjacent communities, which are relevant in terms of
potential collocation or to demonstrate the need for the proposed facility. If the
information in question is on file with the City, the applicant shall be required only to
update as needed. Any such information which is trade secret and/or other confidential
commercial information which, if released would result in commercial disadvantage to
the applicant, may be submitted with a request for confidentiality in connection with the
development of governmental policy MCL 15.243(l)(g). This ordinance shall serve as
the promise to maintain confidentiality to the extent permitted by law. The request for
confidentiality must be prominently stated in order to bring it to the attention of the

constructed of brick, provided the City may waive this requirement for a building that is
not visible from a public right-of-way or any adjacent non-industrial lot.
e. Fencing shall be provided for protection of the support structure and security from
children and other persons who may otherwise access facilities. Fencing shall be black
vinyl coated or decorative wrought iron.
f. Any nonconforming situations on the site, such as, but not limited to, outdoor storage,
signs, inadequate landscaping, unpaved parking, lack of a sidewalk, improper lighting or
similar conditions shall be brought into conformance prior to the erection of the wireless
communication facility. If existing sites are not in conformance with the current zoning
standards, improvements shall be made to decrease the nonconformity or additional
landscaping shall be provided to reduce the impact of the nonconformity and the
wireless facility.
g. The operator shall comply with applicable federal and state standards relative to the
environmental effects of radio frequency emissions.
h. The applicant shall demonstrate that the requested height of the new or modified
support structure and antenna shall be the minimum height necessary for reasonable

l. Where an attached wireless communication facility is proposed on the roof of a building
if the equipment enclosure is proposed as a roof appliance or penthouse on the
building, it shall be designed, constructed and maintained to be architecturally
compatible with the principal building. The equipment enclosure may be located within
the principal building or may be an accessory building. If proposed as an accessory
building, it shall conform with all district requirements for principal buildings, including
yard setbacks.
m. The support system shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable building
codes and shall include the submission of a soils report from a geotechnical engineer,
licensed in the state of Michigan. This soils report shall include soil borings and
statements confirming the suitability of soil conditions for the proposed use.

(6) Collocation
a. Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the City of Taylor to minimize the overall
number of newly established locations for wireless communication support structures
within the City and to encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless
communication facilities. If a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility
owned or controlled by it, where collocation is feasible, the result will be that a new and
unnecessary additional structure will be required, in contradiction with City policy.
Collocation shall be required unless an applicant demonstrates that collocation is not
feasible.
b. Feasibility of Collocation. Collocation shall be deemed "feasible" for the purpose of
this section where all of the following are met:
1. The wireless communication provider or property owner where collocation is
proposed will accept market rent or other market compensation for collocation and
the wireless communication provider seeking the facility will pay such rates.
2. The site on which collocation is being considered, taking into consideration
reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is able to provide structural
support.
3. The collocation being considered is technically reasonable, e.g. the collocation will
not result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate physical and other
adjustments in relation to the structure, antennas and the like.
(7) Nonconforming Facilities and Penalties for not Permitting Collocation. If a party who
owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication support structure shall fail or refuse to
alter a structure to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible collocation, such
facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use,
and shall not be altered, expanded or extended in any respect. In addition, if a party
refuses to allow collocation in accordance with the intent of this section, and this action
results in construction of a new tower, the City may refuse to approve a new wireless
communication support structure from that party for a period of up to five (5) years. Such a
party may seek and obtain a variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) if and to the
limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which, in this
context, shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five (5) year prohibition would
unreasonably burden some providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication
services, or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of
personal wireless communication services.
(8) Variances. The ZBA may consider a variance from the standards of this section, based
upon a finding that one or more of the following factors exist, as appropriate for the type of
variance requested:
a. For location, the applicant has demonstrated that a location within a district or location
in accordance with the standards of this section cannot reasonably meet the coverage
or capacity needs of the applicant.
Use Requirements
Page 13-42 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
13
b. For no collocation the applicant has demonstrated that a feasible collocation is not
available for the coverage area and capacity needs because existing structures cannot
support the facility, that collocation would result in unreasonable interference, or that
reasonable financial terms are not available for collocation.
c. For setback, the applicant has provided engineering information that documents that the
tower is self collapsing and that the setback area provided shall accommodate the
structure should it fall or break and provide a reasonable buffer in the event the
structure fails.
d. For all, the applicant has proposed means to mitigate any negative impacts through
provision for future collocation, if found to be appropriate by the City, and special design
of the facility and site.
e. For all, the wireless communication and accessory facilities shall be designed to be
compatible with the existing character of the proposed site, neighborhood and general
area.

c. A sound level meter and an octave band analyzer shall be used to measure the level
and frequency of the sound or noise during the day and the night. The measuring
equipment and measurement procedures shall conform to the latest American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) specifications on acoustics. The sound level meter and
octave band analyzer shall be calibrated before and after the measurements. Sounds
of very short duration, which cannot be measured accurately with the sound level meter,
shall be measured by an impact noise analyzer; and the measurements so obtained
may be permitted to exceed the maximum levels provided in Tables 14.10.a or b by no
more than five (5) decibels. For purposes of this ordinance, impact noises shall be
considered to be those noises whose peak values are more than seven (7) decibels
higher than the values indicated on the sound level meter.
d. For some post-1960 manufactured instruments, the octave bands mentioned above
have been converted to the new Preferred Frequencies as established by the American
Standards Association. To accommodate the possible use of either type of
instrumentation, Tables 14.10.b lists the preferred Frequencies. Care shall be
exercised to assure the proper correlation between instruments and tables used in
measuring performance.

maximum permitted levels, the intensity levels permitted may then exceed those levels
specified in the tables but may not exceed the level of the subject adjacent street traffic
noises. For those areas in which the existing background noise levels exceed the
maximum permitted levels, the noise levels at the boundary line may not exceed the
background noise levels. In such cases, a study shall be made to determine the
character of the background noise to include sources, levels and duration.
f. Sounds of an intermittent nature or characterized by pure tones may be a source of
complaints even if the measured level does not exceed that specified. In such cases,
General Provisions
Page 14-10 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance

furnace or combustion device, recognized and approved equipment, means, method,
device or contrivance to reduce the quantity of gas borne or airborne solids of fumes
emitted into the open air, which is operated in conjunction with said process, furnace, or
combustion device so that the quantity of gas borne or airborne solids shall not exceed 0.20
grains per cubic foot of the carrying medium at the temperature of five hundred (500)
degrees Fahrenheit.
For the purpose of determining the adequacy of such device, these conditions are to be
conformed to when the percentage of excess air in the stack does not exceed fifty (50%)
percent at full load. The foregoing requirement shall be measured by the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) test code for dust-separating apparatus. All other forms
of dust, dirt and fly ash shall be completely eliminated insofar as escape or emission into
the open air is concerned. The chief building official may require such additional data as is

under the requirements of this section. For applications that are administratively approved,
architecture shall be reviewed by the Development Services Department.
(3) Where additions or remodeling of existing buildings is proposed, the following standards
shall apply:
a. Where a new wall material is proposed for an existing building wall, only that portion of
the building being altered shall be subject to the standards of this section. However, in
considering the proposed alteration, the planning commission may modify the material
requirements of the section where it will be consistent with the architecture of the entire
building.
b. Where an addition is proposed to an existing building, the planning commission may
allow the use of existing wall materials for the addition provided that the design of the

17
Section 17.01 Off-Street Parking, Loading, Access and Circulation
Requirements
(a) Applicability of Parking Requirements. For all buildings and uses established after the
effective date of this ordinance, off-street parking shall be provided as required by this article.
(1) Whenever use of a building or lot is changed to another classification of use, off-street
parking facilities shall be provided as required by this article.
(2) If the intensity of use of any building or lot is increased, through the addition of floor area,
increase in seating capacity or other means, additional off-street parking shall be provided
for such increase in intensity of use.
(3) Off-street parking facilities in existence on the effective date of this ordinance shall not be
reduced below the requirements of this article.
(4) An area designated as required off-street parking shall not be changed to another use,
unless equal facilities are provided elsewhere in accordance with the provisions of this
article.
(b) Collective or Shared Parking. Two (2) or more buildings or uses may use a common parking
facility provided that the number of parking spaces provided is equal to the required number of
spaces for all of the uses computed separately. Cumulative parking requirements for mixeduse
developments or shared facilities may be reduced by the planning commission where it can
be determined that one or more of the factors listed in subsection (d) below apply. Where uses
are on separately-owned lots, a legal agreement for shared parking shall be recorded and a
copy provided to the City before a certificate of occupancy is issued.
(c) Reduction of Parking Requirements. The planning commission may reduce the parking
requirements based upon a finding that there will be a lower demand for parking due to one (1)
or more of the following:
(1) Shared parking by multiple uses where there will be a high proportion of multi-purpose visits
or uses have peak parking demands during differing times of the day or days of the week.
Pedestrian connections shall be maintained between the uses. For separate lots, they shall
be adjacent each other, with pedestrian, and vehicular connections maintained between the
lots. Shared parking agreements shall be filed with the Wayne County Register of Deeds
and the City clerk after approval by the planning commission before a certificate of
occupancy is issued.
(2) Convenient municipal off-street parking or on-street spaces located along the sites
frontage.
(3) Expectation of walk-in business due to sidewalk connections to adjacent residential
neighborhoods or employment centers. In allowing a parking space reduction the site
design shall incorporate pedestrian connections to the site and on-site pedestrian
Off-Street Parking, Loading, Access and Circulation Requirements
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 17-3
17
circulation providing safe and convenient access to the building entrance.
(4) Availability of other forms of travel such as transit. In allowing a parking space reduction
the planning commission may require the site design incorporate transit stops, pedestrian
connections to nearby transit stops or bicycle parking facilities.
(5) Where the applicant has provided a parking study, conducted by a qualified traffic engineer,
that demonstrates that another standard would be more appropriate based on actual
number of employees, expected level of customer traffic or actual counts at a similar
establishment. The planning commission may require a parking study to document that any
one of the criteria (1) through (4) above would be met.
(d) Maximum Allowed Parking. In order to minimize excessive areas of pavement which reduces
aesthetic standards and contribute to high rates of storm water runoff, exceeding the minimum
parking space requirements by more than ten percent (10%) shall only be allowed with
approval by the planning commission. In granting such additional space, the planning
commission shall determine that such parking will be required, based on documented
evidence, to accommodate the use on a typical day. The planning commission may require
that additional spaces be constructed with alternative paving materials, such as
permeable/grass pavers or pervious concrete.
(e) Banked Parking
(1) Where a reduction in the number of parking spaces is not warranted but an applicant
demonstrates that the parking requirements for a proposed use would be excessive, the
planning commission may defer some of the parking. The site plan shall designate portions
of the site for future construction of the required parking spaces, which shall be maintained
in a landscaped appearance and not occupy required greenbelts, or parking lot setbacks or
be used for any other purpose. Landscaping, such as parking lot trees that would
otherwise be required for the banked parking, shall be installed in the area of the banked
parking.
(2) The banked parking shall be required to meet ordinance requirements if constructed.
Construction of the deferred parking area to add parking spaces may be initiated by the
owner or required by the Development Services Department, based on parking needs or
observation, and shall require administrative approval of an amended site plan. The
Development Services Department may request a performance guarantee to cover the cost
of developing the deferred parking lot.
(f) Residential Parking
(1) Single-family residential parking spaces shall consist of a parking strip, driveway, garage, or
combination thereof, and shall be located on the premises they are intended to serve.
(2) Single-family residential parking spaces shall be located on hard or pervious concrete,
asphalt or permeable/grass pavers. Lawn and yard areas, other than designated parking
areas, shall not be utilized for off-street parking. Driveways shall be required to be concrete
Off-Street Parking, Loading, Access and Circulation Requirements
Page 17-4 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
17
if the adjoining street is concrete.
(3) A minimum three (3) foot wide lawn or landscape strip shall be required between the edge
of parking area pavement and all lot lines to provide adequate room for drainage, snow
storage and privacy screening.
(4) Circular drives shall be prohibited unless driveway access points are separated by an
interior distance of seventy (70) feet. A minimum lot width of none hundred (100) feet shall
be required.
(5) Carports and garages for multiple-family dwellings shall be calculated as parking spaces on
a one to one (1:1) basis. Carports and garages in multiple-family dwelling developments
shall be designed and located in accordance with the following:
a. A maximum height of fourteen (14) feet, measured from the grade to the peak of the
structure.
b. Be enclosed or screened at least twenty-five percent (25%) along sides visible from
public streets, single family residential districts or vehicular drives within the site.
c. Not permitted in the front yard.
d. Location shall be approved by the fire marshal for emergency vehicle circulation.
(g) Use Limitations
(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to use private property for vehicle
parking without the express consent, authorization, or ratification of the owner, holder,
occupant, lessee, agent or trustee of the property.
(2) Off-street parking areas are intended only for temporary vehicle parking for public safety by
keeping parked cars off the streets. Except when land is used as storage space in
connection with the business of a repair or service garage, use of parking areas or open
land is not permitted for the storage or parking of wrecked or junked cars, or for creating a
junk yard or nuisance in the area.
(3) Loading spaces and parking spaces shall be considered separate and distinct requirements
and shall be considered separate components on the proposed site plan. In no case shall
one (1) component be construed as meeting the requirements of the other required
components.
(4) It shall be unlawful to use a parking lot or open area for the storage of merchandise,
materials, trucks, trailers, construction trailers, recreational vehicles and equipment, except
for uses approved for this in the Industrial Districts or as provided for in Section 15.08
Storage of Recreational Vehicles and Section 15.10 Commercial Vehicles. This provision
shall not apply to areas designated for fleet and company vehicles, provided they are
located in the side and rear yards.

provided to accommodate handicapped accessibility in accordance with current State of
Michigan Code or ADA requirements.
(i) Bicycle Facilities. All developments shall be designed to accommodate bicycle travel,
including providing bike racks. All parking structures and parking lots shall provide sufficient
bike racks based on a minimum of one (1) bike for every ten (10) automobiles or one (1) bike
for every 3,000 square feet of building floor area, whichever is greater.
(j) Required Off-Street Parking Spaces. The minimum number of required off-street parking
spaces shall be provided on premise in accordance with Table 15.01.b. or as otherwise allowed
by this article.
(1) Fractional Spaces. When units or measurements determining the number of required
parking spaces result in a fraction over one-half (½) a full parking space shall be required.
(2) Uses not Listed. For uses not specifically listed in Table 15.01.b, the required parking
shall be in accordance with that of a similar use as determined by the Development
Services Department, based on documentation regarding the specific parking needs of the

(2) Off-street parking spaces are permitted within any yard except as provided for in (3) below,
provided the parking lot setbacks in the applicable district or use standards are met.
(3) In all multiple-family residential, office and midtown districts, the required front yard setback
shall not be used for off-street parking, loading or unloading, and shall remain open and
unoccupied and unobstructed except for landscaping or vehicle access drives.
(4) In all other districts, the planning commission may allow parking within the required front
yard; provided, parking lot setback requirements are met, and a greenbelt is provided along
the site frontage between the front lot line and the parking area, in accordance with Section
16.02 Landscaping.
(5) Off-street parking facilities required for all other uses shall be located on the lot or within
three hundred (300) feet of the building(s) they are intended to serve, as measured along
lines of public access from the nearest point of the parking facility to the building(s) served.
In the midtown districts parking facilities shall be located within six hundred (600) feet of the
building to be served.
(b) Access
(1) Adequate ingress and egress to the parking lot by means of clearly limited and defined
drives shall be provided for all vehicles meeting the requirements of Section 17.05
Driveway Access Management.
(2) All spaces shall be provided adequate access by means of maneuvering lanes.
(3) Parking lots shall be designed to prevent vehicles from backing into the street or requiring
use of the street for maneuvering between parking rows.
(4) Ingress and egress to parking lot lying in an area zoned for other than single family
residential use shall not be across land zoned for single family residential use, except in
instances where access is provided by means of an alley that forms the boundary between
a residential and non-residential district.
(5) Each entrance to and exit from any off-street parking lot located in an area zoned for other
than single family residential use shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet distant from adjacent

Section 17.05 Driveway Access Management
(a) Driveway Location in General
(1) All driveways serving multiple-family,
commercial, office, institutional or industrial
uses shall comply with the requirements of
this section.
(2) Driveways shall be located to minimize
interference with the free movement of
traffic, to provide adequate sight distance,
and to provide the most favorable driveway
grade.
(b) Driveway Spacing Standards
(1) Minimum spacing requirements between a
proposed driveway and an intersection
either adjacent or on the opposite side of
the street may be set on a case-by-case
basis but in no instance shall be less than
the distances listed in Table 17.05.a. The
following measurements are from the near
edge of the proposed driveway, measured at the throat perpendicular to the street, to the
near lane edge of the intersecting street or pavement edge for uncurbed sections.

construction of the driveway on a side street, a shared driveway with an adjacent property, construction of
the driveway along the lot line farthest from the intersection, or require a service street
Off-Street Parking, Loading, Access and Circulation Requirements
Page 17-18 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
17
(2) Minimum spacing between two (2) driveways shall be determined based upon posted
speed limits along the parcel frontage. The minimum spacing indicated in Table 17.05.b.
are measured from centerline to centerline on the same side of the street.
(3) To reduce left-turn conflicts, new
driveways shall be aligned with
those across the street where
possible. If alignment is not
possible along major streets,
driveways shall be offset from
those on the opposite side of the
street as follows:
a. If the proposed drive is offset such that vehicles turning
left into driveways do not pass prior to reaching the
driveways, the minimum spacing shall be one hundred
fifty (150) feet.
b. If the proposed drive is offset such that vehicles turning
left into driveways will pass prior to reaching the
driveways, the minimum spacing shall be as follows:
(4) In the case of expansion, alteration or redesign of an
existing development where it can be demonstrated that
pre-existing conditions prohibit adherence to the minimum
driveway spacing standards, the Planning commission may
modify the driveway spacing requirements. Such
modifications shall be the minimum necessary, but in no
case shall spacing of a full-access driveway be less than
sixty (60) feet, measured centerline to centerline.
(c) Number of Driveways
(1) The number of driveways serving a property shall be the minimum number necessary to
provide reasonable access and access for emergency vehicles, while preserving traffic
operations and safety along the public street.

(2) Access shall be provided per separately owned parcel. This access may be an individual
driveway, shared driveway or via a service drive. Additional driveways may be permitted
for property meeting the following requirements:
a. One (1) additional driveway for properties with a continuous frontage of over three
hundred (300) feet, and one (1) additional driveway per additional three hundred (300)
feet of frontage, if the Planning commission determines there are no other reasonable
access opportunities.
b. A traffic impact study determines additional access is justified without compromising
traffic operations along the public street.
c. Two (2) one-way driveways may be permitted where the frontage is at least one
hundred twenty five (125) feet.
(d) Driveway Design
(1) All driveways shall be designed according to the standards of the City, Wayne County or
MDOT, as appropriate. Driveways shall have a maximum width of thirty (30) feet, excluding
tapers or curb radii. Wider driveways shall be allowed for locations with large volumes of
truck traffic in accordance with Section 17.04 Truck Maneuvering, Access and Circulation
Standards.
(2) For high traffic generators, or for driveways along streets experiencing or expected to
experience congestion, the planning commission may require two (2) egress lanes.
(3) For a boulevard entrance, a fully curbed island, at least one hundred eighty (180) square
feet in area, shall separate the ingress and egress lanes. The radii forming the edges on
this island shall be designed to accommodate the largest vehicle that will normally use the
driveway. The planning commission may require landscaping tolerant of street conditions
on the section outside the public right-of-way.
(e) Shared Driveways, Frontage Streets and Service Drives
(1) The number of access points may be reduced where the planning commission determines
that there may be a beneficial effect on traffic operations and safety, while preserving the
property owner's right to reasonable access. In this case, a shared driveway, frontage
street or rear service drive connecting two (2) or more properties or uses may be required.
Service streets may be required near existing traffic signals or near locations having
potential for future signalization; along major streets with high traffic volumes; and where
there are a relatively high number of accidents or limited sight distance. Shared access or
cross access shall be required between all sites that are in the same or similar zoning
district (e.g. between all adjacent commercially zoned properties).
(2) Shared driveways and service streets shall be within an access easement recorded with the
Wayne County Register of Deeds. A draft of the access easement shall be provided to the
City for review and approval prior to filing.
Off-Street Parking, Loading, Access and Circulation Requirements
Page 17-20 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
17
(3) Service Street and Shared Driveway Design Standards
a. Location. Service streets shall generally be parallel or perpendicular to the front lot line
and may be located either in front of, adjacent to, or behind, principal buildings. The
planning commission shall determine the most appropriate alignment, taking into
account setbacks of existing buildings and anticipated traffic flow for the site and the
corridor.
b. Access Easement. The service street shall be within an access easement permitting
traffic circulation between properties. This easement shall be a minimum of forty (40)
feet wide. The required width shall remain free and clear of obstructions, unless
otherwise approved by the planning commission.
c. Construction and Materials. Service streets shall have a base, pavement and curb
with gutter in accordance Wayne County standards for public streets, except the width
of the service street shall have a minimum pavement width of twenty-six (26) feet or as
approved by the City engineer.
d. Parking. The service street is intended to be used exclusively for circulation, not as a
parking maneuvering aisle. The planning commission may require the posting of "no
parking" signs along the service street by the property owner/developer at the property
owners/developers expense. The planning commission may permit temporary parking
in the easement area where a continuous service street is not yet available, provided
that the layout allows removal of the parking in the future to allow extension of the
service street.
e. Access to Service Street. The planning commission shall approve the location of all
accesses to the service street, based on the driveway spacing standards of this section.
The planning commission may allow additional driveways if recommended by the City
engineer, Wayne County or MDOT, and consistent with purpose of this section.
f. Temporary Access. The planning commission may approve temporary accesses
where a continuous service street is not yet available and a performance guarantee is
provided to assure elimination of temporary access when the service street is
continued. Building permits shall not be issued until monies have been deposited with
the City.
g. Elevation. The site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the service street at
the lot line. The City shall maintain a record of all service street elevations so that their
grades can be coordinated.
h. Landscaping. The area between a service street and the public street right-of-way
shall be planted as a landscaped greenbelt as specified in Section 16.02(c) Greenbelts.
i. Maintenance. Each property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of the
easement and service drive.

Section 18.01 Intent
The intent of this article is to regulate signs within the City of Taylor. The regulations and
standards of this article are intended to be content neutral and are considered the minimum
amount necessary to achieve a substantial government interest for public safety, aesthetics, and
protection of property values. These objectives are accomplished by establishing the minimum
amount of regulations necessary concerning the size, placement, construction, illumination, and
other aspects of signs in the City so as to:
(a) Protect the public right to receive or convey messages and information protected by the First
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
(b) Maintain and improve the image of the City by encouraging signs of consistent size which are
compatible with and complementary to related buildings and uses, and harmonious with their
surroundings.
(c) Recognize that the proliferation of signs is unduly distracting to motorists and non-motorized
travelers, reduces the effectiveness of signs directing and warning the public, causes
confusion, reduces desired uniform traffic flow, and creates potential for accidents.
(d) Recognize that the principal intent of commercial signs is for identification of an establishment
on the premises, and not for advertising off-premise activities.
(f) Enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities without excessive difficulty and
confusion by restricting the number and placement of signs.
(g) Prevent placement of signs which will conceal or obscure signs of adjacent uses.
(h) Prevent off-premise signs from conflicting with land uses.
(i) Prevent signs that are potentially dangerous to the public due to structural deficiencies or
disrepair.
(j) Prohibit most portable commercial signs in recognition of their significant negative impact on
traffic safety and aesthetics.
Section 18.02 Scope of Requirements
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to erect, repair, alter, relocate, or maintain
any sign within the City except in conformance with the provisions of this article, subject to
issuance of a permit, except as otherwise provided herein.

(2) Sign height shall be measured from the level of the ground, finished surface, adjacent to the
sign.
(3) Sign height shall not be measured from an area of the ground that has been built-up or
constructed in a manner that would have the effect of allowing a higher sign height than
permitted by these regulations (e.g. the height of signs erected on a berm shall be
measured from the finished grade adjacent to the berm).
(c) Determination of Sign Area. Signs shall not exceed the maximum size for display area in
accordance with Table 18.06.a and as regulated elsewhere in this article. The sign display area
shall be expressed in square feet, computed to the nearest tenth of a square foot, and

single faced sign shall be
measured by calculating
the square footage of the
sign face as measured by
enclosing the most
protruding points or edges
of a sign within a
parallelogram or rectangle,
including any frame.
(2) When a sign consists of
individual letters or other
sign elements printed,
painted or mounted on a
wall or a window, the area
of the sign shall be
computed by enclosing the edges of the sign elements (i.e. letters, logos) within a
parallelogram or rectangle.
(3) Where a sign has two (2) faces, the area of only the larger face shall be considered when
calculating maximum size, provided all faces are part of the same structure, back-to-back
and are separated by no more than eighteen (18) inches.

(b) Conditions may also be imposed to protect the natural environment and conserve natural
resources and energy; to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses of land; and to promote the
use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner. Such conditions shall be
considered necessary by the planning commission, or ARC, as applicable, to ensure
compliance with the review standards, and necessary to meet the intent and purpose of this
article.
(c) The conditions imposed on approval of a site plan run with the property and not with the owner
of such property.
(d) A record of conditions imposed shall be recorded in the minutes attached to the approved site
plan and maintained by the City. The conditions shall remain unchanged unless an
amendment to the site plan is approved by the planning commission, or ARC, as applicable.
Section 19.07 Validity of Approved Plans

In the I-1, I-2 and TRO Districts, a master development plan can be submitted to the planning
commission for a recommendation to the City Council to approve an overall business park plan for
an industrial or office development containing more than four (4) building sites or lots. Once the
planning commission and City Council has approved the master development plan for the overall
business park, development of lots or sites within the business park may be approved
administratively by ARC, subject to the following:
(a) The master development plan for the overall business park shall first be approved by the
planning commission and City Council as follows.
(1) The master development plan for the overall business park shall comply with the
requirements of the City subdivision regulations or the condominium regulations.
Subdivision plats and condominium site plans must be approved by the City Council based
upon the recommendation of the planning commission.
(2) An existing business park may obtain approval of a master development plan for
redevelopment of the business park.
(3) A business park master development plan may be approved as a plat or condominium
based upon the current zoning or may be approved as an industrial PUD under Article 22
Planned Unit Developments (PUDs).
(4) The master development plan must include a development agreement that specifies the
general types of uses that will be in the business park and a listing of the person(s)
responsible for the continuous management of the park.
(5) The master development plan needs to include specifications for developing the individual
lots or sites within the business park, including architecture, building materials, landscaping,
paved parking, screening of outdoor storage, location of loading docks, setback
specifications and signage restrictions.
(6) All of the streets, sewer, water and stormwater infrastructure must be installed with the
development of the overall business park and be in place and inspected by the City prior to
development of individual lots or sites in the business park. Sidewalks and common area
landscaping shall be installed or a performance guarantee posted with the City to ensure
installation with development of each lot. A phased development plan may be approved to

Section 19.10 Traffic Impact Studies
(a) Applicability and Types of Studies. The following traffic impact analysis shall be required at
the preliminary review stage for any site plan, special land use, condominium project,
subdivision plat or rezoning that will generate the traffic noted below. The level of detail
required is based on the expected amount of traffic to be generated by the proposed use,
based on generally accepted traffic engineering sources as described herein and the Michigan
handbook Evaluating Traffic Impact Studies.
(1) Traffic Impact Comparison for Rezoning. A comparison of the number of trips expected
to be generated during the a.m. peak hour, p.m. peak hour and on a typical weekday for
any existing use of the subject site, representative uses permitted under current zoning and
representative uses permitted under the requested zoning. For projects where the
comparison yields a difference greater than 50 directional trips during a peak hour or 500
trips on a typical weekday, a Traffic Impact Assessment shall be performed.
(2) Traffic Impact Assessment. An analysis that evaluates current and future inbound and
outbound traffic operations at site access points shall be required for projects expected to
generate either 50 - 99 directional trips during a peak hour or 500 - 750 trips during a typical
day.
(3) Traffic Impact Study. An analysis that evaluates current, background, and future traffic
operations at site access points and major signalized or non-signalized intersections in
proximity to the site shall be required for any proposed development which would be
expected to generate over 100 directional trips during the peak hour of the traffic generator
Site Plan Review
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 19-17
19
or the peak hour on the adjacent streets, or over 750 trips in an average day. Intersections
to be evaluated in the Traffic Impact Statement shall be established by the City.
(4) Updates. A Traffic Impact Study or Assessment shall also be required for new phases,
expansions or changes to a development that requires site plan review, based on the
thresholds established above, except where such report was approved (date of site plan
approval) within two (2) years of the new site plan submittal date, and a demonstration by
the applicants traffic engineer that traffic volumes have not increased by over two percent
(2%) annually.
(b) Required Contents. The following information is required for both Traffic Impact Assessments
and Traffic Impact Studies unless otherwise specified:
(1) Existing Site Conditions. Illustrations and a narrative which describes the characteristics
of the site and adjacent street system (planned and existing right-of-way, functional
classification, lane configuration, speed limits, any sight distances limitations, locations and
potential conflicts with operations at existing access points or intersections within 275 feet
of the sites frontage, or greater based upon MDOT access management guidelines, current
traffic conflicts, etc.). This description should include surrounding land uses, expected
development in the vicinity which could influence future traffic conditions, special site
features and a description of any committed street improvements. The study should define
and justify the study area selected for analysis.
(2) Existing Traffic Conditions. Illustrations, narratives, tables and capacity analysis that
reflects existing traffic conditions including:
a. Street alignment, including any problems with sight distance, number of lanes, lane
width and lane configurations;
b. Posted speed limits for various segments;
c. Existing traffic control;
d. Existing signal timing, as applicable;
e. Existing peak-hour weekday traffic volumes (and daily volumes or peak period counts
(7-9 a.m.-4-6 p.m.) to support the selection of the evaluated peak hour (if applicable) on
street(s) adjacent to the site. For uses with weekend peak characteristics, the City may
require new counts be taken on typical weekend days during the anticipated peak hours
of the proposed use. All counts shall be collected using accepted practices and shall
not be over two (2) years old;
f. For projects that require a Traffic Impact Study, existing counts and levels of service for
intersections in the study area shall be performed; and

g. For a Traffic Impact Study, crash data shall be provided and analyzed for the most
recent three year period upon which information is available for sites in close proximity
to intersections identified as either a Critical Crash Location or a Fatality location, for
projects that generate 500 or more peak hour trips. SEMCOG data or UD-10 reports
should be used in the analysis. Critical crash locations should be identified using
SEMCOGs critical crash thresholds. The City engineer may waive this requirement
upon a finding that the crash potential would not be significantly impacted by the
proposed project. Crash data shall also be obtained and analyzed if a signal warrant
analysis must be preformed where existing or projected level of service is D or worse
for un-signalized intersections. The signal warrant analysis should contain, at a
minimum, Warrants 1, 2, 6, 9, and 11.
(3) Background Traffic Conditions. Projects that are not expected to be completed and
occupied within one (1) year of site plan approval shall provide a separate evaluation of
background traffic for the expected completion date of the proposed development. This
background traffic shall be based on historic counts to acknowledge general growth trends
in the area, plus traffic associated with approved developments either currently under
construction or approved (and would be operational before the build-out year of the
proposed project), in the project area. The background traffic shall be evaluated based on
the existing street system plus programmed improvements where funding has been
committed. A level of service analysis shall be preformed for each intersection in the study
area. Unfunded mitigation that is not programmed by Wayne County, the City or included
in the SEMCOG 5-year TIP shall not be provided under the Background Conditions.
Background traffic turning movements shall be illustrated in the report.
(4) Proposed Use or Future Conditions. For a site plan review, mobile home park,
condominium project, a subdivision plat, planned development, or special land use: a
description of factors that relate to project trip generation such as the number and types of
dwelling units, the gross and usable floor area, the number of employees and shift change
factors shall be provided. Intended phasing or future expansion shall be noted. For a
rezoning, a description of the potential representative uses which would be allowed,
compared to representative uses allowed under current zoning. Representative uses shall
include the most intense traffic generation use allowed under current zoning in compliance
with all City site development regulations.
(5) Trip Generation Forecast. Forecasted trip generation of the proposed use for the a.m.
peak hour, the p.m. peak hour and average day shall be provided for the overall project and
each phase. The forecasts shall be based on the data and procedures outlined in the most
recent edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE). The applicant may use other commonly accepted and published sources of data or
supplement the standard data with data from at least three (3) similar projects in Michigan.
(6) Trip Reduction. Any trip reduction for pass-by trips, transit, ride-sharing, other modes and
internal capture rates shall be based both on ITE findings and documented survey results
acceptable to the City.
Site Plan Review

(7) Trip Distribution. The projected traffic generated shall be distributed (inbound v.
outbound, left turn v. right turn) onto the existing street network to project turning
movements at site access points, and nearby intersections where required. Projected
turning movements shall be illustrated in the report. A description of the application of
standard engineering procedures for determining the distribution should be provided such
as trip distribution model, market studies or counts at existing driveways.
(8) Access Point Level of Service. A level of service or "capacity" analysis is required at the
proposed access points using the procedures outlined in the most recent edition of the
Highway Capacity Manual published by the Transportation Research Board. The capacity
analysis should be provided in the appendix of the report.
(9) Intersection Level of Service. Traffic Impact Studies shall provide capacity analyses for
all nearby street intersections identified by the City under the following conditions:
a. Existing traffic under existing street conditions.
b. Future project traffic under existing street conditions with programmed street
improvements that will be completed before the build-out year of the proposed project.
c. Future traffic, including project and background, under background street conditions.
Background street conditions shall include the existing street system plus programmed
improvements where funding has been committed.
(10) Warrant Analysis. A traffic signal warrant analysis based on the procedures outlined in
the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices shall be performed for unsignalized
intersections identified with an existing Level of Service D or worse for existing
conditions. The signal warrant analysis should contain, at a minimum, Warrants 1, 2, 6, 9,
and 11. For un-signalized intersections projected to operate at Level of Service D or
worse under background or future conditions, an assessment using the peak hour
(Warrant 11) shall be provided. At least 2 traffic signal warrants should be met to warrant a
signal.
(11) Access Design. The report shall include a map and description of the location and design
of proposed access (driveways or new street intersections) including:
a. Sight distance limitations and sketches from field notes.
b. Dimensions from adjacent driveways and intersections within two hundred seventy-five
(275) feet on either side of the main street, or greater based upon MDOT access
management guidelines.
c. Potential for shared access facilities.
d. Data to demonstrate that the number of driveways proposed is the fewest necessary.
e. Support that the access points will provide safe and efficient traffic operation and be in
accordance with the standards of Section 17.05 Driveway Access Management and the
applicable road agency.

f. Comments shall also be provided on internal circulation design such as the adequacy of
queuing (stacking) at site access points and other features that may affect traffic
operations and safety.
(11) Non-motorized Transportation. The report shall include an analysis of non-motorized
facilities, including pedestrian and bicycle. Pedestrian level of service shall consider the
presence of sidewalks, width of sidewalks, buffers between sidewalks and motor vehicle
travel lanes, presence of barriers within the buffer area, crosswalks and driveway
frequency. Bicycle level of service shall consider the presence of bike lanes or paved
shoulders, proximity of bicyclists to motorized vehicles, motorized vehicle volume, speed,
and percentage of trucks and pavement condition.
(12) Mitigation. The study shall outline mitigation measures and demonstrate any changes to
the level of service achieved by these measures for the proposed future conditions.
a. Mitigation shall be provided to ensure that all intersections operate at a Level of
Service D or better during the peak hours of the day. The mitigated capacity analysis
should be provided in the appendix of the report. Any alternatives or suggested
phasing of improvements should be described and illustrated. The mitigation
measures may include items such as, but not limited to, street widening, change to
street intersection alignment or grades, need for bypass lanes or deceleration
tapers/lanes, changes to signalization, relocation change in design, or reduction in
number of access points, or a reduction in the proposed density of intensity of use.
Sketches should be provided of suggested mitigation. Any mitigation that involves
changes to optimize signal timing must demonstrate that such changes will benefit the
overall operations and will be acceptable to the applicable road agency. Proposed
mitigation measures should be discussed with Wayne County and MDOT, as
applicable. The responsibility and timing of street improvements shall be described.
b. Mitigation shall also include measures to improve non-motorized safety and level of
service. All developments shall include walkable design elements such as sidewalks,
design that favors pedestrians over autos within the site, safe and dedicated
pedestrian access from the public sidewalk to the building entrance and links to
adjacent land uses. This may also include improvements to the pedestrian system that
will enhance the level of service for pedestrians using the site, such as improved
streetscape along sidewalk, convenient access to transit stops, enhanced crosswalks
and filling in gaps in the pathway system. Bike amenities would include upgrades to
bike paths along a sites frontage or the provision of bike facilities onsite, such as bike
racks.
(c) Qualifications of Preparer. The person responsible for the preparation of the study shall have
a degree or specific professional training in the preparation of traffic impact studies. The
preparer shall have at least three (3) years of recent experience in the preparation of traffic
impact studies, provide evidence of ongoing experience and familiarity with the Highway
Capacity Manual and other traffic operation evaluation techniques, be an associate (or higher)
member of one or more professional transportation-related organizations, and be either a
registered engineer (PE) or a planner with AICP or PTP certification. Any study involving street

or traffic signal design work shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a registered
engineer (PE) with specific training in traffic engineering.
(d) Procedures.
(1) The applicant shall submit a traffic impact questionnaire, on a form provided by the City. In
addition to completing the questionnaire, the applicant must include a description of the
proposed development, the ITE Trip Generation Land Use(s), and the anticipated number
of directional trips generated during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours of the traffic generator or
the a.m. and p.m. peak hours on the adjacent streets, as well as for an average day. The
City engineer shall review the traffic impact questionnaire and determine the level of traffic
impact analysis required (i.e. traffic impact comparison, traffic impact assessment or traffic
impact study) and establish the study intersections based on the proposed development
and size.
(2) Once the applicant has complete and submitted the traffic impact analysis to the City, it is
distributed to Wayne County, the City engineer, and MDOT, if appropriate. The study is to
be submitted at a minimum of forty-five (45) days prior to the Planning Commission meeting
at which the proposed development is to be considered.
(3) If the City or Wayne County determines there are deficiencies in the traffic impact analysis,
a report of such deficiencies shall be provided to the applicant and the applicant shall be
required to revise and resubmit the traffic impact analysis. Any traffic impact analyses with
noted deficiencies will not be re-reviewed until all elements have been addressed. All partial
re-submittals will be rejected.
(4) The City engineer, Wayne County and other review agencies shall provide the Planning
Commission with comments on the traffic impact analysis prior to any consideration of the
proposed development.
(5) The planning commission, the planning commission shall approve or deny the traffic impact
study based upon the recommendation of the City engineer, and Wayne County and
compliance with the requirements of this ordinance.
(e) Waiver of Requirements. The requirement for a traffic impact study, or the specific study
elements required may be waived or modified by the City. Reasons for the waiver or
modification shall be documented. Factors to be considered include:
(1) Street improvements are programmed to be constructed prior to completion of the proposed
development which are expected to mitigate any impacts associated with the proposed
project.
(2) The existing level of service along the street is not expected to drop below D due to the
proposed project.
(3) The existing level of service is not expected to be significantly impacted by the proposed
project due to specific conditions at this location.

Section 20.01 Intent
(a) It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote and protect the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of the City of Taylor and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations
to prevent a concentration of regulated uses within the City. These regulations are intended to
control the negative secondary impacts such businesses have been documented to have on
the surrounding area and the community.
(b) The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses
in any one (1) area (i.e., not more than one (1) such uses within 1,000 feet of another regulated
use) or within a one thousand (1,000) foot radius of a residential district or within a one
thousand (1,000) foot radius of any nursery, primary, or secondary school. It is further the
intent of these regulations that these uses only be permitted as special land uses.
Section 20.02 Locational Requirements for Regulated Uses
(a) The establishment of a regulated use listed below (whether the use is primary, secondary, or
accessory) is prohibited if the use will be within a 1,000 foot radius of another regulated use:
(1) Adult regulated uses, as listed in Section 20.05(c) Classification.
(2) Firearms dealers (where over ten percent (10%) of the business revenues are generated by
the sale of firearms) distributors, repair shops, firing ranges (only in an enclosed building),
and similar establishments.
(3) Pawn shops.
(4) Tattoo parlor.
(b) The establishment of a regulated use listed in (a) above (whether the use is primary,
secondary, or accessory) is prohibited if the use will be within one thousand (1,000) feet of any
of the following:
(1) Church, religious institution, or building used primarily for religious worship and related
religious activities.
(2) Public or private elementary or secondary school, vocational school, special education
school, junior college or university.

(6) Child care facility, nursery or preschool.
(c) Measurement shall be made in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures or
objects, from the nearest portion of the property site boundary of a regulated uses to the
nearest lot line of the premises of any use, district or right-of-way listed in subsection (a) above.
The distance between any two (2) regulated uses shall be measured in a straight line, without
regard to intervening structures or objects from the site or property boundary in which each
business is located. Access easements or portions of the parcel that are exclusively used to
provide access to the site of the adult regulated uses shall be excluded from the parcel
boundary in determining whether the site complies with the required separation. The intent of
this exclusion is to allow adult regulated uses to comply with the separation requirement from
major streets by means of an access easement or access strip of land from the site to the
street.
(d) A person is in violation of this ordinance if they cause or permit the operation, establishment,
substantial enlargement, or transfer of ownership or control of a regulated uses within one
thousand (1,000) feet of another regulated use.
(e) A person is in violation of this ordinance if they cause or permit the operation, establishment or
maintenance of more than one (1) regulated uses in the same building, structure or portion
thereof or the substantial enlargement of any regulated uses in any building, structure or
portion thereof containing another regulated use.
(f) Any business now classified as a regulated uses lawfully operating on the date of adoption of
the ordinance that is in violation of this section shall be deemed a nonconforming use.
(g) A regulated use shall only be located within a zoning district where it is listed
Section 20.03 Procedures
(a) Application. Application to establish any of the above adult regulated uses (principal or
accessory) shall be made to the planning commission. Applications shall require special land
use and site plan approval under the regulations of Article 19 Site Plan Review and Article 21
Special Land Use Review in addition to the regulations of this article. The planning
commission shall not approve any regulated use if the separation requirements of Section
20.02 Separation Requirements above are not met
(b) Separation. The separation requirements may be modified as provided for in Section 20.04
Appeals and Waivers.
(c) More than One Use. If there is more than one (1) regulated use proposed for a zoning lot that
shall be indicated on the petition and submitted as part of the same application package. The
requirements pertaining to the principal use shall prevail when reviewing the request.

(d) Conditions of Approval. The planning commission may impose such conditions or limitations
upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance or operation of the regulated uses,
as shall, in its judgment, considering the standards set forth in this ordinance, be necessary for
the protection of the public health, safety, welfare and interest, except that any conditions
imposed on a adult regulated use shall be limited to those conditions necessary to assure
compliance with the standards and requirements in Section 20.05. Any evidence and
guarantee may be required as proof that the conditions stipulated in connection with the
establishment, maintenance and operation of a adult regulated use shall be fulfilled.
(e) Time Limits for Review. An application for special land use approval of a regulated use shall
proceed before the planning commission for final decision. Applications for special use
approval of a regulated use, with the exception of an adult regulated use as provided for in (f)
below, shall be processed in the normal course.
(f) Time Limits for Adult Regulated Use Review. An application for special land use approval of
an adult regulated use shall proceed before the planning commission for final decision. The
following time limits shall apply to the review of an application by the planning commission for
special land use approval of an adult regulated use.
(1) The planning commission will publish notice and hold a public hearing as required for
special land use review within sixty (60) days of receiving a technically complete special
land use and site plan application as required by Article 19 Site Plan Review and Article 21
Special Land Use.
(2) The planning commission will make its decision regarding the special land use application
for an adult regulated use at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the planning
commission following the public hearing held to review the application, unless additional
information is required from the applicant. If additional information is required, the planning
commission will make its recommendation at the next regularly scheduled meeting after
receipt of the requested additional information, provided the additional information is
received no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting.
(3) Failure of the City to act within the above specified time limits shall not be deemed to
constitute the grant of special land use to the adult regulated use.
(g) Effect of Denial. An application for a regulated use that has been denied shall not be
resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of denial, except on the grounds of new
evidence or proof of changed conditions.
(h) Revocations. In any case where a building permit for a regulated use is required and has not
been obtained within six (6) months after the granting of the special land use by the planning
commission, the grant of special land use shall become null and void.

Section 20.04 Appeals and Waivers
(a) Waivers. The planning commission may waive the restrictions set forth in Section 20.02
Separation Requirements above for regulated uses provided all of the following findings are
made:
(1) That the proposed use will not be contrary to the public interest or interfere with the use and
enjoyment of nearby properties.
(2) That the proposed use will not enlarge or encourage the development of a "skid row" area
in which the homeless, unemployed, transients or others may loiter or congregate for no
gainful purpose.
(3) That the establishment of an additional regulated use in the area will not be contrary to any
program of neighborhood conservation nor will it interfere with any program of urban
renewal.
(4) That all applicable regulations of the ordinance will be observed.
(5) The locational requirements for adult regulated use may not be waived.
(b) Notice and Public Hearing. Prior to granting waiver of the locational restrictions set forth
above, the planning commission shall conduct a public hearing on the waiver. Notification of
the public hearing shall be in accordance with Section 25.09 Public Hearings.
Section 20.05 Adult Regulated Uses
(a) Intent. It is recognized that there are some uses which, because of their nature, are
recognized as having serious objectionable, operations characteristics, thereby having
deleterious effect upon adjacent areas. It is also recognized when several of these uses are
concentrated in close proximity, they begin to dominate the character of an area and create a
synergy that compounds their deleterious effect on other uses. Special regulations of these
uses are therefore necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the
blighting, deteriorating, and/or down grading of the area and the adjacent areas. These special
regulations are itemized in this Chapter. Prior to adopting these regulations, the City reviewed
studies prepared on these uses, reviewed ordinances and regulations prepared by other
municipalities, and reviewed applicable federal and state case law. Based on evidence of the
adverse effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the City
Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of Pap's AM v City of Erie, 529 US 277

paper entitled "Stripclubs According to Strippers: Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence, " by
Kelly Holsopple, Program Director, Freedom and Justice Center for Prostitution Resources,
Minneapolis, Minnesota, and from "Sexually Oriented Businesses: An Insider's View," by David
Sherman, presented to the Michigan House committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan
12, 2000, and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On the Regulation of
Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the City Council finds that
sexually oriented businesses as a category of establishments are correlated with harmful
secondary effects, and that the foregoing reports are reasonably believed to be relevant to the
problems that Taylor is seeking to abate and prevent in the future.
(b) Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate adult regulated uses to promote and
protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Taylor and to
establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent a concentration of adult regulated uses
within the City. These regulations are intended to control the negative secondary impacts such
businesses have been documented above to have on the surrounding area and the community.
The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults
to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by the
Regulated Use Review

21
Section 21.01 Intent
(a) The formulation and enactment of the zoning ordinance is based upon the division of the City
into zoning districts, in each of which are permitted specified uses which are mutually
compatible. In addition to permitted compatible uses there are certain other uses which may be
necessary or desirable to allow in certain locations within certain districts; but because of their
actual or potential impacts on neighboring uses or public facilities, there is a need to carefully
regulate them with respect to their location for the protection of the City. These uses, due to
their peculiar locational need or the nature of the service offered, may be established in a
district where they cannot be reasonably allowed as a permitted use, but may be allowed on a
case-by-case basis as special land uses.
(b) Special land uses are uses considered to be more intense, or potentially more disruptive,
compared to the various uses permitted by right in a particular zoning district. The uses
classified as special land uses vary by district and are listed in the regulations of each zoning
district. The special land use procedures and standards are intended to: provide a procedure
by which special land uses can be evaluated to determine their potential impacts; ensure
impacts can be accommodated within the environmental, infrastructure, and public services
capacities of the area; and, provide site design, and operational standards to minimize any
negative impact on adjoining or nearby properties.
Section 21.02 Scope
Prior to the establishment of a special land use, the City shall follow special procedures and
carefully review the proposed use so as to minimize potential conflicts with the uses in
conformance with this article.
(a) The planning commission shall have the sole authority to approve, approve with conditions or
disapprove all special land uses.
(b) The planning commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the requirements of
Section 25.09 Public Hearings. If the proposed special land use meets the requirements and
standards of the zoning ordinance, the planning commission shall approve the use. Approval
shall be granted only for those uses specified in the application and shown on the site plan.
(c) A site plan conforming to the requirements and procedures of Article 19 Site Plan Review is
required for all special land uses which shall be reviewed and approved by the planning
commission concurrently with the special land use.
Special Land Use Review
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 21-3

Section 21.03 Procedures
(a) Application. An application for the approval of a special
land use shall be made by an owner, lessee, or other
person with a legal interest in the property who has the
owner's written consent to file the application. All of the
following shall be submitted with the application for a
special land use permit:
(1) A complete site plan in accordance with the
requirements of Article 19 Site Plan Review.
(2) An application fee determined by the City Council shall
be made payable to the City of Taylor.
(3) For uses that require an environmental impact
statement (EIS) under Article 13 Use Requirements,
the EIS shall be submitted to the planning commission
at the time of its review of the special land use. If a
traffic analysis, community impact report or
environmental impact report is required by the City, it
shall be submitted to the planning commission at the
time of review of the special land use.
(4) The owner, developer, or their agent may submit
additional information or exhibits in support of their
application.
(b) Planning Commission
(1) The planning commission shall hold a public hearing and request recommendations from
City staff. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in accordance with Section 25.09
Public Hearings.
(2) The planning commission shall review the application and approve, deny, or approve with
conditions, the application.
(3) In reaching its decision the planning commission shall consider the application, staff
reports, and other relevant materials.
(4) Upon a finding that the application meets the general standards of Section 21.04 Review
Standards and the specific standards for that use contained in the use regulations of Article
13 Use Requirements the planning commission may approve the special land use. Upon
approval the planning commission may attach those conditions it deems necessary, in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
Special Land Use Review

21
(5) If the planning commission determines that the application for the requested special land
use does not meet the standards and requirements of this ordinance, it shall deny the
application setting forth the reason(s) for the denial.
(c) Conditions. Reasonable conditions may be imposed by the planning commission upon any
use of land requiring special land use approval. Any such conditions shall be:
(1) Designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety, and welfare and the social and
economic well being of those who will use the land use or activity under consideration,
residents, and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or activity, and
the community as a whole;
(2) Related to the valid exercise of the police power and purposes which are affected by the
proposed use or activity; and
(3) Necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance, be related to the
standards established in the ordinance for the land use or activity under consideration and
be necessary to ensure compliance with those standards.
(d) Site Plan Approval. The site plan for the special land use shall be approved by the planning
commission. The site plan shall be approved concurrently with the special land use.
Section 21.04 Review Standards
The planning commission shall permit any special land use under the terms of this ordinance if
such use meets the various specific standards set forth in the various sections of this ordinance
pertaining to uses allowed after special approval and if the planning commission finds the
proposed use requiring special land use approval is:
(a) Compatible with Adjacent Uses of Land. The proposed special land use shall be designed,
constructed, operated and maintained to be compatible with uses on surrounding land. The
site design of the proposed special land use shall minimize the impact of site activity on
surrounding properties. In determining whether this requirement has been met, consideration
shall be given to:
(1) The location and screening of vehicular circulation and parking areas in relation to
surrounding development.
(2) The location and screening of outdoor storage, outdoor activity or work areas, and
mechanical equipment in relation to surrounding development.
(3) The hours of operation of the proposed use. Approval of a special land use may be
conditioned upon operation within specified hours considered appropriate to ensure minimal
impact on surrounding uses.
Special Land Use Review
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 21-5
21
(4) The bulk, placement, and materials of construction of the proposed use in relation to
surrounding uses.
(b) Not Injurious to Adjacent Property, Surrounding Neighborhoods, or the Community as a
Whole. The proposed special land use shall not involve any activities, processes, materials,
equipment, or conditions of operation, and shall not be located or designed so as to be
detrimental to public health, safety, and welfare. In determining whether this requirement has
been met, consideration shall be given to the production of traffic, noise, vibration, smoke,
fumes, odors, dust, glare, and light.
(c) Enhancement of Surrounding Environment. The proposed special land use shall provide
the maximum feasible enhancement of the surrounding environment, and shall not
unreasonably interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of the adjacent
land and buildings or unreasonably affect their value.
(d) Provision of Landscaping and other Site Amenities. Provision of additional landscaping
over and above the requirements of this ordinance may be required as a condition of approval
of a special land use to buffer higher impact uses or screen views.
(e) Compatibility with the Master Plan and Zoning Ordinance. The proposed special land use
shall be compatible with and in accordance with the general principles and objectives of the
master plan and shall promote the intent and purpose of this ordinance.
(f) Compatible with the Natural Environment. The proposed special land use shall not have an
unacceptable significant adverse effect on the quality of the natural environment in comparison
to the impacts associated with the districts permitted uses. The planning commission may
require a quantitative comparison of the impacts of typical permitted uses and the special land
use to assist in making this determination (such as an overlay of conceptual development
plans, on a natural features map, illustrating other site development options to demonstrate the
impacts have been minimized to the extent practical). If the cumulative impact creates or
contributes to a significant environmental problem, mitigation shall be provided to alleviate the
impacts associated with the requested use (i.e. ensure the end result is at least similar to the
pre-existing conditions).
(g) Compatible with the Capacities of Public Services and Facilities. The proposed special
land use shall be located so as to be adequately served by essential public facilities and
services, such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage systems, water and
sewage facilities, and schools.
(h) Impact of Traffic. The location of the proposed special land use within the zoning district shall
minimize the impact of traffic generated by the proposed use. In determining whether this
requirement has been met, consideration shall be given to the following:
(1) Proximity and access to major streets.
(2) Estimated traffic generated by the proposed use.
Special Land Use Review
Page 21-6 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
21
(3) Proximity and relation to intersections.
(4) Adequacy of driver sight distances.
(5) Location of and access to off-street parking.
(6) Required vehicular turning movements.
(7) Provision for pedestrian and non-motorized travel.
(i) Isolation of Existing Uses. The location of the proposed special land use shall not result in a
small residential area being substantially surrounded by non-residential development, and
further, the location of the proposed special land use shall not result in a small non-residential
area being substantially surrounded by incompatible uses.
(j) Enhance the Social and Economic Welfare. The approval of a special land use provision is
a privilege granted when it can be demonstrated that there is an over-riding and compelling
benefit that is in the best interest of the City as well as the petitioner. The petitioner must
demonstrate that the proposed use will enhance the social and economic welfare of the City.
(k) Other Studies. The planning commission shall have the authority to require other studies and
materials be submitted to confirm compliance with the standards of this section including, but
not limited to, traffic impact studies, market studies, environmental assessments or utility
capacity analysis.
Section 21.05 Validity of Permit
(a) Start of Construction. Special land use approval is valid for a period of eighteen (18) months
from the date of planning commission approval. A building permit must be issued and physical
construction on structures must commence within that period. In the case of a re-occupancy of
an existing building, the use must be established within eighteen (18) months.
(b) Extensions. Upon written application filed prior to the termination of the eighteen (18) month
period as provided above, the planning commission may authorize a single extension of the
time limit for a further period of not more than one (1) year. Such extension shall be granted
only based on evidence from the applicant that the development has a reasonable likelihood of
commencing construction within the one (1) year extension. The planning commission may
require compliance with any amendments to the zoning ordinance since the special land use
was originally approved.
(c) Expiration of Special Land Use Permit. Where actual construction of a substantial nature of
structures authorized by a special land use permit has not commenced within eighteen (18)
months of issuance, and a written application for extension of the approval has not been filed
as provided below, the special land use permit shall become null and void and all rights there
under shall terminate.

21
Section 21.06 Amendments, Expansions and Change in Use
(a) Amendments. The property owner shall notify the Development Services Department of any
desired change in an approved special land use. The Development Services Department shall
determine whether the proposed amendment constitutes a minor or major amendment, based
on the total cumulative expansion since the original special land use approval as follows:
(1) Changes increase the buildings usable floor area by more than twenty percent (20%).
(2) Parking lots are expanded by more than twenty percent (20%).
(3) The occupancy, capacity or membership of the use is increased by more than twenty
percent (20%).
(4) The use is expanded to occupy an additional twenty percent (20%) or more land area.
(5) The expansion will result in a twenty percent (20%) or more increase in traffic generation
based upon the latest edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers Trip Generation Manual or
will change the number or location of driveway access points.
(6) Any change affecting any previous approved special use condition imposed by the City.
(b) Major Amendments. Any major amendment to an approved special land use by the amounts
in (a) above or greater shall require a new special land use permit and shall be reviewed using
the procedures and requirements of this article.
(c) Minor Amendment. Minor amendment to an approved special land use less than the amounts
noted in (a) above does not require submittal of a new application for a special land use, but
shall still be subject to the site plan review requirements of Article 19 Site Plan Review.
(d) Change in Use. Change to another type of special land use shall require submission of a new
application for a special land use following the review procedures contained in this Article. A
change in use that is still the same type of use shall not require a new special land use, unless
it involves a major expansion. A change in ownership shall not constitute a change in use.
Section 21.07 Revocation of an Approved Special Land Use
The planning commission shall have the authority to revoke any special land use approval after the
applicant has failed to comply with any of the applicable requirements of this article, other
applicable sections of this ordinance, or conditions of the special land use approval. Prior to any
action, the planning commission shall conduct a public hearing following the notification process for
the original approval. The applicant shall be provided an opportunity to present information and to
answer questions. The planning commission may revoke any previous approval if it finds that a
violation exists and has not been remedied. The special use permit may be suspended or revoked

Planned Unit Developments (PUDs)
Page 22-2 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
22
Section 22.01 Intent
The Planned Unit Development (PUD) is intended as a development option to provide a degree of
flexibility in the regulation of land development and the arrangement of uses. Through this option,
more creative approaches to development can be utilized which take better advantage of the
special characteristics of the land than would be possible through the strict enforcement of this
ordinance. The specific objectives of this article are to:
(a) Encourage innovation in land use and variety in design, layout and type of structures
constructed.
(b) Achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy, and the
provision of public services and utilities.
(c) Permit flexibility in the placement, lot area and building type regulations, and combination of
uses while assuring the application of sound site planning standards.
(d) Encourage the provision of useful open space and more extensive landscaping.
(e) Provide opportunities for improvements to public streets or facilities, pathways, and natural
storm water systems.
(f) Promote the development of walkable, mixed-use developments that will result in more
sustainable and healthy neighborhoods.
(g) Achieve consistent and coordinated site design (lighting, signs, building design, etc.), and high
quality architectural design and materials.
(h) Encourage the use, reuse, and improvement of existing sites.
(i) Encourage the use and improvement of land where site conditions make development under
conventional zoning difficult and less desirable.
Section 22.02 Qualifying Conditions
(a) Ownership. An application for the approval of a PUD shall be made by an owner, lessee, or
other person with a legal interest in the property who has the owner's written consent to file the
application.
(b) Public Utilities. The PUD site shall be serviced by public sewer and water systems. The
proposed type and density of use shall not result in an unreasonable increase in the use of
public services, public facilities, and utility capacities.
Planned Unit Developments (PUDs)
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 22-3

Section 22.03 Permitted Uses
Uses permitted in a PUD are based on the underlying zoning district. All permitted uses of the
underlying zoning district shall be permitted and all special land uses of the underlying zoning
district shall be allowed with special land use approval. Additional uses may be allowed in a PUD
as follows:
(a) Residential PUD. The PUD may provide for a variety of permanent housing types, including
single-family detached, townhomes or multiple-family residential.
(1) Where the underlying zoning is single-family residential, a minimum of eighty percent (80%)
of the dwellings shall be detached single-family dwellings and up to twenty percent (20%)
may be townhomes.
Planned Unit Developments (PUDs)
Page 22-4 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
22
(2) Where the underlying zoning is multiple-family, any mixture of single-family, townhouses
and multiple-family is permitted.
(b) Mixed-Use Residential PUD. For a PUD in a residential district that has an area of at least
twenty (20) acres, commercial uses allowed in the B-1 District may occupy up to ten percent
(10%) of the gross site area. Planned commercial sites are to be located at an intersection of
two (2) major streets or a major street.
(c) Mixed-Use/Non-Residential PUD. For a PUD in a non-residential district, residential uses
may be permitted in a mixed-use PUD in addition to the uses allowed by the underlying zoning
district. Other uses may be allowed where the planning commission determines them to be
consistent with surrounding uses and the future land use plan of the City of Taylor Master Plan.
(d) Industrial PUD. For a PUD in an I-1, I-2 or TRO District, uses allowed by the underlying
zoning district shall be allowed. Other commercial uses that provide services to businesses
and employees in the immediate area, such as convenience retail, restaurants, business
services and hotels, may be permitted where the planning commission determines the uses
contribute towards an integrated mixed-use employment district.
Section 22.04 Residential Density
(a) Single-Family Residential. Where the underlying zoning is single-family, residential density
shall be determined by a parallel plan that illustrates how the site could be developed as a
conventional subdivision or site plan, meeting all applicable City zoning and subdivision
requirements. The City shall review the design and determine the number of buildable lots that
could be feasibly constructed, taking into consideration any wetlands or other non-buildable
land. This number shall be the maximum number of dwelling units allowable for the PUD.
(b) Multiple-Family Residential or Commercial. Where the underlying zoning is multiple-family,
density shall be determined based upon the underlying zoning district and the definition of
density. Where the underlying zoning is non-residential, density shall be determined based
upon the RM-1 District.
(c) Change in Underlying Zoning. Where the master plan recommends a different zoning district
than the current zoning, a rezoning of the underlying zoning district consistent with the master
plan may be considered concurrently with the PUD.
(d) The City Council may grant a density bonus of up to ten percent (10%), where the planning
commission finds that the development provides extraordinary benefits and furthers smart
growth principals by meeting all of the following:
(1) The project will provide a wide range of housing opportunities and choices through varied
housing types, varied dwelling sizes and variable lot sizes; or the project will provide a
mixture of compatible and complementary residential and non-residential land uses;
Planned Unit Developments (PUDs)
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 22-5
22
(2) The project will create a walkable neighborhood with a continuous pedestrian circulation
system that links all areas of the development, links the development to other destinations
in the surrounding area and is designed to facilitate a variety of transportation choices by
providing alternatives to automobile travel;
(3) The project takes advantage of compact design through clustering development into a
walkable scale neighborhood and preserving significant open space, and natural features;
and,
(4) The project is consistent with the Taylor Master Plan, furthers the stated goals of the plan
and provides extraordinary benefits to the City.
Section 22.05 Dimensional Requirements
(a) Base Zoning Regulations. All zoning ordinance requirements for the underlying zoning
district shall remain in full force, except as modified under this section.
(b) Regulatory Flexibility. To encourage flexibility and creativity, the planning commission may
recommend the City Council grant specific departures from the requirement of the zoning
ordinance as a part of the approval process. Lot area, width, setback, height and parking
standards may be modified, provided that such modifications result in preservation of open
space, enhanced buffering from adjacent land uses, screening along major streets,
preservation of natural features, pedestrian-oriented development, a more efficient use of land
or improved compatibility with adjacent land uses.
(c) Approval of Modifications. Any regulatory modification shall be approved through a
recommendation by the planning commission stating that the deviation shall result in a higher
quality of development than would be possible using conventional zoning standards.
(d) Table of Modifications. A table shall be provided on the PUD site plan that specifically details
all deviations from the established zoning districts lot area, width, setback, height and parking
standards or other zoning ordinance provisions that would otherwise be applicable to the uses
and development proposed. This specification must include ordinance provisions, from which
deviations are sought, and the reasons and mechanisms to be utilized for the protection of the
public health, safety, and welfare in lieu of the regulations from which deviations are sought.
Only those deviations consistent with the intent of this ordinance and the master plan shall be
considered.
Section 22.06 Open Space
(a) All PUDs shall include common open space located to preserve significant natural features,
central to the residents of the development, along the arterial street frontage, adjacent to
adjoining residential or to connect open spaces throughout the development. Common open
space shall be in locations and configuration to be easily accessible from all parts of the
residential area of the PUD.

(c) The minimum size of open space shall be twenty thousand (20,000) square feet with a
maximum width to depth ratio of 3:1. This standard is intended to ensure open space is
valuable and usable rather than scattered, isolated or remnant lands. The City may waive this
standard for clearly identified pathway corridors between a single row of lots intended to
connect open spaces, if such corridors are determined to be desirable as part of the overall
project layout.
(d) Areas not considered Open Space. Stormwater detention or retention, land under water,
street right of way, parking lots, required setbacks or landscaped areas required in Section
16.02 Landscaping shall not be counted towards meeting common open space.
(e) Protection. The open space or common areas shall be placed under a conservation
easement or otherwise committed by dedication to an association of the residents, and the use
shall be irrevocably dedicated in perpetuity and retained as open space for park, recreation,
conservation or other common uses. The necessary documents will be approved by the City,
recorded by the applicant, with all costs paid by the applicant, prior to the issuance of a building
permit.

Section 24.01 Intent
(a) Within the districts established by this ordinance there exist lots, structures, and uses of land
and characteristics of use which were lawful before the effective date of this ordinance that
would now be prohibited, regulated, or restricted by this ordinance. It is the intent of this
ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until removed, but not to encourage their
survival. It is also the intent to encourage the discontinuance of existing uses that would not be
permitted as new uses under the provisions of this ordinance.
(b) Those uses which cannot be proved conclusively to have legally existed prior to the effective
date of this ordinance are hereby declared illegal uses and shall be subject to enforcement
under the provisions of this ordinance.
(c) Nonconforming uses and structures are declared to be incompatible with the district in which
they are located. Except as may be permitted by this article, a nonconforming use or structure
shall not be permitted to increase its nonconformity.
(d) With an understanding that not all nonconforming uses, buildings or structures are a detriment
to the community or the neighborhood, it is in the public interest to distinguish between
nonconforming uses, buildings or structures which should be eliminated as quickly and those
that may be eliminated over time.

(2) Terms. Members shall be appointed for a term of three (3) years, except that the terms for
the planning commission or City Council members shall be the same as that for their office.
All vacancies for unexpired terms shall be filled for the remainder of the term.

(b) Appeals of Administrative Decisions
(1) The ZBA shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is

administrative official or body in enforcing any provision of this ordinance. Appeals may be
taken by a person aggrieved or by an officer, department, board, or bureau of the state or
City. In order to be aggrieved by a decision of the City, the person or other entity making
the appeal must have a property interest and sufficient standing as recognized under the
law to challenge the decision.
(2) Filing and Hearing of Appeal

1. Was arbitrary or capricious.
2. Was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact.
3. Constituted an abuse of discretion.
4. Was based on erroneous interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance or zoning law.

(c) Interpretation. Upon request of the planning commission, City Council, Development Services
Department, or applicant the ZBA may interpret and clarify the meaning of ordinance text. The
ZBA may also be requested to interpret boundaries of zoning districts where the zoning district
classification can not be clearly discerned on the zoning map or as described in Section 2.03
District Boundaries Interpreted.
Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 26-5
26
(d) Special Land Uses and Planned Unit Developments (PUDs)
(1) The ZBA may grant dimensional or other site plan related variances for special land uses;
however, the ZBA shall not have the power to reverse or modify the planning commissions
decision to approve or deny a special land use permit nor grant variances to any conditions
placed on special land use approval.
(2) The ZBA shall not have the authority to grant variances to the PUD regulations of Article 22
Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) or any requirements placed on PUD approval.
However, the ZBA shall have the authority to hear and decide appeal requests by individual
lot owners for variances from other sections of this ordinance following final approval of the
PUD, provided such variances do not affect the terms or conditions of the original PUD
approval or constitute a variance to the PUD regulations of Article 22 Planned Unit
Developments (PUDs).
(e) Approvals. To hear and decide requests for other decisions that this ordinance specifically
authorizes the ZBA to pass.
(f) Dimensional Variances
(1) The ZBA, after holding a public hearing in accordance with Section 25.09 Public Hearings,
shall have the power to grant requests for dimensional variances from the provisions of this
ordinance where it is proved by the applicant that there are practical difficulties in the way of
carrying out the strict letter of this ordinance relating to the construction, equipment, or
alteration of buildings or structures, or of storm water management requirements so that the
spirit of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety secured and substantial justice
done.
(2) A dimensional variance may be allowed by the ZBA only in cases where the applicant has
shown a practical difficulty in the official record of the hearing. The applicant must prove
that all of the following conditions have been met:
a. Extraordinary Circumstances. There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances
or conditions applying to the property in question that do not apply generally to other
properties in the same zoning district. Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions may include:
1. Exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific property on the
effective date of this ordinance.
2. By reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation on
the land, building or structure.
3. By reason of the use or development of the property immediately adjoining the
property in question; whereby the literal enforcement of the requirements of this
ordinance would involve practical difficulties.
Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)
Page 26-6 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
26
b. Substantial Justice. Compliance with the strict letter of the restrictions governing
area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk, density, or other dimensional provisions would
unreasonably prevent the use of the property. Granting of a requested variance or
appeal would do substantial justice to the applicant as well as to other property owners
in the district and such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in the same
zoning district and in the vicinity. Any variance granted shall be the minimum necessary
to allow the preservation of these substantial property rights. The possibility of
increased financial return shall not of itself be deemed sufficient to warrant a variance.
c. Impact on Surrounding Neighborhood. The variance will not be detrimental to
adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood or interfere with or discourage the
appropriate development, continued use, or value of adjacent properties and the
surrounding neighborhood as compared to other uses in the neighborhood.
d. Public Safety and Welfare. The granting of the variance will not impair an adequate
supply of light and air to adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion in
public streets, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety, comfort,
morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the City.
e. Not Self Created. The immediate practical difficulty causing the need for the variance
request was not self-created by the applicant.
(g) Use Variances
(1) Application Requirements. In addition to the information required for other variance
requests, an application for a use variance shall include a plan drawn to scale detailing the
specific use and improvements proposed by the applicant, and a summary of the facts
which support each of the following conclusions:
a. Applicant's property cannot be used for the purposes permitted in the zoning district;
b. Applicant's plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to his property and not to
general neighborhood conditions;
c. Applicant's suggested use would not alter the essential character of the area;
d. Applicant's problem has not been self-created;
e. Unavailability of administrative relief which may afford reasonable use of applicant's
property.
f. At the end of each statement (a) through (e) above, identify all persons who will testify
at the hearing with respect to each of the facts and, separately, identify all persons who
will testify at the hearing relative to the respective conclusion (and if any person is to be
offered as an expert witness, include with the application a resume which shows the
education and experience of such person within the particular area of expertise).
(2) Use Variance -- Pre-Hearing Conference.
a. Prior to the scheduling of a hearing, the applicant shall contact the Development
Services Department for the purpose of scheduling a pre-hearing conference.
Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 26-7
26
b. The purposes of the pre-hearing conference shall be to:
1. Review the procedure for the hearing and identify all persons who will testify
(directly or through affidavit) and the evidence to be offered on behalf of the
applicant;
2. Attempt to secure a statement of agreed-upon facts to be used to narrow the
matters of dispute and shorten the hearing;
3. Explore a means of providing relief to the applicant by way of non-use variance from
the ZBA, or other relief which may require action by persons or bodies other than
the ZBA which will afford an adequate remedy for the applicant;
4. Discuss the need, desirability, and the terms of providing a verbatim record of the
hearing.
c. The Development Services Department shall determine who should be present at the
pre-hearing conference based upon the application submitted, and taking into
consideration the discussion with the applicant or the applicant's representative.
d. The pre-hearing conference shall be scheduled and conducted on an expeditious basis
so as to avoid unreasonable delay to the applicant. Sufficient time shall be taken,
however, to achieve the purposes of the pre-hearing conference stated above.
(3) Use Variance -- Hearing Procedure.
a. The applicant will have the burden of proof. In order to be entitled to relief, the applicant
must demonstrate each of the five factors in subsection (5) of this section.
b. Manner of Presentation
1. Community representatives shall present an overview of the zoning regulations
involved. This may include an indication of the objectives sought to be achieved in
the zoning district, and any planning, engineering, financial, environmental or other
considerations which are generally relevant within the zoning district and/or in the
general area of the property at issue.
2. The applicant may present witnesses, including the applicant, or may submit
affidavits, for the purpose of attempting to prove facts or conclusions. The applicant
shall be provided with the opportunity to present all testimony and evidence
proposed to be presented at the pre-hearing conference, either through witnesses
or affidavits; however, the chairperson of the ZBA may restrict testimony and
evidence which would result in unreasonable duplication. In addition, by motion
made on its own or at the request of a person at the hearing, the ZBA may require
the presence of any witness who has offered either testimony by affidavit on a
material question of fact or testimony of an expert nature, with the view of permitting
members of the ZBA to ask questions of such witnesses.
3. At the conclusion of the applicant's presentation, interested persons attending the
hearing shall be provided with the opportunity to present testimony and evidence in
the same manner and subject to requiring the presence and questioning of
witnesses, as provided above for the applicant.
Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)
Page 26-8 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
26
c. When interested persons have completed their presentations, at the same meeting
and/or at an adjourned meeting date, testimony and evidence may be presented on
behalf of the community in the same manner, and subject to requiring the presence and
questioning of witnesses, as provided above for the applicant. The purpose of such
presentation shall be to ensure that a full picture, including all relevant information, is
before the ZBA for consideration as it relates to the specific application presented.
d. If testimony or evidence has been offered by or on behalf of interested persons and/or
the community, the applicant shall have the opportunity to make a responsive
presentation, restricted to answering the points raised by interested persons and
community representatives. The manner of presenting witnesses, and requirement of
their presence and questioning, shall be the same as provided above for the applicant's
principal case.
e. At the hearing, the ZBA may determine to establish other rules of procedure, such as
meeting hours on any given day, procedure for presentations by interested persons
and/or on behalf of the community, or other rules found to be necessary or appropriate
by the board. When questions of procedure arise during the hearing, the chairperson of
the ZBA may solicit the recommendation of the representatives of both the applicant
and the community.
f. If a hearing is not completed at a given meeting within the time period allowed by the
ZBA, the board shall adjourn the hearing to a date certain for continuation.
(4) Use Variance -- Decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals
a. The ZBA may deem it appropriate in any given case to provide an opportunity for
anyone presenting testimony or evidence to submit proposed findings of fact and
conclusions.
b. At the conclusion of the hearing, the ZBA may make its decision at that meeting, or it
may adjourn the hearing to a new date for the purpose of reviewing the testimony and
evidence, and reviewing proposed findings and conclusions submitted by hearing
participants, in preparation for making its decision.
c. If the ZBA determines to grant variance relief, it shall be the minimum relief required to
allow reasonable use of the property, while maintaining the essential character of the
area. Such relief may be in the form of one or more non-use variances and/or in the
form of a use variance. The motion may include conditions that are authorized by law.
d. If the ZBA adopts a motion to grant variance relief, such motion may be made as a
tentative grant of relief, subject to review by the planning commission, planning
director/consultant, engineer or other person or official with expertise, with a view of
obtaining recommendations on any conditions that may be relevant and authorized by
law, and for the further purpose of ensuring that the grant of relief would not violate
applicable law. If such a tentative grant of relief is approved, the ZBA shall request the
completion of all reviews by other boards or persons by a specific date, so that relief
may be expeditiously finalized.
(5) Use Variance Standards for Review. A use variance may be allowed by the ZBA only in
cases where the applicant has shown a unnecessary hardship in the official record of the
hearing. The applicant must prove that all of the following conditions have been met:
Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 26-9
26
a. Hardship. The applicant has demonstrated that the site cannot reasonably be used
for any of the uses allowed within the current zoning district designation. The ZBA
may require submission of documentation from professionals or certified experts to
substantiate this finding.
b. Unique Circumstances. That the condition or situation of the specific parcel of
property or the intended use of such property for which the variance is sought is
unique to that property and not commonly present in the general vicinity or in the
zone district. The applicant must prove that there are certain features or conditions
of the land that are not generally applicable throughout the zone and that these
features make it impossible to earn a reasonable return without some adjustment.
Such unique conditions or situations include:
1. Exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific property on the
effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
2. Exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation on the land,
building or structure.
3. The use or development of the property immediately adjoining the property in
question.
4. Any other physical situation on the land, building or structure deemed by the
ZBA to be extraordinary.
c. Character of Neighborhood. The use variance will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or the intent of the comprehensive development plan,
or be a detriment to adjacent properties.
d. Capacity of Roads, Infrastructure and Public Services. The capacity and
operations of public roads, utilities, other facilities and services will not be
significantly compromised.
e. Not Self Created. The immediate practical difficulty causing the need for the
variance request was not self-created by the applicant..
(h) Sign Variance. Any party who has been refused a sign permit for a proposed sign may file an
appeal with the ZBA. In determining whether a variance is appropriate, the ZBA shall study the
sign proposal, giving consideration to any extraordinary circumstances, such as those listed
below, that would cause practical difficulty in complying with the sign standards.
(1) Permitted signage could not be easily seen by passing motorists due to the configuration of
existing buildings, trees, or other obstructions.
(2) Permitted signage could not be seen by passing motorists in sufficient time to permit safe
deceleration and exit.
(3) Existing signs on nearby parcels would substantially reduce the visibility or advertising
impact of a conforming sign on the subject parcel.
(4) Construction of a conforming sign would require removal or severe alteration to natural
features on the parcel, such as removal of trees, alteration of the natural topography, filling
of wetlands, or obstruction of a natural drainage course.
Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)
Page 26-10 City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance
26
(5) Construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the vision of motorists or otherwise
endanger the health or safety of passers-by.
(6) Variance from certain sign regulations would be offset by increased building setback,
increased landscaping, or other such enhancements, so that the net effect is an
improvement in appearance of the parcel, compared to the result that would be otherwise
achieved with construction of a conforming sign.
(7) A sign which exceeds the permitted height or area standards of this ordinance would be
more appropriate in scale because of the large setback of the building.
Section 26.04 Decisions
(a) Voting. A concurring vote of a majority of the members of the ZBA shall be required to decide
any appeal, interpretation, variance or other ZBA decision.
(b) Conditions. In authorizing an action within its authority, the ZBA may attach any conditions
deemed necessary, provided any conditions comply with all of the following standards:
(1) Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety and welfare, as well as the
social and economic well being of those who will use the land use or activity under
consideration, residents and land owners immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or
activity and the community as a whole.
(2) Be related to the valid exercise of the police power and purposes which are affected by the
proposed activity.
(3) Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning regulations; be related to the
standards established in this ordinance for the land use or activity under consideration; and
be necessary to ensure compliance with those standards.
(c) Approval Period
(1) Approval of a dimensional variance by the ZBA shall be valid for a period not longer than
eighteen (18) months, unless a building permit for the construction or alteration is obtained
and construction or alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the
terms of the permit and the requirements of the ZBA.
(2) Any variance may be revoked and declared invalid, following notice and a public hearing, if
any of the requirements of this ordinance or conditions attached to a variance by the ZBA
are not complied with.
Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)
City of Taylor Zoning Ordinance Page 26-11
26
(d) One (1) Year to Rehear Decision. When any application made under the provisions of this
ordinance has been denied by the ZBA, not less than one (1) year must intervene before a new
application of the same tenor, and relating to the same property or proposed use, may be
accepted or acted upon by the Development Services Department or by any other City
employee or authority, unless a positive finding is made by the Development Services
Department that the facts of the case have substantially changed since its previous
consideration.
(e) Reconsideration. The ZBA shall have the authority to rehear a prior decision on its own
motion in instances where new information is presented that could change the findings of fact
used to reach the original decision. Where the ZBA passes a motion to reconsider a decision
based upon the new information provided, it shall set a new public hearing, noticed in the same
manner as required for the original hearing.

structures, improvements, setbacks, landscaping, buffers, design, architecture and other
features.
(3) The conditional rezoning shall not authorize uses or developments of greater intensity or
density, or which are not permitted in the proposed zoning district; nor may a conditional
rezoning agreement permit variations from height, area, setback or similar dimensional
requirements that are less restrictive than the proposed zoning district.
(4) The conditional rezoning may include conditions related to the use and development of the
property that are necessary to:

submitted prior to planning commission making its
recommendation on the rezoning to the City Council.
The conditional rezoning agreement shall be
reviewed by the City attorney, at the expense of the

agreement conforms to the requirements of this
section and the Zoning Act and shall confirm that the

Register of Deeds.
(2) Following the public hearing for a proposed zoning
amendment, the planning commission shall make a
recommendation to the City Council based upon the

In addition, the planning commission shall consider
whether the proposed conditional rezoning
agreement:

b. Bears a reasonable and rational connection or
benefit to the property being proposed for
rezoning.
c. Is necessary to ensure that the property
develops in such a way that protects the
surrounding neighborhood and minimizes any
potential impacts to adjacent properties.
d. Is necessary to allow the rezoning to be
approved, in that the property could not or would
not be rezoned without the proposed conditional
rezoning agreement.
e. Leads to a development that is more compatible
with abutting or surrounding uses than would
have been likely if the property had been
rezoned without a conditional rezoning
agreement, or if the property were left to develop
under the existing zoning classification.
f. Is in the public interest and is consistent with the
recommendations of the master plan.

for approval by the planning commission, the City Council may approve the conditional

above. The conditional rezoning agreement shall be incorporated by attachment or
otherwise as an inseparable part of the ordinance adopted by the City Council to
accomplish the requested rezoning.
(4) If the rezoning and conditional rezoning agreement are approved, the zoning classification
of the rezoned property shall consist of the district to which the property has been rezoned,
and a reference to the conditional rezoning agreement. The zoning map shall specify the
new district, plus the acronym C to indicate that the property is subject to a conditional
rezoning agreement (i.e., R-1A-C). The City clerk shall maintain a listing of all properties
subject to conditional rezoning agreements and shall provide copies of the agreements
upon request.
(5) The approved conditional rezoning agreement shall be recorded with the Wayne County
Register of Deeds.
(6) Any uses proposed as part of a conditional rezoning agreement that would otherwise
require approval of a special land use or site plan approval shall be subject to the
applicable review and approval requirements of Article 19 Site Plan Review and Article 21
Special Land Use Review.
(d) Expiration
(1) The rezoning and conditional rezoning agreement shall expire eighteen (18) months after
adoption of the rezoning and conditional rezoning agreement, unless substantial
construction on the approved development of the property pursuant to building and other
required permits issued by the City commences within the eighteen (18) month period and
proceeds diligently to completion, unless extended by the City Council for good cause.
(2) In the event that substantial construction on the approved development has not
commenced within the aforementioned eighteen (18) months, the conditional rezoning
agreement shall be void and of no effect.
(3) Should the conditional rezoning agreement become void, all development on the property
shall cease, and no further development shall be permitted. Until action satisfactory to the
City is taken to bring the property into compliance with the conditional rezoning agreement,
the City may withhold or, following notice to the applicant and being given an opportunity to
be heard, revoke permits and certificates. This shall be in addition to or in lieu of any other
lawful action to achieve compliance, including rezoning.
(4) Notwithstanding the above, if the property owner applies in writing for an extension of the
conditional rezoning agreement at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date, the City
Council may grant an extension of up to one (1) year where the City Council determines
that the land owner has made diligent effort towards completing the conditions of the
agreement.

(e) Reversion of Zoning. If the rezoning and conditional rezoning agreement becomes void as
outlined above, then the land shall automatically revert back to its original zoning classification
as set forth in the Zoning Act. The Development Service Department will advise the land owner
and/or developer, by registered letter, of the reversion of zoning. The City shall take
affirmative action to rezone the property.
(f) Continuation. Provided that all development and/or use of the property in question is in
compliance with the conditional rezoning agreement, a use or development authorized there
under may continue indefinitely, provided that all terms of the conditional rezoning agreement
continue to be met.
(g) Amendment. The conditional rezoning agreement may be amended by the City Council with
the landowners consent in the same manner as was prescribed for the original rezoning and
conditional rezoning agreement.
(h) Violation of Agreement. Failure to comply with the conditional rezoning agreement at any
time after approval will constitute a breach of the agreement and also a violation of this
ordinance and further use of the property may be subject to legal remedies available to the
City.
(i) Subsequent Rezoning of Land. Nothing in the conditional rezoning agreement, nor any
statement or other provision, shall prohibit the City from later rezoning all or any portion of the
property that is the subject of the conditional rezoning agreement to another zoning
classification. Any rezoning shall be conducted in compliance with this ordinance and the
Zoning Act.
(j) Failure to Offer Conditions. The City shall not require an owner to offer conditions as a
requirement for rezoning. The lack of an offer of conditions shall not affect the owners rights
under this ordinance.
(k) City not Obligated. The City is not required or obligated to accept any or all conditions offered
by a developer on a rezoning application. In no way is an offer of a conditional rezoning
agreement the basis for requiring the City to approve a rezoning application.
