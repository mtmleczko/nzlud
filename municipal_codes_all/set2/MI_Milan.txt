PREFACE 
    Part I of this volume contains the Home Rule Charter of the City. 
    Part II, the City Code, is a complete codification of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the Council. The Code contains all ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole, except zoning ordinances, which are included as an appendix for convenience. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the assessments, vacating streets, making appropriations, etc., are not included herein. For a more complete listing of the types of ordinances not included, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The Chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws and provisions of the Charter have been included. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixteenth section of Chapter 20 is 20-16. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time, new sections may be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added the new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2 and 4-4.3. New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number. Thus, if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12 1/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way, or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof as provided in Section 6 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference. 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which serve as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and John H. Shanks, Jr., Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to the City Administrator, Mr. Allen L. Rushlow, and the City Attorney, Mr. B. A. Simons, for their supervision, cooperation and interest during the progress of the work on this Code. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Milan, Michigan.

    Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, all officers of the City whose duties involve the custody of public property or the handling of public funds, either by way of receipt or disbursement or both, and all other officers and employees so required by the Council shall, before they enter upon the duties of their respective offices, file with the City an official bond in such form and amount as the Council shall direct and approve. Such official bond of every officer and employee shall be conditioned that he will faithfully perform the duties of this office, and will on demand deliver over to his successor in office or other proper officer or an agent of the City, all books, papers, moneys, effects and property belonging thereto, or appertaining to his office, which may be in his custody as an officer or employee; and such bonds may be further conditioned as the Council prescribes.

    All official bonds shall be corporate surety bonds and the premiums thereon shall be paid by the City. All bonds of all officers or employees shall be filed with the Clerk, except that any bond pertaining solely to the Clerk shall be filed with the Treasurer. 
Section 5.15. - Delivery of office. 
    Whenever any officer or employee shall cease to hold such office or employment for any reason whatsoever, he shall within five days or sooner, on demand, deliver to his successor in office or to his superior all the books, papers, moneys, and effects in his custody as such officer or employee.

Section 5.18. - Employees retirement system. 
    The Council may provide by ordinance for an orderly retirement system for the City employees. The objective of the retirement system, if created, shall be for a sound and efficient means of providing retirement allowances for the employees of the City to the end that economy and efficiency in public service may be affected and an ordinary method of retirement be provided without hardship and prejudice to employees who have become super-annuated or incapacitated. The terms and conditions of the ordinance if enacted shall be determined by the Council, provided however, the provisions thereof shall not reduce the benefits and privileges now enjoyed by the municipal employees and the Police and firemen under their respective pension and retirement systems.

Section 9.5. - Attempts to avoid taxation; remedy; treasurer, duties. 
    If the treasurer finds that any person, who is, or may be, liable for taxes upon personal property, the taxable situs of which was in the city on tax day, intends to depart from the city or to remove therefrom personal property, which is, or may be, liable for taxation, or intends to conceal himself or his property, or intends to do any other act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partly ineffectual, the proceedings to collect the tax, unless proceedings therefor cannot be brought without delay, he shall cause notice of his finding to be given such person, together with a demand for the immediate payment of the tax. Thereupon, the tax shall become immediately due and payable and the treasurer shall have and exercise all the powers granted by law to township and city treasurers for the collection thereof. If the exact amount of any such tax has not, at the time of such finding, been determined because the same has not been spread upon the tax roll, the treasurer shall estimate the amount of the tax upon such personal property and the estimate shall be presumed to be the amount of tax upon such property which, together with other taxes which have accrued thereon, shall become payable as hereinabove provided. 
    The tax so estimated by the treasurer shall, upon the giving of the notice herein provided, become a lien upon the property liable for the tax. The lien shall be of the same type and legal effect as the lien upon personal property provided in section 9.15 of this chapter. If the estimate of the treasurer is in excess of the amount of tax spread against such property upon the tax roll, he shall refund the excess upon the demand of the person from whom it was collected or his legal representative. If such person furnishes evidence, satisfactory to the treasurer, by bond or otherwise, that he will duly pay the tax or taxes to which the treasurer's findings relates, then such tax or taxes shall not be payable prior to the time otherwise fixed for payment thereof. 
Section 9.6. - Assessment roll; preparation, notice; assessor, duties. 
    On or before the first Monday in March in each year the assessor shall prepare and certify an assessment roll of all property in the city subject to taxation, and shall file the same in the office of the city clerk for public examinations. It shall be the duty of the city clerk to give notice by publication in one or more of the daily newspapers printed and circulated in the city, by not less than three insertions, the last of which shall be published not less than five days preceding said last mentioned date, that said assessment rolls will be on file in his office subject to public examination, from the first Monday in March until the meeting of the board of review, when they shall be delivered to said board. Such rolls shall be prepared in accordance with statute and this charter. Values shall be estimated according to recognized methods of systematic assessment. The records of the assessor shall show separate figures for the value of the land, of the building improvements and of personal property; and the method of estimating all such values shall be as nearly uniform as possible. 
    On or before the first Monday in March, the assessor shall give by first class mail a notice of any increase over the previous year in the assessed value of any property where such increase does not involve additional construction to the owner as shown by such assessment roll. The failure to give any such notice or of the owner to receive it shall not invalidate any assessment roll or assessment thereon. 
Section 9.7. - Board of review; composition; members; appointment; compensation. 
    The board of review shall be composed of three freeholders who are qualified and registered electors of the city who during their term of office shall not be city officers or employees or be nominees or candidates for elective city office.

One member of the board shall be appointed by the council annually in January, 1968, and each year thereafter for a term of three (3) years, to replace the member whose term expires that year. The council shall fix the compensation of the members of the board. 
    The board of review shall annually in February select its own chairman for the ensuing year, and the assessor shall be clerk of the board and shall be entitled to be heard at its sessions. A majority of the members of the board shall constitute a quorum.

    In each case in which the assessed value of any property is increased over the amount shown on the assessment roll as prepared by the assessor, or any property is added to such roll by the board, or the board has resolved to consider at its second session such increasing of an assessment or the adding of any property to such roll, the assessor shall give notice thereof to the owners as shown by such roll by first class letter mailed no later than the second day following the end of the first session of the board. Such notice shall state the date, time, place and purpose of the second session of the board. The failure to give any such notice or of the owner to receive it shall not invalidate any assessment roll or assessment thereon. 
    The board of review shall convene in its second session on the Tuesday following the third Monday in March of each year at such time of day and place as shall be designated by the council. Provided however, that at least one session thereof shall begin at one (1:00) p.m. and shall continue in session until all interested persons have had an opportunity to be heard, but in no case for less than six hours.

    For the purpose of reviewing and correcting assessments, the board of review shall have the same powers and perform like duties in all respects as are by statute conferred upon and required of boards of review in townships, except as otherwise provided in this charter. It shall hear the complaints of all persons considering themselves aggrieved by assessments, and if it shall appear that any person or property has been wrongfully assessed or omitted from the roll, the board shall correct the roll in such manner as it deems just. In all cases the roll shall be reviewed according to the facts existing on the tax day and no change in the status of any property after said day shall be considered by the board in making its decisions. Except as otherwise provided by statute, no person other than the board of review shall make or authorize any change upon, or additions or corrections to, the assessment roll. It shall be the duty of the assessor to keep a permanent record of all proceedings and to enter therein all resolutions and decisions of the board. 
Section 9.11. - Board of review; assessment roll, endorsement. 
    After the board of review has completed its review of the assessment roll, and not later than the first Monday in April, the majority of its members shall endorse thereon and sign a statement to the effect that the same is the assessment roll of the city for the year in which it has been prepared. The omission of such endorsement shall not affect the validity of such roll. 
Section 9.12. - Clerk; certification of tax levy to assessor. 
    Within three days after the council has adopted the budget for the ensuing year, the clerk shall certify to the assessor the total amount which the council determines shall be raised by general ad valorem tax. He shall also certify all amounts of current or delinquent special assessments and all other amounts which the council requires to be assessed, reassessed or charged upon any property or against any person. 
Section 9.13. - City tax roll; preparation; assessor, duties. 
    After the board of review has completed its review of the assessment roll, the assessor shall prepare a copy of the assessment roll to be known as the "city tax roll", and upon receiving the certification of the several amounts to be raised, as provided in section 9.12, the assessor shall spread upon said tax roll the several amounts determined by the council to be charged, assessed or reassessed against persons or property. He shall also spread the amount of the general ad valorem city tax, county tax and school tax according to and in proportion to the several valuations set forth in said assessment roll. To avoid fractions in computation on any tax roll, the assessor may add to the amount of the several taxes to be raised not more than the amount prescribed by statute. Any excess created thereby on any tax roll shall belong to the city. 
Section 9.14. - Same; delivery to treasurer for collection. 
    After spreading the taxes the assessor shall certify the tax roll, and the mayor shall annex his warrant thereto directing and requiring the treasurer to collect prior to March first of the following year from the several persons named in said tax roll, the several sums mentioned therein opposite their respective names as a tax or assessment and granting to him, for the purpose of collecting the taxes, assessments and charges on such roll all statutory powers and immunities possessed by township treasurers for the collection of taxes. On or before June fifth, the roll shall be delivered to the treasurer for collection. 
Section 9.15. - Taxes; due date; lien on property. 
    On July first, the taxes thus assessed shall become a debt due to the city from the persons to whom they are assessed, and the amounts assessed on any interest in real property shall become a lien upon such real property, for such amounts and for all interest and charges thereon, and all personal taxes shall become a first lien on all personal property of such persons so assessed. Such lien shall take precedence over all other claims, encumbrances and liens to the extent provided by statute and shall continue until such taxes, interest and charges are paid. 
Section 9.16. - Taxes; due date; notice required; failure to give notice; effect. 
    City taxes shall be due on July first of each year. The treasurer shall not be required to call upon the persons named in the city tax roll, nor to make personal demand for the payment of taxes, but he shall: 
(a)  Publish between June fifteenth and July first, notice of the time when said taxes will be due for collection and the penalties and fees for late payment of same; and 
(b)  Mail a bill to each person named in such roll, but in cases of multiple ownership of property only one bill need be mailed. 
    Failure on the part of the treasurer to publish said notice or mail such bills shall not invalidate the taxes on said tax roll, nor release the person or property assessed from the penalties and fees provided in this chapter in case of late payment or non-payment of the same. 
Section 9.17. - Taxes; collection fees. 
    All taxes paid on or before August thirty-first of each year shall be collected by the treasurer without collection fee. On September first he shall add to all taxes paid thereafter a collection fee as the council may determine not to exceed however, four per cent of the amount of said taxes. Such collection fee shall belong to the city and constitute a charge and shall be a lien against the property to which the taxes themselves apply, collectible in the same manner as the taxes to which they are added. 
    It is provided however, that if delivery of the tax roll to the treasurer, as provided in section 9.14 is delayed for any reason by more than thirty days after June 5th, the application of the schedule of collection fees provided herein shall be postponed thirty days for the first thirty days of such delay, and shall be postponed an additional thirty days for each additional thirty days, or major fraction thereof, of such delay. 
Section 9.18. - Personal property tax; failure to pay; seizure, sale, enforcement. 
    If any person, firm or corporation shall neglect or refuse to pay any personal property tax assessed to him or them by October first, the treasurer shall collect the same by seizing the personal property of such person, firm or corporation to an amount sufficient to pay such tax, fees and charges for subsequent sale, wherever the same may be found in the state, and from which seizure no property shall be exempt. He may sell the property seized to an amount sufficient to pay the taxes and all charges in accordance with statutory provisions. The treasurer may, if otherwise unable to collect a tax on personal property, sue, in accordance with statute, the person, firm or corporation to whom it is assessed. 
Section 9.19. - Delinquent taxes; return to county treasurer; enforcement, state law. 
    All city taxes on real property remaining uncollected by the treasurer on the first day of March following the date when said roll was received by him shall be returned to the county treasurer in the manner and with like effect as provided by statute for returns by township treasurers of township, school and county taxes. Such returns shall include all the additional assessments, charges and fees hereinbefore provided, which shall be added to the amount assessed in said tax roll against each property or person. The taxes thus returned shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes returned to the county treasurer are collected, in accordance with statute, and shall be and remain a lien upon the property against which they are assessed until paid. If by change in statute or otherwise, the treasurer of the respective counties is no longer charged with the collection of delinquent real property taxes, such delinquent taxes shall be collected in the manner then provided by statute for the collection of delinquent township, school and county taxes. 
Section 9.20. - State, county, school taxes; state law. 
    For the purpose of assessing and collecting taxes for state, county and school purposes, the city shall be considered the same as a township, and all provisions of statute relative to the collection of and accounting for such taxes shall apply.

Such special assessments or the installments thereof, as the case may be, shall be charged against the owners of the property assessed, according to the records of the assessor's office at the time the special assessment or installment thereof, as the case may be, is due for payment.

Insofar as practicable, considering the nature of the nuisance or hazard, the notice herein required shall be in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail with full postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the address set forth in the current assessment roll of the city or the records of the assessor. Such notice shall be given by the Clerk. If, after diligent and reasonable effort to locate the owner of the premises or his agent, he cannot be found, such notice shall be given to the occupant of the premises, if any, and by posting upon the premises in plain view of all persons going upon or passing near such premises. If, at the expiration of the time limit in said notice, the owner has not complied with the requirements thereof, or in any case where the owner of the land or of the building or structure itself is not known or cannot be found, the Council may order such nuisance or hazard to be abated by the proper department or agency of the city which is qualified to do the work required, or may do the work by contract or by hire, and the cost of such abatement may be assessed against the lot, premises, or description of real property upon which such nuisance or hazard is located, by special assessment.

Section 11.11. - Certain postponements of payments. 
    The Council may provide that any person who, in the opinion of the Assessor and Council, by reason of poverty is unable to contribute toward the cost of the making of a public improvement by special assessment, may execute to the city an instrument creating a lien for the benefit of the city on all or any part of the real property owned by him and benefited by any public improvement, which lien will mature and be effective from and after the execution of such instrument which shall be recorded with the Register of Deeds of either Monroe or Washtenaw County, as the case may be, and shall not be discharged or released until the terms thereof are met in full. In such event, the amount of the assessment for which such lien is created shall be advanced by the City. The Council shall establish the procedure for making this section effective.

In the case of a contract or agreement obligating the city for periodic payments in future fiscal years for the furnishing of a continuing service or the leasing of property, such certification need not cover those payments which will be due in future fiscal years, but this exception shall not apply to a contract for the purchase or construction of a public improvement unless such purchase or construction is being financed by an installment contract under authority of section 10.7. Certification by the purchasing officer of the city shall be endorsed on each contract, agreement or purchase order requiring same or shall be filed as an attachment thereto. 
    No contract or purchase order shall be subdivided for the purpose of circumventing the dollar value limitations contained in this section. 
    No contract shall be amended after the same has been made except upon the authority of the council, provided that the purchasing officer may amend contracts for those purchases and sales made by him under the authority of section 12.1.

If such delinquency shall continue for an additional thirty (30) days, the unpaid original balance and subsequent penalties shall become a lien upon the premises of the individual(s) on whose behalf the fee or charge was incurred, and such individuals shall also be liable for all costs incurred by the city in collecting and attempting to collect all such sums including, without limitation, reasonable attorney fees. On April 1 of each year, each department head shall certify all such unpaid balances and penalties which are delinquent to the city assessor, who shall enter the same upon the next tax roll against the premises to which the permit applied, and such charges and penalties shall be collected and such lien enforced in the same manner as provided for taxes assessed upon such roll. 
(e)  In the event that any check submitted to the city is returned as nonpayable or is otherwise not honored, the person submitting such check shall be liable to the city for a "returned check fee" in the amount specified for such fees in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the city council. 
(f)  Nothing contained in this section, including without limitation provisions for penalties and liens, shall in any way limit the city's remedies with respect to unpaid fees, charges and/or penalties of any type; and the city shall have in addition thereto all other rights available to it at law and in equity.

Sec. 6-132. - Purpose. 
    The city hereby determines that to provide proper police, fire, health, welfare and emergency services, public or private, to residences and businesses, it is necessary to provide for property identification numbers visible from the public roadways adjacent to residences and businesses in the city. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 92-1, § 1, 5-11-92) 
Sec. 6-133. - Definition. 
    Property identification number shall mean the address, when available, or lot number until address is established, which is established for developed property within the city by the city. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 92-1, § 1, 5-11-92) 
Sec. 6-134. - Requirements. 
(a)  All property upon which houses, dwellings, buildings, house trailers, businesses, and other such structures are constructed or located, within the city, shall be considered developed property and shall have property identification numbers which shall be posted on the face and/or other appropriate side of the house, dwelling, business or structure in a manner and location so that such identification numbers are clearly and readily readable to a person of normal vision, from the adjacent roadway. Mobile homes shall have an individual space identification number at least three (3) inches in height on the side of the mobile home facing the access road. The operator of the mobile home park shall be responsible for assigning such numbers. In the event the house, dwelling, mobile home, business or structure is located on the property so that the posted numbers are not clearly readable from the roadway, due to distance or intervening sight barriers such as, but not limited to, shrubbery, terrain features or structures, the identification numbers shall also be posted separate from the main structure (i.e. on a yard light post, entrance gate, driveway marker, mailbox, etc.) in a fashion that is clearly readable from the adjacent roadway. Such additional identification numbers shall be either located centrally between the side boundaries of the property or located immediately adjacent to the driveway(s) providing ingress to the property, and shall be located on the same side of the adjacent roadway as the property it identifies. 
(b)  The property identification number or address shall use numbers not less than three (3) inches in height. In the event the dwelling, mobile home, building, business or structure is located more than ninety (90) feet from the centerline of the traveled portion of the adjacent roadway, the identifying numbers shall be not less than six (6) inches in height, but in any case such numbers shall be of a size sufficiently large so that the numbers are readable from the centerline of the adjacent roadway by a person of normal vision. 
(c)  The color of the numbers shall be in contrast with the immediate background on which they are mounted. 
(d)  In the case of multiple units, either business or residential, it shall be clearly indicated at each entrance the property identification number(s) of those apartments or businesses accessible through such entrance. The purpose of this identification is to facilitate the rapid movement of emergency units to a specific apartment or business unit in apartment buildings or business complexes which have multiple entrances bearing the same number and series of such units that are not accessible except through specific entrance. 
(e)  The occupants of all buildings in the city used for commercial and/or industrial purposes that are connected with or located so close to other buildings as to prevent access between such buildings and which requires a different route of access to the rear than that to the front of the building shall cause the correct business name and street numbers to be placed on the rear entrance door, or immediately adjacent thereto. Such names and numbers shall be not less than three (3) nor more than six (6) inches in height, and may consist of standard manufactured letters and/or numerals. If painted on the building or door such names and numbers shall be applied with standard type numeral and letter stencil.

Thereafter, at each inspection, if not scheduled previously, the next monthly inspection shall be scheduled. 
(2)  Unsecured vacant buildings shall be inspected forthwith pursuant to section 6-191 to determine whether such building or structure is a dangerous building. 
(3)  Unregistered vacant buildings shall be inspected forthwith pursuant to section 6-191 to determine whether such building or structure is a dangerous building and monthly thereafter under section 6-191. 
(4)  Penalty . Any owner or owner's agent that fails to register, fails to schedule, or fails to allow an inspection required by this section shall be responsible for a municipal civil infraction.

If the building department, fire department, police, or fire marshal finds a vacant building to be unsecured for any reason and the owner(s) or other responsible party is unable to be immediately contacted or cannot adequately secure the vacant building within one (1) hour; and where it is determined that it is inappropriate to delay making such vacant building secure; such facts shall be reported to the building official or fire marshal who shall cause the immediate securing of the vacant building. The costs of such immediate securing shall be the responsibility of the owner or party in interest which costs shall be paid within two (2) weeks. The city may choose to deduct such costs from any escrow established pursuant to section 6-174 for such building and/or the city may collect such costs as set forth in section 6-175. 
(Ord. No. 2017-02, § 1, 3-27-17)

Interest, if any, earned on the escrow account shall be retained by the city to reimburse the city for its costs in maintaining the account. The city may deduct from the escrow account its fees for inspections of the vacant buildings, any costs incurred by the city in securing the vacant building, any emergency costs it incurs with regard to the vacant building, and any other costs which it is otherwise authorized by law to deduct. If the vacant building is "regularly occupied" and no longer qualifies as a vacant building, any funds remaining in the escrow account, after all costs are subtracted, shall be returned to the current owner or owner's agent. If the vacant building is not repaired, renovated, and "regularly occupied", and becomes a dangerous building as defined by the city Code, the city may apply the funds in the escrow account toward the repair or demolition of the building or toward such other action as the law allows. 
(1)  For a vacant building that meets all of the following conditions: 1) Presently can be legally "regularly occupied," 2) Is secured and all other necessary safety precautions have been taken, 3) Both the interior and exterior of the building and premises are maintained, and 4) Other than being vacant, complies with this division and all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations, the monthly escrow is waived. 
(2)  A new or existing building or structure undergoing significant construction progress on a continual basis without a triggering event other than remaining a vacant building for twelve (12) months or more shall have the monthly escrow waived. 
(3)  For all other vacant buildings, including buildings also designated as dangerous, the monthly escrow shall be three hundred dollars ($300.00). 
(b)  Sale or transfer . Escrow funds shall not be refunded upon the sale or transfer of a vacant building unless the vacant building is "regularly occupied" and no longer qualifies as a vacant building. Nothing in this provision authorizes the sale or transfer of a vacant building that it is not lawful to otherwise sell or transfer. Persons desiring to be reimbursed for the escrow funds should address that issue with the persons or persons to whom the vacant building is being sold or otherwise transferred. 
(c)  Penalty . Any owner or owner's agent that fails to pay a monthly escrow required by this section shall be responsible for a municipal civil infraction. All municipal civil infraction violations are subject to the enforcement procedures and penalties outlined in Chapter 13 1/4 "Municipal Civil Infractions" and section 1-8 "General Penalty" of this Code. Upon admission or determination of responsibility the violator shall be subject to a civil fine and costs in the amounts specified in the Official Municipal Civil Infraction Fines and Costs Schedule adopted by resolution of the city council. Such fine and costs shall be in addition to any other remedy available to the city under state law and the city Code. Each day in which any violation or infraction referenced in this section shall continue shall be deemed a separate violation or infraction."

Sec. 6-175. - Collection and lien for costs and unpaid escrow. 
    If the owner or owner's agent fails to pay the cost or escrow within thirty (30) days after mailing by the assessor of the notice of the amount of the cost or escrow, the city shall thereupon place the entire sum, plus collection charge as set by resolution of the city council, on the tax rolls as an assessment against the parcel or lot, the assessment to be collected as other taxes are levied and collected. Such charges shall be added to the general city tax roll, and to the total of the taxes levied on such parcel or lot for the same year. The city shall have a lien for the cost incurred by the city to bring the property into conformance with this division, for any unpaid escrow, and for any charges imposed until the amounts have been fully paid. The lien shall not take effect until notice of the lien has been filed or recorded as provided by law. A lien provided for in this section does not have priority over previously filed or recorded liens and encumbrances. The lien shall be collected and treated in the same manner as provided for property tax liens under the General Property Tax Act, Act No. 206 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1893, being MCL 211.1 to 211.157, or the applicable sections of the Milan City Charter and Code.

The requesting party or the cable operator may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.

(a)  After the hearing on the special assessment roll, provided for in section 16-25, the city council by resolution may confirm the same, or may correct it as to any matter appearing therein and confirm it as so corrected, or may refer it back to the city assessor for revision, or may annual it and direct a new roll to be made. No special assessment roll shall be confirmed except with the affirmative vote of at least five (5) members of the city council. If, at or prior to final confirmation of any special assessment roll, more than fifty per cent (50%) of the number of owners of privately owned real property to be assessed thereon, or in the case of paving or similar improvement, more than fifty per cent (50%) of the number of owners of frontage to be assessed thereon, shall object in writing to the proposed improvement, the special assessment roll shall not be confirmed, except in case of sidewalk construction, without a five-sevenths (5/7) vote of the members-elect of the city council. When a special assessment roll shall be confirmed, the city clerk shall endorse thereon the date of confirmation. After such confirmation the special assessment roll and all assessments therein shall be final and conclusive. 
(b)  No work shall be commenced on any public improvement to be financed in whole or in part by special assessment until after confirmation of the special assessment roll therefor, nor shall any confirmation, except for legal, engineering, administrative and other services required for the preparation of the map, drawings, plans, specifications and cost estimate for the improvement and the taking of necessary proceedings, including the making of the special assessment roll, for the levying of the special assessments. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 68-9, §§ 10, 11, 6-24-68) 
Sec. 16-27. - Payment of special assessments. 
(a)  Special assessments may be made payable in one or more installments, as determined by the city council, but such installments may not exceed five (5) in the case of sidewalk improvements, fifteen (15) in the case of paving or similar street improvements, and twenty (20) in the case of water, storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other improvements. The first installment shall be due at such time after confirmation as the city council shall provide and the several subsequent installments shall be due at intervals of twelve (12) months from the due date of the first installment. The amount of each installment (if more than one) need not be extended upon the special assessment roll until after confirmation. All assessments, if payable in more than one installment, shall bear interest after confirmation at a rate as determined by the city council between one-half (1/2) of one per cent (1%) and one per cent (1%) for each month or fraction thereof that the same remain unpaid. Such accrued interest on all unpaid installments shall be due and payable annually on the due dates of the respective installments. Any one or more installments may be paid at any time before due together with accrued interest on such installments. 
(b)  If any installment is not paid when due, then the same shall be deemed to be delinquent, and there shall be collected thereon, in addition to interest as above provided, a collection fee of one per cent (1%) and a penalty of two per cent (2%) of such installment. In case any assessment or any installment thereof shall remain unpaid on the first Monday of May following the date when the same became delinquent, the same shall be reported unpaid by the city treasurer to the city council, and such delinquent assessments, together with all accrued interest, shall be transferred and reassessed on the next annual city tax roll in a column headed "Special Assessments" with a penalty of four per cent (4%) upon such total amount added thereto, and when so transferred and reassessed upon such tax roll, shall be collected in all respects as provided for the collection of city taxes. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 68-9, §§ 12, 13, 6-24-68; Ord. No. C.O. 82-10, § 1, 2-15-83) 
Sec. 16-28. - Lien of city upon property assessed. 
(a)  Special assessments and all interest, charges and penalties thereon, from the date of confirmation of the roll and until paid, shall be and remain a lien upon the property assessed of the same character and effect as the lien created by general law for the state and county taxes and by the city charter for city taxes. 
(b)  No judgment or decree, nor any act of the city council vacating a special assessment shall destroy or impair the lien of the city upon the property assessed, for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the same, or as by a regular mode of proceeding might be lawfully assessed thereon. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 68-9, § 14, 6-24-68) 
Sec. 16-29. - Collection of special assessments. 
(a)  When any special assessment shall be confirmed, the city council shall direct the assessment so made in the special assessment roll to be collected. The assessor shall thereupon deliver to the city treasurer such special assessment roll to which the mayor shall attach his warrant commanding the city treasurer to collect from each of the persons assessed in such roll the amount of money assessed to and set opposite his name therein. Upon receiving such special assessment roll and warrant, the city treasurer shall proceed to collect the several amounts assessed therein. 
(b)  In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien therefor, any delinquent special assessment together with interest and penalties may be collected in an action of assumpsit in the name of the city against the person assessed, in any court having jurisdiction. If in any such action it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant or upon the premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the city, which is a proper charge against the defendant or the premises in question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such defendant or upon such premises. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 68-9, §§ 15, 16, 6-24-68) 
Sec. 16-30. - Procedure when lot or parcel of land is divided after confirmation of special assessment. 
    Should any lot or parcel of land be divided after a special assessment thereon has been confirmed and before the collection thereof, the city council may require the city assessor to apportion the uncollected amounts upon the several parts of such lot or parcel of land. The report of such apportionment when confirmed shall be conclusive upon all parties, provided that before such confirmation, notice of hearing shall be given to all the interested parties by personal service or by publication and mailing as provided in case of an original assessment roll. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 68-9, § 17, 6-24-68) 
Sec. 16-31. - When additional pro rata assessments may be made. 
    Additional pro rata assessments may be made when any special assessment roll proves insufficient to pay for the improvement for which it was levied and the expenses incidental thereto, or insufficient to pay the principal and interest on bonds issued in anticipation of such assessment roll; provided, that the additional pro rata assessment shall not exceed ten per cent (10%) of the assessment as originally confirmed, unless a meeting of the city council be held to review such additional assessment, for which meeting notices shall be published and mailed as provided in the case of review of the original special assessment roll. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 68-9, § 18, 6-24-68) 
Sec. 16-32. - Power of council to make new assessment where original declared invalid or illegal. 
    Whenever any special assessment roll shall, in the opinion of the city council, be invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge such assessment to be illegal, the city council shall, whether the improvement shall have been made or not, or whether any part of the assessment shall have been paid or not, have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for in original assessment except as to corrections in the proceedings required to make the assessment legal. Whenever any sum or part thereof, levied upon any property in the assessment so set aside, has been paid and not refunded, the payment so made shall be applied upon the reassessment. If the payments exceed the amount of the reassessment, refunds shall be made. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 68-9, § 19, 6-24-68) 
Sec. 16-33. - Special assessment account. 
    Moneys raised by special assessments for any public improvement shall be credited to a special assessment account and shall be used to pay for the costs of the improvement for which the assessment was levied and for expenses incidental thereto, to repay any principal and interest on money borrowed therefor, and to refund excessive assessments. The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than the actual cost of the improvement and expense incidental thereto may be placed in the general fund of the city if such excess is five per cent (5%) or less of the assessment, but should the assessment provide larger than necessary by more than five per cent (5%) the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro rata basis to the owners of the property assessed. Such refund shall be made by credit against future unpaid installments to the extent such installments then exist and the balance of such refund shall be in cash. No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured in whole or in part by such special assessment. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 68-9, § 20, 6-24-68) 
Sec. 16-34. - Procedure when expense incurred by city relative to single premises. 
    When any expense shall have been incurred by the city upon or in respect to any single premises, which expense is chargeable against such premises and the owner thereof under the provisions of the charter or any ordinance of the city or law of the state, and is not of that class required to be prorated among the several lots and parcels of land in a special assessment district, an account of the labor, material and service for which such expense was incurred, with a description of the premises upon or in respect to which the expense was incurred, and the name of the owner, if known, shall be reported to the city treasurer, who shall immediately charge and bill the owner, if known. In the event that the city treasurer finds that such amount is not otherwise collectible, he shall report the same to the city council which may direct the city assessor to prepare a special assessment roll covering all such charges reported to it, together with a penalty of ten per cent (10%). Such roll shall be filed with the city clerk, who shall present the same to the city council. Thereafter the same proceedings shall be followed in respect to such special assessment roll as are provided in section 16-24 and subsequent sections of this article and all the provisions of such sections with reference to special assessments generally shall apply to special assessments under this section, insofar as the same may be applicable. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 68-9, § 21, 6-24-68) 
Sec. 16-35. - No lands exempted from assessment; exception. 
    No lands in a special assessment district which are benefited by the improvement therein, shall be exempt from assessment, but if the same are owned by a public or other corporation exempt by law from the payment of special assessments, then the special assessments against such lands, or the installments thereof, may be paid by the city as the same become due or may be paid in advance of their due dates or may be paid by the exempt unit by special agreement. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 68-9, § 22, 6-24-68) 
Sec. 16-36. - City to pay special assessment or installments when property owner unable because of poverty. 
    As authorized in section 11.11 of the city charter, in the event that a lien to secure payment of a special assessment or any one (1) or more installments thereof is created in favor of the city by deed of the addressed property to the city by reason of the finding of the assessor and council that the owner of such property is unable because of poverty to pay such assessment or installments and should be accorded relief therefrom, the obligation of the owner to make such payment shall thereby become the obligation of the city. The city shall pay from its general fund any such assessment or installments, together with interest and penalties, which falls due during the period while the beneficial ownership of such property remains in the grantor of such deed and while the agreement of the city to grant such relief remains in effect. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 68-9, § 23, 6-24-68)

(b)  When expenses for such improvement shall be assessed in a special assessment district and there shall be lands belonging to the city, school buildings or other public buildings or public grounds not taxable fronting upon such improvement, such part of the expense of such improvement as in the opinion of the council making the special assessment will be justly apportionable to such public grounds, buildings and city property, and to any interior squares or spaces formed by the intersection of streets, where they are taxable, shall be paid from such city fund as shall be determined by the council. The balance of such expense shall be assessed upon the taxable lots and premises included in the special assessment district in proportion to their feet frontage upon such improvement. When such assessment is to be made upon lots in proportion to their frontage upon the improvement if from the shape or size of any lot an assessment thereon in proportion to their frontage would be unjust and disproportionate to the assessment upon other lots, the council may assess such lot for such number of feet frontage as in its opinion will be just.

Sec. 24-9. - Water meters. 
(a)  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, all water furnished to any premises connected to the water supply shall be metered as provided in this chapter. Wanton waste of water supply water is strictly prohibited. 
(b)  All meters must be approved by the director of public works or his agent and must be installed and be at all times under the supervision and direction of the director of public works or his agent. Such meters shall be installed so that they can be easily examined and read, and be provided with suitable protection so that they are made safe from frost and other damages. All meters shall at all times be and remain the property of the city. 
(c)  All expenses of installing meters and of protecting them from frost and other damage shall be paid by the customer.

Once a meter is installed, the size of such meter shall not thereafter be changed unless the director of public works determines that such change is appropriate due to a change in the use of the premises to which the meter supplies water and that the change in meter size will not adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of the premises' occupants, the water supply, other customers of the water supply, or other residents of the city. Any request for change of meter size shall be made in writing and be accompanied by documentation of an engineer's review of the new use requirements an such engineer's recommendation as to new meter size. All costs of the review of such request by the director of public works or his designee, including the costs of any consultants to the director of public works, and all costs of any subsequently approved change in meter size, shall be borne exclusively by the customer who requested such change.

By not later than January 1, 2000, and at all times thereafter, each water meter within the city shall have in place a separate outdoor shut-off device meeting the requirements of this subsection. After January 1, 2000, any premises for which multiple water meters have been installed, but for each of which meters there is not installed a separate outdoor shutoff device meeting the requirements of this subsection, shall have all water and sewer furnished to such premises calculated and billed to the property owner. This provision does not apply to residential landscape meters.

Sec. 24-39. - Security for bonds.

Upon deposit of cash or sufficient government obligations, as provided in the previous sentence, the statutory lien shall be terminated with respect to that series of bonds, the holders of that series shall have no further rights under this article except for payment from the deposited funds, and the bonds of that series shall no longer be considered to be outstanding under this article.

The statutory lien upon the net revenues, however, shall not be construed as to compel the sale of the system or any part thereof. 
    If there is a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on the bonds, any court having jurisdiction in any proper action may appoint a receiver to administer and operate the system on behalf of the city and under the direction of the court, and by and with the approval of the court to perform all of the duties of the officers of the city more particularly set forth herein and in Act 94. 
    The holder or holders of the bonds shall have all other rights and remedies given by Act 94 and law, for the payment and enforcement of the bonds and the security therefor.

Sec. 24-42. - Management; fiscal year.

Sec. 24-43. - Rates and charges; pledge of operating support revenues to operating costs. 
    The rates and charges for service furnished by and the use of the system and the methods of collection and enforcement of the collection of the rates shall be those in effect on the effective date of this article. The city hereby pledges the operating support revenues for payment of those operating costs of the system related to payment of the county contracts. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 96-2, § 3, 4-8-96) 
Sec. 24-44. - No free service or use. 
    No free service or use of the system, or service or use of the system at less than cost, shall be furnished by the system to any person, firm or corporation, public or private, or to any public agency or instrumentality, including the city. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 96-2, § 3, 4-8-96) 
Sec. 24-45. - Fixing and revising rates; rate covenant. 
    The rates in effect as of the effective date of this article, together with the amounts pledged to operating costs under section 24-43 of this article, are estimated to be sufficient to provide for the payment of the expenses of administration and operation and such expenses for maintenance of the system as are necessary to preserve the system in good repair and working order, to provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds as the same become due and payable, and the maintenance of any required reserve therefor and to provide for all other obligations, expenditures and funds for the system required by law and this article. The city hereby covenants and agrees to budget annually and fix the rates for service so as to produce net revenues annually in an amount equal to one and one-quarter (1.25) times principal and interest coming due on the bonds and any additional bonds in that annual period. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 96-2, § 3, 4-8-96) 
Sec. 24-46. - Funds and accounts; flow of funds. 
    All moneys belonging to the system and all revenues of the system shall be set aside as collected and credited to a fund to be designated "Water Supply and Sewage Disposal System Receiving Fund" (the "receiving fund"). The revenues credited to the receiving fund are pledged for the purpose of the following funds and shall be transferred or debited from the receiving fund periodically in the manner and at the times and in the order of priority hereinafter specified: 
(1)  Operation and maintenance fund. Out of the revenues and other moneys credited to the receiving fund there shall be first set aside in, or credited to, a fund designated "Operation and Maintenance Fund" (the "operation and maintenance fund"), monthly a sum sufficient to provide for the payment of the next month's expenses of administration and operation of the system and such current expenses for the maintenance thereof as may be necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order. 
A budget, showing in detail the estimated costs of administration, operation and maintenance of the system for the next ensuing operating year, including any moneys necessary to pay the city's obligations under the county contracts shall be prepared by the city council at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of each ensuing operating year. No payments shall be made to the city from moneys credited to the operation and maintenance fund except for services directly rendered to the system by the city or its personnel. 
(2)  Bond and interest redemption fund. There shall be established and maintained a separate depositary fund designated "Bond and Interest Redemption Fund" (the "redemption fund"), the moneys on deposit therein from time to time to be used solely for the purpose of paying the principal of, redemption premiums (if any) and interest on the bonds. The moneys in the redemption fund (including the bond reserve account) shall be kept on deposit with the bank or trust company where the principal of and interest on the bonds, or any series thereof, are payable. 
Out of the revenues remaining in the receiving fund, after provision for the operation and maintenance fund, there shall be set aside each month commencing the first day of the calendar month following delivery of the bonds or any additional bonds in the redemption fund a sum proportionately sufficient to provide for the payment when due of the current principal of and interest on the bonds, less any amount in the redemption fund representing accrued interest on the bonds or investment income on amounts on deposit in the redemption fund (including investment income on amounts held as part of the bond reserve account). If there is any deficiency in the amount previously set aside, that deficiency shall be added to the next succeeding monthly requirements. The amount to be set aside for the payment of principal and interest on any date shall not exceed the amount which, when added to the money on deposit in the redemption fund, including investment income thereon and on the bond reserve account, is necessary to pay principal and interest due on the bonds on the next succeeding July 1. 
There is established a separate account in the redemption fund to be known as the "Bond Reserve Account" (the "bond reserve account"). To the extent reasonably required for the bonds or any additional bonds there shall be deposited in the bond reserve account an amount determined at the time of the sale of the bonds or the issuance of the additional bonds each fiscal year until the "reserve amount" has been achieved. The reserve amount shall be the lesser of (1) the maximum annual debt service due in the current or any future year, (2) one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the average annual debt service or (3) ten (10) percent of the principal amount of the bonds. Interest on the bond reserve account must be transferred into the redemption fund once the reserve amount has been reached. 
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the moneys credited to the bond reserve account shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of, redemption premiums (if any) and interest on the bonds as to which there would otherwise be a default. If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys credited to the bond reserve account for such payment, then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the net revenues first received thereafter which are not required for current principal and interest requirements until the amount on deposit equals the reserve amount. If additional bonds are issued, each ordinance authorizing the additional bonds shall provide for additional deposits to the bond reserve account to be made from the proceeds of the additional bonds or city funds on hand and legally available for such use in an amount that will result in the bond reserve account being equal to the maximum annual principal and interest requirements on the bonds outstanding after issuance of the additional bonds, or such lesser amount as may be necessary to maintain the tax-exempt status of the bonds. If on any July 1 the amount in the bond reserve account exceeds the reserve amount, the excess shall be transferred to the redemption fund for payment of principal and interest on the bonds due on that date. 
(3)  Replacement fund. There shall next be established and maintained a fund, separate depositary account, designated "Replacement Fund" (the "replacement fund"), the money credited thereto to be used solely for the purpose of making repairs and replacements to the system. Out of the revenues and moneys of the system remaining in the receiving fund each month after provision has been made for the deposit of moneys in the operation and maintenance fund and the redemption fund (including the bond reserve account), there may be deposited in the replacement fund such additional funds as the city council board may deem advisable. If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys in the replacement fund for the purpose for which the replacement fund was established, the moneys so used shall be replaced from any moneys in the receiving fund which are not required by this article to be used for the operation and maintenance fund or the redemption fund (including the bond reserve account). 
(4)  Improvement fund. Out of the remaining revenues in the receiving fund, after meeting the requirements of the operation and maintenance fund, the redemption fund (including the bond reserve account) and the replacement fund, there may be next set aside in or credited to a fund to be designated "Improvement Fund" (the "improvement fund"), which improvement fund may have several subaccounts therein, such sums monthly as the city may deem advisable to be used for additions, improvements, enlargements or extensions to the system, including the planning thereof, and including specifically the county improvements. To the extent necessary to pay any portion of the county contracts, the city shall transfer from the city's general fund to the improvement fund money sufficient each year to pay those portions of the county contracts not paid from revenues transferred into the improvement fund. 
(5)  Surplus moneys. Thereafter, any revenues in the receiving fund, after satisfying all the foregoing requirements of this section may, at the discretion of the city, be used for any of the following purposes: 
a.  Transferred to the replacement fund, the improvement fund, or both. 
b.  Any other use related to the system permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 96-2, § 3, 4-8-96) 
Sec. 24-47. - Priority of funds. 
    In the event the moneys in the receiving fund are insufficient to provide for the current requirements of the operation and maintenance fund or the redemption fund, any moneys or securities in other funds of the system, except the proceeds of sale of the bonds, shall be credited or transferred first to the operation and maintenance fund and second to the redemption fund. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 96-2, § 3, 4-8-96) 
Sec. 24-48. - Depositary and funds on hand. 
    Moneys in the several funds and the accounts established pursuant to this article, except moneys in the redemption fund (including the bond reserve account) and moneys derived from the proceeds of sale of the bonds, may be kept in one or more bank accounts at a bank or banks designated by resolution of the city, and if kept in one (1) bank account the moneys shall be allocated on the books and records of the city in the manner and at the times provided in this article. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 96-2, § 3, 4-8-96) 
Sec. 24-49. - Investments. 
    Moneys in the funds and accounts established herein and moneys derived from the proceeds of sale of the bonds may be invested by the city council in government obligations and other investments permitted under Act 94. Investment of moneys in the redemption fund being accumulated for payment of the next maturing principal or interest payment on the bonds shall be limited to government obligations bearing maturity dates prior to the date of the next maturing principal or interest payment on the bonds. Investment of moneys in the bond reserve account, if any, shall be limited to government obligations bearing maturity dates, or subject to redemption at the option of the holder thereof, not later than five (5) years from the date of the investment. Securities representing investments shall be kept on deposit with the depository bank. Profit realized or interest income earned on investment of funds in the redemption fund and at any time after it is fully funded, the bond reserve account, shall be deposited in or credited to the receiving fund. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 96-2, § 3, 4-8-96) 
Sec. 24-50. - Covenants. 
    The city covenants and agrees with the holders of the bonds that so long as any of the bonds remain outstanding and unpaid as to either principal or interest: 
(1)  The city will maintain the system in good repair and working order and will operate the same efficiently and will faithfully and punctually perform all duties with reference to the system required by the constitution and laws of the State of Michigan, and this article. 
(2)  The city will keep proper books of record and account separate from all other records and accounts of the city, in which shall be made full and correct entries of all transactions relating to the system. The city shall have an annual audit of the books of record and account of the system for the preceding operating year made each year by an independent certified public accountant. The auditor shall comment on the manner in which the city is complying with the requirements of the article with respect to setting aside and investing moneys, meeting the requirements for acquiring and maintaining insurance, and meeting the rate covenant set forth in this article. The audit shall be completed and so made available not later than four (4) months after the close of each operating year. 
(3)  The city will maintain and carry, for the benefit of the holders of the bonds, insurance on all physical properties of the system and liability insurance of the kinds and in the amounts normally carried by municipalities engaged in the operation of water supply systems, including self-insurance. All moneys received for losses under any such insurance policies shall be applied solely to the replacement and restoration of the property damaged or destroyed, and to the extent not so used, shall be used for the purpose of redeeming or purchasing bonds. 
(4)  The city will not sell, lease or dispose of the system, or any substantial part, until all of the bonds have been paid in full, both as to principal and interest or provision made thereof as herein provided. The city will operate the system as economically as possible, will make all repairs and replacements necessary to keep the system in good repair and working order, and will not do or suffer to be done any act which would affect the system in such a way as to have a material adverse effect on the security for the bonds. 
(5)  The city will not grant any franchise or other rights to any person, firm or corporation to operate a system that will compete with the system and the city will not operate a system that will compete with the system. 
(6)  The city will cause the project to be acquired and constructed promptly and in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor. 
(Ord. No. C.O. 96-2, § 3, 4-8-96) 
Sec. 24-51. - Additional bonds. 
    Except as hereinafter provided, the city shall not issue additional bonds of equal or prior standing with the bonds. 
    The right is reserved in accordance with the provisions of Act 94 to issue additional bonds payable from the revenues of the system which shall be of equal standing and priority of lien on the net revenues of the system with the bonds but only for the following purposes and under the following terms and conditions: 
(1)  To complete the project in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor. Additional bonds shall not be authorized for this purpose unless the engineers in charge of construction shall execute a certificate evidencing the fact that additional funds are needed to complete the project in accordance with the plans and specifications therefor and stating the amount that will be required to complete the project. If such certificate shall be so executed and filed with the city, it shall be the duty of the city to provide for and issue additional revenue bonds in the amount stated in said certificate to be necessary to complete the project in accordance with the plans and specifications plus an amount necessary to issue such bonds or to provide for part or all of such amount from other sources. 
(2)  For subsequent repairs, extensions, enlargements and improvements to the system or for the purpose of refunding part of any bonds then outstanding and paying costs of issuing such additional bonds including deposits which may be required to be made to the bond reserve account. Bonds for such purposes shall not be issued pursuant to this subparagraph (2) unless the adjusted net revenues of the system for the then last two (2) preceding twelve-month operating years or the adjusted net revenues for the last preceding twelve-month operating year, if the same shall be lower than the average, shall be equal to at least one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the maximum amount of principal and interest thereafter maturing in any operating year on the then outstanding bonds and on the additional bonds then being issued. If the additional bonds are to be issued in whole or in part for refunding outstanding bonds, the annual principal and interest requirements shall be determined by deducting from the principal and interest requirements for each operating year the annual principal and interest requirements of any bonds to be refunded from the proceeds of the additional bonds. For purposes of this subparagraph (2) the city may elect to use as the last preceding operating year any operating year ending not more than sixteen (16) months prior to the date of delivery of the additional bonds and as the next to the last preceding operating year, any operating year ending not more than twenty-eight (28) months prior to the date of delivery of the additional bonds. Determination by the city as to existence of conditions permitting the issuance of additional bonds shall be conclusive. No additional bonds of equal standing as to the net revenues of the system shall be issued pursuant to the authorization contained in this subparagraph if the city shall then be in default in making its required payments to the operation and maintenance fund or the redemption fund. 
(3)  For refunding a part of the outstanding bonds and paying costs of issuing such additional bonds including deposits which may be required to be made to the bond reserve account.

Sec. 24-56. - Water furnished to premises connected to the water supply system to be measured by meter; rates. 
(a)  All water furnished to any premises connected to the water supply shall, except as otherwise herein provided, be measured by a meter installed and controlled by the city. 
(b)  All meters within the city shall be read quarterly (with the exception of those outlined in paragraph (c)) on or about the first of the month. A meter reading schedule shall be maintained by the director of public works. The schedule will show the reading months for each of three (3) different routes. The reading dates of the routes will be staggered so that one-third ( 1/3 ) of the meters are read during each billing period. Charges for water furnished, as shown by such meter readings, shall be made and billed quarterly at the rate specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council. 
(c)  If the average quarterly consumption exceeds one million five hundred thousand (1,500,000) gallons, meters shall be read on or about the first of each month, and charges for water furnished, as shown by such meter readings, shall be made and billed monthly at the rate specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council. 
(d)  Subject to the provisions of subsection 24-9(j) of this chapter, in the case of premises which are served by more than one meter, the rates specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council shall apply to water furnished through each meter on such premises. 
(e)  Persons or entities other than the city who wish to receive temporary water service to premises not equipped with a water meter, including temporary and/or one-time service through city-owned fire hydrants, but excluding those circumstances covered by subsection (g) below, shall make an application for such service to the director of public works. The director of public works shall approve such service applications only when consistent with public safety, and all service so provided will be temporary and only for non-potable supply. The charges for such service shall be based upon the rates specified for such service and the use of a hydrant meter. The water consumption will be charged based upon the rates in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council. The applicant shall pay to the city, prior to commencement of the requested and approved service, an amount equal to the sum of one month's charge for the water plus the turn-on fee specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council. 
(f)  In the case of premises outside of the city limits, the rates specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council for premises of the same type and category within the city shall apply, but shall be doubled.

Provided, however, that upon the expiration of such six-month period, or occupancy of the premises, whichever occurs first, a meter shall be installed and all future water supplied to the premises shall be furnished through such meter and billed for in accordance with subsection (b) or (c) hereof, whichever is applicable. 
(h)  All fire service lines monitored through the use of a fire service meter or a "detector check" system (metered bypass) shall be monitored through a quarterly meter reading. The changes for such monitoring shall be made and billed quarterly at the rate specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council. In the event that such monitoring determines that water from the fire service line was used other than for either testing of the fire suppression system, approved in accordance with section 24-9, or the result of system activation due to an actual fire, the customer shall be billed therefor at the penalty rate specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council. 
(i)  All fire service lines which are not monitored through the use of a fire service meter or a "detector check" system (metered bypass) shall be visually inspected quarterly by the director of public works or his designee. The changes for such inspection shall be made and billed quarterly at the rate specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council.

Sec. 24-57. - Sewage disposal service rates. 
(a)  All premises connected to the sewage disposal system shall be charged and billed on the same periodical basis as for water service (i.e., quarterly or monthly). The quantitative basis for such billing shall be the actual water consumption for the quarter billed, except that in the case of premises billed monthly, actual water consumption during the month for which billing is made shall be the quantitative basis. This excludes the approved use of a landscape meter for which sewer charges are not billed. 
(b)  In the case of premises within the city, the minimum sewage disposal system charges and quantities allowed therefor shall be those specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council. 
(c)  Subject to subsection 24-9(j) of this chapter in the case of premises which are served by more than one meter, the charges for sewage disposal service specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council shall be based on consumption registered by each meter. 
(d)  In the case of premises not owned by the city and not served by metered city water, but excluding those circumstances covered by subsection (g) below, sewage disposal service charges shall be fixed by the director of public works, in conformity with the rates specified for such service in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council; provided, however, that persons or entities other than the city who wish to receive temporary sewage disposal service to premises not equipped with a water meter shall make an application for such service to the director of public works in the same manner as is specified in subsection 24-56(e) of this chapter for temporary water service, and the approval of such service shall be subject to the same process as is specified in subsection 24-56(e) of this chapter. If the application is approved, the applicant shall pay to the city, prior to commencement of the requested and approved service, an amount equal to the sum of one month's charge for such service. In the case of nonmetered premises owned or occupied by the city, the city shall pay for sewage disposal service the fixed quarterly charge specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council. 
(e)  If the character of the sewage from any building or premises is such that it imposes, in the judgment of the director of public works, an unreasonable additional burden upon the sewage disposal system, then an additional charge shall be made by the director of public works over and above the regular rates specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council or, in lieu thereof, the director may require that such sewage be treated by the party or parties responsible therefor before being emptied into any public drain or sewer, or the right to so empty such sewage may be denied if necessary for the protection of the sewage disposal system or the public health or safety. 
(f)  In the case of premises outside of the city limits, the rates for sewage disposal service shall be double those specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council for premises of the same type and category within the city. 
(g)  In the case of premises to which water is furnished for the use of a contractor or other individual during construction of a structure thereon, a minimum charge, as specified in the official fee schedule adopted by resolution of the Milan City Council, shall be assessed in conjunction with the approval of the water and sewer tap permit for sewage disposal at such premises during the initial six (6) months or any portion thereof. Provided, however, that upon the expiration of such six-month period, or occupancy of the premises, whichever occurs first, a water meter shall be installed and thereafter, all sewage disposal service shall be billed for in accordance with subsection (b) or (c) of this section, whichever is applicable.

    The Series 2011 Bond is expected to be delivered to the government as initial purchaser thereof in installments (the "delivery installments") and each delivery installment shall be noted on the registration grid set forth on the applicable Series 2011 Bond. The delivery installments shall be deemed to correspond to the serial principal installments of the applicable Series 2011 Bond in direct chronological order of said serial principal installments. 
    The serial principal installments of the Series 2011 Bond will each bear interest from the date of delivery of the corresponding delivery installment to the registered holder thereof as shown on the registration grid set forth on the Series 2011 Bond at the rate of not to exceed four and one-quarter (4.25) percent per annum, payable on the first February 1 or August 1 following the date of delivery of said delivery installment, and semiannually thereafter on February 1 and August 1 of each year until maturity or earlier prepayment of said installment.

The Series 2011 Bond shall be issued in fully-registered form and such Series 2011 Bond shall not be convertible or exchangeable into more than one (1) fully-registered bond. 
    The Series 2011 Bond or installments thereof will be subject to prepayment prior to maturity in whole or in part at any time on or after the payment date of the first installment of principal of the Series 2011 Bonds in the manner provided in the form of the Series 2011 Bond set forth in subsection (9) of this section.

Whenever any bond or junior lien bond shall be surrendered for transfer, the transfer agent shall record such transfer on the registration books and shall register such transfer on the registration grid attached to the bond or junior lien bond. At the time of such transfer the transfer agent shall note on the bond or junior lien bond the outstanding principal amount thereof at the time of such transfer. The transfer agent shall require the payment by the bondholder requesting the transfer of any tax or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to the transfer. The issuer shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of, or exchange any bond or junior lien bond during a period beginning at the opening of business fifteen (15) days before the day of the mailing of a notice of prepayment of the bond or junior lien bond or installments thereof selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of that mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange the bond or junior lien bond or portion thereof so selected for prepayment. In the event the bond or junior lien bond is called for prepayment in part, the transfer agent upon surrender of the bond or junior lien bond shall note on the bond the principal amount prepaid and shall return the bond or junior lien bond to the registered owner thereof together with the prepayment amount on the prepayment date. 
    The issuer's treasurer is hereby appointed to act as transfer agent with respect to the Series 2011 Bond. If and at such time the Series 2011 Bond is transferred to or held by any registered owner other than the government, the issuer by resolution may appoint a bank or trust company qualified under Michigan law to act as transfer agent and bond registrar with respect to the Series 2011 Bond, and the issuer may thereafter appoint a successor transfer agent upon sixty (60) days notice to the registered owner of the Series 2011 Bond.

Such date of determination of the registered owner for purposes of payment of principal or interest may be changed by the issuer to conform to future market practice. The issuer's treasurer is hereby authorized to execute an agreement with any successor transfer agent. 
    The transfer agent shall record on the registration books the payment by the issuer of each installment of principal or interest or both on the Series 2011 Bond when made and the canceled checks or drafts representing such payments shall be returned to and retained by the issuer's treasurer, which canceled checks or drafts shall be conclusive evidence of such payments and the obligation of the issuer with respect to such payments shall be discharged to the extent of such payments. 
    Upon payment by the issuer of all outstanding principal of and interest on the Series 2011 Bond, the registered owners thereof shall deliver the Series 2011 Bond to the issuer for cancellation.

The Series 2011 Bond shall be manually signed by the mayor and countersigned by the city clerk and shall have the corporate seal of the issuer impressed thereon. After execution, the Series 2011 Bond shall be held by the issuer's treasurer for delivery to the government. The Series 2011 Bond nor any installment thereof shall be valid until registered by the issuer's treasurer or by another person designated in writing by the issuer's treasurer to act as bond registrar, or upon transfer by the government and thereafter, by an authorized representative of the transfer agent.

The Issuer has reserved the right to issue such additional bonds which shall be superior and senior in all respects to this bond as to the Net Revenues. 
    Purchasers of this bond, by their acceptance of the bond or a beneficial ownership interest therein, shall be deemed to have consented to the subordination of their interest in and lien upon the Net Revenues upon the issuance of additional bonds subsequent to the delivery of this bond. 
    This bond is a single, fully-registered, non-convertible bond constituting an issue in the total aggregate principal sum of $2,386,000, issued pursuant to Ordinance 2011-05 (the "Ordinance"), and under and in full compliance with the Constitution and statutes of the State of Michigan, including specifically Act 94, Public Acts of Michigan, 1933, as amended, for the purpose of paying part of the cost of the acquisition, construction, furnishing and equipping improvements to the Issuer's water supply system, together with all necessary interests in land, appurtenances and attachments thereto.

The principal of and interest on the bond is secured by the statutory lien hereinbefore mentioned. 
    Principal installments of this bond are subject to prepayment prior to maturity, in inverse chronological order, at the Issuer's option, on any date on or after August 1, 2012, at par and accrued interest to the date fixed for prepayment. 
    Thirty days notice of the call of any principal installments for prepayment shall be given by mail to the registered owner at the registered address.

Such transfer shall be noted hereon and upon the books of the issuer kept for that purpose by the Transfer Agent.

(10)  Security for bond. Any senior lien bonds hereafter issued and the interest thereon shall be payable solely from the net revenues, and to secure such payment, there is hereby created a statutory lien upon the whole of the net revenues which shall be a first lien to continue until payment in full of the principal of and interest on all senior lien bonds payable from the net revenues, or, until sufficient cash or sufficient government obligations have been deposited in trust for payment in full of all senior lien bonds of a series then outstanding, principal and interest on such senior lien bonds to maturity, or, if called for redemption, to the date fixed for redemption together with the amount of the redemption premium, if any. 
    Any junior lien bonds issued hereunder, including the Series 2011 Bond, and the interest thereon shall be payable primarily from the net revenues, and to secure such payment, there is hereby created a statutory lien upon the whole of the net revenues which shall be a second lien, subject only to the statutory first lien established with respect to the senior lien bonds, to continue until payment in full of the principal of and interest on all junior lien bonds payable from the net revenues, or, until sufficient cash or sufficient government obligations have been deposited in trust for payment in full of all junior lien bonds of a series then outstanding, principal and interest on such junior lien bonds to maturity, or, if called for redemption, to the date fixed for redemption together with the amount of the redemption premium, if any. The statutory lien on the net revenues created with respect to the junior lien bonds (including the Series 2011 Bond) shall at all times be and remain subordinate and inferior to the pledge of net revenues and the statutory first lien thereon authorized to be granted to secure any senior lien bonds hereafter issued, and the junior lien bonds shall carry a legend to that effect. 
(11)  Budget. Immediately upon the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives for the remainder of the current fiscal year, and thereafter prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, the issuer shall prepare an annual budget for the system for the ensuing fiscal year itemized on the basis of monthly requirements. A copy of such budget shall be mailed to the government without request from the government for review prior to adoption (as long as the government is the registered owner of the bond), and upon written request to any other registered owners of the bond. 
(12)  Custodian of funds; funds. The issuer's treasurer shall be custodian of all funds belonging to or associated with the system and such funds shall be deposited in the depository bank. The issuer's treasurer shall execute a fidelity bond with a surety company in an amount at least equal to the maximum annual debt service for the Series 2011 Bond. 
    The issuer's treasurer is hereby directed to create and maintain a Water Supply System Fund, with the following accounts, into which the proceeds of the Series 2011 Bond and the revenues from the system shall be deposited in the manner and at the times provided in this section, which accounts shall be established and maintained, except as otherwise provided, so long as the Series 2011 Bond remains unpaid. 
(A)  Construction Account. The proceeds of the Series 2011 Bond hereby authorized, and no other funds, shall be deposited in the 2011 Water Supply System Construction Account (the "construction account"), in the depository bank. Moneys in the construction account shall be used solely for the purposes for which the Series 2011 Bond is issued. If monies other than proceeds of the Series 2011 Bond are deposited into the construction account, then the monies constituting proceeds of the Series 2011 Bond shall be accounted separately from such other funds or monies. 
Any unexpended balance of the proceeds of sale of the Series 2011 Bond remaining after completion of the project herein authorized may in the discretion of the issuer be used for further improvements, enlargements and extensions to the system, provided that at the time of such expenditure such use be approved by the department of treasury (if such approval is then required by law). Any remaining balance after such expenditure shall be paid into the junior lien bond and interest redemption account and used as soon as is practical for the prepayment of installments of the Series 2011 Bond or for the purchase of installments to the Series 2011 Bond at not more than the fair market value thereof. Following completion of the project, any unexpended balance of the Series 2011 Bond shall be invested at a yield not to exceed the yield on the Series 2011 Bond. 
After completion of the project and disposition of remaining proceeds, if any, of the Series 2011 Bond pursuant to the provisions of this section, the construction account shall be closed. 
(B)  Water Supply System Receiving Account. Upon and after the effective date of this section, the revenues of the system shall be set aside into a separate account to be designated the Water Supply System Receiving Account (the "receiving account"), and moneys so deposited therein shall be transferred, expended and used only in the manner and order as follows: 
(1)  Operation and maintenance account. There is hereby established a separate account to be designated the Operation and Maintenance Account (the "operation and maintenance account"). Revenues shall be transferred each quarter of the fiscal year, commencing upon the effective date of this section, from the receiving account to the operation and maintenance account to pay the reasonable and necessary current expenses of administration and operating and maintaining the system for the ensuing quarter. 
(2)  Bond and interest redemption account (senior lien bonds). There is hereby established a separate account to be designated as the Senior Lien Bond and Interest Redemption Account (the "senior lien bond and interest redemption account"), the moneys on deposit therein from time to time used solely for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest on any senior lien bonds. After the transfer required in (1) above, revenues shall be transferred each quarter of the fiscal year from the receiving account, before any other expenditures or transfer therefrom, and deposited in the senior lien bond and interest redemption account for payment of principal of and interest on any senior lien bonds and to fund the bond reserve account, if any, required upon the issuance of senior lien bonds. 
(3)  Bond and interest redemption account (junior lien bonds). There is hereby established a separate account to be designated as the Junior Lien Bond and Interest Redemption Account (the "junior lien bond and interest redemption account"), the moneys on deposit therein from time to time used solely for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest on junior lien bonds, including the Series 2011 Bond. After the transfer required in (1) and (2) above, revenues shall be transferred each quarter of the fiscal year from the receiving account, before any other expenditures or transfer therefrom, and deposited in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account for payment of principal of and interest on the junior lien bonds, including the Series 2011 Bond and to fund the bond reserve account, in the amounts and at the times specified below. 
Upon any delivery of an installment of the Series 2011 Bond there shall be set aside at the time of delivery and on the first day of each quarter of the fiscal year thereafter to the next interest payment date an amount equal to that fraction of the amount of interest due on the next interest payment date on said installment so delivered, the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is the number of full and partial fiscal year quarters from the date of said delivery to the next interest payment date. There also shall be set aside each fiscal year quarter on or after the delivery of the first principal installment an amount not less than one-half (1/2) of the amount of interest due on the next interest payment date on all outstanding installments of the Series 2011 Bond not delivered during the then current interest payment period. 
Commencing twelve (12) calendar months preceding the date on which the first principal installment payment on the Series 2011 Bond is due, upon any delivery of an installment of the Series 2011 Bond there shall be set aside at the time of such delivery and on the first day of each quarter of the fiscal year thereafter to the next principal payment date an amount equal to that fraction of the amount of principal due on the next principal payment date on said installment so delivered, the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is the number of full and partial fiscal year quarters from the date of said delivery to the next principal payment date. There shall also be set aside each fiscal year quarter on or after the first day of the fiscal year quarter after payment of the first principal installment of the Series 2011 Bond, an amount not less than one-fourth (1/4) of the amount of principal due on the next principal payment date. Except as hereinafter provided, no further deposits shall be made into the junior lien bond and interest redemption account (excluding the bond reserve account) once the aforesaid sums have been deposited therein. Any amount on deposit in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account (excluding the bond reserve account) in excess of (a) the amount needed for payment of principal installments of the Series 2011 Bond for the then current principal payment period, plus (b) interest on the Series 2011 Bond for the then current interest payment period, shall be used by the issuer for redemption of principal installments of the Series 2011 Bond in the manner set forth in subsection (i) hereof, or if such use is impracticable, shall be deposited in or credited to the receiving account. 
If for any reason there is a failure to make such quarterly deposit in the amounts required, then the entire amount of the deficiency shall be set aside and deposited in the bond and interest redemption account out of the Revenues first received thereafter which are not required by this section to be deposited in the operation and maintenance account or in the bond and interest redemption account, which amount shall be in addition to the regular quarterly deposit required during such succeeding quarter or quarters. 
There is hereby recognized in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account a separate account designated as the Bond Reserve Account (the "bond reserve account"). Commencing October 1, 2011, there shall be withdrawn from the Receiving account at the beginning of each fiscal year quarter and set aside in and transferred to the bond reserve account, after provision has been made for the operation and maintenance account and the current requirements of the junior lien bond and interest redemption account, the sum of at least three thousand one hundred twenty-five dollars ($3,125.00) per quarter (twelve thousand five hundred dollars ($12,500.00) annually) until there is accumulated in such account the lesser of the sum of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000.00) or the reserve amount. Except as hereinafter provided, no further deposits shall be made into the junior lien bond and interest redemption account for the purposes of the bond reserve account once the lesser of the sum of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000.00) or the reserve amount has been deposited therein. The moneys in the bond reserve account shall be used solely for the payment of the principal installments of and interest on the Series 2011 Bond as to which there would otherwise be default; provided however, that in the event the amount on deposit in the bond reserve account exceeds the reserve amount, the moneys in excess of the reserve amount shall be used to pay principal installments of and interest on the Series 2011 Bond on the next payment date. 
If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys in the bond reserve account for such payment, then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the net revenues first received thereafter which are not required by this section to be used for operation and maintenance or for current principal and interest requirements for the Series 2011 Bond. 
No further payments need be made into the junior lien bond and interest redemption account after enough of the principal installments of the Series 2011 Bond have been retired so that the amount then held in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account (including the bond reserve account), is equal to the entire amount of principal and interest which will be payable at the time of maturity of all the principal installments of the Series 2011 Bond then remaining outstanding.

If the amount in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account and the bond reserve account is not sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Series 2011 Bond when due, the moneys in the RRI account shall be transferred to the junior lien bond and interest redemption account and used for that purpose. Moneys in the RRI account may be invested in accordance with subsection (13) of this section. 
(5)  General obligation debt account. Out of the remaining revenues in the receiving account, there may be next set aside in or credited to monthly after meeting the requirements of the foregoing account, to an account designated General Obligation Debt Account (the "G.O. account"), or from other available moneys such sums as shall be necessary to pay debt service on presently existing or future general obligation bond issues of the issuer or general obligations or contractual obligations of the issuer incurred or to be incurred for system purposes. 
(6)  Reverse flow of funds; surplus money. In the event the moneys in the receiving account are insufficient to provide for the current requirements of the operation and maintenance account, the bond and interest redemption account (including the bond reserve account) or the RRI account, any moneys and/or securities in the funds of the system described by this section shall be transferred, first, to the operation and maintenance account, second, the bond and interest redemption account, and third, to the RRI account. 
All moneys remaining in the receiving account at the end of any fiscal year after satisfying the above requirements for the deposit of moneys into the operation and maintenance account, the senior lien bond and interest redemption account, the junior lien bond and interest redemption account and the RRI account may be transferred to the bond and interest redemption account and used to call the bond or portions thereof for redemption, or at the option of the issuer, transferred to the RRI account and used for the purpose for which the account was established; provided, however, that if there should be a deficit in the operation and maintenance account, the bond and interest redemption account, the bond reserve account or the RRI account, on account of defaults in setting aside therein the amounts hereinbefore required, then transfers shall be made from such moneys remaining in the receiving account to such accounts in the priority and order named in this section, to the extent of such deficits. 
(13)  Investments. Moneys in the funds and accounts established herein and moneys derived from the proceeds of sale of the senior lien bonds and junior lien bonds may be invested by the legislative body of the issuer on behalf of the issuer in the obligations and instruments permitted for investment by Section 24 of Act 94, as the same may be amended from time to time; provided, however, that as long as the Series 2011 Bond is held by the government, then the investment may be limited to the obligations and instruments authorized by the government. Investment of moneys in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account being accumulated for payment on the next maturing principal or interest payment on the Series 2011 Bond shall be limited to obligations and instruments bearing maturity dates prior to the date of the next maturing principal or interest payment on the bond. Investment of moneys in the bond reserve account shall be limited to government obligations and instruments bearing maturity dates or subject to redemption, at the option of the holder thereof, not later than five (5) years from the date of the investment. In the event investments are made, any securities representing the same shall be kept on deposit with the depository bank.

The issuer hereby covenants and agrees to fix and maintain at all times while the Series 2011 Bond shall be outstanding such rates for service furnished by the system as shall be sufficient to provide for the foregoing expenses, requirements and covenants, and to create a junior lien bond and interest redemption account (including a bond reserve account) for such Series 2011 Bond. The rates and charges for all services and facilities rendered by the system shall be reasonable and just, taking into consideration the cost and value of the system and the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating the same and the amounts necessary for the retirement of all of the Series 2011 Bond, and accruing interest on all of the Series 2011 Bond, and there shall be charged such rates and charges as shall be adequate to meet the requirements of this section and subsection (12) of this section.

(iii)  It will cause an annual audit of such books of record and account for the preceding fiscal year to be made each year by a recognized independent certified public accountant, and will cause such accountant to mail a copy of such audit to the government, without request of the government, or to the manager of the syndicate or account purchasing the Series 2011 Bond. Such audit shall be completed and so made available not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the close of each fiscal year, and said audit may, at the option of the issuer, be used in lieu of the statement on forms prepared by the department of treasury and all purposes for which said forms are required to be used by this section. 
(c)  It will maintain and carry, for the benefit of the holders of the Series 2011 Bond, insurance on all physical properties of the system, of the kinds and in the amounts normally carried by municipalities engaged in the operation of similar systems. The amount of said insurance shall be approved by the government. All moneys received for losses under any such insurance policies shall be applied solely to the replacement and restoration of the property damaged or destroyed, and to the extent not so used, shall be used for the purpose of calling the Series 2011 Bond.

(17)  Additional bonds. The issuer may issue additional bonds of equal standing with the Series 2011 Bond for the following purposes and on the following conditions: 
(a)  To complete construction of the project according to the plans referred to in subsection (1), additional bonds may be issued in the amount necessary therefor.

The adjustments and augmentations provided for in the preceding sentence shall be established by certificate of an independent consulting engineer filed with the clerk of the issuer. If a new bond is issued within four (4) months of the end of a fiscal year, the determination made in subsection (b)(i) of this subsection (17) may be based upon the results of a fiscal year ending within sixteen (16) months of the date of issuance of the new bond. 
The funds herein established shall be applied to all additional bonds issued pursuant to this section as if said bonds were part of the original bond issue and all revenue from any such extension or replacement constructed by the proceeds of an additional bond issue shall be paid to the receiving account mentioned in this section. 
(18)  Ordinance shall constitute contract. The provisions of this section shall constitute a contract between the issuer and the bondholders and after the issuance of the Series 2011 Bond this section shall not be repealed or amended in any respect which will adversely affect the rights and interests of the holders nor shall the issuer adopt any law, ordinance or resolution in any way adversely affecting the rights or the holders so long as the Series 2011 Bond or interest thereon remains unpaid. 
(19)  Refunding of bond.

(20)  Default of issuer. If there shall be default in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account, provisions of this section or in the payment of principal of or interest on any of the Series 2011 Bond, upon the filing of a suit by twenty (20) percent of the holders of the junior lien bonds, any court having jurisdiction of the action may appoint a receiver to administer the system on behalf of the issuer with power to charge and collect rates sufficient to provide for the payment of the junior lien bonds and for the payment of operation, maintenance and administrative expenses and to apply revenues in accordance with this section and the laws of the State of Michigan. 
    The issuer hereby agrees to transfer to any bona fide receiver or other subsequent operator of the system, pursuant to any valid court order in a proceeding brought to enforce collection or payment of the issuer's obligations, all contracts and other rights of the issuer, conditionally, for such time only as such receiver or operation shall operate by authority of the court. 
    The holders of twenty (20) percent of the then outstanding principal amount of the junior lien bonds in the event of default may require by mandatory injunction the raising of rates in a reasonable amount. 
(21)  Ordinance subject to Michigan law and government regulations. The provisions of this section are subject to the laws of the State of Michigan and to the present and future regulations of the government not inconsistent with the express provisions hereof and Michigan law.

    This bond is a single, fully-registered, non-convertible bond constituting an issue in the total aggregate principal sum of $806,000, issued pursuant to Ordinance 2011-06 (the "Ordinance"), and under and in full compliance with the Constitution and statutes of the State of Michigan, including specifically Act 94, Public Acts of Michigan, 1933, as amended, for the purpose of paying part of the cost of the acquisition, construction, furnishing and equipping improvements to the Issuer's sanitary sewer system, together with all necessary interests in land, appurtenances and attachments thereto.

    This bond is a self-liquidating bond and is not a general obligation of the Issuer and does not constitute an indebtedness of the Issuer within any constitutional or statutory debt limitation, but is payable, both as to principal and interest, solely from the Net Revenues of the System. The principal of and interest on the bond is secured by the statutory lien hereinbefore mentioned. 
    Principal installments of this bond are subject to prepayment prior to maturity, in inverse chronological order, at the Issuer's option, on any date on or after August 1, 2012, at par and accrued interest to the date fixed for prepayment. 
    Thirty days notice of the call of any principal installments for prepayment shall be given by mail to the registered owner at the registered address. The principal installments so called for prepayment shall not bear interest after the date fixed for prepayment, provided funds are on hand to prepay said installments. 
    This bond shall be registered as to principal and interest on the books of the Issuer kept by the Issuer's Treasurer or successor or written designee as bond registrar and transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent") and noted hereon, after which it shall be transferable only upon presentation to the Transfer Agent with a written transfer by the registered owner or his attorney in fact. Such transfer shall be noted hereon and upon the books of the Issuer kept for that purpose by the Transfer Agent. 
    The Issuer has covenanted and agreed and does hereby covenant and agree to fix and maintain at all times while any bonds including any installments of this bond payable from the Net Revenues of the System shall be outstanding, such rates for service furnished by the System as shall be sufficient to provide for payment of the interest on and the principal of this bond and any additional bonds of equal standing payable from the Net Revenues of the System as and when the same become due and payable, and to create a bond and interest redemption account (including bond reserve account) therefor, to provide for the payment of expenses of administration and operation and such expenses for maintenance of the System as are necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order, and to provide for such other expenditures and funds for the System as are required by the Ordinance. 
    It is hereby certified and recited that all acts, conditions and things required by law to be done precedent to and in the issuance of this bond have been done and performed in regular and due time and form as required by law.

(10)  Security for bond. Any senior lien bonds hereafter issued and the interest thereon shall be payable solely from the net revenues, and to secure such payment, there is hereby created a statutory lien upon the whole of the net revenues which shall be a first lien to continue until payment in full of the principal of and interest on all senior lien bonds payable from the net revenues, or, until sufficient cash or sufficient government obligations have been deposited in trust for payment in full of all senior lien bonds of a series then outstanding, principal and interest on such senior lien bonds to maturity, or, if called for redemption, to the date fixed for redemption together with the amount of the redemption premium, if any. 
    Any junior lien bonds issued hereunder, including the Series 2011 Bond, and the interest thereon shall be payable primarily from the net revenues, and to secure such payment, there is hereby created a statutory lien upon the whole of the net revenues which shall be a second lien, subject only to the statutory first lien established with respect to the senior lien bonds, to continue until payment in full of the principal of and interest on all junior lien bonds payable from the net revenues, or, until sufficient cash or sufficient government obligations have been deposited in trust for payment in full of all junior lien bonds of a series then outstanding, principal and interest on such junior lien bonds to maturity, or, if called for redemption, to the date fixed for redemption together with the amount of the redemption premium, if any. The statutory lien on the net revenues created with respect to the junior lien bonds (including the Series 2011 Bond) shall at all times be and remain subordinate and inferior to the pledge of net revenues and the statutory first lien thereon authorized to be granted to secure any senior lien bonds hereafter issued, and the junior lien bonds shall carry a legend to that effect. 
(11)  Budget. Immediately upon the effective date of this section for the remainder of the current fiscal year, and thereafter prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, the issuer shall prepare an annual budget for the system for the ensuing fiscal year itemized on the basis of monthly requirements. A copy of such budget shall be mailed to the government without request from the government for review prior to adoption (as long as the government is the registered owner of the bond), and upon written request to any other registered owners of the bond. 
(12)  Custodian of funds; funds. The issuer's treasurer shall be custodian of all funds belonging to or associated with the system and such funds shall be deposited in the depository bank. The issuer's treasurer shall execute a fidelity bond with a surety company in an amount at least equal to the maximum annual debt service for the Series 2011 Bond. 
    The issuer's treasurer is hereby directed to create and maintain a Sanitary Sewer System Fund, with the following accounts, into which the proceeds of the Series 2011 Bond and the revenues from the system shall be deposited in the manner and at the times provided in this section, which accounts shall be established and maintained, except as otherwise provided, so long as the Series 2011 Bond remains unpaid. 
(A)  Construction Account. The proceeds of the Series 2011 Bond hereby authorized, and no other funds, shall be deposited in the 2011 Sanitary Sewer System Construction Account (the "construction account"), in the depository bank. Moneys in the construction account shall be used solely for the purposes for which the Series 2011 Bond is issued. If monies other than proceeds of the Series 2011 Bond are deposited into the construction account, then the monies constituting proceeds of the Series 2011 Bond shall be accounted separately from such other funds or monies. 
Any unexpended balance of the proceeds of sale of the Series 2011 Bond remaining after completion of the project herein authorized may in the discretion of the issuer be used for further improvements, enlargements and extensions to the system, provided that at the time of such expenditure such use be approved by the department of treasury (if such approval is then required by law). Any remaining balance after such expenditure shall be paid into the junior lien bond and interest redemption account and used as soon as is practical for the prepayment of installments of the Series 2011 Bond or for the purchase of installments to the Series 2011 Bond at not more than the fair market value thereof. Following completion of the project, any unexpended balance of the Series 2011 Bond shall be invested at a yield not to exceed the yield on the Series 2011 Bond. 
After completion of the project and disposition of remaining proceeds, if any, of the Series 2011 Bond pursuant to the provisions of this section, the construction account shall be closed. 
(B)  Sanitary Sewer System Receiving Account. Upon and after the effective date of this section, the revenues of the system shall be set aside into a separate account to be designated the sanitary sewer system receiving account (the "receiving account"), and moneys so deposited therein shall be transferred, expended and used only in the manner and order as follows: 
(1)  Operation and maintenance account. There is hereby established a separate account to be designated the operation and maintenance account (the "operation and maintenance account"). Revenues shall be transferred each quarter of the fiscal year, commencing upon the effective date of this section, from the receiving account to the operation and maintenance account to pay the reasonable and necessary current expenses of administration and operating and maintaining the system for the ensuing quarter. 
(2)  Bond and interest redemption account (senior lien bonds). There is hereby established a separate account to be designated as the Senior Lien Bond And Interest Redemption Account (the "senior lien bond and interest redemption account"), the moneys on deposit therein from time to time used solely for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest on any senior lien bonds. After the transfer required in (1) above, revenues shall be transferred each quarter of the fiscal year from the receiving account, before any other expenditures or transfer therefrom, and deposited in the senior lien bond and interest redemption account for payment of principal of and interest on any senior lien bonds and to fund the bond reserve account, if any, required upon the issuance of senior lien bonds. 
(3)  Bond and interest redemption account (junior lien bonds). There is hereby established a separate account to be designated as the Junior Lien Bond And Interest Redemption Account (the "junior lien bond and interest redemption account"), the moneys on deposit therein from time to time used solely for the purpose of paying the principal of and interest on junior lien bonds, including the Series 2011 Bond. After the transfer required in (1) and (2) above, revenues shall be transferred each quarter of the fiscal year from the receiving account, before any other expenditures or transfer therefrom, and deposited in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account for payment of principal of and interest on the junior lien bonds, including the Series 2011 Bond and to fund the bond reserve account, in the amounts and at the times specified below. 
Upon any delivery of an installment of the Series 2011 Bond there shall be set aside at the time of delivery and on the first day of each quarter of the fiscal year thereafter to the next interest payment date an amount equal to that fraction of the amount of interest due on the next interest payment date on said installment so delivered, the numerator of which is one (1) and the denominator of which is the number of full and partial fiscal year quarters from the date of said delivery to the next interest payment date. There also shall be set aside each fiscal year quarter on or after the delivery of the first principal installment an amount not less than one-half (1/2) of the amount of interest due on the next interest payment date on all outstanding installments of the Series 2011 Bond not delivered during the then current interest payment period. 
Commencing twelve (12) calendar months preceding the date on which the first principal installment payment on the Series 2011 Bond is due, upon any delivery of an installment of the Series 2011 Bond there shall be set aside at the time of such delivery and on the first day of each quarter of the fiscal year thereafter to the next principal payment date an amount equal to that fraction of the amount of principal due on the next principal payment date on said installment so delivered, the numerator of which is 1 and the denominator of which is the number of full and partial fiscal year quarters from the date of said delivery to the next principal payment date. There shall also be set aside each fiscal year quarter on or after the first day of the fiscal year quarter after payment of the first principal installment of the Series 2011 Bond, an amount not less than one-quarter (1/4) of the amount of principal due on the next principal payment date. Except as hereinafter provided, no further deposits shall be made into the junior lien bond and interest redemption account (excluding the bond reserve account) once the aforesaid sums have been deposited therein. Any amount on deposit in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account (excluding the bond reserve account) in excess of (a) the amount needed for payment of principal installments of the Series 2011 Bond for the then current principal payment period, plus (b) interest on the Series 2011 Bond for the then current interest payment period, shall be used by the issuer for redemption of principal installments of the Series 2011 Bond in the manner set forth in subsection (9) hereof, or if such use is impracticable, shall be deposited in or credited to the receiving account. 
If for any reason there is a failure to make such quarterly deposit in the amounts required, then the entire amount of the deficiency shall be set aside and deposited in the bond and interest redemption account out of the revenues first received thereafter which are not required by this section to be deposited in the operation and maintenance account or in the bond and interest redemption account, which amount shall be in addition to the regular quarterly deposit required during such succeeding quarter or quarters. 
There is hereby recognized in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account a separate account designated as the Bond Reserve Account (the "bond reserve account"). Commencing October 1, 2011, there shall be withdrawn from the receiving account at the beginning of each fiscal year quarter and set aside in and transferred to the bond reserve account, after provision has been made for the operation and maintenance account and the current requirements of the junior lien bond and interest redemption account, the sum of at least one thousand fifty dollars ($1,050.00) per quarter (four thousand two hundred dollars ($4,200.00) annually) until there is accumulated in such account the lesser of the sum of forty-two thousand dollars ($42,000.00) or the reserve amount. Except as hereinafter provided, no further deposits shall be made into the junior lien bond and interest redemption account for the purposes of the bond reserve account once the lesser of the sum of forty-two thousand dollars ($42,000.00) or the reserve amount has been deposited therein. The moneys in the bond reserve account shall be used solely for the payment of the principal installments of and interest on the Series 2011 Bond as to which there would otherwise be default; provided however, that in the event the amount on deposit in the bond reserve account exceeds the reserve amount, the moneys in excess of the reserve amount shall be used to pay principal installments of and interest on the Series 2011 Bond on the next payment date. 
If at any time it shall be necessary to use moneys in the bond reserve account for such payment, then the moneys so used shall be replaced from the net revenues first received thereafter which are not required by this section to be used for operation and maintenance or for current principal and interest requirements for the Series 2011 Bond. 
No further payments need be made into the junior lien bond and interest redemption account after enough of the principal installments of the Series 2011 Bond have been retired so that the amount then held in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account (including the bond reserve account), is equal to the entire amount of principal and interest which will be payable at the time of maturity of all the principal installments of the Series 2011 Bond then remaining outstanding. 
The moneys in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account and the bond reserve account shall be invested in accordance with subsection (13) of this section, and profit realized or income earned on such investment shall be used or transferred as provided in subsection (13) of this section. 
(4)  Repair, replacement and improvement account. There is hereby established a separate account designated Repair, Replacement and Improvement Account (the "RRI account"). After the transfers required in (1), (2) and (3) above, and so long as any principal installments of the Series 2011 Bond remain outstanding, commencing October 1, 2011, revenues shall be transferred each fiscal year quarter from the receiving account and deposited in the RRI account in an amount not less than thirteen thousand eighty-six dollars ($13,086.00) (fifty-two thousand three hundred forty-four dollars ($52,344.00) annually), less the amount, if any, deposited in the bond reserve account at the beginning of the same fiscal year quarter as provided in the preceding subsection. Moneys in the RRI account shall be used and disbursed only for the purpose of paying the cost of (a) repairing any damage to and emergency maintenance of the system, (b) repairing or replacing obsolete, deteriorating, deteriorated or worn out portions of the system, (c) acquiring and constructing extensions and improvements to the system and (d) when necessary, for the purpose of making payment of principal and interest on the Series 2011 Bond. If the amount in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account and the bond reserve account is not sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Series 2011 Bond when due, the moneys in the RRI account shall be transferred to the junior lien bond and interest redemption account and used for that purpose. Moneys in the RRI account may be invested in accordance with subsection (13) of this section. 
(5)  General obligation debt account. Out of the remaining revenues in the receiving account, there may be next set aside in or credited to monthly after meeting the requirements of the foregoing account, to an account designated General Obligation Debt Account (the "G.O. account"), or from other available moneys such sums as shall be necessary to pay debt service on presently existing or future general obligation bond issues of the issuer or general obligations or contractual obligations of the issuer incurred or to be incurred for system purposes. 
(6)  Reverse flow of funds; surplus money. In the event the moneys in the receiving account are insufficient to provide for the current requirements of the operation and maintenance account, the bond and interest redemption account (including the bond reserve account) or the RRI account, any moneys and/or securities in the funds of the system described by this section shall be transferred, first, to the operation and maintenance account, second, the bond and interest redemption account, and third, to the RRI account. 
All moneys remaining in the receiving account at the end of any fiscal year after satisfying the above requirements for the deposit of moneys into the operation and maintenance account, the senior lien bond and interest redemption account, the junior lien bond and interest redemption account and the RRI account may be transferred to the bond and interest redemption account and used to call the bond or portions thereof for redemption, or at the option of the issuer, transferred to the RRI account and used for the purpose for which the account was established; provided, however, that if there should be a deficit in the operation and maintenance account, the bond and interest redemption account, the bond reserve account or the RRI account, on account of defaults in setting aside therein the amounts hereinbefore required, then transfers shall be made from such moneys remaining in the receiving account to such accounts in the priority and order named in this section, to the extent of such deficits. 
(13)  Investments. Moneys in the funds and accounts established herein and moneys derived from the proceeds of sale of the senior lien bonds and junior lien bonds may be invested by the legislative body of the issuer on behalf of the issuer in the obligations and instruments permitted for investment by Section 24 of Act 94, as the same may be amended from time to time; provided, however, that as long as the Series 2011 Bond is held by the government, then the investment may be limited to the obligations and instruments authorized by the government. Investment of moneys in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account being accumulated for payment on the next maturing principal or interest payment on the Series 2011 Bond shall be limited to obligations and instruments bearing maturity dates prior to the date of the next maturing principal or interest payment on the bond. Investment of moneys in the bond reserve account shall be limited to government obligations and instruments bearing maturity dates or subject to redemption, at the option of the holder thereof, not later than five (5) years from the date of the investment. In the event investments are made, any securities representing the same shall be kept on deposit with the depository bank. Interest income earned on investment of funds in the receiving account, the operation and maintenance account and the bond and interest redemption account (except the bond reserve account), shall be deposited in or credited to the receiving account. Interest income earned on the investment of funds in the bond reserve account shall be deposited in the bond and interest redemption account. 
(14)  Rates and charges. Rates and charges for the services of the system have been fixed by ordinance in an amount sufficient to pay the costs of operating, maintaining and administering the system, to pay the principal of and interest on the Series 2011 Bond and to meet the requirements for repair, replacement, reconstruction and improvement and all other requirements provided herein, and otherwise comply with the covenants herein provided. The issuer hereby covenants and agrees to fix and maintain at all times while the Series 2011 Bond shall be outstanding such rates for service furnished by the system as shall be sufficient to provide for the foregoing expenses, requirements and covenants, and to create a junior lien bond and interest redemption account (including a bond reserve account) for such Series 2011 Bond. The rates and charges for all services and facilities rendered by the system shall be reasonable and just, taking into consideration the cost and value of the system and the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating the same and the amounts necessary for the retirement of all of the Series 2011 Bond, and accruing interest on all of the Series 2011 Bond, and there shall be charged such rates and charges as shall be adequate to meet the requirements of this section and subsection (12) of this section. 
(15)  No free service. No free service shall be furnished by the system to any individual, firm or corporation, public or private or to any public agency or instrumentality. 
(16)  Covenants. The issuer covenants and agrees, so long as any of the Series 2011 Bond hereby authorized remains unpaid, as follows: 
(a)  It will comply with applicable state laws and regulations and continually operate and maintain the system in good condition. 
(b)  (i)  It will maintain complete books and records relating to the operation and financial affairs of the system. If the government is the holder of the Series 2011 Bond, the government shall have the right to inspect the system and the records, accounts, and data relating thereto at all reasonable times. 
(ii)  It will file with the department of treasury and the government each year, as soon as is possible, not later than ninety (90) days after the close of the fiscal year, a report, on forms prepared by the department of treasury, made in accordance with the accounting method of the issuer, completely setting forth the financial operation of such fiscal year. 
(iii)  It will cause an annual audit of such books of record and account for the preceding fiscal year to be made each year by a recognized independent certified public accountant, and will cause such accountant to mail a copy of such audit to the government, without request of the government, or to the manager of the syndicate or account purchasing the Series 2011 Bond. Such audit shall be completed and so made available not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the close of each fiscal year, and said audit may, at the option of the issuer, be used in lieu of the statement on forms prepared by the department of treasury and all purposes for which said forms are required to be used by this section. 
(c)  It will maintain and carry, for the benefit of the holders of the Series 2011 Bond, insurance on all physical properties of the system, of the kinds and in the amounts normally carried by municipalities engaged in the operation of similar systems. The amount of said insurance shall be approved by the government. All moneys received for losses under any such insurance policies shall be applied solely to the replacement and restoration of the property damaged or destroyed, and to the extent not so used, shall be used for the purpose of calling the Series 2011 Bond. 
(d)  It will not borrow any money from any source or enter into any contract or agreement to incur any other liabilities that may in any way be a lien upon the revenues or otherwise encumber the system so as to impair revenues therefrom, without obtaining the prior written consent of the government, nor shall it transfer or use any portion of the revenues derived in the operation of the system for any purpose not herein specifically authorized. 
(e)  It will not voluntarily dispose of or transfer its title to the system or any part thereof, including lands and interest in land, sale, mortgage, lease or other encumbrances, without obtaining the prior written consent of the government. 
(f)  Any extensions to or improvements of the system shall be made according to sound engineering principles and specifications shall be submitted to the government for prior review. 
(g)  If the Series 2011 Bond is issued on a tax exempt basis, then to the extent permitted by law, it shall take all actions within its control necessary to maintain the exclusion of the interest on the Series 2011 Bond from adjusted gross income for general federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including but not limited to, actions relating to the rebate of arbitrage earnings, if applicable, and the expenditure and investment of proceeds of the Series 2011 Bond and moneys deemed to be proceeds of the Series 2011 Bond. 
(17)  Additional bonds. The issuer may issue additional bonds of equal standing with the Series 2011 Bond for the following purposes and on the following conditions: 
(a)  To complete construction of the project according to the plans referred to in subsection (1), additional bonds may be issued in the amount necessary therefor. 
(b)  For the purpose of making reasonable replacement or extension of the system or refunding any junior lien bonds or any additional bonds of equal standing with the Series 2011 Bond if: 
(i)  The augmented net revenues (hereinafter defined) of the system for the fiscal year preceding the year in which such additional bond is to be issued were one hundred (100) percent of the average annual debt service requirements on the junior lien bonds and any bonds of equal standing then outstanding and those proposed to be issued net of any bonds to be refunded by the new issue; or 
(ii)  The holders of at least seventy-five (75) percent of the junior lien bonds consent to such issue in writing. 
    For purposes of this section the term "augmented net revenues" shall mean the net revenues of the system for a year, adjusted to reflect the effect of any rate increase placed in effect during that year (but not in effect for the whole year), placed in effect subsequent to the year or scheduled, at the time the new bond is authorized, to be placed in effect before principal of and interest on the new bond become payable from revenues of the system, and augmented by any increase in revenues or decrease in expenses estimated to accrue from the improvements to be acquired from the new bond. The adjustments and augmentations provided for in the preceding sentence shall be established by certificate of an independent consulting engineer filed with the clerk of the issuer. If a new bond is issued within four (4) months of the end of a fiscal year, the determination made in subsection (b)(i) of this section (17) may be based upon the results of a fiscal year ending within sixteen (16) months of the date of issuance of the new bond. 
    The funds herein established shall be applied to all additional bonds issued pursuant to this section as if said bonds were part of the original bond issue and all revenue from any such extension or replacement constructed by the proceeds of an additional bond issue shall be paid to the receiving account mentioned in this section. 
(18)  Ordinance shall constitute contract. The provisions of the ordinance from which this section derives shall constitute a contract between the issuer and the bondholders and after the issuance of the Series 2011 Bond this ordinance shall not be repealed or amended in any respect which will adversely affect the rights and interests of the holders nor shall the issuer adopt any law, ordinance or resolution in any way adversely affecting the rights or the holders so long as the Series 2011 Bond or interest thereon remains unpaid. 
(19)  Refunding of bond. If at any time it shall appear to the government that the issuer is able to refund upon call for redemption or with consent of the government the then outstanding Series 2011 Bond by obtaining a loan for such purposes from responsible cooperative or private credit sources at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes and periods of time, the issuer will, upon request of the government, apply for and accept such loan in sufficient amount to repay the government, and will take all such actions as may be required in connection with such loans. 
(20)  Default of issuer. If there shall be default in the junior lien bond and interest redemption account, provisions of this section or in the payment of principal of or interest on any of the Series 2011 Bond, upon the filing of a suit by twenty (20) percent of the holders of the junior lien bonds, any court having jurisdiction of the action may appoint a receiver to administer the system on behalf of the issuer with power to charge and collect rates sufficient to provide for the payment of the junior lien bonds and for the payment of operation, maintenance and administrative expenses and to apply revenues in accordance with this section and the laws of the State of Michigan. 
    The issuer hereby agrees to transfer to any bona fide receiver or other subsequent operator of the system, pursuant to any valid court order in a proceeding brought to enforce collection or payment of the issuer's obligations, all contracts and other rights of the issuer, conditionally, for such time only as such receiver or operation shall operate by authority of the court. 
    The holders of twenty (20) percent of the then outstanding principal amount of the junior lien bonds in the event of default may require by mandatory injunction the raising of rates in a reasonable amount. 
(21)  Ordinance subject to Michigan law and government regulations. The provisions of this ordinance are subject to the laws of the State of Michigan and to the present and future regulations of the government not inconsistent with the express provisions hereof and Michigan law. 
(22)  Fiscal year of system. The fiscal year for operating the system shall be the fiscal year. 
(23)  Issuer subject to loan resolution. So long as the government is holder of any of the Series 2011 Bond, the issuer shall be subject to the loan resolution (RUS Bulletin 1780-27) and shall comply with all provisions thereof. 
(24)  Covenant not to defease. So long as the government is the holder of the Series 2011 Bond, the issuer covenants that it will not defease the Series 2011 Bond held by the government. 
(25)  Approval by the Michigan Department of Treasury. The mayor is hereby authorized to obtain any necessary waivers or approvals from the department of treasury in order to effectuate the sale and delivery of the Series 2011 Bonds as contemplated by this section (if such approval is then required). 
(26)  Conflict and severability. All ordinances, resolutions and orders or parts thereof in conflict with the provisions of this section are to the extent of such conflict hereby repealed, and each section of this section and each subdivision of any section hereof is hereby declared to be independent, and the finding or holding of any section or subdivision thereof to be invalid or void shall not be deemed or held to affect the validity of any other section or subdivision of this section.

*Mercury shall not be discharged above levels of detection. The analytical method shall be EPA 245.1, and the reported detection level shall not exceed 0.0002 mg/L unless appropriate based on demonstrated sample matrix interference. 
**The limit for total phenols is based on analytical testing via EPA Method 420.1 and discharge of any or all of the following compounds: 2 chlorphenol, 4-chlorophenal, 2, 4-dichlorophenol, and 2-methylphenol (also referred to as ocresol). Discharge of other phenolic compounds is prohibited, except as specifically authorized by the city. If a discharge exceeds the total phenols local limit, the affected user may petition for an alternative mass-based limit. Included with this petition shall be a phenol characterization plan, which shall aim to identify and quantify the specific phenolic compounds present in the discharge. If the superintendent deems the plan approvable and concurs with the results of the subsequent study, alternative mass-based limits may be granted based on appropriate allocations of the following maximum headworks loadings for the POTW: 
0.798 lb./day 2-chlorophenol 
0.798 lb./day 4-chlorophenol 
2.29 lb./day2, 4-dichlorophenol 
3.29 lb./day 2-methylphenol 
(b)  Compatible pollutants. The following limits for pollutants compatible with the POTW treatment system are established to protect against pass through and interference. Subject to the conditions of section 24-163 herein, no person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following: 
510 mg/l 5-day BOD 
1,100 mg/l chemical oxygen demand (COD), where the superintendent determines COD to be accurate and appropriate alternative to 5-day BOD 
1,800 mg/l total suspended solids (TSS) 
18 mg/l total phosphorus (as P) 
64 mg/l ammonia nitrogen (as N) 
50 mg/l fats, oil and grease 
(c)  Concentrations. Concentrations apply at the point where the industrial waste is discharged to the POTW. All concentration for metallic substances are for "total metal" unless otherwise indicated. At his discretion, the superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration based limitations above.

Sec. 24-103. - Special agreement. 
    The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with industrial users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from EPA. Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-104. - Dilution. 
    No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The superintendent may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitation is appropriate.

c.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in section 24-136. 
(6)  Certification. A statement reviewed by the industrial user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis-and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(7)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in section 24-116 of this article. 
(8)  All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 24-117. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-127. - Compliance schedule progress report. 
    The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by section 24-126(b)(7). The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include hiring and engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and conducting routine operation). No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months. The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the superintendent no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, (and, if appropriate) the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the superintendent. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-128. - Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. 
    Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report containing the information described in section 24-126(b)(4) through (6). For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 24-117. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-129. - Periodic compliance reports. 
(a)  Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard shall, at a frequency determined by the superintendent but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by such pretreatment standards and measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 24-117. 
(b)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(c)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in and of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in section 24-136 of this article the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-130. - Report of changed conditions. 
    Each industrial user is required to notify the superintendent of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least ninety (90) days before the change: 
(1)  The superintendent may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 24-116. 
(2)  The superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 24-118 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 24-122. 
(3)  No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and unless the superintendent has responded to the industrial user's notice. 
(4)  For purposes of this requirement flow increases of ten (10) percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall, by way of illustration and not limitation, be deemed significant. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-131. - Reports of potential problems. 
(a)  In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standard in section 24-98 of this article), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user. 
(b)  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article. 
(c)  Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this article. 
(d)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph A, above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-132. - Reports from nonsignificant industrial users. 
    All industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the superintendent may require. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-133. - Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. 
    If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must notify the city within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The Industrial user is not required to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the industrial user at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the industrial user's initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-134. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous' constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestreams expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under section 24-130, above. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 24-126, 24-128, and 24-129, above. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. 
    Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substances within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-135. - Analytical requirements. 
    All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-136. - Sample collection. 
(a)  Except as indicated in subsection b, below, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or through a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-137. - Determination of noncompliance. 
    The superintendent may use a grab sample(s) to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-138. - Timing. 
    Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-139. - Record keeping.

(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the industrial user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing city personnel access to the industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-141. - Search warrants. 
    If the superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or property or any part thereof, and if the superintendent has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then upon application by the city attorney, the district court for the appropriate county shall issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing therein the specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything, may be searched and/or seized on the property described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the superintendent in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city. In the event of an emergency affecting public health and safety, inspections shall be made without the issuance of a warrant. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-142. - Confidential information. 
    Subject to the requirements and limitations of the Freedom of Information Act, Public Act No. 442 of 1976, as amended; information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction-unless the industrial user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, and subject to the requirements and limitations of the Freedom of Information Act, Public Act No. 442 of 1976, as amended, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.

DIVISION 8. - ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 24-144. - Notification of violation. 
    Whenever the superintendent finds that any user has violated or is violating this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the superintendent or his agent may serve upon said user a written notice of violation. Within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-145. - Consent orders. 
    The superintendent is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Provided, however, that no such order shall be binding upon or otherwise restrict the city unless such order, prior to its execution and entry, has been approved in accordance with the procedures specified in section 12.2 of the city Charter for contracts for payment of an amount of one thousand dollars ($1000.00) or more. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 24-147 and 24-148 below and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-146. - Show cause hearing. 
(a)  The superintendent may order any user which causes or contributes to violation(s) of this article, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the superintendent and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(b)  The superintendent may conduct the hearing and take evidence, or may designate any officer or employee to: 
(1)  Issue in the name of the superintendent notices of the hearing requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings. 
(2)  Take the evidence; 
(3)  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the superintendent for action thereon. 
(c)  At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any part to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-147. - Compliance orders. 
    When the superintendent finds that a user has violated or continues to violate the article, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within one hundred and eighty (180) days. If the user does not come into compliance within one hundred and eighty (180) days, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. An order issued under this section may also impose surcharges on the user in an amount determined by the superintendent to be sufficient to reimburse the city for the additional cost of the operation and maintenance of the POTW resulting from the users' violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-148. - Cease and desist orders. 
    When the superintendent finds that a user is violating this article, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    An order issued under this section may also impose surcharges on the user in an amount determined by the superintendent to be sufficient to reimburse the city for the additional cost of the operation and maintenance of the POTW resulting from the users' violation. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-149. - Emergency suspensions. 
    The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension orders, the superintendent shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in section 24-150 are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the superintendent, prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 24-146 and/or 24-150. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-150. - Termination of discharge. 
    In addition to the reasons specified in section 24-124 of this article, any user that violates the following conditions of this article, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections 24-95 through 24-104 of this article. 
    Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 24-146 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
DIVISION 9. - JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 24-151. - Injunctive relief. 
    Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this article, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the superintendent, in addition to any other remedy or relief permitted hereunder or by state law may petition the circuit court of the appropriate county through the city attorney for issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the industrial user. Such other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be filed or sought by the city. A petition or suit for legal or equitable relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other action against a user. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-152. - Violations; penalties. 
(a)  Willful or negligent violation of any provision of this article other than section 24-110, of any order or wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, or of any other pretreatment requirement shall constitute a municipal civil infraction. 
(b)  Willful or negligent introduction of any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall constitute a municipal civil infraction. 
(c)  Knowingly making any false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article or pursuant to any wastewater discharge permit or order shall constitute a municipal civil infraction. 
(d)  Falsifying, tampering with or knowingly rendering inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall constitute a municipal civil infraction. 
(e)  Upon an admission or determination of responsibility for any municipal civil infraction referenced in this section, the violator shall, in addition to any other penalties provided for in this article, be subject to a civil fine and costs in the amounts specified in the Official Municipal Civil Infraction Fines and Costs Schedule adopted by resolution of the city council. Such fine and costs shall be in addition to any other remedy or cause of action for personal injury or property damage available to the city and/or the POTW under state law. Each day in which any violation or infraction referenced in this section shall continue shall be deemed a separate violation or infraction. 
(f)  Any person who shall violate the provisions of section 24-110 of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days, or both, plus the costs of prosecution.

DIVISION 11. - AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 

Sec. 24-160. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c) are met. 
(c)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset [if the information is provided orally within such twenty-four hour period, a written submission must also be provided within five (5) days of becoming aware of the upset]: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceedings, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-161. - General/specific prohibitions. 
    An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 24-98 of this article if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: (a) a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference, or (b) no local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93) 
Sec. 24-162. - Bypass. 
(a)  Definitions. 
(1)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
(2)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  Bypass not to violate standards. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Prior notice of bypass. 
(1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass if possible. 
(2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on-a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(d)  Prohibited. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless; 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(2)  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. 
(C.O. No. 93-5, § 1, 7-12-93)

650 mg/1 COD, where the superintendent determines COD to be an accurate and appropriate alternative to 5-day BOD 
300 mg/1 total suspended solids 
12 mg/1 total phosphorus (as P) 
(b)  Where necessary, in the opinion of the superintendent, the owner shall provide at his expense such pretreatment as may be necessary to reduce discharge waste to the above threshold limits; or a charge and fee shall be levied upon the industrial user for the services provided based upon the quantity and quality of industrial wastewater used thereon and therein. The rate to be billed for the use of the system shall be as follows, or as subsequently specified in the city's fee schedule article, for all industrial users within the sanitary sewer service area of the city: 
(1)  A $0.235 per pound of excess BOD surcharge shall be made for surcharges in excess of three hundred (300) mg/1 BOD.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2002-04, adopted June 24, 2002, enacted provisions intended for use as §§ 26-1-26-24. To preserve the style of this Code, and at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been redesignated as §§ 26-1-26-6, 26-26-26-34, and 26-51-26-58. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 26-1. - Findings of fact. 
    The city finds that a significant number of traffic arrests and traffic accidents in the city involved drivers who are operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic liquors and/or a controlled substance. In addition, the city finds that in traffic accidents involving drivers who are operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic liquors and/or a controlled substance there is a greater likelihood of personal injury and property damage. As a result of these determinations, a greater operational and/or financial burden is placed upon the city police, public service, firefighting and rescue services by persons who are operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic liquors and/or a controlled substance. 
(Ord. No. 2002-04, 6-24-02) 
Sec. 26-2. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: Costs and expenses of emergency response means reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city making an emergency response including, but not limited, to the actual costs and expenses of the hourly wage of firefighting, police and emergency medical service personnel, including overtime wages, costs and expenses for special equipment used during the response, and the costs and expenses of any special personnel and/or companies or organizations called to the scene to assist in the response. Such costs and expenses shall only include those costs and expenses directly arising because of the response to the particular incident. Such costs shall include the cost of any type of chemical testing for blood alcohol content or for the presence of controlled substances and for videotaping of the driver, if applicable. If legal action is instituted to collect the cost and expenses of emergency response under this article, all legal fees and costs incurred by the city in such a legal action shall also be included in the costs and expenses of such emergency response. 
    Emergency response means: 
(1)  The providing, sending and/or utilizing public service, police, firefighting, and/or rescue services by the city to an accident involving a motor vehicle where one or more of the drivers were operating the motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic liquor or any controlled substance or the combined influence of an alcoholic liquor and any controlled substance; or 
(2)  The making of a traffic stop and arrest by a police officer when the driver was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic liquor or any controlled substance or the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any controlled substance. 
    Operating under the influence means the operation of a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor and/or controlled substance or while visibly impaired by intoxicating liquor and/or controlled substance or with an unlawful alcohol content by weight of alcohol, regardless of whether such person is charged or convicted of any crime relating to the incident causing the emergency response. 
(1)  For purposes of this article, it shall be presumed that a person who was less than twenty-one (21) years of age was operating a motor vehicle under the influence if chemical analysis of the driver's blood, urine, or breath indicates the presence of any amount of a controlled substance or any bodily alcohol content. The term "any bodily alcohol content" means the presence of any alcohol within the driver's body which is due to consumption of intoxicating liquor other than consumption which was part of a recognized religious ceremony. 
(2)  For purposes of this article, it shall be presumed that a person who was operating a commercial motor vehicle was under the influence if chemical analysis of the driver's blood, urine, or breath indicates the presence of any amount of a controlled substance or that the amount of alcohol in the driver's blood contained 0.04 percent or more but not more than 0.07 percent by weight of alcohol. 
(3)  Other than in subsections (1) and (2) of this definition, for purposes of this article, it shall be presumed that a person was operating a motor vehicle under the influence if chemical analysis of the driver's blood, urine, or breath indicates that the amount of alcohol in the driver's blood was in excess of 0.07 percent by weight of alcohol or the presence of any amount of a controlled substance.

(d)  Guidelines, standards, and criteria. 
(1)  In reviewing plans, the commission shall follow the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's "Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings" as set forth in 36 C.F.R. part 67, as amended. The following standards are to be applied: 
a.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
b.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
c.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
d.  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
e.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved. 
f.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
g.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
h.  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
i.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
j.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(2)  The commission shall also consider all of the following: 
a.  The historic or architectural value and significance of the resource and its relationship to the historical value of the surrounding area; 
b.  The relationship of any exterior architectural features of the resource to the rest of the resource and to the surrounding areas; 
c.  The general compatibility of the exterior design, arrangement, texture and materials proposed to be used; 
d.  Those features of the particular resource identified in the historic preservation district study committee report, which supported its recommendation of the site or structure for inclusion within a historic preservation district. 
e.  Other factors, such as aesthetic value, that the commission finds relevant; and 
f.  Whether the applicant has certified in the application that the property where work will be undertaken has, or will have before the proposed project completion date, a fire alarm system or a smoke alarm complying with the requirement of the Stile-DeRossett-Hale Single State Construction Code Act, 1972 PA 230, MCL 125.1501 - 125.1531. 
(3)  Additionally, the quality of materials and craftsmanship used in a rehabilitation project must be commensurate with the quality of materials and craftsmanship of the historic building in question. 
(4)  Owners are responsible for procuring copies of the Secretary of Interior's standards for rehabilitation to consult as part of the planning process. 
(5)  The historic preservation district commission may also adopt rules of procedure and additional review standards and guidelines for resource treatment in order to carry out its duties under this section and for resource treatment in order to carry out its duties under this section, as long as those rules and additional review standards and guidelines are equivalent in guidance to the Secretary of Interior's standards and guidelines and are established or approved by the State Historic Preservation Office. 
(e)  Plan for preservation of structures . In case of an application for repair or alteration affecting the exterior appearance of a structure or for moving or demolition of a structure which the historic preservation district commission deems so valuable to the city, state or Nation that the loss thereof will adversely affect the public purpose of the city, state or Nation, the historic preservation district commission shall endeavor to work out with the owner an economically feasible plan for preservation of the structure. 
(f)  Demolition or moving of structures. It shall be the public policy of this city to discourage the demolition, demolition by neglect or moving of historic resources.

Sec. 28-11. - Decision of the historic preservation district commission. 
(a)  Certificate of appropriateness . Upon its review, the historic preservation district commission shall first approve the proposal and secondly approve the plans if, in its judgment, the standards, guidelines, and criteria enumerated in section 28-10, above, are satisfied and there is no adverse effect caused by the request. In approving the proposal and plans, the commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness. The approval of a certificate of appropriateness may be with or without conditions; provided that any conditions shall be consistent with and for purposes of fulfilling the values embodied in the standards, guidelines and criteria set forth in section 28-10. 
(b)  Approval of proposal with denial of plan . The historic preservation district commission may approve the proposal but reject the specific plans if it determines the plans are contrary or detrimental to the values embodied in the standards, guidelines, and criteria set forth in section 28-10.

(d)  Notice to proceed . Work within a historic preservation district shall be permitted through the issuance of a notice to proceed by the commission if any of the following conditions prevail and if the proposed work can be demonstrated by a finding of the historic preservation district commission to be necessary to substantially improve or correct any of the following conditions: 
(1)  The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or to the structure's occupants. 
(2)  The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of substantial benefit to the community and the applicant proposing the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning approvals, financing, and environmental clearances. 
(3)  Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the owner when a governmental action, an act of God, or other events beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within the historic preservation district, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner. 
(4)  Retaining the resource is not in the interest of the majority of the community. 
(e)  Filing of decision . After due consideration, the historic preservation district commission shall file with the building department its certificate of appropriateness, notice to proceed, or denial of the application submitted to it for review. Such certificate shall be signed by the chairperson or secretary of the historic preservation district commission. The historic preservation district commission shall state the reasons and grounds for its action in its minutes and on the face of its certificate. 
(f)  Compliance with approved plan . After a certificate of appropriateness has been issued and the building or demolition permit granted to the applicant, the building department shall take such action as is necessary to require compliance with the building plan approved by the historic preservation district commission, including any conditions of such approval. Certificates of appropriateness shall remain effective for a period of one (1) year; provided, however, that any plan submitted with the application for a building permit shall meet all of the requirements of the building code in effect at the time the permit is applied for. If a building or demolition permit is not obtained within one (1) year, the approval shall expire and become null and void. 
(g)  Failure of historic preservation district commission to act. The failure of the commission to act within a maximum of sixty (60) days after the date of a complete and accurate application filed with it, unless an extension is agreed upon in writing by the applicant and the historic preservation district commission, shall be deemed to constitute approval.

Sec. 28-13. - Work without a permit. 
    When work has been done upon a resource without a permit, and the historic preservation district commission finds that the work does not qualify for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission may require an owner to restore the resource to the condition that the resource was in before the inappropriate work or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness. If the owner does not comply with the restoration or modification requirement within a reasonable time, the commission may seek an order from the circuit court to require the owner to restore the resource to its former condition or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness. If the owner does not comply or cannot comply with the order of the court, the commission or its agents may enter the property and conduct work necessary to restore the resource to its former condition or modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the court's order.

Sec. 28-15. - Review of work in proposed districts. 
    Upon receipt of substantial evidence showing the presence of historic, architectural, archaeological, engineering, or cultural significance of a proposed historic preservation district, the city council may, at its discretion, adopt a resolution requiring that all applications for permits within the proposed historic preservation district be referred to the historic preservation district commission as prescribed in section 28-10 of this chapter. The historic preservation district commission shall review permit applications with the same powers that would apply if the proposed historic preservation district was an established historic preservation district. The review may continue in the proposed historic preservation district for not more than one (1) year, or until such time as the city council approves or rejects the establishment of the historic preservation district by ordinance, whichever occurs first. 
(Ord. No. 2017-04, § 1, 5-22-17) 
Sec. 28-16. - Emergency moratorium.

City of Milan 14 - 1 Article 14
ARTICLE 14 - SIGNS
SECTION 14.10 PURPOSE, AUTHORITY AND FINDINGS
The intent of this Article is to regulate signs and outdoor advertising within the City to protect
public safety, health and welfare; minimize abundance and size of signs to reduce visual clutter,
motorist distraction and loss of visibility; promote public convenience; preserve property
values; and enhance the aesthetic appearance and quality of life within the City.
The regulation and standards of this Article are considered the minimum amount of regulation
necessary to achieve a substantial government interest for public safety, traffic safety,
aesthetics, protection of property values, and are intended to be content neutral. These
objectives are accomplished by establishing the minimum amount of regulations necessary
concerning the size, placement, construction, illumination, and other aspects of signs in the City
so as to:
A. First Amendment Rights: Protect the public right to express and receive messages,
especially, noncommercial messages such as religious, political, social, philosophical and
other types of information protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Nothing in this Article is intended to limit the expression of free speech protected by the
First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
B. Safety: The requirements of this Section, including without limitation those with regard
to placement, installation, maintenance, size and location of signs are intended to
minimize distractions to motorists, maintain unobstructed vision for motorists, protect
pedestrians, and otherwise minimize any threat to public health or safety.
C. Aesthetics: Signs should enhance the aesthetic appeal of the City. Thus, these
regulations are intended to:
1. Regulate signs that are out-of-scale with surrounding buildings and structures.
2. Prevent an excessive accumulation of signs.
3. Encourage signs that enhance the appearance and value of business districts.
4. Limit off-premises advertising signs which the City Council and the Planning
Commission have found to constitute eyesores and to be deleterious to the wellbeing of the citizens and the economic development of the City, including
development and promotion of tourism and the preservation of the Citys
unique character and historical significance.
5. Recognize that different areas of the City require different sign regulations due
to factors such as their intended audience (pedestrians, drivers, etc.) and their
ability to help promote the character of an area. 
City of Milan 14 - 2 Article 14
D. Equal Protection and Fairness: These regulations are designed to be fair to each
property owner by establishing uniform standards that provide adequate exposure to
the public for all property owners for both commercial and noncommercial speech and
expression.
E. Land Use Planning Objectives: The placement and design of signs should further the
land use planning objectives of the City, and protect neighborhood character and the
value of surrounding properties. These regulations will advance these objectives by
fostering economic development while preserving the Citys unique character and
heritage.

a. Planning Commission Review. Sign permit applications submitted in
conjunction with the proposed construction of a new building or addition to
an existing building shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission for signs
located within the PUD, GB, and HS zoning districts as part of the required
site plan review. Proposed signs must be shown on the site plan. The
applicant shall have the option of submitting sign applications to the
Planning Commission under procedures which are separate from site plan
review.
b. Building/Zoning Official Review. The Building/Zoning Official shall review the
sign permit application for any sign proposed on a site or existing building
where no other new construction is proposed.
c. Issuance of Permit. Following review and approval of a sign application by
the Planning Commission or Building/Zoning Official, as appropriate, the
Building/Zoning Official shall have the authority to issue a sign permit.
4. Exceptions. A sign shall not be enlarged or relocated, except in conformity with
the provisions set forth in this Article for new signs, until a proper permit has
been secured. However, a new permit shall not be required for ordinary
servicing or repainting of an existing sign message, cleaning of a sign, name
changes or changing of the message on the sign where the sign is designed for
such changes. Furthermore, a permit shall not be required for certain exempt
signs listed in Section 14.40.
B. Inspections and Maintenance.
1. Inspection of New Signs. 
City of Milan 14 - 27 Article 14
a. All permanent signs for which a permit has been issued shall be inspected,
when erected, by the Building/Zoning Official or his designee. Approval shall
be granted only if the sign has been constructed in compliance with the
approved plans and applicable standards of this Article and the building
code.
b. In cases where fastenings or anchorages are to be eventually bricked in or
otherwise enclosed, the sign erector shall advise the Building/Zoning Official
when such fastenings are to be installed so that an inspection may be
completed before such enclosure.
2. Inspection of Existing Signs. The Building/Zoning Official or his designee shall
have the authority to routinely enter onto property to inspect existing signs. In
conducting such inspections, the Building/Zoning Official shall determine
whether the sign is adequately supported, painted to prevent corrosion and
secured to the building or other support so as to safely bear the weight of the
sign and pressure created by the wind.
3. Correction of Defects. If the Building/Zoning Official or designee finds that any
sign is unsafe, insecure, improperly constructed or poorly maintained, the sign
erector, owner of the sign or owner of the land shall make the sign safe and
secure by completing any necessary reconstruction or repairs, or entirely remove
the sign in accordance with the timetable established by the Building/Zoning
Official.
C. Removal of Abandoned or Obsolete Signs. Abandoned or obsolete signs shall be
removed by the owner, agent or person having use of the land, building or structure.
Upon vacating a commercial or industrial establishment, facility or land the proprietor
shall be responsible for removal of all abandoned or obsolete signs.
However, where a conforming sign structure and frame are typically reused by a current
occupant in a leased or rented building, the building owner shall not be required to
remove the sign structure and frame in the interim periods when the building is not
occupied, provided that the sign structure and frame are maintained in good condition.
D. Non-Conforming Signs. No non-conforming sign shall be altered or reconstructed
unless the alteration or reconstruction is in compliance with this Article, except that
non-conforming signs shall comply with the following regulations.
1. Repairs and Maintenance. Normal maintenance shall be permitted, provided
that any non-conforming sign that is destroyed by any means to an extent
greater than fifty (50%) percent of the signs pre-catastrophe fair market value,
exclusive of the foundation, shall not be reconstructed. Normal maintenance
shall include painting of chipped or faded signs, replacement of faded or 
City of Milan 14 - 28 Article 14
damaged surface panels, name changes, or repair or replacement of electrical
wiring or electrical devices.
2. Substitutions. No non-conforming sign shall be replaced with another nonconforming sign.
3. Modification to the Principal Building. Whenever the principal building on a site
on which a non-conforming sign is located is modified to the extent that site plan
review and approval is required, the non-conforming sign shall be removed.
E. Appeals. Any party who has been refused a sign permit for a proposed permanent sign
may file an appeal with the Zoning Board of Appeals, in accordance with Section 16.50
C., of this Ordinance. In determining whether a variance is appropriate, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall study the sign proposal, giving consideration to any extraordinary
circumstances, such as those listed below, that would cause practical difficulty in
complying with this Article. The presence of any of the circumstances listed may be
sufficient to justify granting a variance; however, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
decline to grant a variance, even if certain of the circumstances are present:
1. The allowed signage could not be easily seen by passing motorists due to the
configuration of existing buildings, trees or other obstructions.
2. The allowed signage could not be seen be passing motorists in sufficient time to
permit for safe deceleration and exit. In determining whether such
circumstances exist, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider the standards
established in the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(MMUTCD) and any more current Federal, State or credible private research
related to signage and traffic safety.
3. Existing signs on nearby parcels would substantially reduce the visibility or
advertising impact of a conforming sign on the subject parcel.
4. Construction of a conforming sign would require removal or severe alteration to
natural features on the parcel, such as, but not limited to, removal of trees,
alteration of the natural topography, filling of wetlands or obstruction of a
natural drainage course.
5. Construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the vision of motorists or
otherwise endanger the health or safety of passersby.
6. Variance from certain sign regulations would be offset by increased building
setback, increased landscaping or other such enhancements, so that the net
effect is an improvement in appearance of the parcel, compared to the result
that would otherwise be achieved with construction of a conforming sign. 
City of Milan 14 - 29 Article 14
7. A sign which exceeds the permitted height or area standards of this Article
would be more appropriate in scale because of the large size or frontage of the
parcel or building.

SECTION 3.50 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
A. Purpose and Intent: In the interest of insuring compliance with the Zoning Ordinance provisions, protecting the natural resources and the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City and future users or inhabitants of an area for which a site plan for a proposed use has been submitted, the City may require the applicant to deposit a performance guarantee for any or all site improvements required by this Ordinance. The purpose of the performance guarantee is to insure completion of improvements connected with the proposed use as required by this Ordinance, including but not limited to, roadways, lighting, utilities, sidewalks, drainage, fences, walls, screens, and landscaping.
A performance guarantee may be a certified check or an irrevocable bank letter of credit, in the amount of the cost of the improvements based upon an estimate submitted by the applicant and verified by the City. The City shall be authorized to employ the City Engineering Department and/or City consultants to review cost estimates and conduct periodic inspection of the progress of improvements.
B. Procedure:
1. When a performance guarantee is required, said performance guarantee shall be deposited with the City Clerk prior to the issuance of a building permit for the development and use of the land. Upon the deposit of the performance guarantee, the City shall issue the appropriate building permit, and the City shall thereafter deposit the performance guarantee, if in the form of a certified check in an interest bearing account to the applicant.
2. At the time the performance guarantee is deposited with the City and prior to the issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with the City incorporating the performance guarantee provisions.
3. The agreement shall also prescribe the period of time within which the improvements for which the performance guarantee has been required are to be completed. The period will begin from the date of the issuance of the building permit.
4. In the event the performance guarantee deposited is a cash deposit or a certified check, the City shall rebate to the applicant fifty percent (50%) of the deposited funds when the applicant has completed seventy-five percent (75%) of the required improvements as confirmed by the City. The remaining fifty percent (50%) of the deposited funds shall be returned when the applicant has
City of Milan 3 - 5 Article 3
completed one hundred percent (100%) of the required improvements and there is compliance with the Ordinance as confirmed by the City.
5. The return of the performance guarantee, as set forth above, shall be with interest earned thereon. However, the City is not required to deposit the performance guarantee in an interest-bearing account, and instead is able to use internal accounts as long as any interest can be calculated.
6. An amount not to exceed the actual cost of the installation of landscape materials may be retained by the City for at least one (1) year following the installation of said materials to ensure property maintenance and, if necessary, replacement. This amount shall be released to the applicant upon certification by the Building Official that all landscape materials are being maintained in good condition.
7. Prior to the acceptance of the public improvement by the City and upon the recommendation of the City Engineer, the Building Official shall require a maintenance bond for the public improvements in an amount not to exceed thirty-five (35%) percent of the total cost of the improvement and to remain in effect for a period not to exceed three (3) years.
8. In the event the applicant defaults in making the improvements for which the performance guarantee was required within the time period established by the City, the City shall have the right to use the performance guarantee deposited, and any interest earned thereon to complete the improvements through contract or otherwise, including specifically, the right to enter upon the subject property to make the improvements.
9. If the performance guarantee is not sufficient to allow the City to complete the improvements for which such guarantee was posted, the applicant shall be required to pay the City the amount by which the cost of completing the improvements exceeds the amount of the performance guarantee deposit. Should the City use the performance guarantee, or a portion thereof, to complete the required improvements, any amounts remaining after said completion shall be applied first to the City's administrative costs including, without limitation, attorney fees, planning consultant fees, and engineering consultant fees in completing the improvement with any balance remaining being refunded to the applicant.
C. Guarantee with Other Agencies: If the applicant has been required to post a performance guarantee or bond with another governmental agency other than the City to insure completion of an improvement associated with the site, the applicant shall not be required to deposit with the City a performance guarantee for that same improvement.

SECTION 4.130 I-R, INDUSTRIAL/RESEARCH DISTRICT
A. Intent: The I-R, Industrial Research District is intended to provide areas for industrial-research and office uses in planned developments that may have limited external impacts. Such districts are to be located and developed so as to complement the significant light industrial character of the community while at the same time provide for the necessary related non-manufacturing uses such as corporate office and research facilities. The I-R District is intended to encourage the development of uses and services that will support and enhance the office environment in the I-R District, primarily for the benefit of tenants and local residents. Further, the Industrial Research District is intended to provide for those major industrial-research, office and training uses which require proximity to major non-residential areas, rather than office uses serving a local market, which could reasonably be located in commercial and service areas elsewhere in the community.
The general goals of the I-R District include, but are not limited to:
1. Provide sufficient space in appropriate locations to meet the needs of the municipalitys expected future economy for alloy types of light manufacturing, research, testing and related uses.
2. Protect adjacent residential districts by separating them from manufacturing activities.
3. Promote development of manufacturing and research which is free from danger of fire, explosions, toxic and noxious matter, radiation and other hazards, and from
City of Milan 4 - 22 Article 4
excessive offensive noise, vibration, smoke, odor and other objectionable influences.
4. Protect the character of the district by establishing a uniform pattern of architectural design to conserve the value of land and buildings, both within the district and in adjoining districts to promote development within the district.
B. Use Regulations: Section 4.170 sets forth permitted, accessory and special land uses in the I-R District.
C. Dimensional Requirements: For all developments in the I-R District, the following dimensional requirements shall apply:

SECTION 4.160 PUD, PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
A. Intent: This district is established to permit greater flexibility and consequently more creative design of various types of development than are possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is the intention of the associated provisions to allow flexible land use composition and design without sacrificing the basic principles of sound planning practice. The basic zoning districts and their permitted uses as established in this Ordinance will form the land use base for designing a combination of uses permitted in each district in the form of clustering principal uses and activities at a higher density than would otherwise be possible under the respective district regulations on a preferred portion of a parcel while maintaining the overall density of development of the parcels consistent with the district regulations. Another option would be to combine the planning of land uses and activities from several districts as one project on the same clustering principle.
See Article 11 for specific use regulations.
SECTION 4.170 SCHEDULE OF USE REGULATIONS
A. In all Districts, no building or land shall be used and no building shall be erected except for one (1) or more of the following specified uses, unless otherwise provided in this Ordinance.
B. The Schedule of Use Regulations identifies uses as follows:
1. P identifies uses permitted by right.
2. C identifies uses requiring conditional approval.
3. A identifies accessory uses.
4. NP identifies uses that are not permitted.

Supp. No. 2
City of Milan 5 - 1 Article 5
ARTICLE 5  DOWNTOWN FORM-BASED CODE DISTRICTS (DFBC), D-1 & D-2
SECTION 5.10 INTENT
The Zoning Ordinance regulates the intensity and use of development, which is appropriate in most parts of the City. There are also areas within the City in which greater emphasis on regulating form and character of development should be considered as well as use and intensity of use. The Downtown Form-Based Code (DFBC) Districts use form-based provisions to accomplish this, with a special sensitivity to the contextual relevance of two (2) unique downtown sub-districts within the overall DFBC. This unique zoning district allows the City to regulate land use in a more flexible format for this specific area to encourage a viable, dynamic mix of uses.
Physically, the DFBC is intended to promote a unified vision for supporting the historic commercial core of the City of Milan focused on increased and maintained land use intensity and improved public amenities that are oriented as much to the needs of the pedestrian as to those of the automobile. The flexibility in use regulation inherent in the overall DFBC regulations, paired with the prescriptive physical development regulations in this Section will result in a compact, walkable environment that creates new opportunities for investment while protecting quality attributes of the existing area.
Specifically, the DFBC will do the following:
A. Ensure that development is of human scale, primarily pedestrian-oriented and designed to create attractive streetscapes and pedestrian spaces.
B. Promote mixed-use development in both a horizontal and vertical form.
C. Ensure reasonable transition between higher intensity development and adjacent neighborhoods.
D. Provide economic development opportunities by allowing a wider range of potential uses and creative redevelopment techniques that will expand the employment base and value of land.
E. Provide a simple, predictable, efficient way to allow complex, innovative development that would otherwise require special planning procedures.
F. Encourage the incubation of a residential element within the traditional Downtown to foster a twenty-four (24)-hour community.
G. Establish a development pattern in which new buildings and building modifications enhance the character of the existing built environment.
City of Milan 5 - 2 Article 5
H. Orient building entrances and storefronts to the street to add visual interest, put eyes on the street for enhanced crime surveillance, increase pedestrian traffic, and create memorable outdoor spaces.
I. Limit the impact of off-street parking areas which interrupt the flow and consistency of the street wall.
J. Enhance a sense of place and contribute to the sustainability of the City.
K. Allow a pattern of development which will encourage transportation alternatives (walking, biking and transit) to reduce automobile dependence and fuel consumption.
L. Visually distinguish the Downtown from the rest of Milan by encouraging full use of property, consistency and density while respecting adjacent residential areas.
SECTION 5.20 APPLICABILITY AND ORGANIZATION
A. Any new use or expansion of an existing use, unless otherwise noted herein, shall comply with the requirements of this Article and other applicable requirements of this Ordinance.
B. The requirements of this Article shall not apply to:
1. Continuation of a permitted use within an existing structure.
2. Reoccupation of an existing building with a permitted use.
3. The expansion of an existing structure, whether conforming or legal non-conforming, by less than five hundred (500) square feet or five percent (5%), whichever is less, when the building will be occupied or reoccupied by a permitted use.
4. Changes of use within existing structures provided the new use is permitted in the sub-district of the DFBC where the site is located.
5. Normal repair and maintenance of existing structures that do not increase its size.
6. Continuation of a legal non-conforming use, building, and/or structure.
C. The DFBC is divided into two (2) sub-districts. These two (2) sub-districts are identified as the Downtown Core (D-1) and Downtown Edge (D-2). These sub-districts are identified on the Zoning Map as separate and distinct sub-districts within the overall DFBC zoning classification.
D. This Article contains a set of regulations unique to the DFBC. Specifically, these include:
City of Milan 5 - 3 Article 5
1. General standards that apply to all DFBC properties in both sub-districts. These include special provisions for parking and landscape and streetscape elements.
2. Permitted uses table that provides for a dynamic mix of uses throughout both sub-districts.
3. Design standards applicable to all DFBC properties.
4. Form-based dimensional requirements for the D-1 and D-2 sub-districts. These include special provisions not found in other zoning districts, including:
a. Minimum and maximum height;
b. Required building lines and setback lines;
c. Exemptions and modifications from form-based provisions for streetscape elements;
d. Parking location; and
e. Lot coverage and open space.
SECTION 5.30 STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO D-1 & D-2
SUB-DISTRICTS
A. Parking: Parking shall not be required in the D-1 sub-district. Parking shall be provided for D-2 sub-district sites in accordance with the provisions of Article 13. When provided on-site, whether required or not required, parking must comply with the following:
1. When parking is located in a side yard (behind the front building line) but fronts on a required building line, no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total sites linear feet along the required building line or sixty (60) feet, whichever is greater, shall be occupied by parking.
2. For a corner lot or lot with multiple frontages, no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total sites linear feet along the required building line or sixty (60) feet, whichever is greater, shall be occupied by parking on both frontages.
B. Landscape and Streetscape. Landscape and streetscape elements shall be required in accordance with Section 13.20 and the following. Whenever provisions of Section 13.20 may conflict with provisions of Article 5, the provision of Article 5 shall prevail:
1. Street furniture shall be provided at a ratio of one (1) element for every thirty (30) linear feet of frontage along a right-of-way. Street furniture may be located in the right-of-way or on private property, provided they are located between the front
City of Milan 5 - 4 Article 5
building line and the back-of-curb. A five (5)-foot width of walkable area between the building and curb must be maintained. Permitted street furniture features include:
a. A permanently mounted seating fixture constructed of decorative metal.
b. A permanently reserved planting bed with defined, durable edges. Such beds must be a minimum of twenty (20) square feet in area and should be raised or protected from the surrounding paved areas by a durable curb, edge, or other designed feature. Planting beds must be planted with hardy plants and general areas within planting beds must be planted with groundcover to reduce soil loss.
c. Waste receptacle constructed of decorative metal.
2. Parking areas which front a right-of-way shall be screened from the public right-of-way by a thirty (30)-inch decorative masonry wall. Such wall may be located directly along the front property line or may be recessed and buffered by a landscape bed three (3) feet in depth.
SECTION 5.40 USES PERMITTED
Authorized uses are identified in Table 5.40-1.
If a use is not listed but is similar to other uses within a category, the Zoning Official may make the interpretation that the use is similar to other uses. The Zoning Official may also make the determination whether the similar use is permitted by right, as a use subject to conditional use approval, not permitted, or permitted subject to use-specific conditions. The Zoning Official may obtain a recommendation from the Planning Commission as to whether or not the proposed use is similar to a specific use and whether the use is permitted by right, as a conditional land use, not permitted, or permitted on the upper floors only.

SECTION 5.50 DESIGN STANDARDS
In addition to standards set forth in this Article, all proposed development in the DFBC shall comply with the standards set forth herein.
A. Building Design and Materials:
1. Overall Design: It is the intent of this Article to improve the appearance of and add visual interest to the DFBC. Emphasis shall be placed upon methods that focus attention on attractive buildings that front on the adjacent right-of-way.
2. Materials. Durable building materials, simple configurations, and solid craftsmanship are required. Fifty percent (50%) of walls visible from public streets, exclusive of wall areas devoted to meeting transparency and ground story activation requirements, shall be constructed of brick, glass, fiber cement siding, metal (beams, lintels, trim elements, and ornamentation only), wood flap, stucco, split-faced block, or stone. Exterior Insulation Finishing Systems (E.I.F.S) and vinyl or aluminum siding should only be used for accents.
B. Façade Variation: The maximum linear length of an uninterrupted building façade facing public streets and/or parks shall be thirty (30) feet. Façade articulation or architectural design variations for building walls facing the street are required to ensure that the building is not monotonous in appearance. Building wall offsets (projections and recesses); cornices, varying building materials or pilasters shall be used to break up the mass of a single building.
C. Ground Story Activation:
1. Transparency:
a. The first floors of all buildings shall be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-scale activity and crime prevention techniques. It is intended that this be accomplished principally by the use of windows and doors arranged so that active uses within the building are visible from or accessible to the street, and parking areas are visible to occupants of the building. The first floor of any front façade facing a right-of-way shall be no less than fifty percent (50%) windows and doors, and the minimum transparency for facades facing a side street, side yard, or parking area shall be no less than thirty percent (30%) of the façade.
b. Transparency requirements shall not apply to sides which abut an alley.
c. Windows for building sides shall be concentrated toward the front edge of the building, in locations most visible from an urban open space or public right-of-way.
City of Milan 5 - 9 Article 5
2. Transparency Alternatives: The following alternatives may be used singularly or in combination. They may count toward no more than eighty percent (80%) of the transparency requirement.
a. Wall Design: Wall designs that provide visual interest and pedestrian-scale may count as a transparency alternative if they provide a minimum of three (3) of the following elements, occurring at intervals no greater than twenty-five (25) feet horizontally and ten (10) feet vertically:
i. Expression of structural system and infill panels through change in plane not less than three (3) inches.
ii. System of horizontal and vertical scaling elements such as: belt course, string courses, cornice, pilasters, and the like.
iii. System of horizontal and vertical reveals not less than one (1) inch in width/depth.
iv. Variations in material module, pattern, and/or color.
v. System of integrated architectural ornamentation.
vi. Green screen or planter walls.
vii. Translucent, fritted, patterned or colored glazing.
b. Outdoor Dining/Seating: Outdoor dining/seating located between the building and the primary street zone lot line may count toward the transparency requirement. Such spaces must be permanently created by a wall or other permanent improvement defining the outdoor dining area. Permit must be obtained from the Building Department prior to operation of outdoor dining/seating area.
c. Permanent Art. Non-commercial art or graphic design of sufficient scale and orientation to be perceived from the public right-of-way and rendered in materials or media appropriate to an exterior, urban environment and permanently integrated into the building wall may count toward the transparency requirement.
D. Pedestrian Access/Entrance:
1. The primary entrance for a non-residential and/or mixed-use building shall be clearly identifiable and useable and located facing the right-of-way.
2. A pedestrian connection shall provide a clear, obvious, publicly-accessible connection between the primary street upon which the building fronts and the building. The pedestrian connection shall comply with the following:
Supp. No. 2
City of Milan 5 - 10 Article 5
a. Fully paved and maintained surface not less than five (5) feet in width.
b. Unit pavers or concrete distinct from the surrounding parking and drive lane surface.
c. Located either within a raised median or between wheel stops to protect pedestrians from vehicle overhangs where parking is adjacent.
3. Additional Entrances: If a parking area is located in the rear or side yard, it must also have a direct pedestrian entrance to the building that is of a level of materials, quality and design emphasis at least equal to that of the primary entrance.
4. Direct vehicular access to a building within the DFBC from the right-of-way is prohibited.
SECTION 5.60 FORM-BASED REGULATIONS
A. Downtown Core (D-1) Sub-District: Downtown core buildings and sites will be developed in a manner which contributes to the character of the area by maximizing the value of the property and continues to the traditional street wall of adjacent historic buildings. D-1 sites must comply with the following regulations:

ARTICLE 12  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS
SECTION 12.10 SUSTAINABLE DESIGN OPTION
The intent of this Article is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare and improve the site design and visual appearance of the City by requiring consistent standards for such site elements as landscaping, lighting, parking, loading, and site access.
A. Intent: It is the intent of this Section to promote environmentally sustainable and energy efficient design and development practices for the construction of new and the rehabilitation of existing buildings and sites within the City. The purpose of these regulations is to provide various incentives that will achieve the following:
1. Encourage the reuse of existing buildings and redevelopment of existing sites.
2. Conserve natural resources.
3. Reduce the use of energy in both construction and daily operations.
4. Foster a mix of uses and pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit use.
B. Eligibility: Any project for which site plan review is required, including subdivisions and site condominiums, may apply for qualifications as a Sustainable Design Project (SDP).
C. Effect of Qualifications as a Sustainable Design Project: There are provisions identified throughout the Zoning Ordinance where the use of sustainable design measures may be used to satisfy, modify, or replace a specific requirement. Once prequalified as a SDP, the use of a sustainable design measure to satisfy a specific Ordinance requirement is authorized. Approval of a site plan with a modification permitted under this Section shall be considered the formal approval of the SDP status of the project.
D. Procedure:
1. An application for a SDP may be obtained from the Building Department. An applicant seeking qualification as a SDP shall submit a complete SDP application, accompanied by a complete SDP checklist and supportive narrative which verifies how specific measures will be achieved, to the Building/Zoning Official.
2. Qualification as a SDP is based upon the use of specific measures to offset the
City of Milan 12 - 2 Article 12
potential impact of modifying specific areas of the Ordinance. The SDP checklist identifies potential sustainable design measures eligible to modify specific provisions of the Ordinance.
3. Applications for a SDP shall be reviewed by the Sustainable Design Review Committee, which shall consist of the City Administrator, City Engineer, Building/Zoning Official, and two (2) members of the Planning Commission designated by the City Administrator. The Sustainable Design Review Committee may request the review of a SDP application by consultants with specific expertise in sustainable design.
4. Upon completion of the review, the Sustainable Design Review Committee shall make a determination whether a project meets the qualifications as a SDP. If the committee makes a positive determination, the project will have Prequalified SDP status, which will make the project automatically eligible for the requested modification during site plan review and approval. Approval of a site plan with a modification permitted under this Section shall be considered the formal approval of the SDP status of the project.
SECTION 12.20 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
A. Intent: The intent of this Section is to encourage the use of structural, vegetative or managerial practices, commonly referred to as best management practices (BMPs), designed to treat, prevent, or reduce degradation of water quality due to storm water runoff. All development projects subject to site plan review shall use best management practices (BMPs) to prevent flooding, protect water quality, reduce soil erosion, maintain and improve wildlife habitat, and contribute to the aesthetic values of the project. The particular facilities and measures required on-site shall reflect and incorporate existing grade, natural features, wetlands and watercourses on the site to the maximum extent feasible.
B. Sustainable Design: While stormwater management is required to meet the City Engineering Standards, certain BMPs may be used to satisfy qualification as a Sustainable Design Project, as set forth in Section 12.10.
C. Stormwater Management: All stormwater management plans shall meet the Engineering Standards adopted by the City as determined by the City Engineer, and shall utilize nonstructural control techniques to the maximum extent feasible, including, but not limited to:
1. Limitation of land disturbance and grading.
2. Maintenance of vegetated buffers and natural vegetation.
City of Milan 12 - 3 Article 12
3. Minimization of impervious surfaces.
4. Use of terraces, contoured landscapes, runoff spreaders, grass or rock-lined swales.
5. Use of infiltration devices.
D. General Standards:
1. Sites shall be designed and managed utilizing Low Impact Development techniques to emulate the natural water cycle, and maintain local and regional hydrologic patterns. The Low Impact Development Manual for Michigan, published by the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) provides guidance for the designer and developer.
2. Stormwater management systems shall be designed to prevent flooding and the degradation of water quality related to stormwater runoff and soil erosion from proposed development.
3. All new development and redevelopment of properties shall include on-site storage of stormwater. Facilities shall be designed to provide a volume of storage and discharge rate which meets the standards of the City.
4. Priority shall be placed on site design which maintains natural drainage patterns and watercourses. Alterations to natural drainage patterns shall not create flooding or degradation of water quality for adjacent or downstream property owners.
5. The use of swales and buffer strips vegetated with desirable native materials is encouraged as a method of stormwater conveyance so as to decrease runoff velocity, allow for bio-filtration, allow suspended sediment particles to settle and to remove pollutants. Tolerance for water saturation, sunlight, pesticides, metals, and salts shall be required in determining appropriate plantings in these areas.
6. Where large amounts of grease and oil may accumulate, as in the case of commercial/industrial developments and large areas of impervious surfaces for parking, oil separators shall be required.
7. For sites that store or use chemicals, a spill response plan shall be submitted and approved by the City.
City of Milan 12 - 4 Article 12
E. Use of Wetlands: Wetlands may be used for stormwater management, provided applicable permits are obtained from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment and/or the appropriate federal agency.

City of Milan 13 - 1 Article 13
ARTICLE 13  SITE DESIGN STANDARDS
SECTION 13.10 INTENT
The intent of this Article is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare and improve the site design and visual appearance of the City by requiring consistent standards for such site elements as landscaping, lighting, parking, loading, and site access.
Whenever in the Ordinance a greenbelt or planting is required, it shall be planted to completion within three (3) months, and no later than November 30, from the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy if said certificate is issued during the April 1-September 30 period; if the certificate is issued during the October 1-March 31 period, the planting shall be completed no later than the ensuing May 31.
Plantings shall thereafter be reasonably maintained, including permanence and health of plant materials to provide a screen to abutting properties and including the absence of weeds and refuse. Spacing, as required by this Section, shall be provided in any greenbelt or planting.
SECTION 13.20 LANDSCAPING
A. Where Required: A separate, detailed landscape plan shall be submitted as part of the site plan review and tentative preliminary plat review.
1. Plan Requirements. The landscape plan shall be drawn to the same scale as required in Article 8, Site Plan Review, shall demonstrate that all requirements of this Section are met, and shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the information set forth in this Section. The Building/Zoning Official shall have the authority to waive the requirements for certain information set forth below if it is determined that such information does not affect compliance with this Ordinance.
a. The professional seal of the licensed landscape architect who prepared the plan for sites of one (1) acre or greater;
b. Topographic and grading information, as required in Article 8, Site Plan Review;
c. The location, spacing, size, number and root type (bare root (BR), balled and burlapped (BB), pot (P), or container (C)) and botanical and common name for each plant type proposed for use within the required landscape area;
d. Typical straight cross section including slope, height, and width of berms and type of ground cover, or height and type of construction of wall, including footings;
City of Milan 13 - 2 Article 13
e. Construction and grading details to resolve specific site conditions, such as tree wells to preserve existing trees or culverts to maintain natural drainage patterns;
f. Planting details in either text or drawing form to ensure proper installation and establishment of proposed plant materials;
g. Identify existing trees and vegetative cover to be preserved;
h. Identify a landscape maintenance program including a statement that all diseased, damaged, or dead materials shall be replaced in accordance with the standards of this Ordinance.
2. Composition.
a. Plant materials shall be of generally acceptable varieties and species, free from insects and diseases, hardy to Monroe/Washtenaw Counties, conform to the current minimum standards for nursery stock of the American Nursery and Landscape Association and shall have proof of any required governmental regulations and/or inspections.
b. A mixture of live plant material, such as evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs, is required as a protective measure against insect and disease infestation. Artificial plant materials are prohibited. A limited mixture of hardy species is recommended rather than a large quantity of different species to produce a more aesthetic, cohesive design and avoid a disorderly arrangement. Additionally, native species of trees and shrubs shall constitute at least fifty percent (50%) of the total proposed plantings in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 13.20.A.7.
3. Berms. Berms shall be constructed with slopes not to exceed a one to three (1:3) gradient. Berm slopes shall be protected with sod, seed, or other form of natural ground cover.
4. Coordination with Utilities. Provision shall be made to coordinate landscaping with existing and proposed underground and overhead utility lines so as to avoid interference with plant growth.
5. Existing Trees. The preservation and incorporation of existing trees in a landscape plan is encouraged. Where existing trees are used to satisfy the requirements of this Section, the following requirements shall apply:
a. Paving, or other site improvements, shall not encroach upon the dripline of the existing tree(s) to be preserved.
b. If existing plant material is labeled "To Remain" on site plans by the applicant or required by the City, protective techniques, such as, but not limited to, fencing or barriers placed at the dripline around the perimeter
City of Milan 13 - 3 Article 13
of the plant material shall be installed during construction. No vehicle or other construction equipment shall be parked or stored within the dripline of any plant material intended to be saved. Other protective techniques may be used provided such techniques are approved by the City.
c. In the event that healthy trees which are used to meet the minimum requirements of this Ordinance or those labeled to remain are cut down, destroyed, damaged, or excavated at the dripline, as determined by the City, the applicant shall replace them with trees which are either equivalent in size or replace the total diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) of the trees which have been removed.
6. Stormwater Retention and Detention Ponds. The integration of stormwater management systems, including bio-swales, rain gardens, and retention and detention ponds in the overall landscape concept shall be required. Stormwater management systems that replicate a natural design and appearance shall be encouraged.
7. Use of Native Plants in Landscaping.
a. Native plant species chosen for a development shall be based on the native species currently growing on the site, if any.
b. The arrangement of native plant species may be designed in both natural arrangements and more conventional arrangements.
c. Natural arrangements emulate the arrangements found in nature, and have a less manicured appearance. Natural arrangements shall incorporate a wide mix of species. This landscape style shall be used for landscaping open space, surface stormwater systems, street tree plantings, and/or parks. If natural arrangements are used, plant spacing requirements may be waived as long as the function the plants are to serve is accomplished.
d. Conventional, more formal arrangements are generally used close to buildings or heavily used areas of a site. Native species may be used in these areas just as any other commercially-available landscape material. As with any landscape design, the plants ultimate size, soil and site requirements, and other characteristics shall be considered to ensure they do not overwhelm a space, encroach into walkways, or impede sight distance or visibility of motorists. In entryways, where aesthetics is of primary importance, cultivars of native plant species may be considered to ensure the plants appearance.
e. Plantings installed in areas used for stormwater management shall be planted with native species that specifically perform the necessary runoff
City of Milan 13 - 4 Article 13
attenuation, filtration, water uptake, and purification functions needed in such areas. Both herbaceous and woody species shall be incorporated into the mix where the desired function dictates.
8. Installation, Maintenance, and Completion.
a. All landscaping required by this Ordinance shall be planted before obtaining a certificate of occupancy or the appropriate financial surety as required in Article 3, Administration and Enforcement.
b. All landscaping and landscape elements shall be planted, and earth moving or grading performed, in a sound workmanlike manner, according to accepted planting and grading procedures.
c. Landscaping required by this Ordinance shall be maintained in a reasonably healthy condition, free from refuse and debris. All unhealthy and dead material shall be replaced within one (1) year of damage or death or the next appropriate planting period, whichever comes first. All landscaped areas shall be provided with irrigation or a readily available and acceptable water supply.
d. Failure to install and maintain approved landscaping shall be considered a violation of this Ordinance.
B. Screening Between Land Uses.
1. Where Required. The use of physical barriers or screens is considered a necessary requirement to allow for the transition from one zoning district or land use to another contrasting zoning district or land use. This promotes compatibility with existing uses and helps to protect the value of buildings and property. The purpose of this section is to create varying degrees of visual and physical separation between divergent land uses based upon the similarity and/or compatibility of the uses.
2. Screen Requirements.
a. A landscape buffer shall be constructed to create a visual screen at least six (6) feet in height along all adjoining boundaries when a proposed use is either more intense or incompatible with an adjoining property, as set forth in Table 13.20-B. A landscape buffer shall consist of berms and living materials so as to maintain a minimum opacity of approximately eighty percent (80%). Opacity shall be measured by observation of any two (2) square yard area of landscape screen between one (1) foot above the established grade of the area to be concealed and the top or the highest point of the required screen. The plantings must meet this standard based upon reasonably anticipated growth over a period of three (3) years.
City of Milan 13 - 5 Article 13
b. The width of the screen area, location and density of plantings shall be based upon the specific characteristics of the proposed use and adjacent land uses.
i. Plants shall be arranged in a staggered pattern to create a continuous screen.
ii. Existing vegetation which is located on the property to be developed within the area of the proposed screen, is in good condition, and meets the size and type requirements in the various screening alternatives may be counted toward meeting screening requirements.
iii. Screening shall be located along all adjoining boundaries. However, the width and location of the screening may be modified due to site conditions, provided the intent of screening requirements are met.
c. Landscape Screening Schedule. Landscape screening alternatives are established in Table 13.20-A. The application of these landscape screening alternatives shall be controlled by Table 13.20-B, Landscape Screening Schedule. Table 13.20-B describes the required screening on the lot of the use indicated in the left column of the schedule where it is contiguous to land used or zoned as indicated across the top of the schedule. The numbers in the middle columns refer to the landscape screening alternatives described in Table 13.20-A, below, and illustrated in Figures 13.20-A through C.

3. Side or rear parking lot setbacks may be reduced or waived where a shared access driveway, connected parking lots, and/or internal service drives are provided.
F. Flexibility in Application.
City of Milan 13 - 26 Article 13
1. The City recognizes that, due to the specific requirements of any given development, inflexible application of the parking standards may result in development with inadequate parking or parking far in excess of that which is needed. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or unauthorized parking on adjacent streets or neighboring sites. The latter situation may result in excessive paving and stormwater runoff and a waste of space which could be left as open space. Projects with Prequalified Sustainable Development Project (SDP) status are automatically eligible for a parking deviation, provided the measures proposed for SDP status are so qualified for that purpose.
2. The City may grant deviations from off-street parking requirements. These deviations may require more or less parking based upon a finding that such deviations are more likely to provide a sufficient number of parking spaces to accommodate the specific characteristics of the use in question. In the event that a deviation is granted, the following shall apply:
a. An applicant may request a parking deviation as part of a development application or as a separate and distinct action with no other concurrent request.
b. The applicant shall provide a parking study with adequate detail and information to assist the City in determining the appropriateness of the request.
c. A parking deviation may be included in an action on a concurrent request or be made separately by resolution.
d. The City may attach conditions to the approval of a deviation from the off-street parking requirements that bind such approval to the specific use in question.
e. The City may require the applicant to set aside area for reserve parking (landbanking) that can be constructed as needed, although this is not a prerequisite for the approval or a deviation. Where an area is set aside for reserve parking, it shall be easily developed, not devoted to a use other than open space, and shall be designed to accommodate attendant facilities such as maneuvering lanes and drainage.
3. It is the intent of this Ordinance to minimize excessive areas of pavement which reduces aesthetic standards and contributes to high rates of storm water runoff. Exceeding the minimum parking space requirements by more than twenty percent (20%) shall only be allowed with approval by the City. In granting such additional space, the City shall determine that such parking will be required, based on documented evidence, to accommodate the use on a typical day.
G. Schedule of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall be determined by the type of use in accordance with Table 13.60-A.
City of Milan 13 - 27 Article 13
For uses not specifically listed below, the required parking shall be in accordance with that of a similar use as determined by the Zoning Administrator, or determined by the Planning Commission during site plan review based on documentation regarding the specific parking needs of the use.

1. Minimizing Pedestrian/Vehicular Conflicts. Physical separation of pedestrian and vehicular access is the most effective means of avoiding conflicts and unsafe conditions. Where complete separation of pedestrians and vehicles is not possible, potential hazards shall be minimized by the use of techniques such as special paving, grade separations, pavement marking, signs or striping, bollards, pedestrian safety island, landscaping, lighting or other traffic calming measures to clearly delineate pedestrian areas, for both day and night use.
2. Multi-Use Paths. Where bicycle paths are required or are specifically part of a site plan and pedestrians and bicyclist share walkways, the pedestrian/bicycle system shall be designed to be wide enough to easily accommodate the amount of pedestrian and bicycle traffic volumes that are anticipated. The minimum width shall meet American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines and applicable City Engineering design standards.
3. Curb Cuts and Ramps. Curb cuts and ramps shall be located at convenient, safe locations for the physically disabled, for bicyclists and for people pushing strollers or carts. The location and design of curb cuts and ramps shall comply with the Michigan Barrier-Free Code and the Americans with Disabilities Act Standards for Accessible Design.
4. Site Amenities. Development plans shall include site amenities that enhance safety and convenience and promote walking or bicycling as an alternative means of transportation. Site amenities may include bike racks, drinking fountains, canopies and benches. However, all sites with parking of ten (10) spaces or greater shall provide a bike rack for at least two (2) bicycles within fifty (50) feet of the building entrance.
5. Walkways.
a. Walkways within the site shall directly connect points of pedestrian origin and destination. Walkways shall not be located based only on the outline
City of Milan 13 - 36 Article 13
of a parking lot if it does not provide direct pedestrian access. Walkways shall either be grade separated from parking lots or clearly delineated to avoid pedestrian/vehicular conflicts.
b. Where it is necessary for the pedestrian access to cross maneuvering aisles or internal roadways, the crossings shall emphasize and place priority on pedestrian access and safety. The pedestrian crossings must be well-marked, using such measures as pavement treatments, signs, striping, signals, lighting, pedestrian safety islands, landscaping and other traffic calming techniques.
City of Milan 14 - 1 Article 14
ARTICLE 14 - SIGNS
SECTION 14.10 PURPOSE, AUTHORITY AND FINDINGS
The intent of this Article is to regulate signs and outdoor advertising within the City to protect public safety, health and welfare; minimize abundance and size of signs to reduce visual clutter, motorist distraction and loss of visibility; promote public convenience; preserve property values; and enhance the aesthetic appearance and quality of life within the City.
The regulation and standards of this Article are considered the minimum amount of regulation necessary to achieve a substantial government interest for public safety, traffic safety, aesthetics, protection of property values, and are intended to be content neutral. These objectives are accomplished by establishing the minimum amount of regulations necessary concerning the size, placement, construction, illumination, and other aspects of signs in the City so as to:
A. First Amendment Rights: Protect the public right to express and receive messages, especially, noncommercial messages such as religious, political, social, philosophical and other types of information protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Nothing in this Article is intended to limit the expression of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
B. Safety: The requirements of this Section, including without limitation those with regard to placement, installation, maintenance, size and location of signs are intended to minimize distractions to motorists, maintain unobstructed vision for motorists, protect pedestrians, and otherwise minimize any threat to public health or safety.
C. Aesthetics: Signs should enhance the aesthetic appeal of the City. Thus, these regulations are intended to:
1. Regulate signs that are out-of-scale with surrounding buildings and structures.
2. Prevent an excessive accumulation of signs.
3. Encourage signs that enhance the appearance and value of business districts.
4. Limit off-premises advertising signs which the City Council and the Planning Commission have found to constitute eyesores and to be deleterious to the well-being of the citizens and the economic development of the City, including development and promotion of tourism and the preservation of the Citys unique character and historical significance.
5. Recognize that different areas of the City require different sign regulations due to factors such as their intended audience (pedestrians, drivers, etc.) and their ability to help promote the character of an area.
City of Milan 14 - 2 Article 14
D. Equal Protection and Fairness: These regulations are designed to be fair to each property owner by establishing uniform standards that provide adequate exposure to the public for all property owners for both commercial and noncommercial speech and expression.
E. Land Use Planning Objectives: The placement and design of signs should further the land use planning objectives of the City, and protect neighborhood character and the value of surrounding properties. These regulations will advance these objectives by fostering economic development while preserving the Citys unique character and heritage.

SECTION 14.60 DESIGN STANDARDS
A. Construction Standards.
1. General Requirements. All permanent signs shall be designed and constructed in a stable and safe manner in accordance with the Citys adopted Building and Electrical Codes. All electrical wiring associated with a freestanding sign shall be installed underground.
2. Building Code Compliance. All permanent signs shall be designed to comply with minimum wind pressure and other requirements set forth in the adopted Building Code.
3. Framework. All signs attached to a structure shall be designed so that the supporting framework, other than the supporting elements on a freestanding sign, is contained within or behind the face of the sign or within the building to which the sign is attached so as to be totally screened from view.
B. Illumination. (Reference definitions for Flashing Signs and Illuminated Signs.)
1. General Requirements. All signs except for those in residential districts may be illuminated. If illumination is proposed, signs shall be externally illuminated only by steady, stationary, shielded light sources directed solely at the sign or by illumination internal to the sign.

i. Outline and dimensions of both faces are identical; and
ii. Faces are back-to-back so that only one (1) face is visible from any given direction.
iii. For freestanding signs, the area shall include the entire area of the sign face upon which copy, lettering, drawings, or photos can be placed. This shall include borders or framing, but shall exclude necessary uprights and supports. For freestanding signs which are mounted on a solid base, the base shall be excluded from the calculation of sign for a distance up to thirty (30) inches above grade.
iv. Cylindrical Signs. The area of a cylindrical ground sign shall be computed by multiplying the circumference of the cylinder by its height. (See the definition of Monolith Sign.)

b. Permanent Signs. It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, alter, relocate or structurally change a sign or other advertising structure, unless specifically exempted by this Article, without first obtaining a permit in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section. A permit shall require payment of a fee, which shall be established by the City Council. Permanent sign permits shall be issued within fifteen (15) business days.
c. Effect of Issuance. No permit for a sign issued under this Article shall be deemed to constitute permission or authorization to maintain an unlawful sign nor shall any permit issued hereunder constitute a defense in an action to abate an unlawful sign.

Sign permit applications submitted in conjunction with the proposed construction of a new building or addition to an existing building shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission for signs located within the PUD, GB, and HS zoning districts as part of the required site plan review. Proposed signs must be shown on the site plan. The applicant shall have the option of submitting sign applications to the Planning Commission under procedures which are separate from site plan review.
b. Building/Zoning Official Review. The Building/Zoning Official shall review the sign permit application for any sign proposed on a site or existing building where no other new construction is proposed.
c. Issuance of Permit. Following review and approval of a sign application by the Planning Commission or Building/Zoning Official, as appropriate, the Building/Zoning Official shall have the authority to issue a sign permit.
4. Exceptions. A sign shall not be enlarged or relocated, except in conformity with the provisions set forth in this Article for new signs, until a proper permit has been secured. However, a new permit shall not be required for ordinary servicing or repainting of an existing sign message, cleaning of a sign, name changes or changing of the message on the sign where the sign is designed for such changes. Furthermore, a permit shall not be required for certain exempt signs listed in Section 14.40.
B. Inspections and Maintenance.
1. Inspection of New Signs.
City of Milan 14 - 27 Article 14
a. All permanent signs for which a permit has been issued shall be inspected, when erected, by the Building/Zoning Official or his designee. Approval shall be granted only if the sign has been constructed in compliance with the approved plans and applicable standards of this Article and the building code.
b. In cases where fastenings or anchorages are to be eventually bricked in or otherwise enclosed, the sign erector shall advise the Building/Zoning Official when such fastenings are to be installed so that an inspection may be completed before such enclosure.
2. Inspection of Existing Signs. The Building/Zoning Official or his designee shall have the authority to routinely enter onto property to inspect existing signs. In conducting such inspections, the Building/Zoning Official shall determine whether the sign is adequately supported, painted to prevent corrosion and secured to the building or other support so as to safely bear the weight of the sign and pressure created by the wind.
3. Correction of Defects. If the Building/Zoning Official or designee finds that any sign is unsafe, insecure, improperly constructed or poorly maintained, the sign erector, owner of the sign or owner of the land shall make the sign safe and secure by completing any necessary reconstruction or repairs, or entirely remove the sign in accordance with the timetable established by the Building/Zoning Official.
C. Removal of Abandoned or Obsolete Signs. Abandoned or obsolete signs shall be removed by the owner, agent or person having use of the land, building or structure. Upon vacating a commercial or industrial establishment, facility or land the proprietor shall be responsible for removal of all abandoned or obsolete signs.
However, where a conforming sign structure and frame are typically reused by a current occupant in a leased or rented building, the building owner shall not be required to remove the sign structure and frame in the interim periods when the building is not occupied, provided that the sign structure and frame are maintained in good condition.
D. Non-Conforming Signs. No non-conforming sign shall be altered or reconstructed unless the alteration or reconstruction is in compliance with this Article, except that non-conforming signs shall comply with the following regulations.
1. Repairs and Maintenance. Normal maintenance shall be permitted, provided that any non-conforming sign that is destroyed by any means to an extent greater than fifty (50%) percent of the signs pre-catastrophe fair market value, exclusive of the foundation, shall not be reconstructed. Normal maintenance shall include painting of chipped or faded signs, replacement of faded or
City of Milan 14 - 28 Article 14
damaged surface panels, name changes, or repair or replacement of electrical wiring or electrical devices.
2. Substitutions. No non-conforming sign shall be replaced with another non-conforming sign.
3. Modification to the Principal Building. Whenever the principal building on a site on which a non-conforming sign is located is modified to the extent that site plan review and approval is required, the non-conforming sign shall be removed.
E. Appeals. Any party who has been refused a sign permit for a proposed permanent sign may file an appeal with the Zoning Board of Appeals, in accordance with Section 16.50 C., of this Ordinance. In determining whether a variance is appropriate, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall study the sign proposal, giving consideration to any extraordinary circumstances, such as those listed below, that would cause practical difficulty in complying with this Article. The presence of any of the circumstances listed may be sufficient to justify granting a variance; however, the Zoning Board of Appeals may decline to grant a variance, even if certain of the circumstances are present:
1. The allowed signage could not be easily seen by passing motorists due to the configuration of existing buildings, trees or other obstructions.
2. The allowed signage could not be seen be passing motorists in sufficient time to permit for safe deceleration and exit. In determining whether such circumstances exist, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider the standards established in the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MMUTCD) and any more current Federal, State or credible private research related to signage and traffic safety.
3. Existing signs on nearby parcels would substantially reduce the visibility or advertising impact of a conforming sign on the subject parcel.
4. Construction of a conforming sign would require removal or severe alteration to natural features on the parcel, such as, but not limited to, removal of trees, alteration of the natural topography, filling of wetlands or obstruction of a natural drainage course.
5. Construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the vision of motorists or otherwise endanger the health or safety of passersby.
6. Variance from certain sign regulations would be offset by increased building setback, increased landscaping or other such enhancements, so that the net effect is an improvement in appearance of the parcel, compared to the result that would otherwise be achieved with construction of a conforming sign.
City of Milan 14 - 29 Article 14
7. A sign which exceeds the permitted height or area standards of this Article would be more appropriate in scale because of the large size or frontage of the parcel or building.
City of Milan 15 - 1 Article 15
ARTICLE 15 - NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES
SECTION 15.10 INTENT
A. It is the purpose of this Article to provide regulations governing lots, buildings, structures and uses which were lawful prior to the enactment of this Ordinance, or amendments thereto, but which are regulated under the provisions of this Ordinance.
B. It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this Article and subsequent amendments, lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this Article was passed or amended which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments. Such uses are declared by this Article to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this Article that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same District.
C. The standards of this Article are intended to accomplish the following:
1. Eliminate nonconforming uses which are considered to be incompatible with permitted uses and encourage redevelopment into more conforming uses.
2. Permit legal nonconforming buildings, structures or uses to remain until they are discontinued or removed.
3. Encourage investment in surrounding neighborhoods by bringing nonconforming structures into compliance with this Ordinance.
4. Encourage upgrading of site elements such as site landscaping, parking, paving, signage, access, pedestrian circulation or other features of a site which were developed in compliance with the standards at the time of construction, but which do not meet current site standards.
5. Encourage combination of contiguous nonconforming lots of record to create lots which conform to current standards, are compatible with other lots in the appropriate zoning district, to promote public health, safety and welfare and to eliminate problems associated with over-crowding.
D. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to
City of Milan 15 - 2 Article 15
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Article provided progress has been diligently pursued and substantial construction has occurred.
E. The authorization of nonconformities that were legally established prior to enactment or amendment of this Ordinance to continue shall not apply to building structures or uses which were not legally established prior to the enactment or amendment of this Ordinance. Those nonconforming uses or nonconforming structures which have not been legally established shall be declared illegal and shall be discontinued at the effective date of this Ordinance.
SECTION 15.20 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
A. Use of Nonconforming Lots. In any District where single-family dwellings are permitted, any single lot of record existing at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Article that fails to meet the applicable Zoning District requirements for area or width, or both, shall be considered to be a nonconforming lot of record. A single-family dwelling and customary accessory dwellings may be constructed on a nonconforming lot of record provided setbacks and all other requirements of this Ordinance are met.
B. Nonconforming Contiguous Lots Under Same Ownership. If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots with contiguous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this Article, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established by this Article, the lots or combination of lots involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Article. No portion of said parcel shall be used or occupied in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this Article, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which creates a lot width or area below the requirements stated in this Article.
SECTION 15.30 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND
A lawful use of land or structure or land in combination existing at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Article that is no longer permissible under the terms of this Article as enacted or amended, shall be considered a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
A. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Article.
B. A nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Article.
City of Milan 15 - 3 Article 15
C. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
D. A nonconforming use that is replaced by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the District in which the use is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
E. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status.
F. An existing structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, or to bring the structure into greater conformity with the Ordinance.
G. A nonconforming use that is determined to be abandoned shall not be re-established, and any subsequent use shall conform to this Ordinance. A nonconforming use shall be determined to be abandoned if one or more of the following conditions exist:
1. The use ceases for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days.
2. Utilities, such as water, gas and electricity to the property have been disconnected.
3. The property, building, or grounds have fallen into disrepair in a manner which result in violation of applicable zoning and property maintenance codes, or would otherwise give the appearance of neglect or abandonment.
4. Signs or other indications of the existence of the nonconforming use have been removed.
5. Equipment or fixtures necessary for the operation of the nonconforming use have been removed.
6. Other actions, which in the opinion of the Building/Zoning Official, constitute an intention on the part of the property owner or lessee to abandon the nonconforming use.
SECTION 15.40 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
