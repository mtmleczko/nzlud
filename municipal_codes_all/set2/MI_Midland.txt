PREFACE 
    The City Code is a complete codification of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the City Council. The Code contains all ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole, except zoning ordinances. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, or relating to special purposes, such as levying special assessments, vacating streets, making appropriations, etc., are not included herein. For a more complete listing of the types of ordinances not included, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two (2) component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the sixteenth (16th) section of Chapter 19 is 19-16. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time, new sections may be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three (3) sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, the new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3. New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number. Thus, if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way, or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof as provided in Section 6 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference. 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which serve as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Ernest T. Buchanan, III, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to the City Manager, Fred L. Yockey, the City Clerk, Ken W. Lybolt, and the City Manager's Administrative Assistance, David W. Wirth, for their supervision, cooperation and interest during the progress of the work on this Code. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Midland, Michigan.

    Such regulations may include provisions as to the extent to which streets and other utility mains, piping, or other facilities shall be installed as a condition precedent to the approval of the plat. The regulations or practice of the commission may provide for a tentative approval of the plat previous to such installation; but any such tentative approval shall be revocable and shall not be entered on the plat. In lieu of the completion of such improvements and utilities prior to the final approval of the plat the commission may accept a bond with surety to secure to the municipality the actual construction and installation of such improvements or utilities at a time and according to specifications fixed by or in accordance with the regulations of the commission. The municipality is hereby granted the power to enforce such bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies.

A copy of such regulations shall be certified by the planning commission to the recorders of the counties in which the municipality and territory are located. 
Sec. 2-115. - Approval or disapproval of plats; procedure; effect. 
    The planning commission shall approve, modify or disapprove a plat within sixty (60) days after the submission thereof to it; otherwise such plat shall be deemed to have been approved, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the commission on demand. However, the applicant for the commission's approval may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of such period. The ground of disapproval of any plat shall be stated upon the records of the commission. Any plat submitted to the commission shall contain the name and address of a person to whom notice of a hearing shall be sent; and no plat shall be acted on by the commission without affording a hearing thereon. Notice shall be sent to the said address by registered mail of the time and place of such hearing not less than five (5) days before the date fixed therefor. Similar notice shall be mailed to the owners of land immediately adjoining the platted land, as their names appear upon the plats in the county auditor's office and their addresses appear in the directory of the municipality or on the tax records of the municipality or county. Every plat approved by the commission shall, by virtue of such approval, be deemed to be an amendment of or an addition to or a detail of the municipal plan and a part thereof. Approval of a plat shall not be deemed to constitute or affect an acceptance by the public of any street or other open space shown upon the plat. The planning commission may, from time to time, recommend to council amendments of the zoning ordinance or map or additions thereto to conform to the commission's recommendations for the zoning regulations of the territory comprised within approval subdivisions. The commission shall have power to agree with the applicant upon use, height, area or bulk requirements or restrictions governing buildings and premises within the subdivision, provided such requirements or restrictions do not authorize the violation of the then effective zoning ordinance of the municipality. Such requirements or restrictions shall be stated upon that plat prior to the approval and recording thereof and shall have the same force of law and be enforceable in the same sanctions and penalties and subject to the same power of amendment or repeal as though set out as a part of the zoning ordinance or map of the municipality.

(a)  The HDC shall submit to the city council for approval guidelines and standards for review of all plans for the construction, addition, alteration, repair, moving, excavation, or demolition of resources in the historic district which shall be named the West Main Street Historic District Guidelines and Standards for Review and which shall specify the minor classes of work for which certificates of appropriateness may be issued by the building official. Certificates of appropriateness and notices to proceed shall not be required for work in the historic district until such time that the guidelines and standards for review have been approved by city council. Thereafter, all amendments and additions to the guidelines and standards for review must be approved by city council prior to implementation. 
(b)  Except for minor classes of work for which certificates of appropriateness may be issued by the building official, the HDC shall review all applications for the construction, addition, alteration, repair, moving, excavation, or demolition of resources in the historic district and approve each application before a certificate of appropriateness for such work can be granted. In reviewing the application, the HDC shall follow the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings, as set forth in 36 CFR Part 67, or their equivalent, as approved or established by the Michigan Bureau of History of the Department of State, and shall also consider the following: 
(1)  The historical or architectural value and significance of the resource and its relationship to the historic value of the surrounding area; 
(2)  The relationship of the exterior architectural features of such resource to the remainder of the resource and to the surrounding area; 
(3)  The general compatibility of the exterior design, arrangement, texture, and materials proposed to be used; 
(4)  Other factors, such as aesthetic value, that the commission finds relevant. 
(c)  The HDC and the building official shall review and act only upon exterior features of a resource and shall not review and act upon any interior work unless the interior work will cause visible change to the exterior of the resource. The HDC and the building official shall not disapprove an application due to considerations not prescribed in subsection 5-24(b). 
(d)  In case of an application for work affecting an exterior feature of a resource or for the alteration, moving, or demolition of a resource that the HDC deems so valuable to the city that the loss thereof will adversely affect the public purpose of the city, the HDC shall endeavor to work out with the owner an economically feasible plan for preservation of the historic resource. 
(e)  If all efforts by the HDC to preserve a resource fail, and it is determined by the city council that public ownership is most suitable and it is considered to be in the public interest, the city council may acquire the resource using public funds, public or private gifts, grants, or proceeds from the issuance of revenue bonds. 
(Ord. No. 1512, § 7, 7-23-01) 
Sec. 5-25. - Procedure for review of work. 
(a)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance of a resource within the West Main Street Historic District or to prevent work on any resource under a permit issued by the building department, or another duly delegated authority, before this article was enacted. 
(b)  Prior to work on a property located within the West Main Street Historic District, an applicant shall contact the city building department to determine the procedure necessary for receiving approval for such work. 
(c)  Work that does not require a certificate of appropriateness, a building permit or a notice to proceed is not subject to the requirements of this article. 
(d)  Work that requires a certificate of appropriateness, a building permit or a notice to proceed is subject to the requirements of this article, as follows: 
(1)  Certificate of appropriateness. If the building official determines that a building permit is not required but that a certificate of appropriateness is necessary, an application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be filed with the building official. Applications for certificates of appropriateness for work not considered minor shall be forwarded to the HDC by the building official. A certificate of appropriateness for minor classes of work may be issued by the building official as provided in the guidelines and standards for review. 
If the building official denies an application, a written record of the reasons for denial shall be forwarded to the applicant. The building official may suggest that changes be made to the application. The building official shall notify the applicant that the application may be resubmitted for review when the suggested changes have been made and that the applicant has the right to appeal to the city building board of appeals, the state historic preservation review board and to the Midland County Circuit Court. If the application is denied because the work is not appropriate, the applicant shall be so informed and shall be notified of the right to appeal to the building board of appeals for a notice to proceed. 
(2)  Building permit and certificate of appropriateness. If the building official determines that, in addition to an application for a certificate of appropriateness pursuant to subsection 5-25(d)(1), a building permit is required, applications for a building permit and a certificate of appropriateness shall be filed with the building official. The building official may issue a certificate as described in subsection 5-25(d)(1) or transmit the application to the HDC for review and approval. If the building official issues a certificate of appropriateness, the certificate shall be attached to the building permit. A building permit shall not be issued by the building official until a certificate of appropriateness is issued. 
(e)  (1)  Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of an application for a certificate of appropriateness for work not considered minor, the building official shall forward the application to the HDC. The HDC shall meet within ten (10) working days after receipt of the application and shall review the application according to the duties and powers specified herein. If the HDC determines that the application is incomplete, or that additional information is required before the application may be approved or disapproved, the HDC shall contact the applicant to request the necessary information. Thereafter, the HDC shall meet within ten (10) working days from the date of receipt of the additional information. 
(2)  Failure of the HDC to approve or disapprove a complete application within thirty (30) days from the date the application is submitted to the building official or fifteen (15) days after additional information is received by the HDC, whichever is later, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the applicant and HDC, shall be deemed to constitute approval, and the building official shall proceed to process the application without regard to a certificate of appropriateness issued by the HDC. 
(3)  If the application is approved, the HDC shall issue a certificate of appropriateness and transmit it to the building official. The building official shall attach the certificate of appropriateness to the building permit. 
(4)  After the certificate of appropriateness has been issued and, if required, a building permit granted, the building official shall inspect the work permitted in accord with the certificate of appropriateness and shall take such action as necessary to ensure compliance with the approved plan. 
(f)  (1)  If the application is not approved by the HDC, a written record of the reasons for denial shall be forwarded to the applicant and the building official. The HDC may suggest that changes be made to the application. The HDC shall notify the applicant that the application may be resubmitted for HDC review when the suggested changes have been made. A denial of an application for a certificate of appropriateness by the HDC shall be binding upon the building department. 
(2)  The denial of an application shall include a notice to the applicant of the right of appeal to the city building board of appeals, the state historic preservation review board and to the Midland County Circuit Court. If the application is denied by the HDC because the work is not appropriate, the applicant shall be so informed and shall be notified of the right to appeal to the building board of appeals for a notice to proceed. 
(g)  A fee shall not be levied for an application for a certificate of appropriateness; however, the applicable building permit fee shall be levied. 
(h)  Repairs, alterations and additions necessary for the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation or continued use of a building or structure may be made without conformance to all the requirements of the current Michigan Construction Code as adopted by ordinance by city council when authorized by the building official, provided: 
(1)  The building or structure has been designated by official action of the city council as having special historical or architectural significance. 
(2)  Any unsafe conditions as described in said construction code are corrected. 
(3)  The restored building or structure will be no more hazardous based on life safety, fire safety, and sanitation than the existing building. 
(Ord. No. 1512, § 7, 7-23-01) 
Sec. 5-26. - Appeals. 
(a)  Notice to proceed. If an applicant has been denied a certificate of appropriateness for work not deemed appropriate, the applicant may appeal to the building board of appeals for a notice to proceed. Work within the historic district shall be permitted through the issuance of a notice to proceed if any of the following conditions prevail and if the proposed work can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of a majority of the building board of appeals members that the proposed work is necessary to substantially improve or correct any of the following conditions: 
(1)  The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or to the structure's occupants. 
(2)  The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of substantial benefit to the community and the applicant proposing the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning approvals, financing, and environmental clearances. 
(3)  Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the owner when a governmental action, an act of God, or other events beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within the historic district have been attempted and exhausted by the owner. 
(4)  Retaining the resource is not in the interest of the majority of the community. 
Notwithstanding the aforementioned, a building permit may still be required. 
(a)[b]  Appeal from a decision by the building official or HDC. An applicant aggrieved by a decision of the building official or the HDC may file an appeal with the building board of appeals, as created under section 5-1 of the City of Midland Code of Ordinances, or the state historic preservation review board of the Michigan Historical Commission within the Department of State. The HDC shall forward a copy of the West Main Street Historic District Guidelines and Standards for Review approved by city council to the building board of appeals. The West Main Street Historic District Guidelines and Standards for Review shall be utilized by the building board of appeals in appeal decisions. 
(b)[c]  Appeal from a decision by the building board of appeals. An applicant who has appealed to the building board of appeals and is aggrieved by the decision of that board may file an appeal with the state historic preservation review board. The appeal shall be filed within sixty (60) days after the decision is furnished to the applicant by the building board of appeals. 
(c)[d]  Appeal from a decision by the state historic preservation review board. A permit applicant aggrieved by the decision of the state historic preservation review board may appeal the decision to the Midland County Circuit Court. Said applicant may only appeal to the circuit court after appealing to the state historic preservation review board. 
(d)[e]  Appeal by non-applicant. Any citizen or duly organized historic preservation organization in the city that is not an applicant that is aggrieved by a decision of the HDC may appeal the decision to the Midland County Circuit Court.

The failure of any such owner of record to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this section. Service by certified mail in the manner herein provided shall be effective on the date of mailing. Proof of service of the notice and order shall be by affidavit sworn to by the person effecting service; declaring time, date and manner in which the service was made.

(d)  Condemnation procedure. If at the expiration of any time limit in the notice provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner of record has not complied with the requirements thereof, the building official may recommend abatement in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Notice of public hearing. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, when an exterior feature of a historic resource is found to have deteriorated or the structural integrity of a resource has been lost as a result of neglect in maintenance or repair, the building official, having ascertained that the time limit provided in the notice has expired and that the required work has not been completed, shall issue a notice to each owner of record in whose name the property appears on the last local tax assessment records to appear at a hearing before a hearings officer and show cause why the alterations, repairs or maintenance should not be made.

g.  Admissibility of evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of evidence upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions in courts of competent jurisdiction of this state.

d.  The costs of the work shall be a lien against the real property and shall be reported to the city assessor who shall assess the cost against the property on which the resource is located. The owner in whose name the property appears upon the last local tax assessment record shall be notified of the amount of such cost by first class mail at the address shown on the records. If he or she fails to pay the same within thirty (30) days after mailing by the assessor of the notice of the amount thereof, the assessor shall add the same to the next tax roll of the city and it shall be collected in the same manner and in all respects as provided by law for the collection of taxes by the city.

Sec. 5-28. - Failure to obtain a permit. 
    When work has been performed on a historic resource without a permit and the HDC finds that the work does not qualify for a certificate of appropriateness, the HDC shall notify the city council of its findings. The city council may require an owner to restore the resource to the condition the resource was in before the inappropriate work was conducted or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness. 
    If the owner does not comply with the restoration or modification requirement within a reasonable time, the city council may seek an order from the Midland County Circuit Court to require the owner to restore the resource to its former condition or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness. 
    If the owner does not or cannot comply with the order of the court, and if the order of the court so provides, the city council or its agents may enter the property and conduct work necessary to restore the resource to its former condition or modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the order of the court. The cost of the work shall be charged to the owner and may be levied by the city as a special assessment against the property.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 752, §§ 1-13, adopted March 30, 1970, amended the provisions from which Ch. 20 is derived by adding thereto §§ 1002.1-1002.13, codified herein as Art. IX, §§ 12-152-12-164, at the discretion of the editors. Said Ord. No. 752 is set out as enacted, including catchlines; however the editors have changed "ordinance" to "article" where appropriate and, as indicated above, the various sections of the ordinance have been renumbered to conform with the numbering system used in this Code. Prior to the adoption of Ord. No. 793, § 1, adopted May 15, 1972, the title of Art. IX was "Inspection of Multiple Dwellings or Rooming Houses; Condemnation and Demolition of Unfit Dwellings". 

Sec. 12-152. - Certain dwellings, dwelling units or habitable rooms-Time of registration; official. 
(a)  A registry of owners and premises shall be maintained by the building official. 
(b)  The owners of dwellings, dwelling units or habitable rooms which will be offered to let or to hire for more than six (6) months of a calendar year, shall register their names and places of residence or usual places of business and the location of the premises regulated by this article with the building official. The owners shall register prior to the day on which any part of the premises is offered for occupancy. 
(c)  If the premises are managed or operated by an agent, the agent's name and place of business shall be placed with the name of the owner in the registry.

(a)  The building official shall inspect, on a periodic basis, dwellings, dwelling units and habitable rooms regulated by this article. In no event shall the period between inspections be longer than two (2) years. 
(b)  An inspection shall be conducted in the manner best calculated to secure compliance with the article and appropriate to the needs of the City of Midland. Inspections may be on one of the following bases: 
(1)  An area basis, such that all the regulated premises in a predetermined geographical area will be inspected simultaneously, or within a short period of time; 
(2)  A complaint basis, such that complaints of violations will be inspected within a reasonable time; or 
(3)  A recurrent violation basis, such that those premises which are found to have a high incidence of recurrent or uncorrected violations will be inspected more frequently.

A reinspection fee, equal to the fee paid by the applicant for the issuance of a certificate, may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. This provision is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a dwelling unit is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of the housing code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the corrections are made and the unit is ready for inspection or reinspection. The certificate provided herein shall expire two (2) years from the date of issuance and a new certificate shall be required and shall be issued after inspection of the premises by the building inspector and payment of a fee as set forth in section 21-51. 
    When the expired certificate is not renewed within the calendar month of its expiration date, the certification shall become delinquent and the owner shall be assessed a delinquency fee in addition to and equal to the fee for certification. 
     When the owner or agent fails to renew the certification within thirty (30) days after it becomes delinquent, an additional fee as prescribed in section 21-51 shall be assessed. 
     When the owner or agent fails to renew the certification within sixty (60) days after it becomes delinquent, as additional fee as prescribed in section 21-51 shall be assessed. 
     If the owner or agent fails to comply and is delinquent for more than sixty (60) days, an additional fee as prescribed in section 21-51 shall be assessed and the building official shall bring an action to enforce the provisions of this section, as provided for in section 12-161. 
     In the event that a certificate is suspended by the building official, as provided in section 12-159 of this article, the owner shall be required to pay a fee, as provided for in section 21-51 before the certificate is reinstated.

The certificate shall be issued only upon an inspection of the premises by the building official, except as provided in section 12-158. The certificate shall be issued within fifteen (15) days after written application therefor if the dwelling at the date of the application is entitled thereto. 
(b)  A violation of this article shall not prevent the issuance of a certificate, but the building official shall not issue a certificate when the existing conditions constitute a hazard to the health or safety of those who may occupy the premises. 
(c)  Inspections shall be made prior to first occupancy of dwellings, dwelling units, and habitable rooms regulated by this article, if the construction or alteration is completed and first occupancy will occur after the effective date of this article. Where first occupancy will occur before the effective date of this article, inspection shall be made within one (1) year after the effective date of this article. Upon finding that there is no condition that would constitute a hazard to the health and safety of the occupants, and that the premises are otherwise fit for occupancy, the certificate shall be issued. If the finding is of a condition that would constitute a hazard to health or safety, no certificate shall be issued, and an order to comply with the article shall be issued immediately and served upon the owner in accordance with section 12-159.

ARTICLE VII. - ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE LICENSES FOR CONSUMPTION ON THE PREMISES 
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PURPOSE AND GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 15-220. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide for the local regulation of alcoholic beverage licenses for consumption on the premises. Applicants for a liquor license are asking the people, through their duly constituted representatives, for a permit to conduct an alcoholic beverage establishment. No applicant, existing licensee, person or firm has any right to a license. As no one has a right to a license, any consideration given to applicants must be secondary to the requirements of the community-at-large. Alcoholic beverage licenses will be approved to foster economic growth of the city at large and to provide a service to the community. It should be generally interpreted that any applicant for a liquor license shall be seeking this license to be used in conjunction with some primary business activity other than the serving of beer, wine, or spirits. Some examples of this would include restaurants, hotels, motels, bowling alleys, etc. It shall, however, be the responsibility of the city council to evaluate each application on an individual basis and to determine that each license is in the best interest of the city. Approval of any new or reclassification of existing alcoholic beverage licenses for consumption on the premises will be based upon the moral and business character of the prospective licensee, the ability of the establishment to be erected and operated within the limitations of state laws, and the current standards of existing municipal ordinances, except as hereafter specified. 
(Ord. No. 1552, § 1, 11-25-02) 
Sec. 15-221. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this chapter the following definitions are adopted:

(Ord. No. 1552, § 1, 11-25-02) 
Sec. 15-222. - Liquor license distribution. 
    In order that there may be a fair distribution of available licenses, the city will consider whether an applicant has a license in the Midland trading area or has an interest in a firm or corporation having such a license. The extent of such interest, the similarity of the facility involved, and the overall good of the community will be considered in deciding any application which may result in a single individual or firm having a substantial interest in more than one license in the area. Efforts will be made in securing a geographic distribution of available licenses so that the various commercial areas of the city will be properly accommodated.

The transfer in the aggregate to another person during any single licensing year of more than ten (10) percent of the outstanding stock of a licensed corporation or more than ten (10) percent of the total interest in a licensed limited partnership shall be considered to be a transfer requiring the prior approval of the city council.

    When all of the above information has been submitted by the applicant, the city manager will refer the application to the chief of police, fire chief, building department, health department, planning department and to such other officers or employees as the city manager may desire, who shall cause a thorough investigation to be made of the persons and premises. The findings and recommendations resulting from such investigations shall be reported by the city manager to the city council within ninety (90) days of receipt of the application.

Sec. 15-240. - Resort licenses. 
    In regard to the new issuance of a resort license, the city council may reject the license if the city council has reason to believe that the existence of a resort license will prevent the city from obtaining additional class "C" liquor licenses as the city becomes eligible through the normal quota procedure.

(1)  The proposed licensed establishment is located in or in close proximity to a facility or facilities to which large numbers of tourists and visitors come each year for recreational, educational, or entertainment purposes.

(Ord. No. 1552, § 1, 11-25-02) 
Sec. 15-251. - Nonconformance. 
    It is recognized the locations and establishments of licensees, lawfully existing in our city at the time of the adoption of this article or hereafter approved may not conform to all of the current standards of the existing building, zoning and other municipal laws and regulations, as amended. It is not the general intent of this article to now require such conformance, but rather to continue to recognize the non-conforming building and use rights of existing licensees at the time they are reviewed for the renewal of their licenses; provided, however, all applicants and licensees should be aware that the city council may, at any time, amend this ordinance and require conformance with any part or all of such existing standards or any new standards created hereafter. This exception shall not apply to applicants for new licenses or reclassification of existing licenses except applicants for reclassification shall not be required to conform to current zoning requirements.

Such a recommendation by the city manager shall not be considered the same as approval of the recommendation by the city council.

Sec. 15-253. - Basis of recommendation of non-renewal or revocation. 
    In connection with any recommendation made by the city manager to the city council pursuant to section 15-250 concerning non-renewal or revocation of a liquor license and any subsequent decision by the city council to recommend non-renewal or revocation of a liquor license to the commission, both the city manager and the city council shall make said recommendations on the basis of whether any one or more of the following exists or has occurred: 
(1)  Maintenance of a nuisance upon the premises;

(7)  Non-use of the liquor license for a consecutive period of time of three (3) or more years from the time the liquor license is first placed into escrow with the liquor control commission. (The term "non-use" shall be interpreted to mean the absence of actual use or utilization of a specific class "C" liquor license or a specific liquor license other than a class "C" liquor license which also permits consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises in connection with the actual operation of a primary business activity as the latter term is described in section 15-220.) During the annual review, the city manager shall notify each escrowed license holder that the escrowed license must be activated prior to the end of the third consecutive year the license is in escrow. If a license remains in escrow after two (2) consecutive years, the city manager shall initiate the revocation process in section 15-254 six (6) months prior to the third consecutive anniversary of the date the license was placed in escrow by the liquor control commission. 
(8)  Failure to have implemented procedures to prevent alcohol abuse on its premises or related to its premises by instituting a program such as Training for Intervention Procedures by Servers of Alcohol (T.I.P.S.), Techniques of Alcohol Management (T.A.M.) or the Management/Server Awareness Program.

(3)  Date, time and place of the hearing;

The license holder and/or his representative will be afforded an opportunity to present evidence and testimony, question any adverse witnesses and to show cause why the city council should not approve the recommendation of the city manager.

    In the interest of promoting business by increasing activity and improving the general business climate in the Downtown Development Authority District, that being the area specified in chapter 30, section 30-5, the City of Midland may issue revocable permits to businesses within the district who apply for a permit to operate an exterior establishment as an extension of, or compatible with, the existing business on a portion of a public sidewalk. This language shall not be construed as to require sidewalk occupancy permits for entities participating in periodic, district-wide events such as those sponsored by the Downtown Development Authority or Downtown Business Association. [1] Exterior activities are limited to activities carried on by the existing business. A permit may be issued under the following terms and conditions: 
(1)  Administration -Such permits shall be issued by the City Manager, or his designee. 
a.  Permits will be issued when the city is able to determine that the requested public sidewalk use permit will not: 
1.  Unreasonably interfere with the use of the street for pedestrian or vehicular travel. 
2.  Unreasonably interfere with the view of, access to, or use of property adjacent to said street. 
3.  Unreasonably interfere with street cleaning or snow removal activities.

a.  Areas of the sidewalk licensed for the consumption of alcohol shall be enclosed by a structure approved by the Downtown Development Authority. The purpose of this structure shall be to delineate the private use area from the public access area of the sidewalk. Said structure shall be aesthetically compatible with the streetscape and area buildings. The structure will be removable to accommodate efficient snow removal activity but yet of sufficient construction so as to prevent relocation by patrons or pedestrians. 
b.  Sidewalk areas used for the sale and/or consumption of food and/or beverages shall be kept in a clean and orderly manner and shall, at a minimum: 
1.  Be provided with adequate solid waste receptacles so as to allow for the convenient disposal of waste materials associated with the private use of the sidewalk space. 
2.  Tables, chairs, and other appurtenances of the food and/or beverage consumption area shall be placed in such a manner so as not to hinder safe pedestrian use of the sidewalk and shall not block ingress or egress to any building. 
(3)  Insurance requirements -Prior to the issuance of a sidewalk occupancy permit, the applicant must supply the city with a certificate of liability insurance in an amount to be determined by the city. The certificate of insurance must be in effect for at least the period that the permit will be issued. In addition, the applicant shall indemnify and hold harmless the city from all claims or damages incident to the creation and operation of an outside establishment. 
(4)  Effective dates and hours of operation -All permits shall specify the dates and duration of the permitted sidewalk occupancy, and the permits shall be valid for only the specified period. Permits may not be granted for a period in excess of twelve (12) months. All permits shall specify the hours during which the permitted sidewalk occupancy may occur during any given day of the valid permit period. 
(5)  Revocation -All permits issued under this article are subject to immediate revocation by the city manager, or his designee, for failure to comply with any or all provisions of this article.

    Annually, the city engineer shall notify the director of fiscal services of any such charges due. The director of fiscal services shall forward a statement of the total charges assessed on each parcel of property to the owner, as shown by the last current assessment or tax roll, and said assessment shall be payable to the city treasurer within thirty (30) days from the date said statement was forwarded. If not paid within the prescribed thirty-day period, such statement shall be filed by the director of fiscal services with the city assessor and shall thereupon be assessed against the land in question and become a lien on such property, in accordance with the City of Midland charter. The amount so charged may be discharged at any time by the payment of the amount specified in the statement, together with the accrued interest compiled from the time of filing said statement with the city assessor.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1603, § 2, adopted July 11, 2005, amended article II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, article II pertained to procedures for submission of plats and derived from Ord. No. 1110, § 1, adopted July 28, 1986. 

Sec. 23-10. - Summary of review procedures. 
    The plat review process shall consist of the following steps: 
(1)  Optional sketch plan review, involving a preliminary review by city staff but no formal action. The purpose of sketch plan review is to provide the proprietor with information needed to complete the plat, to explain applicable standards and regulations, and to acquaint the city with the proposed plat. Comments made during sketch plan review about the proposed plat shall not be binding on the city or the proprietor (see § 23-15). 
(2)  Tentative preliminary plat review, involving review and action to recommend approval or denial of the plat by the planning commission within sixty (60) days from the date of filing, followed by review and action to approve or deny the plat by the city council within ninety (90) days from the date of filing (see § 23-16). When all information required by this and other ordinances has been submitted, tentative and final preliminary plat approval may be granted concurrently. 
(3)  Final preliminary plat review, involving review by outside agencies (state and Midland and Bay County agencies) prior to action by the city council. The city council shall approve or deny the final preliminary plat within twenty (20) days from the date of filing (see § 23-17). When all information required by this and other ordinances has been submitted, tentative and final preliminary plat approval may be granted concurrently. 
(4)  Final plat review, involving review and action to approve or deny the plat by the city council within twenty (20) days of the date of filing (see § 23-19). 
(Ord. No. 1603, § 2, 7-11-05) 
Sec. 23-11. - Extension of review deadlines. 
    Deadlines for the city to take action on a preliminary or final plat, as specified in the Land Division Act and reiterated in this chapter, may be extended by mutual written consent of the proprietor and the city. A waiver of the review deadlines may be required to permit concurrent processing of related review applications. In the absence of written consent for such a waiver, denial of a plat shall be considered appropriate if the proprietor has been unable to complete submittal requirements and/or bring the plat into compliance with chapter regulations within the review deadline. 
(Ord. No. 1603, § 2, 7-11-05) 
Sec. 23-12. - Coordination of development options with subdivision approval. 
(a)  Rezoning. Since proper zoning is required as a condition of plat approval, whenever a development option involves rezoning of the land or application of municipal zoning to the land, approval of the rezoning shall be required prior to any formal action by the city to approve or deny the tentative preliminary plat. 
(b)  Issuance of permits. Within the subdivision, no certificates of occupancy shall be issued until the city has granted final plat approval and the final plat has been properly recorded. 
(Ord. No. 1603, § 2, 7-11-05) 
Sec. 23-13. - Pre-application review meeting. 
    Pursuant to Section 111(3) of the Land Division Act, a proprietor may request that a pre-application review meeting take place by submitting a written request to the chairperson of the county plat board and submitting copies of a concept plan for the preliminary plat to the municipality and to each officer or agency entitled to review the preliminary plat under sections 113 to 118 of the Land Division Act. A pre-application review meeting shall take place not later than thirty (30) days after the written request and concept plan are received. The meeting shall be attended by the proprietor, representatives of each officer or agency entitled to review the preliminary plat under section 113, 114, and 118 of the Land Division Act, and a representative of the municipality. Representatives of each agency entitled to review the preliminary plat under sections 115 to 117 of the Land Division Act shall be informed of the meting and may attend. The purpose of the meeting is to conduct an informal review of the proprietor's concept plan for the preliminary plat.

(Ord. No. 1603, § 3, 7-11-05) 
Sec. 23-25. - Preservation of natural features. 
    To the extent feasible, the subdivision shall be designed to preserve the natural character and natural features of the land, including woodlands, wetlands, water courses, natural drainage courses and stream channels, wildlife habitats and other valuable natural assets. In order to accomplish these objectives, dedication of easements, creation of protective barriers, and similar measures should be considered. In addition, the following standards shall be met. 
(1)  Wetlands. The design of subdivisions shall comply with the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act (Michigan Public Act 451 of 1994, as amended). Wetlands shall be delineated by a qualified wetland consultant and shown on the preliminary plat (see requirements for a wetland within a lot and water features setback in Section 23-26). 
(2)  Floodplains. Portions of plats located within any area of special flood hazard shall be subject to the provisions of section 60.3(d) of the Rules and Regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR 59, etc., formerly 1901). 
(Ord. No. 1603, § 3, 7-11-05) 
Sec. 23-26. - Lots. 
    Lots within subdivisions shall conform to the following standards: 
(1)  General lot arrangement. 
a.  Every lot in a subdivision or site condominium shall front on and have direct access to a public or private street. 
b.  Residential lots abutting major or minor thoroughfares on the city street plan shall be platted using a public secondary access street parallel to the thoroughfare providing access to the lot(s). 
c.  Lots shall have a front-to-front relationship across all streets where possible. 
d.  Through or double frontage lots are prohibited, except as permitted in subsection 23-26(1)(b). 
e.  Lots facing a three-way intersection (T-intersection) should be aligned to prevent on-coming headlight glare into the building envelope of the living area. 
f.  Blocks shall generally be designed with tiers of two (2) lots placed back to back, except where lots back onto a thoroughfare, railroad, natural feature, storm water detention feature or subdivision boundary. 
(2)  Lot sizes and shapes. 
a.  Lot area and width. Each lot shall comply with the minimum area and width requirements of the zoning ordinance for the district in which the subdivision is proposed (unless approved as part of an open space plan or planned unit development). 
b.  Lot depth. The minimum lot depth for residential lots shall meet minimum requirements established by the city zoning ordinance. 
c.  Area calculation of ponds and lakes. Areas of the subdivision plat that contain ponds, lakes, storm water detention features or similar bodies of water shall not be platted as subdivision lots nor calculated as a portion of the minimum lot area required by the zoning ordinance. 
d.  Lots occupied by wetlands. A portion of each lot may be occupied by wetlands provided that, if wetlands are present on the lot, the proprietor can demonstrate that adequate buildable area will exist on each lot without intruding into the required setbacks, including the required wetland or water features setback. 
e.  Area in floodplain. Land in the 100-year floodplain shall be developed in accord with the state construction code and the National Flood Insurance Program. 
f.  Depth-to-width ratio. Narrow, deep lots shall be avoided. A depth-to-width ratio of two and one-half (2.5) to one (1) shall be considered a maximum, except where the proprietor demonstrates that a deeper lot will protect natural resources, such as woodlands, wetlands, or wildlife habitat. 
g.  Building setbacks. Lots shall be of sufficient size and proportion to accommodate the minimum required building setbacks listed in the zoning ordinance for the district in which the subdivision is located. 
h.  Nonresidential lots. Lots intended for purposes other than residential use shall be specifically designated for such purposes, and shall have adequate provision for off-street parking, setbacks and other requirements, including such uses being permitted in the applicable zoning district, in accordance with the zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 1603, § 3, 7-11-05) 
Sec. 23-27. - Streets. 
    The provisions of this chapter shall be the minimum requirements for streets and intersections. 
(1)  Compliance with applicable standards. The standards of this section are intended to comply with the applicable public street standards of the city, Midland and Bay County Road Commission and the state department of transportation. The city reserves the right to adopt written standards which are more restrictive, upon a determination that the additional regulations meet special needs or goals in the city which may not be appropriate on a county-wide basis. 
(2)  Conformance with city master plan. The layout of the street system shall conform to the goals, policies, street functional classification system, alignment and minimum rights-of-way recommended in the transportation element of the city master plan. 
(3)  Relationship to natural features and grades. Streets shall be aligned to maximize the preservation of natural features and existing grades to the extent feasible. 
(4)  Continuity of street system. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of existing streets from adjoining areas into new subdivisions. Where adjoining vacant areas are zoned or planned for development similar to the proposed subdivision, streets shall be extended to the boundary line of the parcel to make provision for the future street connections. Where stub streets have been provided on adjoining property, the arrangement of streets in the proposed subdivision or site condominium shall align and connect with the existing stub streets to achieve street system continuity. The proprietor shall demonstrate that the proposed stub street is a reasonable location for extension into the adjacent lands, in consideration of such factors as grades, water bodies, wetlands and lot configuration. In determining the need for such connections, the city shall consider the need for adequate access and response time for emergency vehicles, the impacts such connections may have on reducing congestion along thoroughfares, the projected traffic volumes and the compatibility with adjacent developments. 
An improved temporary cul-de-sac built to specifications of the city engineering department shall be provided if any lots front solely on the stub street; if no lots front solely on the stub street, then a T-turnaround shall be permitted, subject to approval by the city engineer. A sign shall be placed at the end of the stub street or cul-de-sac with a sign face on both sides stating "Future Street Extension". 
(5)  Collector and local streets. The proposed subdivision street layout shall be designed to discourage through traffic and excessive speeds. This shall be accomplished by incorporating offset street intersections within the subdivision, curvilinear street alignments, and discontinuities in the street pattern where appropriate. In general, straight sections of streets shall not exceed one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet in length, except that at subdivision entrances the straight sections of subdivision street that intersect thoroughfares shall generally not exceed six hundred sixty (660) feet in length. These restrictions shall not prevent continuation of streets to adjoining properties where deemed desirable by the city. 
(6)  Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited. Wherever a half street exists adjacent to the parcel to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted, dedicated and recorded to make a complete street. 
(7)  Minimum and maximum length for blocks. Blocks, or the length of any street constructed for any phase of a subdivision, shall not be less than two hundred seventy (270) feet long, nor longer than one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet measured from centerline to centerline of the intersections at each end of the block, except that the city council, upon recommendation from the planning commission, may approve a plat which varies from these dimensions upon consideration of any or all of the following: 
a.  Documented evidence that significant natural features will be preserved or stub street to connect to vacant land are being provided which will result in a conforming condition in the future; and 
b.  Recommendations from the police, fire, department of public services and city engineering departments that the shorter or longer block length will not create a threat to public safety or the delivery of services. 
The minimum block length dimensions do not apply to approved stub streets. 
(8)  Cul-de-sac and dead-end streets. Dead-end streets are prohibited, except those designed as permanent cul-de-sacs or those required for future access to adjacent unplatted property. Cul-de-sac streets shall be no longer than one thousand (1,000) feet unless: 
a.  Reviewed by the engineering, fire, planning, and public services departments; and 
b.  Approved, with or without conditions, by the city council. 
On street parking within a cul-de-sac turnaround shall be prohibited. 
(9)  Minimum right-of-way widths. The minimum street right-of-way (r.o.w.) width for subdivisions shall be as follows: 
a.  Parkway: One hundred fifty (150) feet. 
b.  Major thoroughfare: Eighty (80) to one hundred (100) feet. 
c.  Minor thoroughfare: Eighty (80) to one hundred (100) feet. 
d.  Collector street: Eighty (80) feet. 
e.  Local street: Sixty (60) feet. 
f.  Cul-de-sac: Sixty (60) feet. 
g.  Cul-de-sac turnaround: Fifty (50) foot radius. 
h.  Private street: Forty (40) feet. 
A greater right-of-way may be required by the city in consideration of the intensity of development, the expected traffic volumes, the need for additional area for utilities or grading or to accommodate planned or expected street cross sections, and the expected traffic volumes and characteristics associated with the types of uses which may access the street based on the zoning. If the city council deems that right-of-way in excess of one hundred (100) feet is necessary, it shall enter into an agreement to purchase the land within ninety (90) days of submission of the final preliminary plat to the city. 
(10)  Spacing of intersections along major and minor thoroughfares or collector streets. Streets intersecting a thoroughfare or collector street shall be spaced at least eight hundred (800) feet from the intersection of another platted street on the same side of the street. Intersections shall be aligned with public streets or private roads across the street, or offset at least two hundred fifty (250) feet from such streets or roads, measured between centerlines. Lesser intersection spacing or offsets may be approved where there are existing conditions which make compliance with spacing requirements impossible or where adequate sight distance would not be compromised. 
(11)  Design at entrances. Boulevard entrances to subdivisions are permitted by the city, subject to approval by the appropriate road agency. 
(12)  Internal street offsets. Three-way intersections ("T" type intersections) are encouraged within the plat, rather than four-way intersections. No more than two (2) streets shall cross at any intersection. Street intersections within a plat shall be offset at least one hundred twenty-five (125) feet, measured between centerlines. Lesser offsets may be approved where less than ten (10) lots or units are served by the intersection or where significant natural features would be preserved that would otherwise be destroyed. 
(13)  Street geometrics. Street geometrics, including horizontal curves, tangents between reverse curves, sight distance at intersections, street gradients, and vertical alignment at intersections, shall comply with the standards of the appropriate road agency as well as the following regulations. 
a.  Horizontal curves shall have the following minimum center line radii: 
1.  Local streets: Two hundred (200) feet. 
(2)  Collector streets: Three hundred (300) feet. 
(3)  Major streets: Four hundred seventy-five (475) feet. 
(4)  Tangents at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be provided between reverse curves on collector streets, and at least two hundred and fifty (250) feet long on major streets. 
b.  Street grades shall not be greater than six (6) percent or less than four-tenths (0.4) percent. 
(14)  Intersection angles. Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible to ninety (90) degrees; in no case shall the intersection be less than eighty (80) degrees. 
(15)  Street names. Street names shall be sufficiently distinct from existing street names to avoid confusion, particularly for emergency service providers. 
(16)  Signs. The city shall place street name signs on public streets and at the intersection of public and private streets. The proprietor shall be responsible for placement of street name signs at all private street intersections in accordance with the requirements of the city. The proprietor shall also be responsible for placement of pavement markings and regulatory street signs (such as no parking signs, stop or yield signs, speed limit signs, and warning signs) as requested or required by the appropriate road agency. All regulatory signs shall be in conformance with the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
(17)  Stormwater drainage. Curbs and gutters are required for all public streets in the city. Open drainage along private roads may be permitted by the city, except where curbs and gutters are required by the city. Drainage design and construction shall be in accordance with the specifications of the appropriate road agency. 
(18)  Street construction requirements. All streets and appurtenances thereto shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications of the city or the appropriate road agency. 
(19)  Phasing. Each phase of the plat shall be designed to meet the street requirements above, regardless of whether future phases are constructed. 
(Ord. No. 1603, § 3, 7-11-05) 
Sec. 23-28. - Sidewalks. 
(a)  Sidewalks are required on both sides of all public and private streets. The planning commission may waive the sidewalk requirement along private streets if an alternate pedestrian circulation system that provides access to all parts of a development is provided. The alternate pedestrian circulation system may incorporate hard surfaced and non-hard surfaced paths, provided that such pathways provide access to all parts of a development. 
(b)  Pedestrian through-block connectors may be required in the middle of any block over one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet in length to obtain satisfactory pedestrian circulation within the subdivision, to provide access to parks or open space, to provide links with an adjacent development, and/or to provide access to a center of activity. Where such pedestrian through-block connectors are required a ten (10) foot wide easement, a dedicated right-of-way or other means of securing the land for the connector shall be required. The city may require placement of a fence to ensure the pedestrian connection location is visible and to protect the adjacent property owners. 
(c)  Any yard which abuts a pedestrian easement shall provide the required minimum building setback, as applicable, from the easement. 
(d)  All sidewalks shall be concrete, have a minimum width of four (4) feet on local streets and five (5) feet on major streets, and be constructed in accordance with city engineering standards. 
(e)  Grades shall be clearly illustrated on the plans to insure proper connection to sidewalks on adjacent lands. 
(f)  Sidewalks shall be installed by the proprietor within the dedicated street right-of-way, except that placement within private access easements may be permitted where grades or other factors prevent placement within the street right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 1603, § 3, 7-11-05) 
Sec. 23-29. - Landscaping. 
    The selection, size, spacing and planting of all landscaping within a subdivision shall comply with the zoning ordinance and the following standards:

Sec. 28-2. - Findings-Water. 
(a)  Necessity for potable water. The city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms that the businesses, industries, governmental and charitable agencies and residents located in the city need to have potable and otherwise usable water. 
(b)  Availability of potable water. The city council further has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that the supply of potable water available from private wells within the city is insufficient to assure that all businesses, industries, governmental and charitable agencies, and residents will have sufficient potable water available for their use and other water necessary for industrial and fire prevention and control unless the city offers water to all properties located within the city. 
(c)  Method for measuring use-water supply services. Based on advice of its engineers, the city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that the most precise method, given available technology, of measuring the use of the water supply from the system by any user is by a meter or meters installed and controlled by the city. 
(d)  Continuation of service. The city council has previously found, and further currently reaffirms that, in order to provide and continue to provide clean potable and other usable water to all customers of the system, in quantities necessary for all varieties of use, it is necessary from time to time to install improvements, enlargements, extensions and repairs to the system. 
(e)  Purpose of charges. The charges and fees for the use of and connection to the system are hereby established for the purpose of recovering the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, repair, and operation of the system and to comply with federal and state safe drinking water acts and related regulations, to provide for the payment of principal of and interest on any bonds authorized to be issued as and when the same become due and payable, to create a bond and interest redemption fund therefor, to provide a fund for reasonable and necessary improvements to the system, to provide a fund for equipment replacement and to provide for such other funds as are necessary to meet contractual obligations of the city. Such charges and fees shall be made in accordance with the purposes herein described as well as the following: 
(1)  All premises connected directly or indirectly to the system, except as hereinafter provided, shall be charged and shall make payments to the city in amounts computed on the basis of this chapter. 
(2)  The charges, rates and fees for water service by the system are established herein to adequately provide for bond requirements and to ensure that the system does not operate at a deficit. 
(3)  The system staff or designated parties shall periodically review the charges, rates, fees, rules and regulations of the system, which review shall be completed not less than one (1) time per fiscal year. Results of the review shall be reported to the city council with recommendations for any adjustments. 
(4)  The charges, rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs from users in reasonable proportion to the cost of serving those users. 
(f)  Proportionality, fairness, and benefits of charges, rates and fees. The city council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the fairest and most reasonable method of providing for the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user, based in all cases on amount of use, for the costs of: (i) retiring debt secured by the net revenues of the system issued to pay for improvements and replacements to the system; (ii) ongoing repair, replacement and improvement and budgeted as part of the annual costs of the system; and (iii) operation, administration and maintenance costs of the system. 
The city has investigated several methods of apportioning the costs of the water service provided by the system. Based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers, the city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that to ensure the stability and viability of the system for the benefit of its users, the fairest and most accurate way to apportion the costs of operation, maintenance, replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user: (i) a connection fee and a capital charge for water service when such user's property is first connected to the system; (ii) a commodity rate for the use of water; (iii) a readiness-to-serve charge; and (iv) other charges and costs for services which are equivalent to the cost of providing such services. The city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms that the rates and charges currently in effect accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs of the system among the users of the system and that the commodity rate and the readiness-to-serve charges each provide actual benefits to such users in the form of ready access to water service that would be unavailable if such charges were not charged. 
In addition to the findings set forth above, the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the capital charge reflects the depreciated capital costs of the system, previously paid by the city and the system, less grants, attributable to each new user and that the opportunity to connect to the system provides actual benefits to each new user equal to or greater than the amount of such charges. 
Furthermore, the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the charges imposed by the system are sufficient to meet the short-term capital improvement needs of the system. 
(g)  Design life of improvements. Based on the advice of its engineers, the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that any improvements to or capital expenditures for the system paid for by rates and charges did not, at the time such improvements were constructed and financed, have an expected design life that would exceed the term of the respective bonds issued to finance such improvements or capital expenditures. 
(h)  Charges for non-residents. 
Contracts for water service. The city has previously entered, and may continue to enter, into contracts with municipalities adjacent to the city, to provide service to users of the water supply system located in those municipalities. Rates and charges billed for use by the residents of those municipalities shall be in accordance with the applicable contract. 
Charges for service to customers outside city where no other contract compensates the city for indirect costs. The city has previously found, and hereby ratifies and confirms, that the total direct and indirect costs of providing service to customers outside the city jurisdiction, where no other contract exists with the governmental units where those customers are located, equals at least 1.75 times the rates and charges imposed for direct services and debt service cost to customers located in the city. Indirect costs include payment for capital improvements, extraordinary repairs and replacements for the water supply system benefiting all users of the system and paid for by customers served within the corporate limits of the city or the corporate limits of other municipalities which have entered into contracts with the city for such costs, funding depreciation of the improvements to the water supply system, and fire and police or other protection for the water supply system paid by city taxpayers or by the governmental units with which the city has contracts for water supply.

(Ord. No. 1513, § 1, 7-23-01) 
Sec. 28-4. - Findings-Sewer. 
(a)  Necessity for sewage disposal. The city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that the use of septic tanks, privies, privy vaults, cesspools, or similar private sewage disposal facilities, may be deleterious to the health, safety and welfare of the businesses, industries, governmental and charitable agencies, and residents of the city and that the health, safety and welfare of the businesses, industries, governmental and charitable agencies and residents is enhanced by the creation of a public sewer system and wastewater treatment plant, with regulation by the city of pollutants and other harmful materials according to state and federal standards. 
(b)  Method for measuring use-sewage disposal services. Based on advice of its engineers, the city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that the most practical, cost effective and accurate method, given available technology, of measuring the use of the system's sewers by any user is by the meter or meters used to measure water usage. 
(c)  Continuation of service. The city council has previously found, and further currently reaffirms that, in order to provide and continue to provide for the safe and uninterrupted removal and treatment of sewage, pollutants and other harmful materials, it is necessary from time to time to install improvements, enlargements, extensions and repairs to the system's sewers and sewer service pipes. 
(d)  Purpose of charges. The charges and fees for the use of and connection to the system are hereby established for the purpose of recovering the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, repair, and operation of the system and to comply with federal and state safe drinking water acts and related regulations, to provide for the payment of principal of and interest on any bonds authorized to be issued as and when the same become due and payable, to create a bond and interest redemption fund therefor, to provide a fund for reasonable and necessary improvements to the system, to provide a fund for equipment replacement and to provide for such other funds as are necessary to meet contractual obligations of the city. Such charges and fees shall be made in accordance with the purposes herein described as well as the following: 
(1)  All premises connected directly or indirectly to the system, except as hereinafter provided, shall be charged and shall make payments to the city in amounts computed on the basis of this chapter. 
(2)  The charges, rates and fees for sewer service by the system are established herein to adequately provide for bond requirements and to ensure that the system does not operate at a deficit. 
(3)  The system staff or designated parties shall periodically review the charges, rates, fees, rules and regulations of the system, which review shall be completed not less than one (1) time per fiscal year. Results of the review shall be reported to the city council with recommendations for any adjustments. 
(4)  The charges, rates and fees shall be set so as to recover costs from users in reasonable proportion to the cost of serving those users. 
(e)  Proportionality, fairness, and benefits of charges, rates and fees. The city council has previously found and further currently reaffirms that the fairest and most reasonable method of providing for the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user, based in all cases on amount of use, for the costs of: (i) retiring debt secured by the net revenues of the system issued to pay for improvements and replacements to the system; (ii) ongoing repair, replacement and improvement and budgeted as part of the annual costs of the system; and (iii) operation, administration and maintenance costs of the system. 
The city has investigated several methods of apportioning the costs of the sewage disposal service provided by the system. Based on its investigation and on the advice of its engineers, the city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms, that to ensure the stability and viability of the system for the benefit of its users, the fairest and most accurate way to apportion the costs of operation, maintenance, replacement and improvement of the system is to charge each user: (i) a connection fee and a capital charge for sewer service when such user's property is first connected to the system; (ii) a commodity rate for the use of sewer services; (iii) a readiness-to-serve charge; and (iv) other charges and costs for services which are equivalent to the cost of providing such services. The city council has previously found, and currently reaffirms that the rates and charges currently in effect accurately apportion the fixed and variable costs of the system among the users of the system and that the commodity rate and the readiness-to-serve charges each provide actual benefits to such users in the form of ready access to sewer service that would be unavailable if such charges were not charged. 
In addition to the findings set forth above, the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the capital charge reflects the depreciated capital costs of the system, previously paid by the city and the system, less grants, attributable to each new user and that the opportunity to connect to the system provides actual benefits to each new user equal to or greater than the amount of such charges. 
Furthermore, the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that the charges imposed by the system are sufficient to meet the short-term capital improvement needs of the system. 
(f)  Design life of improvements. Based on the advice of its engineers, the city council has previously found and currently reaffirms that any improvements to or capital expenditures for the system paid for by rates and charges did not, at the time such improvements were constructed and financed, have an expected design life that would exceed the term of the respective bonds issued to finance such improvements or capital expenditures. 
(g)  Charges for non-residents. 
Contracts for sewage disposal services. The city has previously entered, and may continue to enter, into contracts with municipalities adjacent to the city to provide sewage disposal services in those municipalities. Rates and charges billed for use by the residents of those municipalities shall be in accordance with the applicable contract. 
Charges for service to customers outside city where no other contract compensates the city for indirect costs. The city has previously found, and hereby ratifies and confirms, that the total direct and indirect costs of providing sewage disposal service to customers outside the city jurisdiction, where no other contract exists with the governmental units where those customers are located, equals at least 1.75 times the rates and charges imposed for direct services and debt service cost to customers located in the city. Indirect costs include payment for capital improvements, extraordinary repairs and replacements for the sewage disposal system benefiting all users of the system and paid for by customers served within the corporate limits of the city or the corporate limits of other municipalities which have entered into contracts with the city for such costs, funding depreciation of the improvements to the sewage disposal system, and fire and police or other protection for the sewage disposal system paid by city taxpayers or by the governmental units with which the city has contracts for sewage disposal services.

(b)  Interest on security deposits. The water department will apply interest to the deposit accounts of all users with security deposits over fifty dollars ($50.00). For deposits exceeding fifty dollars ($50.00), interest at the rate of four (4) percent per annum shall be credited to the customer's account, said interest to be computed annually on all sums that have remained on deposit for six (6) months and to be credited semiannually. Accrued interest due shall be paid at the time the deposit is refunded. 
(c)  Notification necessary to waive lien. When a tenant is responsible for payment of water and/or sewer bills and a lease has been executed containing a provision that the lessor not be liable for water and/or sewer charges, then it shall be the responsibility of the lessor to so notify the water department office with an appropriate affidavit signed by both parties requesting a waiver or lien. 
The affidavit must state: "Tenant is totally responsible for all charges for water and/or sewer service furnished to the said premises by the City of Midland. Tenant understands that no service shall be commenced to the above address until there has been deposited with the city a sum sufficient to cover twice the average quarterly bill with a one hundred ten dollars ($110.00) minimum, and a copy of the lease including the affidavit fur nished to the city. Tenant further understands that payment of charges for water and/or sewer service may be enforced by discontinuing the services to the premises." The affidavit shall state the expiration date of the lease. Upon receipt of such notification, the city will waive its lien pursuant to Public Act 178 of the Public Acts of the State of Michigan, of 1939, as amended, and the water and sewer bills to the lessee within the term of the lease shall not be a lien against the property. Upon expiration of the lease, a new affidavit must be submitted to retain the lien waiver. Without such notification, water and/or sewer bills will be a lien against the property served regardless of any lease provisions between the parties. The water and/or sewer bills shall be in the name of the premises except as provided by this section concerning tenants. 
(d)  Security deposits in lieu of lien. When the water department has received and approved a request from the property owner for a waiver of lien, then a cash deposit will be required of the lessee as security for payment of all water and/or sewer charges. Said cash deposit shall be equal to two (2) times the estimated quarterly bill for water and/or sewer charges, but in no case, less than one hundred ten dollars ($110.00). 
Sec. 28-51. - When two customers are served by one connection.

Sec. 28-98. - Purpose and policy. 
    This article of the Code sets forth uniform requirements for direct and indirect discharges into the wastewater collection and treatment system of the City of Midland. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through inadequately treated to the receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the collection and/or treatment facilities; 
(3)  To enable the recycling and reclaiming of wastewaters and sludges from the system; 
(4)  To provide for equitable distribution of the costs incurred by the municipal wastewater system; and 
(5)  To generally govern the use of the City of Midland Sewerage System. 
    This article provides for the regulation of direct and indirect discharges to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user reporting, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs for operation and maintenance of the POTW system and associated programs thereof. 
    This article shall apply to the City of Midland and to persons outside the city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of the city POTW.

ARTICLE II. - CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT AUTHORITY 

Sec. 30-13. - Adopted. 
    The Corridor Improvement Authority Act (Public Act 280 of the Public Acts of the State of Michigan of 2005, as amended) is hereby adopted as the corridor improvement authority ordinance and made a part of this chapter as if fully set out herein, except such portions as are amended or deleted by the provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 1657, § 3, 5-12-08) 
Sec. 30-14. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to provide for the establishment of a corridor improvement authority; to prescribe the powers and duties of the authority; to correct and prevent deterioration in business districts; to encourage historic preservation; to authorize the acquisition and disposal of interest in real and personal property; to authorize the creation and implementation of development plans and development areas in the districts; to promote the economic growth of the districts; to create a board; to prescribe the powers and duties of the board; to authorize the levy and collection of taxes; to authorize the issuance of bonds and other evidences of indebtedness; to authorize the use of tax increment financing; to prescribe powers and duties of certain state officials; to provide for rule promulgation; and to provide a means through which the council may exercise the authority and discharge the responsibilities vested in it by this article and Public Act 280 of the Public Acts of the State of Michigan of 2005, as amended. 
    The city is strongly committed to the revitalization and redevelopment of commercial properties that have historically developed along the city's major arterial roadways ("commercial corridors"). The council believes that revitalization and redevelopment of existing commercial corridors in maturing communities is preferable to the negative effects associated with the continual consumption of vacant land for commercial purposes in growth communities. 
    There presently exist within the city a number of commercial corridors which could greatly benefit from the new Corridor Improvement Authority Act, Act 280 of PA 2005 (the "Act"), through analysis, short- and long-term planning, construction, renovation, repair, remodeling, rehabilitation, restoration, preservation and reconstruction of buildings and facilities. Tax incremental financing is one of many tools available to finance these activities under the Act. 
    The council, having heard and considered testimony regarding the public need and potential benefits that are to be realized through the Act; and, having determined that it is necessary for the best interests of the public to redevelop and promote economic growth within commercial corridors; resolves to proceed with the creation and provide for the operation of a corridor improvement authority ("authority") within the city pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 
(Ord. No. 1657, § 3, 5-12-08) 
Sec. 30-15. - Creation of authority. 
    There is created pursuant to this division a corridor improvement authority for the city. The authority shall be known and exercise its powers under the name "Corridor Improvement Authority of the City of Midland". The authority shall possess all of the powers provided within this article and Public Act 280 of the Public Acts of the State of Michigan 2005, as amended. The enumeration of a power in this division or in the Act shall not be construed as a limitation upon the general powers of the authority. 
(Ord. No. 1657, § 3, 5-12-08) 
Sec. 30-16. - Board. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in the Act, the authority shall be under the supervision and control of a nine (9) member board consisting of the city manager or his or her designee and eight (8) members appointed by the city manager subject to approval by the council. Not less than a majority of the members shall be persons having an ownership or business interest in property located in the development area. At least one (1) of the members shall be a resident of the development area or of an area within one-half mile of any part of the development area. The board shall elect a chairperson from among its members. 
(b)  Before assuming the duties of office, a member shall quality by taking and subscribing to the constitutional oath of office. 
(c)  The business which the board may perform shall be conducted at a public meeting of the board held in accordance with the Open Meetings Act, Public Act 267 of the Public Acts of the State of Michigan of 1976, as amended. Public notice of the time, date and place of the meeting shall be given in the manner required by Act 267. The board shall adopt rules consistent with Act 267 governing its procedure and the holding of regular meetings, subject to the approval of the council. Special meetings may be held when called in the manner provided in the rules of the board. 
(d)  A writing prepared, owned, used, in the possession of, or retained by the board in the performance of an official function is subject to the Freedom of Information Act, Public 442 of the Public Acts of the State of Michigan of 1976, as amended. 
(e)  Members of the board shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses.

    This chapter is enacted to provide minimum standards and regulations applicable to breaking and entering, holdup and fire alarm systems, alarm businesses and alarm users. Both society in general and public safety in particular will be aided by providing a useful and usable system of private security or fire response which properly balances quick response by the police and fire departments with minimization of police officer or fire officer time spent on alarms which are false or otherwise not the intended function of such systems.

Nor is section 32-3 intended to apply to contributions to political campaigns which are governed by state or federal law. 
(Ord. No. 1337, § 1, 1-22-96)

Section 3.10  COMMERCIAL DRIVEWAYS
A. Intent
The intent of this section is to establish standards for driveway spacing and the number of
driveways permitted during the site plan review process. The standards of this section are
intended to promote safe and efficient travel within the City; minimize disruptive and potentially
hazardous traffic conflicts; separate traffic conflict areas by reducing the number of driveways;
provide efficient spacing standards between driveways, and between driveways and intersections;
protect the substantial public investment in the street system; and to ensure reasonable access to
properties, though not always by the most direct access.
The standards herein apply to site plans and plats along roads which are under the jurisdiction of
the City of Midland, Midland County Road Commission, Bay County Road Commission or
Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). Those agencies have driveway design and
permit requirements; however, those general standards may not be sufficient to meet the
particular traffic issues and objectives of The City of Midland. Therefore, the driveway standards
herein may be more restrictive than those provided by the road agencies. Construction within the
public right-of-way under the jurisdiction of Midland or Bay County or MDOT still shall also
meet the permit requirements of the road agency. Where any conflicts arise, the more stringent
standard shall apply.
The City of Midlands Master Plan presents four (4) specific goals to further improve the overall
transportation network in our community. This section strives to implement Goal 1 by regulating
the placement of commercial driveways to ensure that all developments are constructed to a
standard that maximizes pedestrian and vehicular safety and minimizes risks and negative
impacts of new commercial development:
Goal 1: Maintain and improve safety and efficiency in the transportation system to support
land use patterns and ensure that Midland remains an attractive place to live, work, and
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 13
visit.
B. General Standards for Driveway Location
1. Driveways shall be located so as to minimize interference with the free movement of traffic,
to provide adequate sight distance, and to provide the most favorable driveway grade.
2. Driveways, including the radii but not including right turn lanes, passing lanes and tapers,
shall be located entirely within the right-of-way frontage, unless otherwise approved by the
City of Midland.
3. Spacing between driveways where traffic signals are involved shall meet the requirements for
spacing of driveways from street intersections as shown in Table 3.5
4. Arterials, collectors, and local streets are as classified in the City of Midland Master Plan.
C. Commercial Driveway Spacing Standards for a Parcel
Each parcel on which a commercial or industrial development is located on shall be permitted one
(1) commercial driveway to provide reasonable access for regular traffic and emergency vehicles,
while preserving traffic operations and safety along the public roadway. Additional driveways
may be permitted for a property only under one of the following:
1. One (1) additional driveway may be allowed for properties with a continuous frontage of over
three hundred (300) feet if it is determined there are no other reasonable access opportunities,
provided the additional driveway complies with the requirements in subsection D, below.
2. On parcels with frontage along two (2) streets, one driveway may be permitted to each street
provided that proper driveway spacing is achieved from the roadway intersection as shown in
Table 3.5.
3. When considering additional driveway placement, Table 3.3 and the following criteria shall
be reviewed:
a. Will not be detrimental to public safety.
b. Will not be detrimental to the safety and operation of the street.
c. Are necessary for safe and efficient use of the property.
d. Will prevent/reduce traffic congestion and confusion, based on a traffic impact study.
(See Section 3.10(I))
4. For parcels that are not a corner lot, one-way drives may be permitted provided the driveway
approaches comply with the commercial driveway spacing standards in subsection D, below.
D. Commercial Driveway Spacing Standards for Separate Parcels
1. Spacing between driveways on separate parcels or developments: The minimum
spacing between two commercial driveways shall be determined based upon posted speed
limits along the parcel frontage as shown in Table 3.3. The minimum spacing indicated
below is based on Michigan Department of Transportation Guidelines and are measured
between driveway centerlines. The minimum spacing between driveways may be
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 14
reduced if one driveway has a traffic signal.

1 If adjacent parcels are over 300 feet in width, then the minimum spacing between driveways
shall be 300 feet.
2 Collector and Arterial Roadways may require more restrictive spacing based on local conditions
Table 3.3 General Notes:
? Spacing between driveways is measured centerline to centerline.
? Driveways shall be placed as far from adjacent driveways as practical.
? Driveway sharing or driveway cross access with adjacent parcels may apply when minimum spacing is not
possible and at the discretion of the City.
? Spacing of driveways from intersections takes precedence over spacing from other driveways.
For site with insufficient street frontage to meet the above criterion, the following alternatives may be
considered:
a. Construction of the driveway may be required along a side street. A shared driveway
with an adjacent property may be used.
b. Construction of a driveway along the property line farthest from the intersection.
c. A service/frontage road as described in Sections 3.10(E) and 3.10(F) may be required.
2. Spacing between driveways on the opposite sides of the street: To reduce left-turn conflicts,
new commercial driveways shall be aligned with driveways or streets on the opposite side of the
roadway where possible. Spacing between driveways on opposite side of a street shall be
indicated in Table 3.4. For sites with insufficient street frontage to meet the above criterion, it
may require construction of the driveway along a side street, a shared driveway with an adjacent
property, construction of a driveway along the property line farthest from the intersection or
require a service/frontage road as described in Sections 3.10(E) and 3.10(F).

? Table 3.4 applies to Arterials and Collectors Streets.
? Local Street driveways are approved at the discretion of the City.
? Spacing between driveways is measured centerline to centerline.
? This standard may be reduced by the City in the case of a single proposed driveway serving a parcel, where no
other point of reasonable access is feasible. No reduction is allowed if two or more driveways are proposed to
serve the parcel.
? If the proposed driveway is a boulevard, or two access points acting as one-way pair, existing driveway spacing to
the right applies to inbound movements, and existing driveway spacing to the left applies to outbound movements.
3. Spacing from intersections: Minimum spacing requirements between a proposed commercial
driveway and an intersection either adjacent to or on the opposite side of the street in no instance
shall be less than the distances listed in Table 3.5. The following measurements are from the near
edge of the proposed driveway, measured at the throat perpendicular to the street, to the near lane
edge of the intersecting street or pavement edge for uncurbed sections.

Arterials and Collectors are as classified in the City of Midland Master Plan.
For sites with insufficient street frontage to meet the above criterion, construction of the driveway
along a side street, a shared driveway with an adjacent property, construction of a driveway along
the property line farthest from the intersection or require a service/frontage road as described in
Sections 3.10(E) and 3.10(F) is encouraged.
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 16
E. Standards for Shared Driveways and Service/Frontage Roads
The use of service roads, in conjunction with driveway spacing, is intended to preserve traffic flow
along major thoroughfares and minimize traffic conflicts, while retaining reasonable access to the
property. Where noted above, or where reducing the number of access points may have a beneficial
impact on traffic operations and safety while preserving the property owner's right to reasonable
access, access from a side street, a shared driveway or service road connecting two or more
properties or uses is encouraged. In particular, service drives, frontage roads or at least a
connection between uses is encouraged in the following cases:
1. Where the driveway spacing standards of this section cannot be met.
2. When the driveway could potentially interfere with traffic operations at an existing or potential
traffic signal location.
3. The site is along an Arterial.
4. The property frontage has limited sight distance.
5. The fire department recommends a second means of emergency access.
F. Design Standards for Service Drives
Service roads as an alternate to numerous individual driveways serving a series of uses or lots shall
be designed according to the following additional standards:
1. Location
Service roads shall generally be parallel or perpendicular to the front property line and
may be located either in front of, adjacent to, or behind, principal buildings and may be
placed in required yards. In considering the most appropriate alignment for a service
road, the setbacks of existing and/or proposed buildings and anticipated traffic flow for
the site shall be considered.
2. Access Easement
The service road shall be within an access easement permitting traffic circulation between
properties. This easement shall be at least forty (40) feet wide. This easement shall be
recorded with the Midland or Bay County Register of Deeds.
3. Construction and Materials
Service roads shall have a base, pavement in accord with city standards and when
required curb and gutter in accordance with City standards.
4. Parking
The service road is intended to be used exclusively for circulation, not as a parking
maneuvering aisle. It may be required that "no parking" signs be posted along the service
road. In reviewing the site plan, temporary parking may be permitted in the easement area
where a continuous service road is not yet available, provided that the layout allows
removal of the parking in the future to allow extension of the service road. Temporary
parking spaces permitted within the service drive shall be in excess of the minimum
required under Article 5.00, Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements.
5. Access
The location of all accesses to the service/frontage road shall be approved based on the
driveway spacing standards of this Article.
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 17
6. Temporary Access
Temporary access points may be approved where a continuous service road is not yet
available and a performance bond or escrow is created to assure elimination of temporary
access when the service road is continued.
7. Elevation
The site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the service/frontage road at the
property line and the Engineering Department shall maintain a record of all service road
elevations so that their grades can be coordinated.
8. Landscaping
The greenbelt between a service road and the public street right-of-way shall be
landscaped as specified in Article 6.00, Landscaping and Screening.
9. Maintenance
Each property owner shall be responsible for maintaining the service/frontage road. A
maintenance agreement, approved by the City Attorney, shall be required.
G. Commercial Driveway Design
Commercial driveways shall be designed according to the standards of the City of Midland and in
accordance with the following:
1. Throat Width & Length
a. Throat Width: The typical commercial driveway design shall include one ingress
lane and one egress lane with a combined maximum throat width of thirty (30) feet,
measured from face to face of curb.
b. Throat Length:
i. There shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet of throat length for entering
and exiting vehicles at the intersection of a driveway and pavement of the
public road or service drive as measured from the pavement edge.
ii. For a driveway serving between one hundred (100) and four hundred (400)
vehicles in the peak hour (two way traffic volumes) the driveway shall
provide at least sixty (60) feet of throat length.
iii. For a driveway serving over four-hundred (400) vehicles per peak hour (two
way traffic volume) and for any driveway controlled by a traffic signal,
adequate throat length shall be determined by a traffic impact study.
iv. In areas where significant pedestrian/bicycle travel is expected, the ingress
and egress lanes should be separated by a four to ten foot (4 to 10) wide
median with pedestrian refuge area.
2. Additional Egress Lanes Required
For high traffic generators, or for commercial driveways along roadways experiencing or
expected to experience congestion, two (2) egress lanes may be required (one a separate left
turn lane). The total width of such a driveway shall be between thirty-seven and thirty-nine
feet (37  39), with one fifteen foot (15) wide ingress lane and two (2) eleven to twelve
foot (11  12) wide egress lanes.
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 18
3. Boulevard Entrances.
Where a boulevard entrance is desired, a fully curbed island shall separate the ingress and
egress lanes. The radii forming the edges on this island shall be designed to accommodate the
largest vehicle that will normally use the driveway. The minimum area of the island shall be
one hundred eighty (180) square feet. Landscaping may be required on the section outside
the public right-of-way. Such landscaping shall be tolerant of roadway conditions. Direct
alignment of boulevard entrances is discouraged.
H. Modification of Standards for Commercial Driveways for Special Situations
During site plan review dealing with commercial driveways, the Planning Commission shall have
the authority to modify the standards of this Article upon consideration of the following:
1. The standards of this section would prevent reasonable access to the site.
2. Access via a shared driveway or service/frontage road is not possible due to the presence of
existing buildings or topographic conditions.
3. Roadway improvements (such as the addition of a traffic signal, a center turn lane or
bypass lane) will be made to improve overall traffic operations prior to project completion,
or occupancy of the building.
4. The use involves the redesign of an existing development or a new use that will generate
less traffic than the previous use or will move traffic more efficiently.
5. The proposed location and design is supported by a Road Authority other than the City of
Midland as an acceptable design under the conditions. The Planning Commission may also
request the applicant provide a traffic impact study in accordance with Section 3.17 to
support the requested access design.
6. The modification shall be of the minimum amount necessary, but in no case shall spacing
of a full-access driveway from another driveway be less than sixty (60) feet, measured
centerline to centerline.
I. Traffic Impact Studies
Traffic impact studies shall be required based on thresholds and related recommendations established per
the Evaluating Traffic Impact Studies A Recommended Practice for Michigan Communities (ETIS),
as amended and related Institution of Transportation Engineers (ITE) specifications as amended. Studies
provided in the ETIS are dependent on trip generation thresholds primarily described in Tables 1 and 3 of
the ETIS. Details regarding content of any required traffic study are as provided in the ETIS. The types
of required studies shown in Table 3 of the ETIS are indicated below.
? Rezoning/Use Traffic Study  Standard study related to trip generation rates below 50 vehicles in
one direction in the peak traffic hour or below 500 daily vehicle trips.
? Traffic Impact Assessment (TIA)  complete study that is significantly more detailed than the
standard study, with related trip generation rates from 50-99 vehicles in one direction in the peak
traffic hour or 500-749 daily vehicle trips.
? Traffic Impact Statement (TIS)  More detailed study than the TIA. This study is related to trip
generation rates with 100+ vehicles in one direction in the peak traffic hour or 750+ daily vehicle
trips.
? Regional Traffic Analysis - More detailed study than the TIS. This study is related to trip
generation rates with 500+ vehicles in one direction in the peak traffic hour.
Any required traffic studies may require review by a City designated professional traffic consultant or
engineer.

Section 3.11 -- GRADING REGULATIONS
A. Intent and Scope of Requirements
In addition to the requirements in Chapter 29 of the Midland Code of Ordinances, compliance with
the grading regulations set forth herein shall be required as follows:
1. Intent
Grading regulations are established to control the excavation and filling of land, to assure
adequate drainage away from structures and to a natural or established drainage course, and
to assure protection of trees on sites where grading is to take place and to protect adjacent
properties from receiving excess storm water runoff. The regulations set forth herein also
establish procedures and requirements for grading permits, inspection of finished grading
operations, and penalties for violation of the grading regulations.
2. Scope of Application
A Grading Plan approved by the Building Official and the City Engineer shall be required
in all instances where grading, excavating, filling, stockpiling, or other alterations to the
land are proposed. "Filling" includes the dumping of soil, sand, clay, gravel, rock, garbage,
rubbish or other wastes or byproducts on a site. The regulations in this section do not apply
to normal soil removal for basement or foundation work when a building permit has been
duly issued by the Building Official.
B. Grading Plan
1. Grading Plan
The fee holder owner of the property concerned shall first submit a Topographic Plan for
review and approval by the Building Official and City Engineer.
2. Grading Plan Standards
At a minimum, topographic plans shall be drawn at a scale of not less than one (1) inch
equals fifty (50) feet, and shall show existing and proposed grades and topographic
features. The City Engineer may require other data.
C. Grading Standards
1. Slope Away From Buildings
All buildings and structures shall be constructed at an elevation that provides a sloping
grade away from the building or structure, thereby causing surface water to drain away
from the walls of the building to a natural or established drainage course without negatively
impacting neighboring properties. The finished grade around a building within one
hundred (100) feet of a street curb line shall not be less than one quarter inch per foot above
the curb height of the street on which the building faces, unless this slope cannot be
reasonably achieved on a parcel of property, in which case the Building Official or City
Engineer may establish the appropriate grade.
2. Grade on Vacant Lot Adjacent to Existing Building
When a new building is constructed on a vacant lot between two (2) buildings or adjacent
to an existing building, the existing established grade shall be used to determine the grade
around the new structure if the provisions of Section 3.11, item C.1, are met. If the existing
slope does not meet the provisions, the Building Official or City Engineer will establish the
appropriate grade.
3. Prohibited Runoff
New grades shall not be established that would permit an increase in the runoff of surface
water onto adjacent properties or public roads, except through established drainage courses,
or cause surface runoff to accumulate on the surface of an adjacent property.
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 20
4. Excavations of Holes
The excavation, maintenance or continued existence of unprotected, unbarricaded, open or
dangerous holes, pits, or wells that constitute or are reasonably likely to constitute a danger
or menace to the public health, safety, and welfare is prohibited. However, this restriction
shall not apply to excavations for which a permit has been acquired from the City under
this chapter or the building code of the City, provided such excavations are properly
protected with fencing, guard rails, and warning signs, as may be approved by the Building
Official. This section also shall not apply to lakes, streams, ditches, reservoirs, or other
bodies of water under the jurisdiction of the State of Michigan, Midland County, Bay
County, the City of Midland, or other governmental agency.
5. Soil Erosion and Sedimentation
If required by Public Act 451 of 1994, as amended, a Soil Erosion and Sedimentation
Control Permit shall be obtained. Proposed grading shall comply with other requirements
of the County Drain Commission.
D. Review, Inspection, and Approval Procedures
A Certificate of Occupancy may be issued by the City when the requirements set forth herein and in
other applicable ordinances have been complied with. The filing of a surety bond to the City,
issued by a surety company authorized to do business in Michigan, may be required with the
application for a Grading Certificate in appropriate cases. The amount of the surety bond will
determined by the City Engineer and should be sufficient to rehabilitate the property upon default
of the operator or such other reasonable expenses.
Section 3.12 -- LIGHTING
Subject to the provisions set forth herein, all parking areas, walkways, driveways, building entryways,
off-street parking and loading areas, and building complexes with common areas involving commercial,
industrial, office, multiple family, or manufactured housing park development shall be sufficiently

H. Site Plan Requirements
All lighting, including lighting that is intended to be primarily decorative in nature, shall be shown
on the site plans. For all site plan reviews, a photometric plan shall be submitted as part of the site
plan in sufficient detail to allow determination of the effects of such lighting upon adjacent
properties, traffic safety, and overhead sky glow. The objective of these specifications is to
minimize undesirable off-site effects.
Section 3.13 -- EXCEPTIONS
A. Essential Services
Essential services, as defined in Section 2.02, shall be permitted as authorized and regulated by
franchise agreements and by state, federal, and local ordinances and laws. Essential services will
be permitted in all use districts. It is the intention of this Ordinance to exempt such uses from those
regulations governing lot area, building or structure height, building or structure placement, and use
of land in the City that would not be practical or feasible to comply with.
The intention of the City is to achieve efficient use of the land and alleviate adverse impact on
nearby uses or lands. Essential services buildings and uses should be reasonably necessary for the
public convenience, and should be designed, erected and landscaped to conform harmoniously with
the general architecture and character of such district and shall not be permitted in clear vision
areas.
B. Exceptions to Height Standards
The height limitations of this Ordinance shall not apply to roof structures for the housing of
elevators, stairways, tanks, ventilating fans, or similar equipment required to operate and maintain

collectors, towers, steeples, cupolas, belfries, domes, ornamental towers, stage lofts and screens;
flagpoles, chimneys, smokestacks, individual domestic radio and television aerials, wireless masts
and satellite dishes; water tanks or similar structures, fire and hose towers. Such structures may be
erected without regard to height limitations imposed in the district in which the same is located, to a
maximum height of one hundred (100) feet from the building grade. This maximum height
limitation does not apply in the Industrial A and B Districts.
Section 3.14 -- PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
A. Intent and Scope of Requirements
To insure compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance and any conditions imposed there
under, the City Council may require that a performance guarantee be deposited with the City to
insure faithful completion of improvements, in accordance with Michigan Public Act 100 of 2006
as amended.
Improvements means those features and/or actions considered necessary to protect natural resources
or the health, safety, and welfare of the city residents and/or the future users or inhabitants of the
proposed project. Improvements for which a performance guarantee may be required include, but
are not limited to, roadways, parking, lighting, utilities, sidewalks, screening and drainage.
B. General Requirements
The performance guarantee shall meet the following requirements:
1. The performance guarantee shall be in the form of an irrevocable bank letter of credit or
cash escrow. If the applicant posts a letter of credit, the credit shall require only that the
City present the credit with a draft and an affidavit signed by the City Manager attesting to
the City's right to draw funds under the credit. If the applicant posts a cash escrow, the
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 24
escrow instructions shall provide that the escrow agent shall have a legal duty to deliver the
funds to the City whenever the City Manager presents an affidavit to the agent attesting to
the City's right to receive funds whether or not the applicant protests that right.
2. The performance guarantee shall be submitted at the time of issuance of the permit
authorizing the activity or project. If appropriate, based on the type of performance
guarantee submitted, the City shall deposit the funds in an interest-bearing account in a
financial institution with which the City regularly conducts business.
3. The amount of the performance guarantee shall be sufficient to cover the estimated cost of
the improvements for which the performance guarantee is required. The applicant shall
provide an itemized schedule of estimated costs to complete all such improvements. The
Building Official shall determine the exact amount of the performance guarantee.
4. The entire performance guarantee, plus interest accrued, if any, shall be returned to the
applicant following inspection by the Building Official and a determination that the
required improvements have been completed satisfactorily. The performance guarantee
may be released to the applicant in proportion to the work completed on various elements,
provided that a minimum of ten percent (10%) shall be held back on each element until
satisfactory completion of the entire project.
5. An amount not less than ten percent (10%) of the total performance guarantee may be
retained for a period of at least one (1) year after installation of landscape materials to
insure proper maintenance and replacement, if necessary. This amount shall be released to
the applicant upon certification by the Building Official that all landscape materials are
being maintained in good condition.
C. Unsatisfactory Completion of Improvements
Whenever required improvements are not installed or maintained within the time stipulated or in
accordance with the standards set forth in this Ordinance, the City may complete the necessary
improvements itself or by contract to an independent developer, and assess all costs of completing
said improvements against the performance guarantee. If the performance guarantee is not
sufficient to cover the cost of required improvements, the City may complete the required
improvements and then place a lien on the property to recover the full cost of such improvements.
Prior to completing said improvements, the City shall notify the owner, site plan review applicant,
or other firm or individual responsible for completion of the required improvements.
Section 3.15 -- WASTE DUMPSTERS, COMPACTORS, AND
ENCLOSURES
Adequate refuse disposal facilities shall be required for all uses, except single-family and two-family
residences.
A. Standards for Siting and Screening of Trash Dumpsters or Compactors
Dumpsters or compactors may be permitted or required as accessory to any use other than single
and two-family residential uses, subject to the following conditions:
1. Location
Dumpsters or compactors shall not be located in the required front yard setback. Any such
dumpster shall have adequate vehicular access, shall not encroach on a required parking
area, and shall not conflict with entrances to principal buildings. Dumpsters shall be located
to minimize their visibility from adjacent streets and adjacent properties. Dumpsters shall
be setback a minimum of ten (10) feet from any side or rear property line, and shall be
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 25
located as far as practicable from any adjoining residential district.
2. Concrete Pad
Dumpsters or compactors shall be placed on a concrete pad. The concrete pad should
extend a minimum of three (3) feet in front of a dumpster enclosure.
3. Screening
Dumpsters and compactors shall be screened from view from adjoining property and public
streets and thoroughfares. Any dumpsters or compactor shall be screened on three sides
with a permanent building, decorative masonry wall, or wood fencing, at least one (1) foot
above the height of the enclosed dumpster. The height of the screening shall not exceed
eight (8) feet. The screening material shall be compatible with the exterior of the principal
building. The fourth side of the screening shall be equipped with an opaque lockable gate
that is the same height as the enclosure around the other three sides.
4. Waiver of Screening Requirements
The screening requirements may be waived upon finding that the unscreened dumpster or
compactor will not be visible from adjoining property or from any public road, or upon
finding that if the dumpster or compactor is visible from the adjoining property the impact
will not be detrimental because of the size or location of the proposed dumpster or
compactor or because of the nature of the adjoining use.
If it is determined those circumstances have changed and screening is needed, the Building
Official may order screening around the dumpster or compactor at a later date. This section
is not intended to require the screening of any dumpster or compactor used on a temporary
basis during construction, remodeling or demolition of a building.
5. Bollards
Bollards (concrete filled metal posts) or similar protective devices shall be installed at the
opening of the enclosure to prevent damage to the screening wall or fence.
6. Site Plan Requirements
The location and method of screening of dumpsters shall be shown on all site plans.
Section 3.16 -- COMMUNICATION FACILITIES
A. Reception and Broadcast Antennae Facilities
In all zoning districts the installation of reception and broadcast antenna facilities shall be permitted
as an accessory use, subject to the provisions in this section. This section does not apply to wireless
communication facilities (See Section B).
1. Purpose
The purposes of this section are as follows:
a. To provide reasonable regulations for the placement of reception antenna facilities.
b. To promote safety and prevent danger to persons and property resulting from accidents
involving antenna facilities that may become dislodged and fall due to wind load, snow load
or other forces.
c. To require screening of ground-mounted facilities and to minimize the visibility of roof or
structure mounted facilities in the interest of maintaining the high architectural and aesthetic
qualities of the City and in the interest of maintaining and preserving property values.
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 26
2. Ground-Mounted or Tower-Mounted Antennas
Ground-mounted or tower-mounted antennas shall be subject to the following conditions:
a. The maximum height of any part of a ground-mounted or tower-mounted antenna shall not
exceed twenty-eight (28) feet or the minimum height necessary to achieve adequate
reception.
b. Ground-mounted or tower-mounted antennas in a residential zoning district shall not be
located in the front yard.
3. Roof-Mounted Antennas
Antennas mounted on a roof of a building shall be subject to the following regulations:
a. Antennas mounted on a building shall not exceed an overall height of twenty-eight (28) feet.
b. Roof-mounted antennas shall be permitted on an accessory structure located in a yard
between the principal building and any property line.
4. General Requirements
All antennas shall comply with the following regulations:
a. Antennas shall not be used to display a sign or message board.
b. Permits, if required by the adopted building or electrical code, shall be obtained prior to
construction of an antenna. The applicant shall submit an administrative site plan for
administrative review indicating the exact location where the antenna will be located, plus
applicable electrical and structural plans and documentation.
c. All wiring to a freestanding antenna shall be installed underground.
d. In the event that approval is requested for an antenna that is higher than the minimum
standards specified in this section, or if other variations from the required standards are
proposed, documentation shall be provided demonstrating the need for such variations in
order to achieve adequate reception. The following criteria shall be used to evaluate a
request for a variation:
i. No alternate sites would provide adequate coverage while meeting the minimum
requirements;
ii. The variation is needed due to existing physical features that are not self-created such as
topography, vegetation or existing structures;
iii. The variation is the minimum needed to achieve adequate coverage; and
iv. Appropriate design measures have been taken to minimize the affect of the variation,
such as a stealth design, landscaping, etc.
e. Notwithstanding the setback requirements specified previously in this section, antennas with
a wind resistance surface of seven (7) square feet or less and all open element and monopole
antennas shall have a setback from any residential-zoned district or existing or proposed
right-of-way or other publicly traveled road, whichever is greater: the total height of the
structure and attachments thereto or the required setbacks for principal buildings specified in
the Schedule of Regulations for the zoning district.
Where antennas with a wind resistance surface of seven (7) square feet or less and all open
element and monopole antennas abut a parcel of land zoned for a use other than residential,
the structure shall comply with the required setbacks for principal buildings specified in the
Schedule of Regulations for the zoning district in which the facility is located.
All antennas with a wind resistance over seven (7) square feet shall be located in the rear
yard only, and shall be subject to the setback and height standards for the district in which
they are located. Any such antenna shall be located to obscure its view from adjacent
properties and roads, to the maximum extent possible.
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 27
B. Wireless Communication Facilities
1. Purpose
It is the general purpose and intent of the City of Midland to carry out the will of the United
States Congress by authorizing communication facilities needed to operate wireless
communication systems. However, it is the further purpose and intent of the City to provide for
such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character,
property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large. In fashioning and administering
the provisions of this section, an attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing
interests.
Recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless communication
services and coverage, it is the further purpose and intent of this Section to:
a. Facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless communication facilities.
b. Identify districts considered best for the establishment of wireless communication
facilities, subject to applicable standards and conditions.
c. Recognize that operation of a wireless communication system may require the
establishment of facilities in locations outside of the districts considered best for such
facilities. In such cases, it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater
adverse impact. Consequently, more stringent standards and conditions should apply to
the review, approval and use of such facilities.
d. Ensure that wireless communication facilities are situated in appropriate locations and
relationships to other land uses, structures and buildings.
e. Minimize the adverse impacts of technological obsolescence of such facilities, including
a requirement to remove unused and/or unnecessary facilities in a timely manner.
f. Minimize adverse visual impact of transmission towers and telecommunications
facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping and innovative camouflaging
techniques.
g. Promote and require, where feasible, shared use/co-location of transmission towers and
antenna support structures as the primary option rather than construction of additional
single-use transmission towers.
h. Promote public health and welfare and prevent potential damage to property by
ensuring transmission towers and antenna support structures are soundly and carefully
designed, constructed, modified, maintained and removed when no longer used or
determined to be structurally unsound.
i. Minimize the negative visual impact of wireless communication facilities on
neighborhoods, community landmarks, historic sites and buildings, natural beauty areas
and public rights-of-way. This contemplates the establishment of as few structures as
reasonably feasible, and the use of structures which are designed for compatibility,
including the use of existing structures and the avoidance of lattice structures that are
unnecessary, taking into consideration the purposes and intent of this section.
2. Definitions
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this Article, shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
a. Administrative Site Plan. A site plan submitted pursuant to Article 27 for co-locations
and small scale facilities specified in the following Section 3. Because of their minimal
impacts, these projects or changes are permitted to provide less detailed information than
a full scale site plan. The level of information is intended to be proportionate to the
extent of the change and to ensure adequate review for compliance with applicable
standards.
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 28
b. Administrative Review. Select smaller scale projects and expansions or changes in use
to existing sites do not require review by the Planning Commission; but shall undergo an
administrative site plan review for approval by city staff.
c. Antennas. An electrical conductor or group of electrical conductors that transmit or
receive radio waves, excluding amateur radio antennas.
d. Attachment. An antenna or other piece of related equipment affixed to a transmission
tower, building, light or utility pole, or water tower.
e. Co-location. Placement of an antenna on an existing transmission tower, building, light
or utility pole or water tower where the antenna and all supports are located on the
existing structure.
f. Private or Public Utility Cabinets. Ground mounted structures that are used to house
telecommunication equipment.
g. Site Plan. See definition in Section 2.02.
h. Stealth. Any transmission tower or telecommunications facility which is designed to
enhance compatibility with adjacent land uses, including, but not limited to,
architecturally screened roof-mounted antennas, antennas integrated into
architectural elements, and transmission towers designed to look other than like a
transmission tower such as light poles, power poles and trees.
i. Support Structure. Structures erected or modified to support wireless
communication antennas. Support structures within this definition include, but shall not
be limited to, monopoles, lattice towers, light poles, guyed towers, and stealth structures
which appear to be something other than a mere support structure.
j. Telecommunications Facilities. Any cables, wires, lines, wave guides, antennas and
any other equipment or facilities associated with the transmission or reception of
communications which a person seeks to locate or has installed upon or near a
transmission tower or antenna support structure. However, the term
telecommunications facilities shall not include any satellite earth station antenna one
meter or less in diameter, regardless of zoning category.
k. Transmission Tower. The monopole or lattice framework designed to support
transmitting and receiving antennas. For the purposes of this section, amateur radio
transmission facilities and facilities used exclusively for the transmission of television and
radio signals are not "transmission towers."
l. Wireless Internet Facilities. Wireless internet facilities, including integrated units
that have a radio and antenna in one unit and point to point and point to multi-point
antennae, are considered to be a telecommunication facility.

4. Standards and Conditions
a. No telecommunication facility or transmission tower, as defined in this Section, may be
constructed, modified to increase its height, installed or otherwise located within the City
except as provided in this Section.
i. Public Health and Safety: Facilities and/or support structures shall not be
detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare.
ii. Harmony with Surroundings: Facilities shall be located and designed to be
harmonious with the surrounding areas.
iii. Compliance with Federal, State and Local Standards: Wireless communication
facilities shall comply with applicable federal and state standards, including
requirements promulgated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),
Federal Communication Commission (FCC), and Michigan Aeronautics
Commission. Wireless communication support structures shall comply with all
applicable building codes.
No wireless communication facility shall be installed at a location where special
painting or lighting will be required by the FAA regulations unless the applicant
has demonstrated to the City that the proposed location is the only technically
feasible location for the provision of personal wireless services as required by the
FCC.
iv. Conflict with Tri-City Regulations: In the event of any conflict between this
Section and the Tri-City Zoning Ordinance, the Tri-City regulations shall take
precedence.
v. Maximum Height: Applicants shall demonstrate a justification for the proposed
height of the structures and an evaluation of alternative designs which may result
in lower heights. The maximum height of a new or modified support structure
and antenna shall be the minimum height demonstrated to be necessary for
reasonable communication by the applicant (and by other entities to collocate on
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 30
the structure), but shall not exceed one hundred fifty (150) feet. However, higher
towers may be permitted, subject to the granting of a waiver provided for by
sub-section 9, if necessary to achieve co-location or the minimum height for
attaining an adequate signal.
The buildings, cabinets, and other accessory structures shall not exceed the
maximum height for accessory structures in the zoning district in which the
facility is located.
vi. Minimum Setbacks: The setback of a new or modified support structure shall be
no less than the total height of the structure and attachments thereto.
New support structures are to be setback at least 300 feet from a property zoned
or used for residential purposes. New support structures that are proposed to be
setback less than 300 feet from a property zoned or used for residential purposes
shall be required to obtain Conditional Use approval. In addition to other
considerations, the applicant must demonstrate, through written documentation
provided by an engineer, that a location 300 feet or more from a property zoned or
used for residential purposes is not feasible.
Buildings and facilities accessory to the wireless communication facility (such as
equipment shelters, guy wire anchors) shall comply with the required setbacks
for principal buildings specified in the Schedule of Regulations for the zoning
district in which the facility is located.
vii. Access: Unobstructed permanent access to the support structure shall be provided
for operation, maintenance, repair and inspection purposes, which may be
provided through or over an easement. The permitted type of surfacing,
dimensions and location of such access route shall be based on evaluation of the
location of adjacent roads, layout of buildings and equipment on the site, utilities
needed to service the facility, proximity to residential districts, disturbance to the
natural landscape, and the type of vehicles and equipment that will visit the site.
The access road must be properly designed and constructed to ensure adequate
access by emergency vehicles.
viii. Division of Property: The division of property for the purpose of locating a
wireless communication facility shall be permitted only if all zoning
requirements, including lot size and lot width requirements are met.
ix. Exterior Finish. If a facility is conditioned to require paint, it shall initially be
painted with a flat (i.e., non-reflective) paint color, and thereafter repainted as
necessary with a flat paint color, unless it is determined that flat paint color
would lead to more adverse impact than would another type of paint color.
x. Stealth Design: Wireless communication facilities should be sited where they
blend with the existing and projected development for any given vicinity. Where
appropriate, antennas should be located on existing structures such as a church
steeple, or a clock tower, eliminating the need for additional new support towers.
Facilities should appear integrated, and architecturally compatible with the
existing structure to promote visual harmony.
Where feasible, a self-supporting transmission tower should be designed to
closely resemble a commonplace object that blends with its surroundings. Some
examples of stealth structures are tree poles in wooded areas or a flag pole.
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 31
Wireless communication facilities located on highly visible sites will only be
allowed when appropriately camouflaged. All stealth or faux structures shall
emulate architectural or landscape features typical of the surrounding area in
terms of architectural style, height, bulk, mass, material, and color.
xi. Signs and Graphics. No signs, striping, graphics or other devices that draw
attention are permitted on the transmission tower or ancillary facilities except
for warning and safety signage with a surface area of no more than three (3)
square feet. Such signage shall be affixed to a fence or ancillary facility and the
number of signs is limited to no more than two (2).
xii. Fencing: Wireless communication facilities shall be enclosed by a fence having
a maximum height of allowed by the district in which it is located. Barbed wire
is not permitted except in the IA and IB districts.
xiii. Lighting: Any exterior lighting, except as required for FAA regulations for
airport safety, shall be manually operated and used only during night
maintenance checks or in emergencies. The lighting shall be constructed or
located so that only the intended area is illuminated and off-site glare is fully
controlled in accordance with Section 3.12 of this Ordinance.
xiv. Structural Integrity: Wireless communication facilities and support structures
shall be constructed and maintained in structurally sound condition, using the
best available technology, to minimize any threat to public safety. The support
system shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable building codes and
shall include the submission of a soils report from a geotechnical engineer,
licensed in the State of Michigan. This soils report shall include soil borings and
statements confirming the suitability of soil conditions for the proposed use. The
requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Communication
Commission, and Michigan Aeronautics Commission shall be noted.
xv. Maintenance: A plan for the long term, continuous maintenance of the facility
shall be submitted. The plan shall identify who will be responsible for
maintenance and shall include a method of notifying the City if maintenance
responsibilities change.
b. A telecommunication facility or transmission tower, which requires a conditional use
permit, shall be processed in accordance with the conditional use permit procedures of
this ordinance and in accordance with established administrative policies. The
conditional use criteria contained in this ordinance and the application requirements and
standards of this Section of the Ordnance shall govern approval or denial of the
conditional use permit application. In the event of a conflict in criteria, the criteria
contained in this Section shall govern. No building permit shall be issued prior to
completion of this conditional use permit process, including any appeals.
5. Administrative site plan requirements
a. For situations requiring administrative site plan review, the following information shall
be provided:
1. All plans shall adhere to the provisions of Article 27.
2. Signed certification by a professional engineer licensed by the State of Michigan
with regard to the manner in which the proposed structure will fall in the event of
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 32
damage, accident or injury, i.e., fall line, and that the setback area provided shall
accommodate the structure should it fall or break and provide a reasonable buffer
in the event the structure fails.
3. The name, address and phone number of the person to contact for engineering,
maintenance and other notice purposes. This information shall be continuously
updated during all times the facility is on the premises.
4. Access (cross section of road access).
b. Standards and Conditions Applicable to Conditional Land Use Facilities: In addition to
the standards and conditions described in the preceding subsection where approval is
sought for a wireless communication facility that is considered Conditional Land Use, the
applicant shall provide sufficient documentation and maps to demonstrate the need for
the facility in the proposed location because of one or more of the following conditions:
i. Proximity to an interstate or major thoroughfare.
ii. Proximity to areas of population concentration.
iii. Proximity of other wireless communication facilities.
iv. Lack of ability to meet co-location requirements.
v. Concentration of commercial, industrial, and/or other business centers.
iv. Presence of signal interference due to masses of trees, topography, or other
obstructions.
v. Other specific reason(s) creating the need for the facility in the specific location
being proposed.
6. Co-location of Additional Antennas on Existing Transmission Towers
a. Co-location Requirements: It is the policy of the City to minimize the overall number of
newly established locations for wireless communication facilities and wireless
communication support structures within the city and to encourage the use of existing
structures for attached wireless communication facilities. If a provider fails or refuses to
permit co-location on a facility owned or controlled by it, where co-location is feasible,
the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be required, in
contradiction with this policy. Co-location shall be required unless an applicant
demonstrates that co-location is not feasible.
Co-location shall be deemed feasible for the purpose of this Section where all of the
following are met:
1. The wireless communication provider or property owner where co-location is
proposed will accept market rent or other market compensation for co-location
and the wireless communication provider seeking the facility will pay such rates.
2. The site on which co-location is being considered, taking into consideration
reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is able to provide structural
support.
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 33
3. The co-location being considered is technically reasonable, e.g. the co-location
will not result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate physical and other
adjustments in relation to the structure, antennas and the like.
New transmission towers shall be designed to accommodate co-location of additional
providers:
1. New transmission towers of a height of one hundred (100) feet or more shall be
designed to accommodate co-location of a minimum of two additional providers
either outright or through future modification to the transmission tower.
2. New transmission towers of a height of at least sixty (60) feet and no more
than one hundred (100) feet shall be designed to accommodate co-location of a
minimum of one additional provider either outright or through future
modification to the transmission tower.
7. Requirements for Co-location
a. A conditional land use permit for the construction and use of a new wireless
communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates
that a feasible co-location is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs.
b. All new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be designed and
constructed to accommodate co-location.
c. Penalties for not permitting co-location.
The policy of the community is for co-location. If a party who owns or otherwise controls
a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to alter a structure to accommodate
a proposed and otherwise feasible co-location such facility shall thereupon and thereafter
be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be altered, expanded or
extended in any respect. In addition, if a party refuses to allow co-location in accordance
with the intent of the article and, this action results in construction of a new tower, the
City may refuse to approve a new wireless communication support structure from the
party for a period of up to five (5) years. Such a party may seek and obtain a variance
from the Zoning Board of Appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates
entitlement to variance relief which, in this context, shall mean a demonstration that
enforcement of the five-year prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among
providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication services or that such
enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless
communication services.
d. The applicant must demonstrate to the Planning Commission that a feasible co-location
on an existing tower for the new wireless communication facility is not available for the
coverage and capacity.
e. Antennae which are attached to an existing tower are encouraged to minimize the adverse
visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers. Co-location of
antennas by more than one (1) carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over the
construction of new towers, provided such co-location is accomplished in a manner
consistent with the following:
1. A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the co-location of
an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower.
2. An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed
thirty (30) feet over the tower's existing height, to accommodate the co-location
of an additional antenna.
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 34
3. A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the co-location of an additional
antenna may be moved on-site when approved by the Planning Commission.
In addition to co-location on an existing transmission tower, an antenna may be
collocated on existing buildings, light poles, utility poles and water towers. Said
antenna(s) shall not exceed the building height allowed in the zone, or 18 feet above the
structure, whichever is less. Said antenna(s) shall project no more than two (2) feet
away from the existing structure, and the color of the antenna(s) shall blend in with the
existing structure and surroundings.
8. Application Requirements for Installation, Construction, or Increasing the Height of
Transmission Tower
In addition to standard building permit application material, an applicant seeking to construct,
install or increase the height of a transmission tower shall submit the following information.
a. A description of the proposed transmission tower location, design and height.
b. The capacity of the transmission tower in terms of the number and type of antennas it is
designed to accommodate.
c. Documentation from an engineer demonstrating compliance with non-ionizing
electromagnetic radiation (NIER) emissions standards as set forth by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
d. A signed agreement stating that the applicant will allow co-location with other users,
provided all safety, structural and technological requirements are met. This agreement
shall also state that any future owners or operators will allow co-location on the
transmission tower.
e. A landscape plan drawn to scale showing proposed and existing landscaping,
including type, spacing, size and irrigation methods.
f. Plans showing the connection to utilities, right-of-way required, ownership of utilities
and easements required.
g. Documents demonstrating that necessary easements have been obtained.
h. Plans showing how vehicle access will be provided.
i. Documents demonstrating that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has
reviewed and approved the proposal. Alternatively, when a special use permit process is
required, submit a statement documenting that notice of the proposal has been submitted
to the FAA. The special use permit process may proceed and approval may be granted
for the proposal as submitted, subject to FAA approval. If FAA approval requires any
changes involving increased height or additional lighting other than as initially approved,
then that initial special use permit approval shall be void. A new application will need to be
submitted, reviewed and approved through an additional special use permit process. No
building permit application shall be submitted without documents demonstrating FAA
review and approval.
j. The names, addresses and telephone numbers of all owners of other transmission
towers or usable antenna support structures within a one-half (1/2) mile radius of the
proposed new transmission tower site, including City-owned property.
k. An affidavit attesting to the fact that the applicant made diligent, but unsuccessful efforts
for permission to install or collocate the applicant's telecommunications facilities on Cityowned
facilities or usable antenna support structures located within a one-half (1/2) mile
radius of the proposed transmission tower site.
l. An affidavit attesting to the fact that the applicant made diligent, but unsuccessful efforts
to install or collocate the applicant's telecommunications facilities on transmission
towers or usable antenna support structures owned by other persons located within a
one-half (1/2) mile radius of the proposed transmission tower site.
m. Written, technical evidence from an engineer(s) that the proposed transmission tower
or telecommunications facilities cannot be installed or collocated on another
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 35
person's transmission tower or usable antenna support structure located within a onehalf
(1/2) mile radius of the proposed transmission tower site because of the coverage
requirements of the applicant's communications system.
n. Each application to allow construction of a transmission tower shall include a
written statement from an engineer(s) that the construction and placement of the
transmission tower will not interfere with public safety communications and the usual
and customary transmission or reception of radio, television, or other communications
service enjoyed by adjacent residential and non-residential properties.
o. A visual study containing, at a minimum, a graphic simulation showing the appearance of
the proposed transmission tower, antennas, and ancillary facilities from at least four (4)
points within a three (3) mile radius. Such points shall be chosen by the applicant with
review and approval by the City to ensure that various potential views are represented.
p. Documentation from an engineer that alternative sites within a radius of at least onehalf
(1/2) mile have been considered and have been determined to be technologically
unfeasible or unavailable.
q. A current overall system plan for the City, showing facilities presently constructed
or approved and future expansion plans.
r. A statement providing the reasons for the location, design and height of the proposed
transmission tower or antennas.
9. Waivers and Variances
a. Any waiver to the requirements of this Section shall be granted only pursuant to the
following provisions. The criteria for granting a waiver shall be limited to this sub-section,
and shall not include criteria beyond this sub-section. A waiver shall not be issued to
reduce the 300 foot setback from a residential use.
b. The Planning Commission may grant a waiver from the provisions of Subsection 3 -
Standards and Conditions providing the applicant demonstrates that:
1. It is technologically impossible to locate the proposed transmission tower on
available sites more than one-half (1/2) mile from a pre-existing transmission
tower and still provide the approximate coverage the transmission tower is
intended to provide;
2. The pre-existing transmission tower that is within one-half (1/2) miles of the
proposed transmission tower cannot be modified to accommodate another
provider; and
3. There are no available buildings, light or utility poles, or water towers on which
antennas may be located and still provide the approximate coverage the
transmission tower is intended to provide.
c. The Planning Commission may grant a waiver to the setback requirements of Subsection
3 - Standards and Conditions upon finding that stealth design, proposed landscaping,
configuration of the site, or the presence of mature trees obviates the need for
compliance.
d. The Planning Commission may not grant a waiver to the one hundred fifty (150) foot
height limitation. An applicant proposing a transmission tower taller than one hundred
fifty (150) feet must apply to the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) for a variance. In
addition to the variance criteria usually considered by the ZBA, the applicant must
demonstrate, through written documentation provided by an engineer, that the proposed
height is the minimum height needed to meet service needs AND to accommodate future colocations.
Article 3: General Provisions
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 3 - 36
10. Removal of Facilities
a. A condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility shall be adequate
provision for removal of all or part of the facility by users and owners upon the
occurrence of one or more of the following events:
i. When the facility has not been used for one hundred eighty (180) days or more.
For purposes of this section, the removal of antennas or other equipment from the
facility, or the cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of radio
signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse.
ii. Six (6) months after new technology is available at reasonable cost, as
determined by the City Council, which permits the operation of the
communication system without the requirement of the support structure.
b. Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal, the property owner
or persons who had used the facility shall immediately apply for any required demolition
or removal permits and immediately proceed with and complete the demolition, removal,
and site restoration.
c. If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has not been lawfully completed
within sixty (60) days of the applicable deadline, and after at least thirty (30) days written
notice, the City may remove or secure the removal of the facility or required portions
thereof, with its actual cost and reasonable administrative charge to be drawn or collected
and/or enforced from or under the security posted at the time application was made for
establishing the facility.
Section 3.17  PRIVATE ROADS
Any private road built in the City of Midland must comply with the following standards:
1. Sidewalks. Sidewalks are required on both sides of all private streets. The Planning
Commission may waive the sidewalk requirement along private streets if an alternate pedestrian
circulation system that provides access to all parts of a development is provided. The alternate
pedestrian circulation system may incorporate hard surfaced and non-hard surfaced paths,
provided that hard surfaced pathways provide access to all parts of a development.
2. Construction Standards. All private roads and appurtenances thereto shall be constructed in
accordance the specifications of the City of Midland or the appropriate road agency.
3. Minimum Right-of-way. The minimum right-of-way width of any private road shall be 40 feet.

ARTICLE 4.00
NONCONFORMITIES
Section 4.01 -- INTENT
Nonconformities are uses, structures, buildings, or lots which do not conform to one or more provisions
or requirements of this Ordinance or a subsequent amendment, but which were lawfully established prior
to the time of adoption of this Ordinance or amendment. Such nonconformities are not compatible with
the current or intended use of land in the district in which they are located. Therefore, it is the intent of
this Ordinance to permit such nonconformities to continue under certain conditions, but to foster the
elimination of nonconformities by discouraging their expansion, enlargement, or extension. Accordingly,
the purpose of this section is to establish regulations that govern the completion, restoration,
reconstruction, extension, and/or substitution of nonconformities, and to specify the circumstances and
conditions under which nonconformities shall be permitted to continue.

Article 4: Nonconformities
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 4 - 3
E. Purchase or Condemnation
In order to accomplish the elimination of nonconforming uses and structures which constitute a
nuisance or are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, the City of Midland, pursuant
to the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act 110 of 2006, as amended, may, but is not
required to, acquire by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, private property for the purpose of
removal of nonconforming uses.
F. Establishment of a Conforming Use or Structure
In the event that a nonconforming principal use or structure is superseded or replaced by a
conforming principal use or structure on a site, any structure or structure and land in combination
shall abide by the regulations of the district in which the structure is located and the nonconforming
use may not thereafter be resumed.
G. Change of Tenancy or Ownership

use or structure shall be allowed to continue provided there is no change in the nature or character
of such nonconformity.
H. Unlawful Nonconformity

was established. Unlawful land uses and structures include, but are not limited to, uses established
without proper zoning approval or a proper building permit.
I. Change of Location

No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel
other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the
Ordinance.

Notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance, a permitted use may be
erected on any single lawfully created lot of record in existence at the effective date of adoption or
amendment thereto. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area, and/or width and/or road frontage, provided that the lot can be developed in compliance
with other dimensional requirements (such as setback requirements) without any significant
adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health, safety, and welfare.
Article 4: Nonconformities
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 4 - 4
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed
by other provisions of this Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory building
may be erected on any single lot of record (see definition  Section 2.02) at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance. This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to
meet the requirements for area and width, or both, generally applicable in the district, provided that
yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall
conform to the regulation for the district in which the lot is located.
Section 4.05 -- MODIFICATION TO NONCONFORMING
USES OR STRUCTURES
Except as permitted in this Section, no nonconforming use or structure shall be enlarged, extended, or
structurally altered, nor shall any nonconformity be changed to a different nonconformity which increases
the intensity of use or nonconformity. Examples of enlargements or increases in intensity include, but are
not limited to, the further encroachment of a structure into a required side yard, the addition of sales area
to a nonconforming retail use and the start of a nonconforming use which has greater noise, traffic, and/or
nuisance impacts than an existing nonconforming use.
A. Applicability
The following regulations shall apply to any nonconforming use or structure, including:
1. Nonconforming use of buildings designed for a conforming use.
2. Nonconforming use of buildings specifically designed for the type of use which occupies them
but not suitable for a conforming use.
3. Buildings designed and used for a conforming use but not in conformance with area and bulk,
parking, loading, or landscaping requirements.
4. Nonconforming structures, such as fences. Signs are an exception to this regulation. See
Section 8.03.
5. Nonconforming uses without structures.
6. Nonconforming driveways.
B. Enlargement, Extension, or Alteration
1. Increase in Nonconformity Prohibited
Except as specifically provided in this section, no person may engage in any activity that
causes an increase in the extent of any nonconformity. For example, physical alteration of
structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results
in:
a. An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use, or
b. Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions, such as setback
requirements, height limitations, density requirements, or other requirements in the
district in which the property is located, unless a variance is granted by the Zoning
Board of Appeals.
Article 4: Nonconformities
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 4 - 5
2. Permitted Extension
Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a building, which was
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this
Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. No
nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area
of land, nor shall any such use be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or
parcel than was occupied on the effective date of this Ordinance or amendment thereto,
except as follows:
a. Any nonconforming place of worship, on the effective date of this Ordinance,
nonconforming due to a lack of lot area or yard requirements, may be increased in
building area provided said expansion conforms to all requirements in this Ordinance.
b. A dwelling nonconforming due to its location in a non-permitted district may be
expanded or enlarged for residential purposes up to fifty percent (50%) of the existing
ground floor area. Accessory buildings may be constructed or expanded upon the same
lot.
3. Alterations that Decrease Nonconformity
Any nonconforming structure or any structure or portion thereof containing a nonconforming
use, may be altered if such alteration serves to decrease the nonconforming nature of the
structure or use. Signs are an exception to this regulation. See Section 8.03.
4. Variance to Area and Bulk Requirements
If a proposed alteration is deemed reasonable by the Zoning Board of Appeals by virtue of
the fact that it would decrease the nonconforming nature of a structure or use, but such
alteration requires a variance from the area or bulk requirements, then such alteration shall
be permitted only if a variance is granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
C. Repairs, Improvements, and Modernization
1. Permitted Improvements
Ordinary building repairs, repair or replacement of fixtures, wiring or plumbing in a
nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use shall be
permitted provided such repairs or improvements do not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
assessed value of the structure during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months. Any
such repairs, improvements, and modernization shall not result in enlargement of the cubic
content of the nonconforming structure. The provisions in this paragraph shall apply to all
structures except as otherwise provided in this Article for reconstruction of structures
damaged by fire or other catastrophe.
2. Required Repairs
Repairs or maintenance deemed necessary by the Building Official to keep a nonconforming
building structurally safe and sound are permitted. However, if a non-conforming structure
or a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe and/or unlawful
due to lack of maintenance and repairs and is declared as such by the Building Official, it
shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in full conformity with the
regulations in the district in which it is located.
D. Damage by Fire or Other Catastrophe
Any nonconforming structure or structure housing a nonconforming use that is damaged by fire,
collapse, explosion, acts of God or acts of public enemy may be reconstructed, repaired or restored
provided the following:
Article 4: Nonconformities
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 4 - 6
1. Reconstruction Expense
The following nonconforming uses or structures may be repaired or restored provided that
the expense of such reconstruction is not in excess of fifty percent (50%) structures precatastrophe
fair market value as determined by the City Assessor:
a. Residential Use in Residential Districts
b. Non-Residential Use in Residential Districts
c. Uses in Non-Residential Districts
d. Structure in any District
Persons aggrieved by a determination of the pre-catastrophe fair market value by the City
Assessor may appeal such determination to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
2. Timing
The restoration of the structure and the resumption of use shall commence within six (6)
months of the time of when the damage occurred. Where pending insurance claims require
an extension of time, the Building Official may grant a time extension provided that the
property owner submits a certification from the insurance company attesting to the delay.

LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING
Section 6.01 -- INTENT AND SCOPE OF REQUIREMENTS
A. Intent
Except where specifically noted, the provisions in this Article do not apply to single family and
two-family residential uses. Landscaping enhances the visual image of the City, preserves natural
features, improves property values, and alleviates the impact of noise, traffic, and visual distraction
associated with certain uses. Screening is important to protect less intensive uses from the noise,
light, traffic, litter and other impacts of more intensive, nonresidential uses. The provisions in this
article are intended to set minimum standards for the design and use of landscaping, greenbelts, and
screening, and for the protection and enhancement of the City's environment. More specifically,
the intent of these provisions is to:
1. Improve the appearance of off-street parking areas, vehicular use areas, and property abutting
public rights-of-way,
2. Protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of the residential uses that abut
non-residential areas, parking areas, and other intensive use areas, thereby protecting the
public health, safety and welfare,
3. Reduce soil erosion and depletion, and
4. Increase storm water retention, thereby helping to prevent flooding.
B. Scope of Application
No site plan shall be approved unless it shows landscaping consistent with the requirements of this
Article. A Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued unless provisions set forth in this Article
have been met or a performance guarantee has been posted in accordance with the provisions set
forth in Section 3.14. The requirements in this Article shall not apply to single family and twofamily
detached homes, unless otherwise specifically noted.
C. Minimum Requirements
The requirements in this Article are minimum requirements, and under no circumstances shall they
preclude the developer and the City from agreeing to more extensive landscaping.
D. Summary of Regulations

walls, edging, and so forth, shall be maintained in good condition and neat appearance. Rotted,
deteriorated, or damaged landscape elements shall be repaired, replaced, or removed.
Section 6.06 -- TREATMENT OF EXISTING PLANT MATERIAL
The following regulations shall apply to existing plant material:
A. Consideration of Existing Elements in the Landscape Design
In instances where healthy plant material exists on a site prior to its development, substitution of
such plant material in place of the requirements set forth previously in this Article, provided such
substitution is in keeping with the spirit and intent of this Article and the Ordinance in general, is
permitted.
Existing hedges, berms, walls, or other landscape elements may be used to satisfy the requirements
set forth previously, provided that such landscaping is in conformance with the requirements of this
section.
B. Preservation of Existing Plant Material
When tree preservation credits are deserved, site plans shall show all existing trees which are
located in the portions of the site that will be built upon or otherwise altered, and are five (5) inches
or greater in caliper, measured twelve (12) inches above grade. A single tree credit, if deserved,
shall equal one (1) of the trees required by the provisions of this Article.
Trees shall be labeled "To Be Removed" or "To Be Saved" on the site plan. If existing plant
material is labeled "To Be Saved" on the site plan, protective measures shall be implemented, such
as the placement of fencing or stakes at the drip line around each tree. No vehicle or other
construction equipment or supplies shall be parked or stored within the drip line of any tree to be
saved.
Article 6: Landscaping and Screening
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 6 - 14
Trees to be preserved may provide credits toward the required trees for greenbelts, buffers, and
parking lot landscaping. To obtain credit, the preserved trees shall be of a high quality and at least
five (5) inches in caliper measured 12 inches above grade. Trees to be preserved shall be counted
for credit only if they are located on the developed portion of the site.
The credit for preserved trees shall be as follows:
Table 6.7: PRESERVED TREE CREDITS
Caliper of Preserved Tree Measured
12 Inches Above Grade
Tree Landscaping Credits
1 credit = 1 required tree
Over 12 inches 3 credits
8 inches  12 inches 2 credits

In the event that healthy trees which are intended to meet the requirements of the Ordinance are cut
down, damaged or destroyed during construction, the removed trees shall be replaced with the
same species as the damaged or removed tree, in accordance with the schedule in Table 6.8, unless
otherwise approved by the Director of Planning and Community Development based on
consideration of the site and building configuration, available planting space, and similar
considerations:

Less than 6 inches 2 ½ to 3 inches 1 for 1
More than 6 inches 2 ½ to 3 inches 1 replacement tree for each 6 inches in
caliper or fraction thereof of damaged tree
Section 6.07 -- MODIFICATIONS TO LANDSCAPE
REQUIREMENTS
In consideration of the overall design and impact of a specific landscape plan, and in consideration of the
amount of existing plant material to be retained on the site, the specific requirements outlined herein may
be modified, provided that any such adjustment is in keeping with the intent of this Article and Ordinance
in general. In determining whether a modification is appropriate, the approval authority shall consider
whether the following conditions exist:
1. Topographic features or other unique features of the site create conditions such that strict
application of the landscape regulations would result in a less effective screen than an
alternative landscape design.
2. Parking, vehicular circulation, or land use are such that required landscaping would not
enhance the site or result in the desired screening effect.
3. The public benefit intended by the landscape regulations could be better-achieved with a plan
that varies from the strict requirements of the Ordinance.
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 6 - 1
ARTICLE 6.00
LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING
Section 6.01 -- INTENT AND SCOPE OF REQUIREMENTS
A. Intent
Except where specifically noted, the provisions in this Article do not apply to single family and
two-family residential uses. Landscaping enhances the visual image of the City, preserves natural
features, improves property values, and alleviates the impact of noise, traffic, and visual distraction
associated with certain uses. Screening is important to protect less intensive uses from the noise,
light, traffic, litter and other impacts of more intensive, nonresidential uses. The provisions in this
article are intended to set minimum standards for the design and use of landscaping, greenbelts, and
screening, and for the protection and enhancement of the City's environment. More specifically,
the intent of these provisions is to:
1. Improve the appearance of off-street parking areas, vehicular use areas, and property abutting
public rights-of-way,
2. Protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of the residential uses that abut
non-residential areas, parking areas, and other intensive use areas, thereby protecting the
public health, safety and welfare,
3. Reduce soil erosion and depletion, and
4. Increase storm water retention, thereby helping to prevent flooding.
B. Scope of Application
No site plan shall be approved unless it shows landscaping consistent with the requirements of this
Article. A Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued unless provisions set forth in this Article
have been met or a performance guarantee has been posted in accordance with the provisions set
forth in Section 3.14. The requirements in this Article shall not apply to single family and twofamily
detached homes, unless otherwise specifically noted.
C. Minimum Requirements
The requirements in this Article are minimum requirements, and under no circumstances shall they
preclude the developer and the City from agreeing to more extensive landscaping.
D. Summary of Regulations

parking lot landscaping shall be designed to improve the safety of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic, guide traffic movement, and improve the appearance of the parking area.
2. Minimum Area
Landscaped areas in parking lots shall be no less than five (5) feet in any single dimension and
no less than one hundred fifty (150) square feet in area. Landscaped areas in or adjacent to
parking lots shall be protected with curbing or other means to prevent encroachment of
vehicles. Curb cuts which permit drainage of landscaped areas may be designed as part of
required curbing.
3. Other Landscaping
Required landscaping elsewhere on the parcel shall not be counted in meeting the parking lot
landscaping requirements.
4. Required Plantings
Requirements for plant material shall be based on the location, size, and shape of the parking
lot landscaped area. A minimum of one (1) shrub shall be planted per seventy-five (75) square
feet or fraction thereof of interior parking lot landscaping, and one (1) tree shall be planted per
three hundred (300) square feet or fraction thereof of interior landscaped area. At least fifty
percent (50%) of each interior landscaped area shall be covered by living plant material, such
as sod, shrubs, ground cover, or trees. Plantings within parking lots shall comply with the
requirements for unobstructed sight distance set forth in Section 3.09.A(5). The landscape

In instances where healthy plant material exists on a site prior to its development, substitution of
such plant material in place of the requirements set forth previously in this Article, provided such
substitution is in keeping with the spirit and intent of this Article and the Ordinance in general, is
permitted.
Existing hedges, berms, walls, or other landscape elements may be used to satisfy the requirements
set forth previously, provided that such landscaping is in conformance with the requirements of this
section.
B. Preservation of Existing Plant Material
When tree preservation credits are deserved, site plans shall show all existing trees which are
located in the portions of the site that will be built upon or otherwise altered, and are five (5) inches
or greater in caliper, measured twelve (12) inches above grade. A single tree credit, if deserved,
shall equal one (1) of the trees required by the provisions of this Article.
Trees shall be labeled "To Be Removed" or "To Be Saved" on the site plan. If existing plant
material is labeled "To Be Saved" on the site plan, protective measures shall be implemented, such
as the placement of fencing or stakes at the drip line around each tree. No vehicle or other
construction equipment or supplies shall be parked or stored within the drip line of any tree to be
saved.
Article 6: Landscaping and Screening
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 6 - 14
Trees to be preserved may provide credits toward the required trees for greenbelts, buffers, and
parking lot landscaping. To obtain credit, the preserved trees shall be of a high quality and at least
five (5) inches in caliper measured 12 inches above grade. Trees to be preserved shall be counted
for credit only if they are located on the developed portion of the site.
The credit for preserved trees shall be as follows:
Table 6.7: PRESERVED TREE CREDITS
Caliper of Preserved Tree Measured
12 Inches Above Grade
Tree Landscaping Credits
1 credit = 1 required tree
Over 12 inches 3 credits
8 inches  12 inches 2 credits
5 inches  7.9 inches 1 credit
In the event that healthy trees which are intended to meet the requirements of the Ordinance are cut
down, damaged or destroyed during construction, the removed trees shall be replaced with the
same species as the damaged or removed tree, in accordance with the schedule in Table 6.8, unless
otherwise approved by the Director of Planning and Community Development based on
consideration of the site and building configuration, available planting space, and similar
considerations:
Table 6.8: DAMAGED OR REMOVED TREE REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE
Caliper Measured 12 Inches Above Grade
Replacement Ratio

Less than 6 inches 2 ½ to 3 inches 1 for 1
More than 6 inches 2 ½ to 3 inches 1 replacement tree for each 6 inches in
caliper or fraction thereof of damaged tree
Section 6.07 -- MODIFICATIONS TO LANDSCAPE
REQUIREMENTS
In consideration of the overall design and impact of a specific landscape plan, and in consideration of the
amount of existing plant material to be retained on the site, the specific requirements outlined herein may
be modified, provided that any such adjustment is in keeping with the intent of this Article and Ordinance
in general. In determining whether a modification is appropriate, the approval authority shall consider
whether the following conditions exist:
1. Topographic features or other unique features of the site create conditions such that strict
application of the landscape regulations would result in a less effective screen than an
alternative landscape design.
2. Parking, vehicular circulation, or land use are such that required landscaping would not
enhance the site or result in the desired screening effect.
3. The public benefit intended by the landscape regulations could be better-achieved with a plan
that varies from the strict requirements of the Ordinance.

approved plans and applicable Zoning Ordinance and Building Code standards.
All signs requiring permits under this Ordinance shall have affixed to them an identification
tag as provided by the sign contractor. Said identification tag will be affixed by the City to
indicate compliance with the provisions of this Article. It shall be the responsibility of the
Article 8: Signs
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 8-3
owner of a sign to see that said identification tag is replaced, should it be removed for any
reason.
In cases where fastenings or anchorages are to be eventually bricked in or otherwise enclosed,
the sign erector shall advise the Building Official when such fastenings are to be installed so
that inspection may be completed before enclosure.
2. Inspection of Existing Signs
The Building Official shall have the authority to routinely enter onto property to inspect
existing signs.
3. Maintenance
All signs shall be maintained at all times in a safe and secure manner. Exposed surfaces shall
be cleaned and painted as necessary. Broken and defective parts shall be repaired or replaced.
4. Correction of Violations
a. If the Building Official finds that any sign is in violation of this ordinance, the official
shall notify one or more of the responsible persons to correct the violations by repair,
removal or other action, within a timetable established by the official.
b. The notice provided in Subsection (a) may be accompanied or followed by a written order,
sent to the responsible persons, requiring correction of violations by repair, removal or
other action within thirty (30) days. Where there is imminent danger to public safety,
immediate removal or action may be required.
c. For purposes of this Section, responsible persons include the owner(s) of the building,
structure or premises upon which the sign is located.
C. Removal of Obsolete Signs
Any sign that identifies a business that is no longer in operation, or that identifies an activity or
event that has already occurred, or a product that is no longer made, shall be considered
abandoned and shall be removed by the owner, agent, or person having use of the building or
structure. Upon vacating a commercial or industrial establishment, the proprietor shall be
responsible for removal of all signs used in conjunction with the business.
However, where a conforming sign structure and frame are typically reused by a current occupant
in a leased or rented building, the building owner shall not be required to remove the sign
structure and frame in the interim periods when the building is not occupied, provided that the
sign structure and frame are maintained in good condition.
D. Nonconforming Signs
No nonconforming sign shall be altered, enlarged or reconstructed, unless the alteration or
reconstruction is in compliance with Article 4.00 of the Zoning Ordinance, and the following
regulations:
1. Repairs and Maintenance
Normal maintenance shall be permitted, provided that any nonconforming sign that is
destroyed by any means to an extent greater than fifty percent (50%) of the sign's precatastrophe
fair market value, exclusive of the foundation, shall not be reconstructed. Normal
maintenance shall include painting of chipped or faded signs; replacement of faded or
damaged surface panels; or, repair or replacement of electrical wiring or electrical devices.
2. Nonconforming Changeable Copy Signs
Article 8: Signs
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 8-4
The sign face or message on a nonconforming changeable copy sign or nonconforming
bulletin board sign may be changed provided that the change does not create any greater
nonconformity.
3. Substitution
No nonconforming sign shall be replaced with another nonconforming sign. However, the
panel containing the message may be replaced with a different message without affecting the
legal nonconforming status of a sign, provided that the sign structure or frame is not altered.
E. Appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals
Any party who has been refused a sign permit for a proposed sign or received a correction or
removal order for an existing sign may file an appeal with the Zoning Board of Appeals, in
accordance with Article 29.00 of the Zoning Ordinance.
F. Enforcement

Each use listed in this Article, whether permitted by right or subject to approval as a conditional land use,
shall be subject to the site development standards specified, in addition to applicable standards and
requirements for the district in which the use is located. These standards are intended to mitigate the
impact from a use which is of a size or type, or which possesses characteristics which are unique or
atypical in the district in which the use is located. These standards are further intended to assure that such
uses will be compatible with surrounding uses and the orderly development of the district.
Unless otherwise specified, each use listed in this Article shall be subject to all applicable yard, bulk and
other standards for the district in which the use is located. Compliance with the standards in this Article

establishment of such use will constitute the second such use within a one thousand (1,000)

DISTRICT
Section 21.01 -- STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
The intent of the Commercial Districts is to provide for a variety of commercial uses, including retail,
office, restaurant, and service uses, to serve the needs of residents of the City and surrounding
communities. The Zoning Ordinance provides for five Commercial Districts and two Overlay Districts,
which vary based on the intended target market, the permitted intensity of use, and the range of products
and services offered by permitted uses. It is intended that uses in the Commercial Districts exhibit high
standards of site planning and landscape design so as to achieve compatibility with surrounding uses.
The purposes of the individual Commercial Districts are as follows:
NC - Neighborhood Commercial District
The purpose of the Neighborhood Commercial District is intended to provide locations for businesses that
meet the day-to-day shopping and service needs of residents in surrounding neighborhoods. Wherever
possible, Neighborhood Commercial uses should be designed to fit into the fabric of the surrounding
neighborhood, by giving special consideration to site layout, building design, pedestrian orientation,
traffic patterns, exterior lighting, and similar site and building characteristics. Intensive commercial uses
that generate large volumes of traffic or that have other characteristics that would adversely affect the
quality of surrounding residential areas are not appropriate in the Neighborhood Commercial District.
CC - Community Commercial District
The purpose of the Community Commercial District is to provide for commercial development that offers
a broad range of goods and services to meet the convenience and comparison shopping needs of residents.
Because of the variety of business types permitted in the CC District, special attention shall be focused on
site layout, building design, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and coordination of site features
between adjoining uses. An effort should be made to achieve design compatibility between adjoining
commercial uses.
Article 21  Business Districts
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 21 - 2
RC  Regional Commercial District
The purpose of the Regional Commercial District is to provide for commercial development that offers a
diversity of retail, service, entertainment, office, finance, and related business uses to serve the needs of
residents of the City and region. The Regional Commercial District is intended to be the Citys most
intensive, vehicle-oriented commercial district. Consequently, Regional Commercial uses should be
served by or have access to major or minor thoroughfares and the uses should be buffered from or located
away from residential uses. Because of the prominence of Regional Commercial uses, high standards of
site planning and landscape design are desired.
D  Downtown District & D-O  Downtown Overlay
The Downtown District is intended to be a compact, lively, pedestrian-oriented District that offers a wide
diversity of commercial, office, civic, cultural, entertainment, recreation, residential, and tourism uses.
Building design and layout should be based on traditional design principles, with architectural features
that create visual interest. Primary building entrances should be physically and visually oriented toward
streets. The D-O, Downtown Overlay, is intended to promote a vibrant traditional downtown
environment, along Main Street between Jerome and George Streets. Residential development,
particularly on the upper floors of retail and office buildings, is encouraged in the Downtown Overlay
District. The D classification applies to more outlying areas in the Downtown where vehicle oriented uses
exist in a less compact urban setting.
C  Circle District
The Circle District is intended to provide for the continued use, enhancement, and new development of
retail, personal service, and related commercial uses in the Ashman Circle business district. Residential
use is encouraged on the upper floors of retail and office buildings and in townhouses. Businesses in the
Circle District are intended primarily to meet the day-to-day shopping and service needs of residents in
surrounding neighborhoods and the broader community. Intensive commercial uses that would adversely
affect the quality of surrounding residential areas are not appropriate in the Circle District.
DNO  Downtown Northside Overlay District
The purpose of the Midland Downtown Northside Overlay District is to provide specific regulations to
achieve the following:
1. Facilitate redevelopment of the district as a fully integrated, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented
environment with mixed-use buildings that contain commercial, residential and office uses.
2. Provide for a variety of housing types that include a more-urban alternative to single family detached,
including townhouses, apartments above commercial uses and live-work units.
3. Calm traffic traveling through the City to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment and improve
pedestrian linkages to the Downtown.
4. Regulate building height and placement to achieve appropriate scale along streetscapes and ensure
proper transition between the downtown and surrounding neighborhoods.
5. Establish clear controls on building form and placement to frame a well-defined public realm
comprised of human-scale streets, neighborhoods and public spaces, all of which contribute to
creating a safe, comfortable and livable environment.
6. Create a more pedestrian-oriented development pattern by placing storefronts near the sidewalk,
locating parking in the side, or rear yard and limiting auto-oriented uses such as drive-throughs.
The Downtown Northside Overlay District is an overlay district that applies over the existing underlying
zoning. The existing underlying zoning of a property is not changed nor is any legal use at the time of
adoption of the overlay district made illegal or nonconforming. Not until such time as the property
changes use or is redeveloped do the provisions of the overlay district become required.

City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 24 - 1
ARTICLE 24.00
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
Section 24.01 -- INTENT
The intent of the Planned Unit Development regulations is to provide a zoning regulatory process that
encourages planning and design, resulting in plans for particular sites that fulfill the goals and objectives
of the Master Plan while achieving development that could not be achieved under other types of zoning
regulations. It is the further intent of these regulations to permit development in accordance with such
plans for particular sites, provided that the plans are prepared and adopted in accordance with the
regulations in this Article.
A. Regulatory Flexibility
These Planned Unit Development regulations are further intended to permit regulatory flexibility
to achieve development that is in accord with the Citys Master Plan; to achieve economy and
efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy, and in the provision of public services and
utilities; to protect and preserve natural resources and natural features; to encourage the creation
of useful open space particularly suited to the proposed development and the parcel on which it is
located; and to provide appropriate development to satisfy the needs of residents of the City of
Midland.
B. Land Use Compatibility
It is further intended that development permitted pursuant to this Article be laid out so that
proposed uses, buildings, and site improvements relate to each other and to adjoining existing
uses in such a way that they will be compatible, with no material adverse impact of one use on
another.
C. Redevelopment
It is further intended that these regulations bring about re-use and/or redevelopment of sites where
an orderly change of use is determined to be desirable, especially where re-use is restricted
because of existing nonconformities, physical development, or the constraints of conventional
zoning standards.
Section 24.02 -- DEFINITIONS
A. Planned Unit Development (PUD Development)
The term PUD Development means a specific parcel of land or several contiguous parcels of
land, which is/are proposed to be developed in accordance with a Concept Plan approved by the
City Council (after receiving a recommendation from the Planning Commission), where the plans
meet the requirements of this Article, addresses needs in the City that could not otherwise be
addressed in other conventional zoning districts, and achieves compatibility with surrounding
uses.
Article 24  Planned Unit Development
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 24 - 2
B. Concept Plan
A Concept Plan, for the purposes of this Article, consists of the following:
1. Drawings and documentation illustrating and describing existing conditions, zoning, and
development constraints;
2. Drawings and documentation illustrating the general layout of proposed uses, describing
the general development plan, and identifying mandatory development conditions; and,
3. Documentation of impacts the proposed development will have on public facilities and
services and ways in which these impacts will be mitigated in conjunction with the
proposed development. Examples of impacts include, but are not limited to: level of
service of street intersections, residential equivalency units for sewer service, water
capacity and school district enrollment.
C. Detail Plan
A Detail Plan, for the purposes of this Article, consists of the following:
1. Scale drawings showing accurately and with complete dimensioning, the boundaries of a
development site and the locations of all buildings, structures, and principal site
development features proposed for a PUD Development; and
2. Plans and information regarding roads, utilities, sidewalks, and other infrastructure, parks
and open spaces, enhancements to public services, and other features of the proposed
PUD Development.
D. Underlying Zoning
The term Underlying Zoning means the zoning classification currently applicable to a parcel of
land that is proposed to be developed in accordance with the PUD regulations.
Section 24.03 -- QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
A. Mandatory Requirements
Consideration of a proposed development, pursuant to the Planned Unit Development regulations
in this Article, may occur only on sites where the following conditions are met:
1. The proposed development site shall be at least three (3) acres in area. However, in the
interest of making use of the Planned Unit Development as a tool to implement the
Master Plan, the City Council, upon recommendation from the Planning Commission,
may permit a PUD project on a site as small as one (1) acre in size if: (a) the project has
unique characteristics and benefits, and/or (b) the parcel in question has unique
characteristics that significantly impact development, such as, for example, unusual shape
or proportions, unusual topography, or potentially incompatible land uses on surrounding
property.
2. The proposed development shall either:
a. Be under single ownership or control such that there is a single person or entity
having responsibility for assuring completion of the project in conformity with this
Ordinance, or
Article 24  Planned Unit Development
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 24 - 3
b. If there is more than one owner or entity with an interest in the project, then there
shall be a commitment in writing by all owners and/or entities to work in unison
toward completion of the project in conformity with this Ordinance.
The applicant(s) shall provide legal documentation of single ownership, single control, or
joint unified control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and deed restrictions
which indicate that the development can be completed as shown on the plans, and further,
that all portions of the development that are not to be maintained or operated at public
expense will continue to be operated and maintained by the developers or their
successors. These legal documents shall bind all development successors in title to any
commitments made as a part of the documents. This provision shall not prohibit a
transfer of ownership or control, provided notice of such transfer is given to the Planning
and Community Development Director.
B. Concept Plan
The City Council shall have the authority to approve a Concept Plan for a PUD development
proposal, following a recommendation by the Planning Commission, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 24.06, and the Concept Plan Eligibility Criteria that follow in this
Section 24.03. Preparation of a Concept Plan for a development site may be initiated by the City
Council, Planning Commission, Downtown Development Authority, or Brownfield Authority, or
by the property owner or other person(s) or entity that has a legal interest in the site.
C. Concept Plan Eligibility Criteria
In order to be eligible for PUD approval, it shall be demonstrated with the Concept Plan that all
of the following criteria will be met:
1. The use of PUD regulations shall not be used for the sole purpose of avoiding the
requirements for dimensional variances involving uses that would already be permitted in
the underlying zoning district.
2. PUD approval shall be granted only when the proposed land use will not materially add
public service or facility loads beyond those contemplated in the Master Plan or other
adopted policies or plans of the City, unless the applicant can demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the City Council that such added loads will be accommodated or mitigated
upon implementation of the PUD plan.
3. A proposed PUD development shall be consistent with the goals and objectives and shall
not have an adverse impact upon the Master Plan for the City. Notwithstanding this
requirement, the City Council may approve a PUD proposal that includes uses which are
not called for on the Master Plan, provided that the City Council determines that such a
use deviation from the Master Plan is justified based on a demonstrated need and the
current planning and development objectives of the City. In making such a
determination, the City Council shall seek the advice of the Planning Commission.
4. Land use patterns established by the PUD development shall be compatible with existing
and planned uses on and adjacent to the site.
5. The PUD development shall improve the appearance of the City through quality building
design and site development; the provision of trees and landscaping consistent with or
beyond minimum requirements; the preservation of unique and/or historic sites or
structures; and/or the provision of open space or other desirable features of a site beyond
minimum requirements.
Article 24  Planned Unit Development
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 24 - 4
6. The PUD development shall not be allowed solely as a means of increasing the density or
intensity of development. The PUD development shall result in a development that could
not be achieved under conventional zoning.
Section 24.04 -- PERMITTED USES
A PUD development may contain any uses or combination of uses that are listed as Principal Permitted
Uses or Uses Permitted Subject to Site Development Standards in compatible zoning districts in the City
provided that the proposed uses are shown on the approved Concept Plan, and provided further that the
proposed uses satisfy the following criteria:
A. Compatibility of Uses
1. Uses permitted in PUDs in RA-1, RA-2, RA-3, and RA-4 Districts. Uses permitted in
Sections 20.02.A, 20.02.B, 20.02.C, and principal permitted uses and uses permitted with site
development standards in the NC district as found in Table 21.1 are permitted in addition to
all uses permitted by Section 14.02.
2. Uses permitted in PUDs in the RB District. Uses permitted in Sections 14.02.A, 14.02.B,
14.02.C, 20.02.A, 20.02.B, 20.02.C, and principal permitted uses and uses permitted with site
development standards in the NC district as found in Table 21.1 are permitted in addition to
all uses permitted by Section 15.02.
B. Harmonious Relationship
There shall be a reasonably harmonious relationship between the location of buildings and uses
on the site relative to buildings and uses on lands in the surrounding area.
C. Combination of Residential and Non-Residential Uses
Residential and non-residential uses may be permitted together on the same site in a PUD
development, provided that the residential and non-residential uses are carefully integrated in a
manner that is consistent with good site design and planning principles so as to create a high
quality living environment.
Section 24.05 -- DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The design standards in this Section shall be used as a guide for design of PUD developments. However,
modifications to these standards may be approved by the City Council in conjunction with approval of the
Concept Plan, upon receiving an advisory recommendation from the Planning Commission, upon making
the determination that other standards would be more appropriate because of the particular design and
orientation of buildings and uses, and provided that any such modified standards shall be consistent with
the intent of the PUD stated in Section 24.01. Design and zoning standards modifications approved in
conjunction with the approval of a PUD Concept Plan shall not require approval of the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
A. Purpose
The purpose of this section is to ensure that the physical and operational characteristics of
proposed buildings and uses are compatible when considered in the context of the surrounding
area.
B. Setbacks
PUD developments shall comply with the following minimum setback requirements, which shall
be determined by the same method as determination of setbacks in other zoning districts, unless
otherwise indicated:
Article 24  Planned Unit Development
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 24 - 5
Table 24.1: PUD MINIMUM SETBACKS
Location Minimum Setback
Along perimeter, adjacent to public road 30 ft. a
Along perimeter, but not adjacent to a road 20 ft.
Along an internal road or driveway b
Parking lot setback from adjacent public road 20 ft.
Setback between buildings within a PUD b
a. A smaller setback with a build-to line may be approved upon review of the Concept Plan in
the interest of establishing a consistent relationship of the buildings to the street and sidewalk,
so as to form a visually continuous pedestrian-oriented street front.
b. Minimum setbacks within the development shall be based on good planning and design
principles, taking into account the degree of compatibility between adjoining uses,
compatibility between uses and roads and drives, sensitivity to the characteristics of the site,
the need for free access for emergency vehicles, the need for adequate amounts of light and
air between buildings, and the need for proper amounts of open space.
C. Maximum Height
Buildings and structures taller than permitted by the underlying zoning proposed on the Concept
Plan that are taller than the maximum height allowed in the underlying zoning district may be
approved, upon making the following determinations:
1. Light and Shadow. Buildings or structures greater than forty (40) feet in height shall be
designed so as to not have an unreasonable adverse impact on adjacent property as a
result of the shadows that are cast or glare created from reflected or artificial light.
2. Privacy. Buildings or structures greater than forty (40) feet in height shall be designed to
avoid infringing on the privacy of adjacent public and private property, particularly
adjacent residential areas.
3. Scale of Development. Buildings or structures greater than forty (40) feet in height shall
be compatible with the scale of the neighborhood or area in which they are situated in
terms of relative height, height to mass, and building or structure scale to human scale.
D. Parking and Loading
Parking and loading facilities in PUD developments shall comply with the standards in Article
5.00. However, the minimum number of parking spaces required may be modified, based on
evidence that other standards would be more reasonable because of the level of current or future
employment, the level of current or future customer traffic, shared parking by uses that have peak
parking demands that do not overlap, and other considerations. A decision to reduce the number
of parking spaces shall be based on technical information provided by a qualified planning,
parking or traffic consultant, that verifies that the reduction will not impair the functioning of the
developments served, or have an adverse impact on traffic flow on or adjacent to the
development.
In conjunction with a decision to reduce the number of required parking spaces, the City Council
may require the execution, by the developer, of an Agreement, that commits the developer to the
provision of additional parking spaces, up to the minimum required by Section 5.01, subsection
C, if and when such are determined to be necessary by the City within a specified period of time.
This Agreement may be part of the PUD agreement, as provided for under Section 24.06.B(3).
Article 24  Planned Unit Development
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 24 - 6
E. Landscaping
A complete landscaping plan which satisfies the requirements in Article 6.00 shall be required as
part of the Detail Plan submittal.
F. Open Space in PUD Developments with Residential Component
PUD developments containing a residential component shall provide usable open space that is
accessible to all residents of the development. Such open usable space shall not consist of
required yard areas or storm water retention or detention ponds (except as identified below) and
shall be identified on the Concept and Detail Plans. The amount, location, shape, and other
characteristics of open space within a development shall be based on good planning and design
principles, taking into account the following considerations:
1. The types and arrangement of uses on the site;
2. The proposed uses of the open space and types of improvements proposed within the
open space;
3. The extent to which the leisure and recreation needs of all segments of the population
residing in the development would be accommodated; and
4. The manner in which the open space is integrated into the overall design of the
development.
5. Up to 50% of the surface area of stormwater management ponds may qualify as open
space if the following conditions are met:
a. All stormwater management ponds shall be integrated into the overall
development and shall serve as a visual and physical amenity to the site. A
visual and physical amenity is easily accessible to pedestrians and/or nonmotorized
vehicles and is visually attractive.
b. All stormwater management ponds shall have a minimum permanent water depth
of 4 feet and a maximum permanent water depth of 9 feet.
c. The maximum slope of stormwater management ponds in a Planned Unit
Development shall be 1:6.
d. Fences around stormwater management ponds are not permitted.
e. All stormwater management ponds shall have a natural appearance, and shall be
round, oval, or kidney in shape with irregular edges.
f. Recreation facilities such as walking paths shall be provided near and/or around
stormwater management ponds to allow users of the site to use and enjoy the
ponds as an amenity.
G. Circulation System
The vehicular and pedestrian circulation system within each development shall safely and
conveniently accommodate the movement of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians throughout the
proposed development and to and from surrounding areas.
Article 24  Planned Unit Development
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 24 - 7
H. Additional Considerations
1. Stormwater Detention or Retention
Stormwater detention or retention shall be provided in underground pipes or in open
unfenced detention or retention basins, where feasible. These basins shall be
incorporated into the landscaping or open space plan for the site. Best management
practices in stormwater management are encouraged such as use of natural habitat to
filter stormwater (bio-swales, rain gardens and phytoremediation), design to decrease the
amount of impervious surfaces (permeable paving, green roofs, and curbless parking
areas and roads), and dissemination of stormwater in a natural manner (level spreaders
and multiple, connected ponds).
2. Other Considerations
In their review of a proposed PUD development, the Planning Commission and City
Council may review other considerations that are found to be relevant to a particular
project, including, but not necessarily limited to: road capacity; capacity and design of
utility systems; achievement of an integrated development with respect to signage,
lighting, landscaping, and building materials; and, extent to which noise reduction and
visual screening are used, particularly in cases where non-residential uses adjoin
residential uses. When reviewing any such additional considerations, the Planning
Commission and City Council may refer to applicable standards in Article 3.00  General
Provisions, Article 5.00  Parking & Loading, Article 6.00  Landscaping & Screening,
Article 7.00  Walls & Fences, Article 8.00  Signs, and Article 9.00  Site Development
Standards for Specific Uses of the Zoning Ordinance, while recognizing that such
standards may be used as a guide for design of PUD developments and modifications to
these standards may be approved.
Section 24.06 -- REVIEW PROCEDURES
A. Review Process
1. Concept Plan Contents
A Concept Plan may be submitted by any person or entity owning or controlling land that
is eligible for consideration as a Planned Unit Development in accordance with Section
24.03.A and shall include the following:
a. A written statement explaining the proposed uses, building and site
improvements, phasing plans, and resulting open spaces, landscaped areas, floor
area and parking. The written statement shall include a statement of reasons that
PUD is preferred over conventional zoning, and identification of the benefits to
the City of Midland and its residents resulting from the PUD project.
b. Concept Plan drawings, as defined and described in Section 24.02.B, containing
enough detail to explain the proposed uses, relationship to adjoining parcels,
vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns, open spaces and landscape areas,
and building density or intensity.
c. Additional maps and documents as necessary to adequately describe the project.
2. Concept Plan Review by the Planning Commission
If the application is found to be complete by the Planning and Community Development
Department staff, the application shall be transmitted to the Planning Commission for
review and recommendation to the City Council. Before making a recommendation, the
Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing, following the hearing requirements for
Article 24  Planned Unit Development
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 24 - 8
Conditional Land Uses in Section 28.02. After the public hearing, the Planning
Commission shall review the proposal. In conducting its review, the Planning
Commission may seek information, analysis and advice from the City staff, as necessary.
The Planning Commission shall then report its findings and make its recommendations to
the City Council.
3. Concept Plan Review by the City Council
Upon receipt of the report and recommendation from the Planning Commission, a public
hearing by the City Council shall be scheduled. After the public hearing, the City
Council shall review all findings and take action to approve, approve with conditions, or
deny the Concept Plan, and shall set forth the reasons for their action in writing. A
determination that a proposal qualifies for PUD approval shall be accompanied by a
description of the minimum conditions under which the proposal will be considered for
final approval. In describing such conditions, the City Council may identify specific
requirements or standards in the Zoning Ordinance that could be waived or modified
upon approval of the final PUD Detail Plan. A determination of Qualification and
Concept Plan Approval does not assure approval of a particular PUD Detail Plan, but is
intended to provide direction for preparation of the Detail Plan upon which a final
determination would be based. If the City Council denies the Concept Plan, the applicant
may pursue development or use of the site under conventional zoning standards, or may
submit a new design based upon a revised Concept Plan.
4. Approval
Approval of a Concept Plan by the City Council pursuant to the PUD regulations shall
confer upon the property owner or owners the right to submit a PUD Detail Plan in
accordance with Section 24.06.B. The right to submit a PUD Detail Plan will be valid
for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of Concept Plan approval by the
City Council. Once an area has been included in a Concept Plan that has been approved
by the City Council, no development may take place in such area nor may any use thereof
be made except in accordance with the City Council-approved Concept Plan or a Plan
Amended in accordance with paragraph (D) of this Article.
B. Request for Final Approval
Following approval of a Concept Plan and Request for Qualification by the City Council, final
approval may be sought by a property owner or developer by submittal of the following
materials:
1. PUD Detail Plan
An application and Detail Plan (as defined in Section 24.02) shall be submitted to the
Planning Department to initiate review and action by the Planning Commission. The
Detail Plan shall contain all of the information required for site plans in Section 27.05,
and any other documentation necessary to demonstrate that the Detail Plan complies with
all the conditions upon which approval of the Concept Plan was based.
2. City Council Review
a. The Planning and Community Development Department shall determine if the
Detail Plan is substantially in compliance with the site plan submittal
requirements and the minimum conditions of approval of the Concept Plan. If
the Plan is found to be in compliance with submittal requirements and minimum
conditions, the proposal shall be placed on the City Council agenda.
b. The City Council shall review the proposed Detail Plan and make a
determination whether the proposal satisfies the qualification criteria and whether
the proposal adheres to the following objectives and requirements.
Article 24  Planned Unit Development
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 24 - 9
(1) The Detail Plan is in compliance with the approved Concept Plan.
(2) All applicable provisions of this Article and Ordinance shall be met.
Insofar as any provisions of this Article are in conflict with the
provisions of any other section of this Ordinance, the provisions of this
Article shall apply to the lands within the boundaries of a proposed PUD
project.
(3) There is, or will be at the time of development, sewer, water, and an
adequate means of managing storm water flow, and achieving a safe and
adequate road system.
Upon making these determinations, the City Council shall take action to
approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the Detail Plan, and
shall set forth the reasons for their action in the minutes of the meeting at
which the action occurred.
c. City Council approval of a PUD Detail Plan shall be final, unless the Detail Plan
proposes significant alterations to the intent and conditions of the Concept Plan
approval, in which case reconsideration of the Concept Plan by the Planning
Commission and City Council shall be required, pursuant to Section 24.06. If
such reconsideration is required, then the City Council shall delay taking action
on the Detail Plan until the Planning Commission reconsiders and acts on the
revised Concept Plan.
3. PUD Agreement
Upon approval of the Detail Plan, the City Attorney shall prepare a PUD Agreement
setting forth the conditions upon which such approval is based, which Agreement, after
approval by resolution of the City Council, shall be executed by the City and the
applicant. Approval of the Detail Plan shall become effective upon recording of the
Agreement in the Office of the Midland County Register of Deeds, which shall be done at
the expense of the applicant. The Agreement shall include the following elements:
a. Project summary.
b. Identification of the plans and documents that are a part of the approval.
c. The terms and conditions under which the approval was granted and the project
will be allowed to be implemented.
d. The entity that is responsible for constructing each element of the project,
including the public facilities and infrastructure.
e. Project details and dimensions that are mandatory.
f. Identification of the entities that will own and be responsible for maintenance of
public open space, common areas, and facilities, and the method of financing
such maintenance work.

designed so that each phase, when completed, is capable of standing on its own in terms of public
or common services, facilities, and utilities and open space. Each phase shall contain the
Article 24  Planned Unit Development
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 24 - 10
necessary components to insure protection of natural resources and the health, safety and welfare
of the users of the project and the residents of the surrounding area.
D. Amendments
1. If the Planning and Community Development Director determine that a proposed
amendment to a plan approved pursuant to these PUD regulations alters the intent and
conditions of the PUD approval, revised Concept and Detail Plans shall be submitted for
review following the procedures in Section 24.06.A
2. If the proposed amendment is found to not alter the intent and conditions of the PUD
approval, the amendment shall be reviewed as an amendment to the site plan, following
the procedures for site plan review in Article 27.00.
E. Appeals
The Board of Zoning Appeals has no authority in matters covered by this Article. Modifications
to plans or proposals submitted under this Article shall be processed in accordance with the
amendment procedures covered under Section 24.06.D.
F. Violations
Any violation of the approved PUD Concept or Detail Plan or PUD Agreement shall be
considered a violation of the Zoning Ordinance, which shall be subject to the enforcement actions
and penalties described in Section 31.07.
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 25 - 1
ARTICLE 25.00
RESIDENTIAL OPEN SPACE OPTION
Residential Open Space developments may be approved in the Agricultural, Residential A-1, Residential
A-2, Residential A-3 and Residential A-4 districts, subject to the standards and review procedures set
forth herein.
Section 25.01 -- PURPOSE
It is the intent of this Article to offer an alternative to traditional subdivisions through the use of cluster
zoning as authorized by the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (Public Act110 of 2006, as amended) for the
purpose of:
Encouraging the use of land in accordance with its character and adaptability;
Assuring the permanent preservation of open space and other natural resources;
Providing recreational facilities within a reasonable distance of all residents of the Residential
Open Space development;
Encouraging the provision of open space of a reasonable size;
Allowing innovation and greater flexibility in the design of residential developments;
Facilitating the construction and maintenance of streets, utilities, and public services in a more
economical and efficient manner;
Ensuring compatibility of design and use between neighboring properties and a consistent density
with that permitted in the current zoning district; and
Encouraging a less sprawling form of development, thus preserving open space as undeveloped
land.
These regulations are intended to preserve the character of the City of Midland through the creation of
small residential nodes with complementary open space. It is the intent of these regulations to produce a
development substantially consistent with Zoning Ordinance standards, yet to allow for modifications
from the general standards to meet the intent of this Ordinance.
Section 25.02  REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS
If the Residential Open Space option is selected, the property shall be developed under the conditions and
requirements in this sub-section, applicable requirements for the district in which the development is
located, and other applicable zoning regulations and City ordinances. Proposals for Residential Open
Space developments shall be reviewed following the same procedures used for a conditional land use in
the underlying zoning district, except that the applicant shall complete a site features inventory prior to
development. The inventory shall consist of maps and written analysis which shall identify, describe and
Article 25  Residential Open Space
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 25 - 2
quantify the following features, at minimum: existing vegetation, topography at two-foot contour
intervals, water courses, drainage patterns, roads and road rights-of-way, easements, soils (based on U.S.
Soil Conservation Survey or soil borings), MDEQ-regulated wetlands, floodplains, woodlands and tree
lines, and any additional features uniquely affecting the site.
Section 25.03  DENSITY
A. Permitted Density
The overall density of residential uses in a Residential Open Space development shall not exceed
the density that would be permitted if the site was developed as a conventional single family
subdivision, unless a density bonus is recommended by the Planning Commission and approved
by the City Council.
The permitted density shall be based on the net buildable area of the site which consists of the
portions of the site that are not encumbered by regulated wetlands (except that one-quarter of the
total wetlands may be counted as buildable), steep slopes, existing and proposed road rights-ofway,
easements, existing structures or lots, or other existing or proposed features that would
prevent construction of a building or use of the site for residential purposes.
Modifications permitted under the Residential Open Space option that result in reduction in land
area dedicated to individual dwelling units shall be compensated for by an equivalent amount of
open space, which shall be maintained and preserved in accordance with the standards specified
in this subsection.
B. Density Bonus
A density bonus of up to twenty percent (20%) shall be permitted at the discretion of the City
Council where provisions are made for either preservation of natural features, recreational
facilities, more extensive landscaping than otherwise required, the provision of bike paths or the
preservation of open space of recognizable benefit to the City of Midland, not including the
protection of regulated wetland areas.
Section 25.04  DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS
A. Variations from the setback and lot size requirements listed in Article 26.00 for the underlying
zoning district may be permitted where the City Council finds that a smaller lot size is required to
achieve the density permitted under Section 25.03.
B. Distances between Buildings
Any detached single family structure (or accessory structure thereto) shall be located at least ten
(10) feet from any other detached single family structure or accessory structure.
C. Height Standards
Buildings in a Residential Open Space development shall comply with the height standards for
the district in which the development is located.
Section 25.05  OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS
Residential Open Space developments shall provide and maintain open space in an undeveloped state,
which shall comply with the following requirements:
Article 25  Residential Open Space
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 25 - 3
1. Residential Open Space developments shall reserve at least twenty percent (20%) of the
parcel in an undeveloped state.
2. Open space shall be located on the parcel to meet the following objectives:
a. To preserve distinctive natural features, scenic or wooded conditions, and other
open space.
b. To preserve farmlands.
c. To minimize impact from development on wetlands, streams, and other sensitive
environmental areas.
d. To provide additional buffering from traffic and enhance views from the
roadway.
In addition, the open space shall be developed with childrens play facilities, picnic
facilities, trails, and similar passive recreational facilities to satisfy the needs of future
residents of the development, provided that all such facilities shall be compatible in
design with other open space requirements and objectives.
3. Required open space shall not include the area of any public or private road, the area of
any easement providing access to the site, or the area of any commercial recreation use
(such as a golf course). Required open space also shall not include the area of any
stormwater retention or detention pond, with the exception that up to 50% of the surface
area of stormwater management ponds may qualify as open space if the following
conditions are met:
a. All stormwater management ponds shall be integrated into the overall
development and shall serve as a visual and physical amenity to the site. A
visual and physical amenity is easily accessible to pedestrians and/or nonmotorized
vehicles and is visually attractive.
b. All stormwater management ponds shall have a minimum permanent water depth
of 4 feet and a maximum permanent water depth of 9 feet.
c. The maximum slope of stormwater management ponds in a Planned Unit
Development shall be 1:6.
d. Fences around stormwater management ponds are not permitted.
e. All stormwater management ponds shall have a natural appearance, and shall be
round, oval, or kidney in shape with irregular edges.
f. Recreation facilities such as walking paths shall be provided near and/or around
stormwater management ponds to allow users of the site to use and enjoy the
ponds as an amenity.
4. Open Space areas shall be protected from soil compaction during construction.
5. The required open space shall be set aside by the developer through an irrevocable
conveyance, such as a deed restriction, conservation easement, plat dedication, restrictive
covenant, or other means that runs with the land assuring that the open space will remain
undeveloped. Such conveyance shall:
Article 25  Residential Open Space
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 25 - 4
a. Indicate the proposed use(s) of the required open space.
b. Provide for the privately-owned open space to be maintained by private property
owners having an interest in the open space.
c. Provide maintenance standards and a maintenance schedule.
d. Provide notice of possible assessment to the private property owners by the City
of Midland for the maintenance of the open space in the event that it is
inadequately maintained and becomes a public nuisance.
e. After approval from the City Attorney, the developer shall record the conveyance
with the Midland County Register of Deeds to provide record notice of the
restrictions to all persons having or seeking an interest in the property contained
in the Residential Open Space development. Evidence that the document has
been recorded shall be provided to the City prior to issuance of any permits to
commence construction.
Section 25.06  STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
1. Existing natural drainage shall be maintained to the maximum extent feasible.
2. Retention and detention basins, where proposed or required, shall resemble natural ponds
with gradual slopes and shall be landscaped with plant material that enhances the wildlife
habitat.
3. Best management practices in stormwater management are encouraged such as use of
natural habitat to filter stormwater (bio-swales, rain gardens and phytoremediation),
design to decrease the amount of impervious surfaces (permeable paving, green roofs,
and curbless parking areas and roads), and dissemination of stormwater in a natural
manner (level spreaders and multiple, connected ponds).

responsibility of the applicant to obtain all other applicable City, County, State, or
Federal permits prior to issuance of a building permit.
A building permit for a structure in a proposed condominium project shall not be issued
until evidence of a recorded Master Deed has been provided to the City. However, the
Building Official may issue permits for site grading, erosion control, installation of
public water and sewage facilities, and construction for roads prior to recording the
Master Deed. No permit issued or work undertaken prior to recording the Master Deed
pursuant to this Section shall grant any rights or any expectancy interest in the approval
of the Master Deed. The Master Deed shall contain provisions describing the
responsibilities of the condominium association, condominium owners, and public
entities, with regard to maintenance of the property in accordance with the approved site
plan on a continuing basis. The Master Deed shall further establish the means of

responsibility of the condominium association
2. Expiration of Site Plan Approval
If construction has not commenced within two (2) years of final approval of the site
plan, the site plan approval becomes null and void and a new application for site plan
review shall be required. The applicant may apply in writing to the City Council for an
extension of the site plan approval. The City Council may grant an extension of up to
twelve (12) months if:
a. The applicant requests the extension prior to expiration of the previous approval,
and
b. The approved site plan adequately represents current conditions on and
surrounding the site, and
c. The site plan conforms to the current Zoning Ordinance standards.
3. Monuments Requirements for Condominium Projects

furnish the City with the following:
c. Two (2) copies of an "as built survey", and
d. One (1) copy of the site plan.
E. Modification to Approved Plan
Minor modifications to an approved site plan may be approved by the Planning and Community
Development staff.
1. Minor Modification Defined
Minor modifications are changes that do not substantially affect the character or
intensity of the use, vehicular or pedestrian circulation, drainage patterns, the demand
for public services, the danger from hazards, or the provision of any bonus item.
Examples of minor modifications include:
a. An addition to an existing commercial or industrial building that does not increase
the floor space by more than twenty-five percent (25%) or seventy five hundred
(7,500) square feet, whichever is less.
b. Changes to building height that do not add an additional floor.
c. Alterations or modifications involving less than twenty-six (26) parking spaces.
d. Substitution of landscaping for equivalent species of landscaping.
e. Off-site improvements that individually would otherwise be approved
administratively by the city and that add to the safety, appearance or functionality
of the approved site plan being amended.
The construction of a new building or structure with 7,500 square feet or more of gross
floor area, adding twenty six (26) or more parking spaces, or deleting parking or the
addition of curb cuts onto a public road are examples of modifications which are not
considered minor. If the modifications are not deemed minor by the Planning and
Community Development staff, then full review and approval by the Planning
Commission and City Council shall be required.
2. Recording of Action
Each action related to modification of a site plan shall be duly recorded in writing on a
copy of the approved plan, and shall be kept on file. The City Council shall be advised
of all minor site plan modifications approved by the Planning and Community
Development staff and such modifications shall be noted on the site plan.

CONDITIONAL LAND USE
Section 28.01 -- INTENT
The procedures and standards in this Section are intended to provide a consistent and uniform method for
review of proposed plans for conditional land uses. Conditional land uses are uses, either public or
private, that possess unique characteristics and therefore cannot be classified as a permitted use in a
particular zoning district (see Definitions, Section 2.02). This Article contains standards for review of
each conditional land use proposal individually on its own merits to determine if it is an appropriate use
for the district and specific location where it is proposed.
Section 28.02  PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS
Conditional land use proposals shall be reviewed in accordance with the procedures in Article 27.00 for
site plan review, except as follows:
A. Public Hearing Required
A public hearing shall be scheduled and held by the Planning Commission before a
recommendation is made on a conditional land use request. One notice of the public hearing shall
be published in a newspaper which circulates in the City, and sent by mail or personal delivery to
the owners of property for which approval is being considered, to all persons to whom real
property is within three hundred (300) feet of the boundary of the property in question, and to the
occupants of all structures within three hundred (300) feet. The notice shall be given not less than
15 days before the date the application will be considered, in accordance with the provisions in
Sec. 502 (2) of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, PA 110 of 2006 as amended. The notice
shall:
1. Describe the nature of the conditional land use request.
2. Indicate the property which is the subject of the conditional land use request.
3. State when and where the conditional land use request will be considered.
4. Indicate when and where written comments will be received concerning the request.
5. Indicate the date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing.
B. Planning Commission Action
The Planning Commission shall review the application for conditional land use in accordance
with the procedures in this Article, together with the public hearing findings and reports and
recommendations from the Planning and Community Development staff, City Engineering
Department, Midland County Road Commission, Midland County Health Department, Midland
County Drain Commissioner, Fire Department, City of Midland City Police Department and other
reviewing agencies. The Planning Commission shall then make a recommendation to the City
Council, solely based on the requirements and standards of this Ordinance. The Planning
Commission shall submit to the City Council a written recommendation of approval, denial, or
approval with conditions within forty-five (45) days of the close of the public hearing required for
a conditional land use proposal.

D. City Council Action
A public hearing shall be scheduled and held by the City Council before a decision is made on a

which approval is being considered, to all persons to whom real property is within three hundred
(300) feet of the boundary of the property in question, and to the occupants of all structures
within three hundred (300) feet. The notice shall be given, in accordance with the provisions of

2. Approval with Conditions
The City Council may impose reasonable conditions with the approval of a conditional
land use. The conditions may include provisions necessary to insure that public services
and facilities affected by a proposed conditional land use or activity will be capable of
accommodating increased service and facility loads generated by the new development,
to protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to insure
compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and
economically desirable manner. Conditions imposed shall meet all of the following
requirements:
a. Conditions shall be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety, welfare,
and social and economic well being of those who will use the land use or activity

standards.
3. Denial
Upon determination by the City Council that a conditional land use proposal does not
comply with the standards and regulations set forth in this Ordinance, or otherwise will
be injurious to the public health, safety, welfare, or orderly development of the City, a
conditional land use proposal shall be denied.
The City Council decision on a conditional land use shall be incorporated in a written statement
of findings relative to the conditional land use under consideration. Said findings shall specify
the reasons for the decision and any conditions imposed. Upon the recommendation of denial by
the Planning Commission, the approval of a conditional land use shall require a four-fifths (4/5)
vote of the City Council.
E. Effect of Approval
Upon approval, a conditional land use shall be deemed permitted in the district in which it is
proposed, subject to any conditions imposed and final approval of the site plan. Such approval
shall affect only the lot or portion thereof on which the proposed use is located. Such approval
shall remain valid regardless of change of ownership.
F. Expiration of Conditional Land Use Approval
If construction has not commenced within twelve (12) months of final approval the approval
becomes null and void and a new application for conditional land use approval shall be required.
Upon written request from the applicant prior to expiration of the previous approval, a twelve
(12) month extension may be granted by the City Council, if it finds that the approved conditional
land use application and site plan adequately represent current conditions on and surrounding the
site and provided the site plan conforms to current zoning ordinance standards. The written
request for extension shall be received by the Planning and Community Development Department
or post marked prior to the expiration date or a new application for conditional land use review
will be required.

use permit.
H. Modification to Approved Conditional Land Use
Conditional Land Uses approved in accordance with provisions of this Section may subsequently
be modified, subject to the following requirements:
1. Site modifications that do not change the nature of the use or that do not affect the
intensity of use may be reviewed and approved following normal site plan review
procedures described in Article 27.00. In evaluating change in intensity of use, the staff
shall consider the extent of increase of vehicular or pedestrian traffic, the change in
demand for public services, extent to which the total floor area occupied by the proposed
use will increase, increased demand for parking, off-site impacts from noise, fumes,
drainage, etc., and similar considerations.
2. Modifications that change the nature of the use or that result in an increase in the
intensity of the use shall be reviewed in the same manner as a new conditional land use
proposal, following the procedures in this Section.
I. Revocation of Conditional Land Use Approval
Article 28  Conditional Land Use
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 28 - 4
Compliance with the conditions of conditional land use approval shall be a continuing obligation
of the applicant and any subsequent owner. Approval of a conditional land use may be revoked
by the City Council if construction is not in conformance with the approved plans or if the use is
not being operated in compliance with the required conditions. Written notice shall be provided
to the applicant at least five (5) days prior to the meeting at which the case will be considered.
The applicant shall be given the opportunity to present information and to answer questions. The

City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 29-1
ARTICLE 29.00
VARIANCES AND APPEALS
Section 29.01  INTENT
The purpose of this Section is to provide guidelines and standards to be followed by the Zoning Board of
Appeals to act on matters where this Ordinance or state law gives jurisdiction to the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
Section 29.02 -- AUTHORITY OF THE ZONING BOARD OF
APPEALS
A. General Authority
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the authority to act on those matters where this Ordinance
provides for appeal of an administrative order or interpretation and shall have authority to authorize
a variance as defined in this Ordinance and laws of the State of Michigan. Such authority shall be
subject to the rules and standards in this Section. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not have the
authority to alter or change zoning district classifications of any property, nor to make any change
in the text of this Ordinance.
B. Administrative Review
Except for conditional land use approval, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall have authority to hear
and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in an order, requirement, permit,
decision, or refusal made by an official, board, or commission in carrying out or enforcing any
provisions of this Ordinance. Such appeal shall be requested by the applicant within thirty (30)
days of the date of the order, refusal, requirement, or determination being appealed. In hearing
and deciding appeals under this sub-section, the Zoning Board of Appeals review shall be based
upon the record of the administrative decision being appealed. If new information is presented, the
official, board or commission from whom the appeal is taken should first review the revised
application and make a decision, which may be then appealed under this section.
C. Interpretation
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have authority to hear and decide requests for interpretation of
the Zoning Ordinance, including the zoning map. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall make such
decisions so that the spirit and intent of this Ordinance shall be observed.
Text interpretations shall be limited to the issues presented, and shall be based upon a reading on
the Ordinance as a whole, and shall not have the effect of amending the Ordinance.
Map interpretations shall be made based upon rules in the Ordinance, and any relevant historical
information. In carrying out its authority to interpret the Ordinance, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall consider reasonable and/or practical interpretations which have been consistently applied in
the administration of the Ordinance. Prior to deciding a request for an interpretation, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may confer with City staff and consultants to determine the basic purpose of the
provision subject to interpretation and any consequences which may result from differing
decisions. A decision providing an interpretation may be accompanied by a recommendation for
consideration of an amendment to the Ordinance.
Article 29: Variances and Appeals
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 29 - 2
D. Variances
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have authority in specific cases to authorize one or more
dimensional or non-use variances from the strict letter and terms of this Ordinance by varying or
modifying any of its rules or provisions so that the spirit of this Ordinance is observed, public
safety secured, and substantial justice done. A dimensional or non-use variance allows a deviation
from the dimensional (i.e., height, bulk, setback) requirements of the Ordinance. A use variance
authorizes the establishment of a use of land that is otherwise prohibited in a zoning district. The
Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to grant use variances by this Ordinance.
Such authority shall be exercised in accordance with the following standards:
1. The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a requested "non-use" variance only upon a
finding that practical difficulties exist. A finding of practical difficulties is when the
applicant has demonstrated all of the following:
a. Strict compliance with restrictions governing area, setback, frontage, height, bulk,
density or other non-use matters, will unreasonably prevent the owner from using the
property for a permitted purpose or will render ordinance conformity unnecessarily
burdensome.
b. The variance will do substantial justice to the applicant, as well as to other property
owners.
c. The variance requested is the minimum variance needed to provide substantial relief
to the applicant and/or be consistent with justice to other property owners.
d. The need for the variance is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the property and
not generally applicable in the area or to other properties in the same zoning district.
e. The problem and resulting need for the variance has been created by strict
compliance with the Zoning Ordinance, not by the applicant or the applicants
predecessors.
2. The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a requested use variance only upon finding
that an unnecessary hardship exists. An unnecessary hardship is when the restrictions of
the zoning ordinance on the property, when its environment is considered, is so
unreasonable as to constitute an arbitrary and capricious interference with basic private
property rights. A use variance is a variance that permits a use that is otherwise
prohibited in a zoning district. A finding of unnecessary hardship shall require
demonstration by the applicant of all of the following:
a. The property cannot be reasonably used for any purpose permitted in the zoning
district without a variance.
b. The need for the variance is due to unique circumstances peculiar to the property and
not generally applicable in the area or to other properties in the same zoning district.
c. The variance will not alter the essential character of the area. In determining whether
the effect the variance will have on the character of the area, the established type and
pattern of land uses in the area and the natural characteristics of the site and
surrounding area will be considered.
d. The problem and resulting need for the variance has not been self-created by the
applicant.
Article 29: Variances and Appeals
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 29 - 3
3. In all variance proceedings, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide
information, plans, testimony and/or evidence from which the Zoning Board of Appeals may
make the required findings.
E. Conditions
The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose reasonable conditions in connection with an affirmative
decision on an appeal, interpretation or variance request. The conditions may include requirements
necessary to insure that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity
will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by the land use or
activity, to protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources and energy, and to
insure compatibility with adjacent uses of land. Conditions imposed shall meet the following
requirements:
1. Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety and welfare of those who will use
the land use or activity under consideration, residents and surrounding property owners, and
the community as a whole.
2. Be related to the valid exercise of the Citys police power, the ability to protect health, safety
and welfare endowed to local governments by the Constitution of the United States, and
purposes which are affected by the proposed use or activity.
3. Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance, be related to the
standards established in the ordinance, be related to the standards established in the ordinance
for the land use or activity under consideration, and be necessary to insure compliance with
those standards.
Conditions imposed with respect to the approval of a variance shall be recorded as part of the
Zoning Board of Appeals minutes, and shall remain unchanged except upon the approval of the
Zoning Board of Appeals following notice and hearing as required in a new case.
F. Performance Guarantee
The Zoning Board of Appeals may require that a performance guarantee be deposited with the City
to ensure faithful completion of the improvements, in compliance with Section 3.14.

The Zoning Board of Appeals has the authority to require a land survey prepared by a professional
surveyor or registered engineer if the Zoning Board of Appeals determines it to be necessary to
insure accuracy of the plan.
C. Applications Involving an Appeal of Administrative Order
In a case involving an appeal from an action of an administrative official or entity (as specified in

assessment role.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall decide the application or appeal within sixty (60) days of the
hearing date and shall promptly mail a copy of its decision to the applicant or appellant.
F. Stay of Proceedings
An appeal shall have the effect of staying all proceedings in furtherance of the action being
appealed unless the officer or entity from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Zoning Board of
Appeals that, by reason of facts stated in such certification, a stay would in his or her opinion cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed unless specifically
determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals, or by a court of competent jurisdiction.
G. Decision by the Zoning Board of Appeals
The concurring vote of a majority of the full membership of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of an administrative
official, board or commission made in the administration of this ordinance, and to decide in favor

E. Conditional Zoning Map Amendment Considerations
1. Intent
It is recognized that there are certain instances when it would be in the best interests of
the City, as well as advantageous to property owners seeking a change in zoning
classification, if certain conditions are proposed by property owners as part of a request
for a zoning map amendment, otherwise referred to as rezoning. It is the intent of this
Section to provide a process consistent with the provisions of the City and Village Zoning
Act by which an owner seeking a rezoning may voluntarily propose conditions regarding
the use and/or development of land as part of the rezoning request.
2. Application and Offer of Conditions.
a. All owners of land may voluntarily offer in writing conditions relating to the use
and/or development of land for which a rezoning is requested. This offer may be
made either at the time the application for rezoning is filed or may be made at a
later time during the rezoning process.
b. The required application and process for considering a rezoning request with
conditions shall be the same as that for considering rezoning requests made
without any offer of conditions, except as modified by the requirements of this
Section.
c. The owners offer of conditions may not purport to authorize uses or
developments not permitted in the requested new zoning district.
d. The owner's offer of conditions shall bear a reasonable and rational relationship
to the property for which rezoning is requested.
e. Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would
require a conditional land use permit under the terms of this Ordinance may only
be commenced if a conditional land use permit for such use or development is
ultimately granted in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
f. Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would
require a variance under the terms of this Ordinance may only be commenced if a
variance for such use or development is first granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
g. Any use or development proposed as part of an offer of conditions that would
require site plan approval under the terms of this Ordinance may only be
commenced if site plan approval for such use or development is ultimately
granted in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
h. The offer of conditions may be amended during the process of rezoning
consideration provided that any amended or additional conditions are entered
voluntarily by the owner. An owner may withdraw all or part of its offer of
conditions any time prior to final rezoning action of the City Council provided
that, if such withdrawal occurs subsequent to the Planning Commissions public
hearing on the original rezoning request, then the rezoning application shall be
referred to the Planning Commission for a new public hearing with appropriate
notice and a new recommendation.
Article 30  Amendments
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 30 - 5
3. Planning Commission Review
The Planning Commission, after public hearing and consideration of the factors for
rezoning set forth in Section 30.03 of this Ordinance, may recommend approval, approval
with conditions offered in writing by the applicant or denial of the rezoning.
4. City Council Review
After receipt of the Planning Commissions recommendation, the City Council shall
deliberate upon the requested rezoning and may approve or deny the conditional rezoning
request. The City Council's deliberations shall include, but not be limited to, a
consideration of the factors for rezoning set forth in Section 30.03 of this Ordinance.
Should the applicant offer additional conditions after the Planning Commission
recommendation has been made that substantially impact the zoning request, City
Council shall refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for further review and
recommendation.
5. Approval.
a. If the City Council finds the rezoning request and offer of conditions acceptable,
the offered conditions shall be incorporated into a formal written Statement of
Conditions acceptable to the owner and conforming in form to the provisions of
this Section. The Statement of Conditions shall be incorporated into the
ordinance adopted by the City Council to accomplish the requested rezoning.
b. The Statement of Conditions shall:
i. Be in a form recordable with the Register of Deeds of the County in
which the land is located or, in the alternative, be accompanied by a
recordable Affidavit or Memorandum prepared and signed by the owner
giving notice of the Statement of Conditions in a manner acceptable to
the City Council.
ii. Contain a legal description of the land to which it pertains.
iii. Contain a statement acknowledging that the Statement of Conditions
runs with the land and is binding upon successor owners of the land.
iv. Incorporate by attachment or reference any diagram, plans or other
documents submitted or approved by the owner that are necessary to
illustrate the implementation of the Statement of Conditions. If any such
documents are incorporated by reference, the reference shall specify
where the document may be examined.
v. Contain a statement acknowledging that the Statement of Conditions or
an Affidavit or Memorandum giving notice thereof may be recorded by
the City with the Register of Deeds of the County in which the land
referenced in the Statement of Conditions is located.
vi. Contain the notarized signatures of all of the owners of the subject land
preceded by a statement attesting to the fact that they voluntarily offer
and consent to the provisions contained within the Statement of
Conditions.
c. Upon the rezoning taking effect, the Zoning Map shall be amended to reflect the
new zoning classification along with a designation that the land was rezoned with
Article 30  Amendments
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 30 - 6
a Statement of Conditions. The City Clerk shall maintain a listing of all lands
rezoned with a Statement of Conditions.
d. The approved Statement of Conditions or an Affidavit or Memorandum giving
notice thereof shall be filed by the City with the Register of Deeds of the County
in which the land is located. The City Council shall have authority to waive this
requirement if it determines that, given the nature of the conditions and/or the
time frame within which the conditions are to be satisfied, the recording of such a
document would be of no material benefit to the City or to any subsequent owner
of the land.
e. Upon the rezoning taking effect, the use of the land so rezoned shall conform
thereafter to all of the requirements regulating use and development within the
new zoning district as modified by any more restrictive provisions contained in
the Statement of Conditions.
6. Compliance with Conditions
a. Any person who establishes a development or commences a use upon land that
has been rezoned with conditions shall continuously operate and maintain the
development or use in compliance with all of the conditions set forth in the
Statement of Conditions. Any failure to comply with a condition contained
within the Statement of Conditions shall constitute a violation of this Zoning
Ordinance and be punishable accordingly. Additionally, any such violation shall
be deemed a nuisance per se and subject to judicial abatement as provided by
law.
b. No permit or approval shall be granted under this Ordinance for any use or
development that is contrary to an applicable Statement of Conditions.
7. Time Period for Establishing Development or Use
Unless another time period is specified in the ordinance rezoning the subject land, the
approved development and/or use of the land pursuant to building and other required
permits must be commenced upon the land within 18 months after the rezoning took
effect and thereafter proceed diligently to completion. This time limitation may upon
written request be extended by the City Council if:
(1) it is demonstrated to the City Council's reasonable satisfaction that there is a
strong likelihood that the development and/or use will commence within the
period of extension and proceed diligently thereafter to completion; and
(2) the City Council finds that there has not been a change in circumstances that
would render the current zoning with Statement of Conditions incompatible with
other zones and uses in the surrounding area or otherwise inconsistent with sound
zoning policy.
8. Reversion of Zoning
If approved development and/or use of the rezoned land does not occur within the time
frame specified under Subsection 7 above, then the land shall revert to its former zoning
classification as set forth in MCL 125.584g. The reversion process shall be initiated by
the City Council requesting that the Planning Commission proceed with consideration of
rezoning of the land to its former zoning classification. The procedure for considering
and making this reversionary rezoning shall thereafter be the same as applies to all other
rezoning requests.
Article 30  Amendments
City of Midland Zoning Ordinance Page 30 - 7
9. Subsequent Rezoning of Land
When land that is rezoned with a Statement of Conditions is thereafter rezoned to a
different zoning classification or to the same zoning classification but with a different or
no Statement of Conditions, whether as a result of a reversion of zoning pursuant to
Subsection 8 above or otherwise, the Statement of Conditions imposed under the former
zoning classification shall cease to be in effect. The City Clerk shall record with the
Register of Deeds of the County in which the land is located a notice that the Statement
of Conditions is no longer in effect.
10. Amendment of Conditions
a. During the time period for commencement of an approved development or use
specified pursuant to Subsection 7 above or during any extension thereof granted by
the City Council, the City shall not add to or alter the conditions in the Statement of
Conditions.
b. The Statement of Conditions may be amended thereafter in the same manner as was
prescribed for the original rezoning and Statement of Conditions.
11. City Right to Rezone
Nothing in the Statement of Conditions nor in the provisions of this Section shall be
deemed to prohibit the City from rezoning all or any portion of land that is subject to a
Statement of Conditions to another zoning classification. Any rezoning shall be
conducted in compliance with this Ordinance and the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act,
P.A 110 of 2006 as amended.
12. Failure to Offer Conditions
The City shall not require an owner to offer conditions as a requirement for rezoning.
The lack of an offer of conditions shall not affect an owners rights under this Ordinance.
F. Notice of Record of Amendment Adoption
Following adoption of an amendment by the City Council, one notice of adoption shall be filed
with the City Clerk and one notice shall be published in newspaper of general circulation in the
City within fifteen (15) days after adoption, in accordance with Michigan Public Act 110 of 2006,
as amended. A record of all amendments shall be maintained by the City Clerk. A master
Zoning Map, including all map amendments by ordinance date, shall be maintained by the City.
Section 30.04 -- FILING FEES
All applications shall be accompanied by a filing fee which shall be established by the City Council,
found in Chapter 21 of the City of Midland Code of Ordinances. Upon notification of deficient payment
of fees, administrative officials charged with enforcement of the Ordinance shall suspend further review
of the application.
