PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Wyoming, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through September 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLES SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Allen Z. Paul, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Nancy M. Giar, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Any enumeration of particular powers, privileges or immunities anywhere in this charter shall not be held to be exclusive.

Such notice shall include a copy of the charges against such officer. The hearing shall afford an opportunity to the officer, in person or by attorney, to be heard in his defense, to cross examine witnesses, and to present testimony. If such officer shall neglect to appear at such hearing and answer such charges, his failure to do so may be deemed cause for his removal. A majority vote of the members of the Commission in office at the time, exclusive of any member whose removal is being considered, shall be required for any such removal.

In case of failure to comply with the provisions of this section within ten days from date he is notified in writing of his election or appointment, such officer shall be deemed to have declined the office and such office shall thereupon become vacant unless the Commission shall by resolution extend the time in which such officer may qualify.

Such official bond of every officer and employee shall be conditioned that he will faithfully perform the duties of his office, and will on demand deliver over to his successor in office, or other proper officer or agent of the city, all books, papers, money, effects and property belonging thereto, or appertaining to his office, which may be further conditioned as the Commission shall prescribe. The official bond of every officer whose duty it may be to receive or pay out money, besides being conditioned as above required, shall be further conditioned that he will, on demand, pay over or account for to the city, or any proper officer or agent thereof, all moneys received by him as such officer or employee.

Sec. 5.12. - Pecuniary interest prohibited.

A "contract" shall, for the purpose of this section, include any arrangement pursuant to which any material, service or other thing of value is to be furnished to the City or sold or transferred by the City, including the furnishing of personal services as an officer or employee of the City if the employment is made directly or indirectly by the officer who is a member of such family. 
(b)  Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this section, an officer shall be deemed to have a pecuniary interest in a contract if he or any member of his family is an employee, partner, officer, director, or sales representative of the person, firm, or corporation with which such contract is made or a sales representative of such person, firm, or corporation. Ownership, individually or in a fiduciary capacity, by an officer or member of his family of securities, or of any beneficial interest in securities, of any corporation with which a contract is made or which is a sales representative of any person, firm, or corporation with which such contract is made, shall not be deemed to create a pecuniary interest in such contract unless the aggregate amount of such securities, or interest in such securities, so owned by such officer and the member of his family, shall amount to ten percent of any class of the securities of such corporation then outstanding. 
(c)  A contract in which an officer or member of his family has a pecuniary interest may be made by the City if the members of the City Commission in office at the time having no interest shall by five-sixths vote determine that the best interests of the City shall be served by the making of such contract and if such contract is made after comparative prices are obtained. 
(d)  Any officer who knowingly permits the city to enter into any contract in which he has a pecuniary interest without disclosing such interest to the Commission prior to the action of the Commission in authorizing such contract, shall be guilty of misconduct of office. Except in the instances specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the unanimous determination (by vote or written instrument filed with the Clerk) of the Commission that in a particular case an officer or member of his family will not have a pecuniary interest in any contract or purchase to be entered into by the city shall be final and conclusive in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation. 
(e)  No officer or employee shall stand as surety on any bail bond to the city or give any bail for any other person which may be required by the charter or any ordinance of the city. Any officer of the city who violates the provisions of this paragraph shall be guilty of misconduct in office. 
(Amended September 14, 1965)

Such fees, commissions, and compensation shall belong to the city and shall be collected and accounted for by such officers or employees, and be paid into the city treasury, and a statement thereof filed periodically with the City Manager. The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to fees, commissions or other compensation paid by the County of Kent to any officer or employee serving as a city representative on the Board of Supervisors.

ARTICLE III. - ADULT BUSINESSES 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 14-86. - Purpose and intent of article. 
    The purpose and intent of this article are to license and regulate, but not to exclude, adult businesses in the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations of such uses in order to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. This article is enacted based upon the finding by the city that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, have serious, objectionable, operational characteristics. The city also finds that the regulation of such uses is necessary to ensure that adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of surrounding residential neighborhoods, nonresidential areas or other places of public congregation. The provisions of these regulations have neither the purpose nor intent of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adult or sexually-oriented materials, nor to restrict or deny access by adults to such materials protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, nor to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of such materials or entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the purpose nor intent of such sections to condone or legitimize the distribution of adult or sexually oriented materials. 
(Ord. No. 13-93, § 1(80.401), 11-1-93; Ord. No. 11-01, § 1, 5-21-01) 
Sec. 14-87. - Legislative findings. 
    The city council makes the following legislative findings based upon evidence concerning adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community provided in various reports made available to the city and on findings incorporated by the U.S. Supreme Court in the cases of City of Renton v Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); studies conducted in other cities; the findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) and statistics obtained from various health departments. The council specifically finds that: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are often uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments; there must be in place a mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located. 
(3)  Sexual acts, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live shows. 
(4)  Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. 
(6)  Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses. 
(7)  The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact. 
(8)  According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(9)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(10)  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity including drug use and sales. 
(11)  These findings raise substantial governmental concerns and indicate that it is necessary for protection of the public health, safety and welfare to promulgate regulations for adult businesses. 
(12)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics, which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(13)  It is necessary and in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to promulgate zoning regulations for sexually oriented businesses.

City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. , 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc. , 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Paps A.M. , 529 U.S. 277 (2000); DejaVu of Cincinnati, LLC v. Union Township , 411 F3d 777 (6th Cir. 2005); Triplet Grill, Inc. v. City of Akron , 40 F3d 129 (6th Cir. 1994); Executive Arts Studio v. City of Grand Rapids , 227 F Supp 2d 731 (D.C. WD Mich 2002); City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc , 535 U.S. 425 (2002); DejaVu of Nashville v. Metropolitan Gov't of Nashville , 274 F. 3d 377 (6th Cir. 2001); DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga, 107 F 3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Bamon Corp. v. City of Dayton , 923 F 3d 470 (6th Cir. 1991); Sensations, Inc . v. City of Grand Rapids (U.S.D.C., WD Mich, case No. 1:06-cv-300, 2006). 
    Based upon the findings in these cases and opinions and the various reports and information presented, the city council finds that sexually oriented businesses are often associated with adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, crime, prostitution, public indecency, potential spread of disease, sexual assault and exploitation, illicit drug sales and use, urban blight and negative impact on surrounding properties and property values. The council further finds that the city has a substantial government interest in preventing adverse secondary effects related to any current or future sexually oriented business that may locate in the city.

Sec. 14-132. - Unlawful activities. 
(1)  Nothing contained in this division is intended, or shall be construed to permit or authorize activities which are unlawful under state law or city ordinance. It is unlawful and a violation of this division for an operator to knowingly or intentionally violate the provision of this division or to allow, either knowingly or intentionally, an employee or patron to violate the provisions of this division. It shall be a defense to prosecution that the person prosecuted was powerless to prevent the violation. 
(2)  No person shall knowingly or intentionally, in a sexually oriented business, appear before a patron or patrons in a state of nudity, regardless of whether such public nudity is expressive in nature. 
(3)  No employee shall knowingly or intentionally, in a sexually oriented business, appear within view of any patron in a semi-nude condition unless the employee, while semi-nude, shall be and remain at least six feet from all patrons and on a fixed stage at least 18 inches from the floor in a room of at least 600 square feet. 
(4)  A sexually oriented business which exhibits on the premises, through any mechanical or electronic image-producing device, a film, video cassette, digital video disk, or other video reproduction characterized by an emphasis on the display of specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas shall comply with the following requirements: The interior of the premises shall be configured in such a manner that there is an unobstructed view from an operator's station of every area of the premises, including the interior of each viewing room but excluding restrooms, to which any patron is permitted access for any purpose. An operator's station shall not exceed 32 square feet of floor area. If the premises has two or more operator's stations designated, then the interior of the premises shall be configured in such a manner that there is an unobstructed view of each area of the premises to which any patron is permitted access for any purpose from at least one of the operator's stations. The view required in this paragraph must be by direct line of sight from the operator's station. It is the duty of the operator to ensure that at least one employee is on duty and situated in an operator's station at all time that any patron is on the portion of the premises monitored by that operator station. It shall be the duty of the operator, and it shall also be the duty of any employees present on the premises, to ensure that the view area specified in this paragraph remains unobstructed by any doors, curtains, walls, merchandise, display racks or other materials or enclosures at all times that any patron is present on the premises. 
(5)  No employee who regularly appears within view of patrons in a semi-nude condition in a sexually oriented business shall knowingly or intentionally touch a patron or the clothing of a patron in a sexually oriented business. 
(6)  No operator shall allow or permit a sexually oriented business to be or remain open between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. on any day.

Sec. 14-133. - Proof of violation. 
    This division does not impose strict liability. Unless a specific culpable mental state is otherwise specified herein, a showing of a knowing or reckless mental state is necessary to establish a violation of a provision of this division. For the purposes of this division, an act by an employee shall be imputed to the sexually oriented business for purposes of finding a violation of this division only if an officer, director or general partner or a person who managed, supervised or controlled the operation of the business premises, knowingly or recklessly allowed such act to occur on the premises. It shall be a defense to liability that the person to whom liability is imputed was powerless to prevent the act.

    The city council hereby makes the following findings: 
(a)  There is a need to ensure that residents in the metropolitan area that are the recipients of emergency medical services receive enhanced care in an efficient manner. 
(b)  The Michigan Public Health Code, Act No. 368 of the Public Acts of 1978, as amended, authorizes local government units to do the following: 
(1)  Contract for ambulance pre-hospital life support services; 
(2)  Regulate ambulance pre-hospital life support operations providing the standard are not in conflict or less stringent than those provided in the Public Health Code; and 
(3)  Defray costs through the collection of fees for services or by the creation and levy of special assessments. 
(c)  Local governments comprised of the cities of East Grand Rapids, Grandville, Grand Rapids, Kentwood, Rockford, and Wyoming, as well as Plainfield Charter Township, (the "participating municipalities") and American Medical Response, Life EMS, and Rockford Ambulance (the "EMS providers") have developed an agreement to define emergency ground ambulance service areas for each EMS provider and establish standards for such services. 
(Ord. No. 1-16, § 1, 3-21-16) 
Sec. 26-102. - Adoption of agreement. 
    The city hereby approves and adopts the agreement for allocation of primary emergency ground ambulance service areas among EMS providers dated January 14, 2016, between the participating municipalities and the EMS providers pursuant to the provisions of the Municipal Partnership Act, Act No. 258 of the Public Acts of 2011, as amended, and the Michigan Public Health Code, Act No. 368 of Public Acts of 1978, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 1-16, § 1, 3-21-16) 
Sec. 26-103. - Designation of primary service area. 
    The participating municipalities and the EMS providers have entered into a formal agreement originally dated January 14, 2016, to designate primary emergency operating rights in certain areas, to improve patient and system outcomes by ensuring continuity of services, to establish transparency in operation, and to develop data reporting standards ("agreement"). 
    Pursuant to the agreement, the city has designated a primary emergency ground ambulance service area to the provider or providers listed in the agreement. The agreement contemplates periodic review of emergency ground ambulance service providers and the service areas to which they are primarily assigned. During this review process, it is possible for other emergency ground ambulance service providers to be authorized to act and to be assigned a primary service area. Unless and until such assignment is made, only a currently authorized emergency ground ambulance service provider may operate within the city.

(e)  Differentiation between jobbing and production foundries: Cupolas used in a jobbing foundry are the same as those used in a production foundry and will vary in size only according to the quantity of iron melted per hour. However, the cupolas in a jobbing foundry will be run intermittently for just long enough at one time to pour the molds that are ready on the foundry floor, job by job. This might be for a two- to four-hour period per day for any number of days per week. Production foundry cupolas will melt continuously to pour a succession of molds that are constantly being prepared to receive this continuous flow of iron. This could become eight hours, 16 hours or 24 hours per day for any number of days per week. 
(f)  Where no water is available and emission limit of 0.3 pound per 1,000 pounds of gas cannot otherwise be satisfied, plant may be located as center point of buffer zone one mile in radius having no occupied residences or places of public assembly.

Thereafter, one installment shall be due each year on the anniversary date of the installment date, together with one year's interest on the unpaid balance to the last day of the month in which the anniversary date occurs; provided, however, that when any annual installment shall have been prepaid as is provided in this chapter, then only the interest upon the unpaid balance shall be billed for each year.

If payment is made on or after the first day of the month subsequent to the month on which the installment date or any anniversary date thereof occurs, the city treasurer shall add to such assessment or such installment, together with accrued interest thereon, a collection fee of one-half of one percent of the amount thereof, including accrued interest, and on the first day of each succeeding month he shall add an additional one-half of one percent collection fee until returned to the county on March 1 for collection.

(Code 1983, § 7.17) 
Sec. 66-18. - Deficiency assessments. 
    Should the assessments in any special assessment roll, including the amount that may be contributed by the city at large, prove insufficient for any reason to pay the cost of the improvement for which they were made, then the city may make an additional contribution and the city council, to supply the deficiency, may make additional assessments against the several lots and parcels of land, in the same ratio as the original assessments, but the total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement. 
(Code 1983, § 7.18) 
Sec. 66-19. - Special assessment errors.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 4-19, adopted Feb. 18, 2019, amended div. 2 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former div. 2 pertained to the same subject matter, consisted of §§ 70-76-70-80, and derived from the 1983 Code; Ord. No. 22-94, adopted Nov. 7, 1994; and Ord. No. 6-14, adopted Mar. 3, 2014. 

Sec. 70-76. - Purpose. 
    It is common for weather conditions between December 1 and March 31, and sometimes during other months, to include snowfalls requiring the plowing and removal of snow from city streets. It is also common for weather conditions to change requiring plowing all the way to curbs in order to clear snow cover over catch basins to allow for drainage when the snow and ice melt or rain occurs so as to prevent flooding, refreezing of undrained snowmelt and rain water, and other unsafe conditions. Plowing to the curbs is not possible when cars are parked on the street along the curb. The city recognizes on-street parking is important in some circumstances. In balancing these competing needs, the city is allowing for parking on only one side of the street during overnight hours in the months of December, January, February and March and as such other times as there is a declared snow emergency with the allowed parking alternating on a daily basis to enable snowplowing of both sides of the street. 
(Ord. No. 4-19, § 1, 2-18-19) 
Sec. 70-77. - Odd and even parking for winter and snow emergencies. 
(a)  During the months of December, January, February and March and, at other times during any declared snow emergency: 
(1)  A motor vehicle or a licensed trailer or equipment shall be parked only on that side of the street having even-numbered street addresses on even-numbered calendar days and on that side of the road having odd-numbered street addresses on odd-numbered calendar days between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 7:00 p.m. of the same day. 
(2)  On cul-de-sacs on-street parking of a motor vehicle or a licensed trailer or equipment is permitted between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 7:00 p.m. of the same day only on even-numbered calendar days. 
(b)  The city manager may declare a snow emergency when the city manager determines that because of current or anticipated winter weather conditions it is prudent to declare such an emergency in order to clear and maintain the streets of the city so as to allow normal and safe vehicular traffic, parking and access, or to open catch basins to improve street drainage. 
(1)  A declared snow emergency shall continue in effect until such time that the city manager declares the emergency to be ended. 
(2)  The city manager shall use reasonable means commensurate with the time and the weather conditions to notify the citizens by website, by publication, by media releases, or by other means a snow emergency declaration. 
(c)  This section shall not allow on-street parking on any street or part of a street on which "no parking" signs are posted on one side of the street. 
(Ord. No. 4-19, § 1, 2-18-19) 
Sec. 70-78. - Violations. 
(a)  A violation of this division is a municipal civil infraction for which a civil fine shall be imposed as provided in section 1-27(e) of this Code. 
(b)  Parking violation notices or municipal civil infraction citations for violations of this division may be issued by any city police officer, police cadet, fire fighter, chief building inspector, building inspector, housing inspector, director of planning/community development/inspections, code enforcement inspector, the city manager, or any other person who the city manager may authorize in writing to issue such parking violation notices or municipal civil infraction citations. 
(1)  A parking violation notice may be placed on or affixed to a vehicle that is parked in violation of this division to notify the owner or driver of the offense. Such notice shall state the date and time of issuance. A notice of violation shall not require payment of any fine or other cost of the violation. 
(2)  A municipal civil infraction citation shall be issued in the same form and manner as for any other parking violation and shall require the same response, appearance, payment of fine and other consequences and actions as any other municipal civil infraction citation. 
(3)  A parking violation notice or municipal civil infraction citation issued pursuant to this subsection shall contain or be accompanied by a statement that failure to move the parked vehicle to comply with the requirements of this division will result in the impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this division. 
(c)  A vehicle parked in violation of this division is a public nuisance per se. 
(d)  If 48 hours has elapsed since a parking violation notice or a municipal civil infraction citation was issued as provided in subsection (b) and the vehicle is still parked or again parked in violation of this division, a city official authorized to issue a parking violation notice or municipal civil infraction citation under subsection (b) may order the impounding of the vehicle so the street can be plowed. 
(e)  Notice of the impounding of the vehicle shall be given in the same manner as for impounding a vehicle under other circumstances in which neither the owner nor operator are present. Towing, storage and other fees related to impounding the vehicle shall be due, payable and collectable from the owner of the vehicle and the operator of the vehicle, jointly and severally, in the same manner as for impounding a vehicle under other circumstances. Any vehicle so impounded shall be released from impound in the same manner as for a vehicle impounded under other circumstances in which the owner or operator were not present or as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(f)  If the city has incurred costs to impound a vehicle as provided in this section, but that vehicle is not so actually removed but is released to the owner or operator prior to such removal, the owner or operator shall pay, in addition to the penalty fixed for such violation, all costs and expenses incurred by the city by reason of the institution of those steps necessary to the removal of that vehicle.

If the requirements and conditions of this Code have been met, the city council shall grant final approval to the plat. 
(c)  Performance guarantee. The city shall require all improvements and facilities to be constructed or, in lieu thereof, a performance guarantee shall be provided to the city before final plat approval. The performance guarantee may be in the form of a cash deposit, irrevocable letter of credit or performance bond, in an amount sufficient to ensure the construction of unfinished improvements and facilities. No reductions in the performance guarantee related to partial completion of improvements or of facilities shall be allowed, unless it is a cash deposit. If any of such improvements are not completed by the completion date specified in an agreement between the city and the developer, the city shall have the right to complete the work, either by city employees or by outside contractors, and draw upon the performance guarantee for payment. No building or occupancy permits shall be issued by the city until all work is completed and approved by the city, except that up to three building permits may be issued for model homes, as per section 74-176. 
(d)  Subsequent approvals; disapproval. Upon the approval of the final plat by the city council, the subsequent approvals shall follow the procedure set forth in the Subdivision Control Act.

DIVISION 5. - DIVISION OF PLATTED LOTS 

Sec. 74-80. - Division of platted lots. 
    The partitioning or dividing of lots, outlots or other parcels of land in a recorded plat within the city is permitted in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(1)  Before division of a platted lot or parcel is made, written application therefor shall be made to the city assessor as follows: 
a.  The application shall be signed by all parties in interest and include the legal description of the parcels for the requested real estate division. 
b.  Two plot plans shall be submitted showing dimensions of the parcels resulting from the proposed division. The city assessor shall have the authority to require that the plot plan is prepared by a registered land surveyor when in the judgment of the city assessor the proposed courses and measurements may be difficult to verify and ascertain. 
c.  The application shall be accompanied by a certificate from the city treasurer showing that the appropriate fee has been paid for all of the parcels resulting from the division and certifying the tax status of the property proposed to be divided. 
(2)  No division of a platted lot or parcel shall be permitted in violation of the Subdivision Control Act or when such division results in more than four resultant parcels. 
(3)  No division of a platted lot or parcel shall be permitted while there remain unpaid real estate taxes on the lot or parcel. 
(4)  Upon submission of proper application, the city assessor may, in accordance with the provisions of this article, permit division of a platted lot or parcel into two, three or four parts when the resulting parcels each satisfy the minimum lot size requirements of the zoning provisions. 
(5)  No division of a platted lot or parcel shall be made which creates a parcel of land not having reasonable access to a public street or dedicated right-of-way. 
(6)  Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship, the board of zoning appeals, may approve division of a platted lot or parcel when resulting parcels are less than the minimum requirements of the zoning code when it is determined that the proposed division would allow the development of the land in such manner as to be compatible with the spirit and purpose of the zoning code or where the property is presently developed and the proposed division creates parcels conforming to existing development and use.

Secs. 74-122-74-175. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - PLANNING STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR LOTS 

Sec. 74-176. - Lot requirements. 
(a)  General description. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision as well as for the type of development and use contemplated. Residential lots shall be of such size as to permit a variety of house types which shall be in general conformance with contiguous development, to provide side yards for desirable access, light, air, privacy and safety from fire hazards, and to provide for setbacks from the street line and allow sufficient space for household purposes. 
(1)  Access. All lots shall abut by their full frontage on a properly dedicated street. Lots, other than corner lots, shall not be permitted to front onto two streets. Backup lots to major thoroughfares are permitted with approval of the planning commission. 
(2)  Width. The minimum width of any residential lot shall be governed by the existing zoning requirements for that district. 
(3)  Depth. No lot shall be less than 120 feet in depth and the depth of a lot shall not exceed a depth to width ratio of two to 21/2 to one except where the planning commission shall deem that there are topographic, boundary or other circumstances unique to the property or lands surrounding it. 
(4)  Area. The width and depth of the lot shall be such that minimum lot areas will be in accordance with the zoning provisions. 
(5)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be provided an extra 20 feet of width sufficient to permit the maintenance of building setback lines on both the front and side street lines in order to protect similar setbacks on both the front and side street which exist or are planned. 
(6)  Backup lots. Lots which back into such features as freeways, arterial streets, shopping centers, or industrial properties, except where there is a marginal access street, unless a secondary access is provided, shall incorporate in the lot depth for buffering purposes an additional 20 feet. 
(7)  Industrial or commercial lots. No lot or parcel zoned as commercial shall be platted that is less than 65 feet in width, and no lot or parcel zoned as industrial shall be platted that is less than 100 feet in width. The minimum depth for commercial lots shall be 150 feet and 200 feet for industrial lots. The area of such lot or parcel shall be sufficient in size as to provide sufficient area for off-street parking and loading in accordance with the requirements of the zoning provisions. 
(8)  Lot division or split. The division of a lot in a recorded plat, shall be in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. Any person desiring a lot split shall deposit the necessary fees as provided in section 74-175. Once the city has granted a preliminary plat (tentative approval) to a plat, no lot splits are allowed within the proposed plat until the plat has received final plat approval and has been recorded. 
(9)  Building and setback lines. Building and setback lines shall conform to the requirements of the city zoning provisions. 
(10)  Side lot lines. Side lot lines shall be arranged in relation to each other so that the building width of the lot will not be reduced to unusable proportions at either the front or rear setback lines. Lot boundaries along sides and rear of lots shall be made up of straight lines. 
(11)  Developer model homes. Once the city has granted preliminary plat final approval to a plat, building permits may be obtained by the developer for up to three model homes, provided that the nearest points of the lot lines of those lots intended for model homes are located within 300 feet of the existing improved public street for access to model home lots, as measured along proposed subdivision streets to model home lots. 
(b)  Uninhabitable areas. Lands deemed by the planning commission to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential purposes, or for uses that may in the judgment of the planning commission increase the danger to health, life or property, or increase the flood hazard. Such lands within a proposed subdivision shall be set aside for other uses, such as parks or other open space. 
(c)  Future arrangements. Where parcels of land are subdivided into unusually large lots (such as when large lots are required for septic tank operations) the parcels shall be arranged, where feasible, so as to allow for resubdividing into smaller parcels in a logical fashion. 
(d)  Division of platted lots. The partitioning or dividing of lots, outlots or other parcels of land in a recorded plat within the city is permitted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(1)  Before division of a platted lot or parcel is made, written application therefor shall be made to the city assessor as follows: 
a.  The application shall be signed by all parties in interest showing the legal description of the parcels from the requested real estate division. 
b.  Two plot plans shall be submitted showing dimensions of the parcels resulting from the proposed division. The city assessor shall have authority to require that the plot plan be prepared by a registered land surveyor when in the judgment of the city assessor the proposed courses and measurements may be difficult to verify and ascertain. 
c.  The application shall be accompanied by a certificate from the city treasurer showing that the appropriate fee has been paid for each of the parcels resulting from the division and certifying the tax status of the property proposed to be divided. 
d.  An opinion of title signed by an attorney at law or a policy of title insurance of current date evidencing that the persons signing the application for division represent all parties interested in the real estate proposed to be divided shall be furnished. 
(2)  No division of a platted lot or parcel shall be permitted in violation of the Subdivision Control Act or when such division results in more than four resultant parcels. 
(3)  No division of a platted lot or parcel shall be permitted while there remain due and unpaid real estate taxes with respect thereto. 
(4)  Upon submission of proper application, the city assessor may in accordance with the provisions of this chapter permit division of a platted lot or parcel into two, three or four parts when the resulting parcels each satisfy the minimum lot size requirements of the zoning provisions. 
(5)  No division of platted lot or parcel shall be made which creates a parcel of land not having reasonable access to a public street or dedicated right-of-way. 
(6)  Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship, the board of zoning appeals, after report and recommendation from the city planning commission, may approve division of a platted lot or parcel when resulting parcels are less than the minimum requirements of the zoning provisions when it is determined that the proposed division would allow the development of the land in such manner as to be compatible with the spirit and purpose of the zoning provisions or where the property is presently developed and the proposed division creates parcels conforming to existing development and use. 
(7)  When division of platted lot or parcel has been approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, such approval shall be noted upon the application which shall be filed with the city assessor. 
(Code 1983, §§ 70.17, 70.23) 
Sec. 74-177. - Block requirements. 
    The size and shape of blocks shall be appropriate for the type of lots and land used proposed. Blocks shall be designed so as to permit good lot orientation, topography, safe street design and economical use of the land, and may be bounded by streets, railroad right-of-way, waterway or other definite barrier. 
(1)  Length. Length of blocks between intersecting streets shall be no less than 500 feet nor more than 1,250 feet unless greater or smaller dimensions are required or accepted by the planning commission during preliminary plat review. 
(2)  Width. A block shall be so designed as to provide two tiers of lots and shall not be less than 240 feet in width, except where lots back into a major thoroughfare, natural feature or subdivision boundary. 
(3)  Nonresidential blocks. Blocks intended for purposes other than residential shall be especially designed for such purposes and shall have adequate provision for off-street parking and loading in accordance with the requirements of the zoning provisions. 
(4)  Block frontage. A block frontage shall mean property abutting on one side of a street and lying between the two nearest intersecting or intercepting streets, or between the nearest intersecting or intercepting street and railroad right-of-way, waterway or other natural topographic boundary. 
(Code 1983, § 70.18) 
Sec. 74-178. - Other planning requirements. 
(a)  Modification of intended use. Wherever property is proposed for subdividing with the intention that it shall have a use different than as zoned, such use shall be stated in an application for an amendment to the zoning or in a separate statement filed with the planning commission. Conformance with the objectives of the land use plan shall be required so as to ensure general uniformity of land uses within blocks and neighborhoods. 
(b)  Use conformance. Property use and area restrictions shall be in accordance with the zoning provisions and the floodplain provisions. 
(c)  Business or commercial lots. Business or commercial lots shall bear a reasonable relation in number to the probable number of families constituting the purchasing power of surrounding tributary area. The planning commission shall recommend the location of business and commercial lots in accordance with the land use plan and zoning provisions. 
(d)  Commercial or industrial modification. Modifications of this chapter must be sought prior to initiation of the platting process and in accordance with section 74-211 and shall be specifically for commercial or industrial developments, including shopping districts, wholesaling areas and planned industrial districts. However, adequate provisions shall be made for off-street parking, buffering, loading areas and traffic circulation. 
(e)  Areas subject to flooding. Any areas which are subject to flooding, inundation by stormwater or within the floodplain of a river, stream, creek or lake, or have inadequate drainage, shall not be platted for any use so as to increase danger to life, health or property. If the planning commission determines that a flood problem does exist, it shall reject all or part of the proposed plat lying within the floodplain or area subject to flooding. Areas of land lying within a floodplain shall require compliance with the Subdivision Control Act and review by the state department of natural resources. The proprietor may show by engineering site plans that a change in the topography will eliminate flooding and shall demonstrate that any planned topographical change will not aggravate the flood hazard beyond the limits of the plat. 
(f)  Public sites and open spaces. Where a site for a park, playground, playfield, school, library, fire station or other public use is deemed necessary by the planning commission to fulfill the objectives of the land use plan, the commission may recommend the reservation of such areas within the development. Reservation of other public open spaces may be required where deemed necessary by the planning commission for preservation of historic sites and scenic areas or for a particular type of development proposed in the subdivision but not anticipated in the land use plan. Dedication of planting strips of buffer parks may be required by the planning commission in areas where they deem it desirable to separate and protect residential subdivisions from adjacent commercial developments, highways, streets and railroads or any obnoxious use. Such strips shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide and shall not be a part of the normal roadway right-of-way or utility easement. 
(g)  Public reserve strips. A one-foot reserve may be required to be placed at the end of dead-end streets which terminate at subdivision boundaries and between half-streets. These reserves shall be deeded in fee simple to the city for future street purposes. 
(h)  Protection of natural features. Due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as large trees, exceptionally fine groves of trees, watercourses, scenic points, historic spots and similar community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision. Earth moving and the removal of trees prior to plat review by the city is strongly discouraged. Provisions shall be made to retain trees within the plat wherever practical.

ARTICLE V. - VARIANCES 

Sec. 74-211. - Recommendation by planning commission; findings of fact. 
    The city planning commission may recommend to the city council a variance from the provisions of this chapter on a finding that undue hardship may result from strict compliance with specific provisions or requirements of the chapter or that application of such provision or requirement is impracticable. The planning commission shall only recommend variances that it deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. In making its findings, as required in this section, the planning commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No variances shall be recommended unless the planning commission makes the following finding of facts: 
(1)  There are such special circumstances or conditions affecting the property that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would clearly be impractical or unreasonable. In such cases, the subdivider shall first state his reasons in writing as to the specific provision or requirements involved and submit them to the planning commission. 
(2)  The granting of the specified variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which the property is situated. 
(3)  Such variance will not violate the provisions of the Subdivision Control Act. 
(4)  The planning commission shall include its findings and the specific reasons therefor in its report of recommendations to the city council and shall also record its reasons and actions in its minutes. 
(5)  Such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the purpose of this chapter and the land use of the city. 
(Code 1983, § 70.20) 
Sec. 74-212. - Topographical; physical limitation. 
    In the case of a proposed subdivision when it can be shown that strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in extraordinary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography, other physical conditions or other conditions which are not self-inflicted, or that these conditions would result in inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of this chapter, the planning commission may recommend to the board of appeals that variance modification or a waiver of these requirements is granted. 
(Code 1983, § 70.21) 
Sec. 74-213. - Planned residential development and cluster subdivision. 
(a)  The developer may request a variance from specified portions of this chapter in the case of a planned residential development or cluster subdivision. If in the judgment of the planning commission such a plan provides adequate public spaces and includes provisions for efficient circulation, light, air and other needs, it shall make findings as required in this section. The planning commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land and existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivisions and the probably effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. The planning commission shall report to the city council whether: 
(1)  The proposed project will constitute a desirable and stable community development; and 
(2)  The proposed project will be in harmony with adjacent areas. 
(b)  Application for the development under this section shall be made in writing and shall be supplemented with maps, plans or other additional data which may aid the planning commission and city council in the analysis of the proposed plat.

ARTICLE III. - ADDITIONAL AND SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS 
DIVISION 1. - PURPOSE 

Sec. 77-66. - Purposes. 
(a)  Before November 1, 2002. Before November 1, 2002, the purpose of this article shall be to regulate the access to and ongoing use of public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers to ensure and protect the public health, safety, and welfare and to exercise reasonable control of the public rights-of-way pursuant to the City Charter, the Michigan Telecommunications Act (Act No. 216 of the Public Acts of 1995, as amended, being MCLA 484.2101 et seq.), other state statutes (including, without limitation, MCLA 247.183), and Article VII, § 29 of the 1963 Michigan Constitution by (1) minimizing disruption of the public rights-of-way by regulating the access to and ongoing use of the public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers and the construction, installation, operation, and use of facilities in the public rights-of-way to provide telecommunication services, (2) ensuring that the city and the public are protected from liability for use of the public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers, (3) providing for the payment of nondiscriminatory permit fees which do not exceed the fixed and variable costs of granting permits and maintaining the rights-of-way used by telecommunications providers, and (4) assisting telecommunications providers in understanding the city's requirements for use of the public rights-of-way and providing a fair and non-discriminatory policy for permitting the use of the public rights-of-way by such providers. 
(b)  After October 31, 2002. The Michigan Metropolitan Extension Telecommunications Rights-of-Way Oversight Act, 2002 PA 48 ("Act 48") is effective November 1, 2002. In order to comply with the requirements of Act 48, the city adopted Ordinance No. 22-02 regarding permits for telecommunications providers issued on or after November 1, 2002, now article II of this chapter of the City Code. However, a number of the city's existing permits and agreements with telecommunications providers for use of the public rights-of-way, dated prior to November 1, 2002, incorporate by reference all or portions of this article. An example is the requirement that telecommunications providers comply with the insurance requirements of section 77-127 of the City Code. Under sections 4(2) and 5(1) of Act 48, those existing permits and agreements continue in force and effect in accordance with their terms and conditions, subject to section 13 (regarding fee modification) and any other applicable sections of Act 48. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article or the City Code, this article shall, after October 31, 2002, therefore remain in effect solely for the limited purpose of applying to those public rights-of-way permits and agreements in existence before November 1, 2002 (except as otherwise provided in Act 48), and for no other purpose. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (b), this article shall have no application to telecommunications providers after October 31, 2002. 
(Ord. No. 26-02, § 2, 11-4-02) 
Sec. 77-67. - Reservation of rights. 
    The issuance of a permit or permits under this article and the access to and use of the public rights-of-way by a telecommunications provider shall not constitute a waiver of or otherwise adversely affect the following reserved rights: 
(1)  Right to require franchise. Article VII, § 29 of the 1963 Michigan Constitution and the City Charter require that all public utilities obtain a franchise to conduct a local business within the city. The applicability of this requirement to telecommunications providers may be challenged under section 102(dd) of the Michigan Telecommunications Act which purports to define telecommunications services as not constituting public utility services. Due to this and other legal and regulatory issues, and to avoid the expense and delay of litigation that may be unnecessary, the city hereby determines that telecommunications providers shall not be required at this time to obtain franchises for the transaction of local business within the city. Telecommunications providers shall be required to obtain and maintain a permit for access to and ongoing use of the public rights-of-way and to otherwise comply with the terms of this article. Such a permit shall not constitute a franchise. The city reserves the right to require telecommunications providers to obtain a franchise in the future to transact local business within the city. 
(2)  Rights regarding takings claim. Certain cable or telecommunications providers have initiated or supported legal proceedings in which they contend that federal law grants them the right to physically occupy the rights-of-way and other property of a municipality for the purpose of providing telecommunications service without compensating the municipality for the use or value of the property so occupied or the cost of acquiring and maintaining such property. Municipalities dispute that claim. The city believes that if such a claim were sustained it would, among other things, constitute an unlawful taking by the United States in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The legal issues involved in such disputes have not been finally decided. The city desires to act on applications for permits granting access to its public rights-of-way at this time rather than wait for determination of these issues, provided this can be done without waiver or loss of any rights of the city or a permittee. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision hereof, a permittee is not precluded by this article from seeking relief from the fee provisions of section 77-111 from any court or agency of competent jurisdiction. If a permittee seeks such relief, the city reserves the right to assert a takings claim and to take all action it deems necessary in support thereof. Neither this article nor the issuance or acceptance of a permit hereunder constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either the city or the permittee in connection with these disputed issues, and the acceptance of a permit constitutes an acknowledgment and agreement thereto by the permittee. 
(3)  Option to obtain consent agreement. The city finds that legislative, legal and regulatory issues in connection with use of the public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers and the resulting potential for litigation and delay are likely to have an adverse impact on the development of a healthy, competitive telecommunications infrastructure in the community. This would be detrimental to the city and its residents as well as to telecommunications providers. The issues affect, among other things, both the cost to telecommunications providers and compensation to the city for the maintenance and use of its public rights-of-way. In order to promote certainty, encourage competition and avoid litigation, the city will, at the request and sole option of an applicant or permittee, consider entering into a consent agreement for use of the public rights-of-way for the provision of telecommunications services on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the city and the telecommunications provider. It is the city's intent that such an agreement would satisfy the requirement for a permit under this article, and would include, among other things, a fee of up to five percent of the applicable gross revenues of the telecommunications provider, which would include the permit fee; an extended term of up to 15 years; authorization to conduct a local business in the city pursuant to Article VII, Section 29 of the 1963 Michigan Constitution; and a covenant to abide by the terms of the agreement as a compromise of disputed issues and uncertain outcomes, notwithstanding the resolution of these legislative, regulatory and legal requirements in the future. A permittee may request a consent agreement at any time. 
(Ord. No. 26-02, § 2, 11-4-02) 
Sec. 77-68. - City Signal; permit. 
    City Signal, Inc. and the city entered into a Right-of-Way Agreement in 1990, which has since been amended, including a 1995 amendment which permitted City Signal (now Brooks Fiber Communications) to use the public rights-of-way to provide local telephone service within the city in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Right-of-Way Agreement, as amended. For purposes of this section, the term "agreement" shall refer to the 1990 Right-of-Way Agreement, as amended. The agreement contains requirements for the use of the public rights-of-way that are substantially similar to the requirements of this article. For purposes of this article, the agreement shall be deemed to satisfy the requirement of a permit under this article and under the Telecommunications Act for the term of the agreement. Any requests of Brooks Fiber Communications for expansion of its telecommunications system shall be considered in accordance with the agreement. Upon expiration of the agreement, Brooks Fiber Communications shall be required to comply with all terms and conditions of this article as it may be amended from time to time.

(d)  Administrative completeness. An application shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of the 90-day permit application review period in section 251(3) of the Telecommunications Act unless and until the application is determined by the city manager to be administratively complete.

If the city manager determines that the application is not administratively complete, the city manager shall so advise the applicant in writing and shall identify the items which must be furnished by the applicant for an administratively complete application. 
(e)  Additional information. The city manager may request an applicant to submit such additional information which the city manager deems reasonably necessary or relevant to review the application.

Each day that a person fails to correct an untrue statement of a material fact or the omission of a material fact necessary to make the information not misleading shall constitute a separate violation of this article.

The city council shall not unreasonably deny an application for a permit. The failure of the city to comply strictly with the procedural requirements of this section 77-110 for the review of permit applications shall not invalidate the decision or proceedings of the city. 
(h)  Conditions. The city council may impose conditions on a permit to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Without limitation, these conditions may include the posting of a bond by the telecommunications provider in an amount which shall not exceed the reasonable cost to ensure that the public rights-of-way are returned to their original condition during and after the telecommunications provider's access and use. 
(i)  Modification. The city council may, in its discretion, grant a modification of a specific requirement of sections 77-112, 77-113, 77-114, or 77-127 of this article if the applicant requests such modification in its application for a permit and if the applicant demonstrates that: (1) there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances which warrant a modification, (2) the modification will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare, and (3) the modification will not impair the intent and purposes of this article and its several sections. The application shall describe the applicant's request for a modification and the reasons for the request with specificity. A modification granted by the city council pursuant to this section shall expire upon the expiration of the permit or earlier if so determined by the city council. A modification shall modify only those requirements expressly set forth in the approval of the city council and shall not modify any other provisions of this article. If a request for a modification is denied by the city council, the telecommunications provider shall comply with all requirements of this article without exception. 
(j)  Waiver. The city council shall grant a waiver of any requirement of this article if an applicant or permittee requests a waiver and the city council finds that 1) unless waived the requirement will prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of the applicant or permittee to provide any telecommunications service within the meaning of section 253(a) of the Federal Telecommunications Act, 47 USC § 253(a), 2) the requirement is not within the scope of any state or local authority referenced in section 253(c) of the Federal Telecommunications Act, 47 USC § 253(c), and 3) the requirement is not necessary to protect the public safety and welfare or safeguard the rights of consumers. A request for a waiver may be included in an application for a permit. A request for a waiver shall include a detailed statement of the facts and circumstances forming the basis for the request. If the request is made in connection with an application for a permit, the provisions of sections 77-110(d) through 77-110(g) shall apply to the request, except that submission of a request for a waiver shall constitute consent that the time periods provided in section 77-110(g) for holding a public hearing and acting on an application are extended by 90 days. Sections 77-110(a), 77-110(c), and 77-110(f) shall apply to a waiver request that is not made in connection with a permit application, and the request may be denied for violation of or failure to comply with any of those provisions. Section 77-110(g) shall also apply to such a request, with the exception of the 75 and 90-day time periods set forth in that section, but the city council may by resolution establish different or additional procedures for conducting the public hearing and acting on the request.

In addition to the non-refundable application fee set forth in section 77-110(c) and any other fees for other permits or authorizations required by the City Code, the permittee shall pay an annual fee in an amount established by ordinance or resolution of the city council. The annual fee may be modified from time to time by ordinance or resolution of the city council. The amount of the annual fee shall not exceed the fixed and variable costs to the city in maintaining the public rights-of-way used by a telecommunications provider unless otherwise permitted by law. The annual fee shall be payable quarterly as follows: 
1st quarter (Jan. 1-March 31) - April 30 
2nd quarter (April 1-June 30) - July 31 
3rd quarter (July 1-Sept. 30) - October 31 
4th quarter (Oct. 1-Dec. 31) - January 31 
When a permit is issued during a calendar year, the annual fee shall be prorated for the balance of the calendar year. In the event that a quarterly payment is not paid when due, the permittee shall pay a late payment charge of the greater of $100.00 or interest at the rate of one percent over the prime rate then charged by NBD Bank and computed monthly. A person who violates this article by failing to obtain a permit shall pay the annual fee plus late payment charges, as required by this section, for the time period in which the violator did not have a permit plus the actual costs of the city in enforcing this article against the person. 
(b)  Option to pay annual fee based upon gross revenues. A permittee, at its option, may elect to pay an annual fee of one percent of its annual gross revenues as set forth below, in lieu of and in full satisfaction of the annual fee established by the city council pursuant to section 77-111(a). Permittees may elect this annual fee option for administrative convenience in computing the fee or for any other reason. 
(1)  An election shall be made within 45 days of applying for a permit or at least 60 days before the start of any calendar year after issuance of a permit. 
(2)  Any election, once made, shall continue in effect until the end of the next three calendar years, such that an election made in a permit application in 1997 would continue in effect through the end of the year 2000. 
(3)  An election shall be made on a form provided by the city. Copies of the form shall be submitted in the manner provided in section 77-110(a). The permittee shall supply all information requested on the form and any additional information that the city manager deems reasonably necessary or relevant, including information on affiliates of the permittee relating to the requirements of sections 77-111(b)(5), 77-111(b)(6), 77-111(b)(7), and 77-111(c). After providing notice and an opportunity to be heard the city may reject or revoke an election for failure to comply with this section 77-111(b)(3). 
(4)  The annual fees shall be paid quarterly by the same due dates as are set forth in Section 77-111(a) above. 
(5)  An election shall apply to all affiliates of a permittee. In making its election, a permittee shall expressly affirm that it has the authority to bind, and does bind, its affiliates to the obligations of this section 77-111(b) including section 77-111(b)(6) and the audit and records provisions of sections 77-111(b)(7) and 77-111(c). 
(6)  For purposes of this section 77-111(b), "gross revenues" is defined in Appendix A. 
(7)  If a permittee or any affiliate of a permittee refuses to pay the fees due under this option or prohibits or effectively prohibits the city from auditing the permittee or its affiliates under section 77-111(c) to verify the accuracy of annual fees, then the city at its option may revoke the election for all or any portion of the time period in question. The annual fees computed under section 77-111(a) shall then become immediately due and payable, less a credit for any sums paid by the permittee or its affiliates, plus the late payment charges set forth in section 77-111(a) and any additional sums due under the last sentence of section 77-111(c). 
(c)  Records. All records (including those of affiliates) reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of annual fees paid by the permittee under either section 77-111(a) or section 77-111(b) shall be made available by a permittee at a location within the city or within 20 miles of the city's boundaries. The city, by itself or in combination with other municipalities, reserves the right to audit any permittee (or any affiliate of a permittee) to verify the accuracy of annual fees paid or to be paid to the city. Any additional amount due the city shall be paid within 30 days of submission of an invoice. If the additional amount due exceeds two percent of the total annual fee which the audit determines should have been paid for a calendar year, the permittee shall pay the city's costs in connection with the audit within 30 days of submission of an invoice. 
(d)  Other payments. The non-refundable application fees and the annual fees established pursuant to this article shall be in addition to any tax, charge, fee, or payment due, or to become due, to the city by a permittee under the City Code or the laws of the State of Michigan. 
(e)  Misleading statements. A person who provides information to the city in connection with any matter under this section 77-111 which contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits a material fact necessary to make the information not misleading shall be in violation of this article, and shall be subject to all remedies for violation of this article and the City Code including, without limitation, rejection or revocation of an election under section 77-111(b) and permit revocation pursuant to section 77-142. Each day that a person fails to correct an untrue statement of a material fact or the omission of a material fact necessary to make the information not misleading shall constitute a separate violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 26-02, § 2, 11-4-02) 
Sec. 77-112. - Duration of permit; renewal. 
    A permit shall remain in effect until December 31 following the fifth anniversary of the issuance of the permit (unless the permit expires pursuant to section 77-113(k) or the permit is earlier revoked pursuant to section 77-142). Applications for renewal of permits shall be filed in the same manner as original applications in section 77-110 and shall be filed with the city not less than 120 days before the expiration of the permit. The city expressly reserves all rights to approve, approve with conditions, or deny applications for permit renewals pursuant to this article and to impose additional conditions on renewed permits. 
(Ord. No. 26-02, § 2, 11-4-02) 
Sec. 77-113. - Permit terms and requirements. 
(a)  Non-exclusive; additional permits. A permit shall be non-exclusive. The city expressly reserves the right to approve, at any time, additional permits for access to and ongoing use of the public rights-of-way by telecommunications providers and to enter into agreements and grant franchises for such access and use. The issuance of additional permits, entry into agreements, or grant of franchises shall not be deemed to amend, modify, revoke, or terminate the terms and conditions of any permits previously issued to telecommunication providers. 
(b)  Expansion requests. A permit approved by the city council shall authorize access to and ongoing use of the public rights-of-way described in the permit, subject to strict compliance with the conditions of the permit, the requirements of this article, and any other applicable requirements of the City Code or applicable state and federal law. The permittee shall not use any public rights-of-way not expressly authorized by the permit. Any use of the public rights-of-way (including any installation, construction, maintenance, repair, or operation of a telecommunication system within the public rights-of-way) to provide telecommunications services shall be performed only as authorized by the permit. A permittee may, however, expand its telecommunications system to public rights-of-ways not described in its permit by obtaining approval of an amended permit from the city. Such approval may be granted in writing by the city manager in response to a written request from the permittee for expansion to specific portions of named public rights-of-way. The city council may establish by resolution a non-refundable application fee for such a request. The city manager may grant, grant with conditions, or deny such request. The city manager shall not unreasonably deny any request. A denial of any request may be appealed to the city council which shall make the final decision. Any expansion into additional public rights-of-way shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the original permit and this article including, without limitation, the application of the annual fee to the expanded public rights-of-way used by the permittee. 
(c)  Construction permit. A permittee shall not commence construction upon, over, across or under the public rights-of-way in the city without first obtaining a construction permit as required under the City Code, as amended, for construction within the public rights-of-way. 
(d)  Lease or use of facilities: overlashing. A permittee shall not lease, sublease, license or otherwise allow the use of wires, conduit, poles or facilities in the public rights-of-way by a person who is required to obtain a permit under section 77-109 of this article or is required by law to obtain the city's permission or consent to transact local business in the city, and who lacks such permit, permission or consent. A permittee shall not allow the property of a third party or non-telecommunications system wires or any other facilities to be overlashed, affixed or attached to any portion of a permittee's telecommunications system; or allow other actions with a similar result without the written consent of the city manager. 
(e)  "As built" maps. Without expense to the city, a permittee shall provide the city with "as-built" maps, records and plans showing its telecommunications system or portions thereof within the city, including those of affiliates used by the permittee, and maps and descriptive information of facilities of other persons used by the permittee. The city manager may waive part or all of this requirement if satisfactory records of the location of the telecommunications system were previously provided to the city. The "as built" maps, records and plans shall be provided within 30 days of the completion of the telecommunications system and any extensions, additions, or modifications to the telecommunications system. In addition to the foregoing, a permittee, without expense to the city, shall, upon 48 hours' notice, give the city access to all "as-built" maps, records, plans and specifications showing its telecommunications system or portions thereof within the city. Upon request by the city, a permittee shall inform the city as soon as possible (but no more than one business day after the request) of any changes from previously supplied maps, records, or plans and shall mark up maps provided by the city so as to show the location of its telecommunications system. 
(f)  No recourse. A permittee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss, cost, expense or damage arising out of the failure of the city to have the authority to grant all or any part of a permit or the authority to grant permission to use all or part of the public rights-of-way. A permittee expressly acknowledges that on accepting a permit it did so relying on its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority of the city. 
(g)  No inducement. By acceptance of a permit, a permittee acknowledges that it has not been induced to obtain the permit by any understanding or promise or other statement, whether verbal or written, by or on behalf of the city or by any third person concerning any term or condition of a permit not expressed in this article. 
(h)  Acceptance of terms and conditions. Permittee acknowledges by the acceptance of a permit that it has carefully read its terms and conditions and does accept all of such terms and conditions. 
(i)  No priority. A permit does not establish any priority of use of the public rights-of-way by a permittee over any present or future permittees or parties having agreements with the city or franchises for such use. In the event of any dispute as to the priority of use of the public rights-of-way, the first priority shall be to the public generally, the second priority to the city, the third priority to the State of Michigan and its political subdivisions in the performance of their various functions, and thereafter as between permittees, other permit holders, parties having agreements with the city, and franchisees, as determined by the city in the exercise of its powers, including the police power and other powers reserved to and conferred on it by the State of Michigan. 
(j)  Future use by city. A permittee acknowledges, by accepting a permit, that it obtains no rights to or further use of the public rights-of-way other than those expressly granted herein. Each permittee acknowledges and accepts as its own risk that the city may make use in the future of the public rights-of-way which a permittee is using or in which a permittee's telecommunications system is located in a manner inconsistent with the permittee's use of such public rights-of-way and that in such event the permittee will not be entitled to compensation from the city. 
(k)  Expiration of permit. Unless the city grants an extension, a permit shall expire one year from the date of issuance unless prior thereto the permittee either (1) commences construction, installation, or operation of its telecommunications system within the public rights-of-way authorized by the permit and diligently pursues completion of construction or installation, or (2) commences use of the public rights-of-way to provide telecommunications services as authorized by the permit.

Sec. 77-114. - Use of public rights-of-way by permittee. 
(a)  No burden on public rights-of-way. A permittee and its contractors and subcontractors and a permittee's telecommunications system shall not unduly burden or interfere with the present or future use of any of the public rights-of-way within the city. A permittee shall erect and maintain its telecommunications system so as to cause minimum interference with the use of the public rights-of-way and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners. Permittee's cables and wires shall be suspended or buried so as to not endanger or injure persons or property in the public rights-of-way. If the city in its reasonable judgment determines that any portion of the telecommunications system constitutes an undue burden or interference, the permittee at its sole cost and expense shall modify its telecommunications systems or take such other actions as the city may determine are in the public interest to remove or alleviate the burden, and the permittee shall do so within the time period established by the city. 
(b)  Restoration of property.

In the event that the permittee, its contractors or subcontractors fail to do so within the time specified by the city, the city shall be entitled to complete the work and the permittee shall reimburse the city for the costs of doing so. 
(c)  Easements. Any easements over or under private property necessary for the construction or operation of a telecommunications system shall be arranged and paid for by the permittee. Any use or intrusion on private property without an easement or other instrument evidencing permission of the property owner shall constitute a trespass by the permittee and a violation of this article. Any easements over or under property owned by the city other than the public rights-of-way shall be separately negotiated with the city. 
(d)  Tree trimming. A permittee may trim trees upon and overhanging the public rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with its telecommunications system. The permittee shall minimize the trimming of trees to trimming only those trees that are essential to maintain the integrity of its telecommunications system. No trimming shall be done in the public rights-of-way without previously informing the city. 
(e)  Pavement cut coordination/additional fees. A permittee shall coordinate all construction work in the public rights-of-way with the city's program for street construction, rebuilding, resurfacing and repair (collectively, "street resurfacing"). A permittee shall meet with the official of the city primarily responsible for the public rights-of-way at least twice per year to this end. 
The goals of such coordination shall be to require a permittee to conduct all work in the public rights-of-way in conjunction with or immediately prior to any street resurfacing planned by the city, and to prevent the public rights-of-way from being disturbed by a permittee for a period of years after such street resurfacing. 
In addition to any other fees or payments required by this article, a permittee shall pay to the city the sum of $1,250.00 for each 50 feet cut into or excavation of any public rights-of-way, or portion thereof, which was subject to street resurfacing within 18 months prior to such cut or excavation. This fee is in addition to and not in lieu of the obligation to restore the public rights-of-way and is in addition to all other fees required by this article or the City Code.

(3)  Portions of its telecommunications system located in conduit, including facilities of others used by a permittee, shall be marked at each manhole with the permittee's name and toll-free telephone number to call for assistance. 
(g)  Compliance with laws. A permittee shall comply with all laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations regarding the installation, construction, ownership and use of its telecommunications system, whether federal, state or local, now in force or which hereafter may be promulgated (including, without limitation, any ordinances requiring the installation of additional conduit when a permittee installs underground conduit for its telecommunications system). Before any installation is commenced, the permittee shall secure all necessary permits, licenses and approvals from all appropriate departments, agencies, boards or commissions of the city or other governmental entity as may be required by law, including, without limitation, all utility line permits and highway permits. A permittee shall comply in all respects with applicable codes and industry standards, including but not limited to the National Electrical Safety Code (latest edition) and the National Electric Code (latest edition). A permittee shall comply with all zoning and land use ordinances and historic preservation ordinances as may exist or may hereafter be amended. 
(h)  Street vacation. If the city vacates or consents to the vacation of public rights-of-way within its jurisdiction, and such vacation necessitates the removal and relocation of a permittee's facilities in the vacated right-of-way, the permittee shall, as a condition of the permit, consent to the vacation and move its facilities at its sole cost and expense when ordered to do so by the city or a court of competent jurisdiction. The permittee shall relocate its facilities to such alternate route as the city, acting reasonably and in good faith, shall designate. 
(i)  Relocation. If the city requests a permittee to relocate, protect, support, disconnect, place underground or remove its facilities because of street or utility work, or other public projects, the permittee shall relocate, protect, support, disconnect, place underground or remove its facilities, at its sole cost and expense, to such alternate route as the city, acting reasonably and in good faith, shall designate. The work shall be completed within the time period designated by the city. 
(j)  Public emergency.

(l)  Use of existing facilities: undergrounding. A permittee shall utilize existing poles, conduits, and other facilities wherever practicable, and shall not construct or install any new, different, or additional poles or other facilities unless expressly authorized by the permit. Where utility wiring is located underground, either at the time of initial construction or subsequent thereto, a permittee's telecommunications system shall also be located underground unless otherwise expressly authorized by the permit. All undergrounding shall be at the sole cost and expense of the permittee. 
(m)  Underground relocation. If a permittee has its facilities on poles of Consumers' Energy Company or another public utility company and Consumers' Energy Company or other public utility company relocates its facilities underground, the permittee shall relocate its facilities underground in the same location at permittee's sole cost and expense.

APPENDIX A-GROSS REVENUES 
    For the purpose of section 77-111(b), "Gross Revenues" means all amounts earned, received or accrued by a permittee and its affiliates in whatever form and from all sources which are in connection with or attributable to the permittee's telecommunications system in city or to the permittee's or its affiliates' provision of telecommunications services within the city. 
(1)  Gross Revenues shall include, but not be limited to, all revenues from or attributable to customers, other carriers, or third parties whether for services, equipment, directories, publications, or otherwise. It shall include revenues of the types generally described in the revenue accounts of the FCC Uniform System of Accounts for Telecommunications Companies as in effect on October 31, 1996, 47 CFR § 32 Subpart D, whether or not the permittee or its affiliates are subject to such system of accounts, including accounts 4999 through 5302 and any cross referenced accounts or sub-accounts which may be established by permittee or its affiliates relating to the preceding account numbers. Gross revenues shall include all services provided by a permittee or its affiliates, whether or not subject to regulation at the federal, state or local level. For transactions with affiliates gross revenues shall be computed in accordance with the principles set forth in 47 CFR § 32.27 as in effect on October 31, 1996, including in particular § 32.27(d), and otherwise at the fair market rate. 
(2)  Gross revenues shall include all amounts received, earned, or accrued during a period regardless of whether (a) received or not in the case of amounts earned or accrued; (b) the amounts are to be paid in cash, in trade, or by means of some other benefit to the permittee or its affiliates; (c) the goods or services with which the revenue is associated are provided at cost or the revenue amount can be matched against an equivalent expenditure; (d) the amounts are characterized, separately identified, or accounted as being for goods, services, or fees to be paid to units of government or government agencies; or (e) the amounts are initially recorded or received by the permittee or by an affiliate. However, gross revenues shall exclude uncollectible accounts during the period, computed on a fair basis consistently applied. 
(3)  Gross revenues shall be computed at the level where first received from an entity not in any way affiliated with the permittee and shall not be net of (a) any operating expense; (b) any accrual, including without limitation, any accrual for commissions; or (c) any other expenditure. 
(4)  Revenues from customers shall be allocated to the city based upon whether or not the location being provided service pursuant to the permit is located in the city and not by any other allocation method. Revenues from non-switched telecommunications services shall be allocated to the city as set forth in Appendix A-1. 
(5)  Revenues whose source cannot be identified with a specific customer or city shall be allocated to the city based upon the percentage of customers in the City compared to the number of customers served by that portion of permittee's telecommunications system (including portions outside the city) to which such revenues are reasonably attributable. 
APPENDIX A-1 
ALLOCATION OF REVENUE FROM NON-SWITCHED TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
SERVICES 
    Gross revenues from non-switched telecommunications services shall be allocated to the city as follows: 
a.  For purposes of this Appendix A-1, "non-switched telecommunications services" means the two-way transmission of high speed digital voice, data and (for such applications as teleconferencing) video signals (i) to carry interexchange traffic between long distance carrier points-of-presence; (ii) to interconnect user locations to interexchange carrier points-of-presence; and (iii) to interconnect user locations. 
b.  If all the locations of a given customer receiving service from the permittee are in the city, gross revenues shall include all revenues received from or imputed to that customer. 
c.  If any but not all of the locations of a given customer receiving service from the permittee are in the city, the revenues attributable to the city shall be computed separately for each service taken by the customer. For each separate service taken the revenues attributable to the city are all revenues received from or imputed to that service times a fraction whose numerator is the number of locations of the customer within the city taking that service and whose denominator is all the customer's locations taking that service. 
d.  If (such as with an interexchange carrier which contracts for capacity from the permittee so as to connect with its customers through the permittee's telecommunications system) a customer uses the permittee's telecommunications system to connect to third parties, such third parties shall be treated as customers (or customer locations, as the case may be) for purposes of this provision and revenue attribution thereunder. "Interexchange carrier" means a person who provides interexchange telecommunications service, commonly called a long distance carrier (Sprint, MCI and AT&T are examples), and typically deemed a carrier under the Federal Communications Act of 1934 or amendments thereto. 
e.  The different services taken by customers shall correspond with the classes of service offered by the permittee. 
f.  Examples of the preceding computations are as follows: 
Example 1 
A customer leases a 56 kbps data channel for $5,000.00/month which serves/may be accessed by one customer location each in Municipality A, Municipality B, and Municipality C. $1,666.00/month is gross revenues from Municipality A ( 1/3 times $5,000.00). 
Example 2 
A customer leases three T-1 telephone lines @ $400.00/month to connect to MCI. Gross revenues from Municipality A are computed separately for each line as follows: 
The first connects a location in Municipality B to an MCI point of presence in Municipality A. $200.00/month is the gross revenues from Municipality A for this service (1/2 times $400.00). 
The second connects a location in Municipality A to the same MCI point of presence. All $400.00 is gross revenues from Municipality A for this service. 
The third connects a location in Municipality C to a different MCI point of presence, located in Municipality D. There are no gross revenues from Municipality A for this service (but there would be gross revenues of $200.00 each in Municipality C and Municipality D). 
Example 3 
Sprint, an interexchange (long distance) carrier, leases a large amount of capacity from the permittee for $50,000.00/month so that persons desiring to use its services may connect with it directly and not have to go through the local Ameritech central office. Sixteen customers take advantage of this service, comprising 42 locations, of which 28 locations are in Municipality A. Sprint's point of presence is also in Municipality A. 
$41,667.00 is gross revenues from Municipality A as follows: 
$25,000.00 (half of the $50,000.00) is included because all the circuits (wherever the customer is located) connect to the point of presence in Municipality A, i.e.-each customer circuit is composed of two locations (one at the customer, one at Sprint), one of which is in Municipality A. 
$16,667.00 ( 28/42 of $25,000.00) because the other half of the $50,000.00 is attributable to the specific customer locations being connected to Sprint, of which 28 out of 42 are in Municipality A. 
Secs. 77-160-77-200. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - VIDEO SERVICE PROVIDER RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 77-201. - Purpose. 
(a)  Under the Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act, video service providers may obtain a franchise to provide video services in municipality using a standardized, uniform form of franchise agreement established by the MPSC. This form includes the right to use the public right-of-way to provide such service but does not contain right-of-way management and related provisions. 
(b)  Municipality's cable television consent agreement with its current cable operator predates the Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and has right-of-way management and related provisions. However, that Act states that as of January 1, 2007, "any provisions" of such an agreement "that are inconsistent with or in addition to" the standardized, uniform form of franchise agreement established by the MPSC "are unreasonable and unenforceable by the franchising entity." 
(c)  Telecommunications providers who obtain a standardized, uniform form of franchise agreement generally will have previously obtained from municipality a permit under the Metro Act to construct and maintain their telecommunications facilities in the public right-of-way. Such Metro Act permits set forth the terms and conditions for such right-of-way usage, standard forms of such permits were agreed to in a collaborative process between municipalities and providers that was initiated by the MPSC, and such standard forms have since been approved by the legislature and the MPSC. 
(d)  Because telecommunications providers typically provide video services over combined video and telecommunications facilities, such Metro Act permits generally provide adequate public right-of-way related protections for municipality and the public when such providers are providing video services. 
(e)  Other video service providers, in particular new providers or existing cable operators, may not have a Metro Act permit issued by municipality. 
(f)  The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized, uniform franchise agreement require video service providers with such an agreement to comply with all valid and enforceable local regulations regarding the use and occupation of the public right-of-way in the delivery of video services, including the police powers of the franchising entity, and makes such right-of-way usage subject to the laws of the State of Michigan and the police powers of the franchising entity. 
(g)  The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized, uniform franchise agreement state that franchising entities shall provide video service providers with open, comparable, nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral access to the public right-of-way, and may not discriminate against a video service provider for the authorization or placement of a video service or communications network in the public right-of-way. 
(h)  The Michigan Constitution reserves reasonable control of their highways, streets, alleys and public places to local units of government, which may exercise such authority through the use of their police powers. 
(i)  The purpose of this article is to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare and exercise reasonable control over the public right-of-way by regulating the use and occupation of such rights-of-way by video service providers who lack a Metro Act permit from municipality. This article does so by setting forth terms and conditions for such usage and occupation from the forms of Metro Act permit approved by the MPSC and approved by the legislature in Section 6(1) of the Metro Act, thus providing open, comparable, nondiscriminatory, and competitively neutral access to the public right-of-way and not discriminating against a video service provider for the authorization or placement of a video service or communications network in public right-of-way.

Sec. 78-162. - Definitions.

(c)  Charge against person. The costs of an emergency response shall be a charge against the person liable for the costs under this article. The charge constitutes a debt of that person and is collectible by the city for incurring those costs in the same manner as in the case of an obligation under a contract, expressed or implied. 
(d)  Cost recovery schedule. The city council shall from time to time adopt resolutions that set forth a schedule of the costs incurred in making an emergency response. It shall be presumed that the costs listed in this schedule are the true costs incurred by the city and represent the "costs of an emergency response." This schedule shall be available to the public from either the city clerk or the police department. 
(e)  Billing. The chief of police or the chief's agent may, within 30 days of receiving a complete list of itemized costs of an emergency response, submit a bill for these costs by first class mail or personal service to the person liable for the costs. The bills shall require full payment in 30 days from the date of service. 
(f)  Failure to pay; procedure to recover costs. Any failure by the person described in this article as liable for the costs of an emergency response, to pay the bill within 30 days of service shall be considered a default. In case of default, the city may commence civil suit to recover the costs, plus any additional costs or expenses allowed by law.

The city may use the test results from a COD analysis as an alternative means of surcharging for BOD. Surcharges for compatible pollutants shall be calculated as follows: 

_____ 
(b)  The city shall collect at least three composite or grab samples quarterly and base the surcharge cost upon such samples. If the director determines based on information made available to the director that more frequent sampling may more accurately provides a basis for the amount of surcharges, the city, may collect more frequent sample and base the surcharge on the more frequent sampling. If the user does not agree with the sampling or testing method of the city, the city may agree to an independent company, approved by the city, taking such samples, at the user's expense, under conditions and standards as determined by the city. The surcharge shall be calculated and billed quarterly by the city unless another time period is designated by the director (e.g., monthly). City employees and officials shall not be involved directly or indirectly with any company performing tests on any samples where such tests are to be used by the city. 
(c)  A violation of a wastewater discharge permit is a municipal civil infraction. The city council may from time to time by resolution establish penalties for violation of a user's wastewater discharge permit. Penalties may be based on either a grab, composite or in the case of pH, on the basis of results from a pH recorder. Penalties will be assessed for any sample exceeding limits established from time to time by a resolution of the city council. Unless otherwise specified in such a resolution, any user who violates any provision of this article, or permits issued under this article, shall be penalized in an amount not to exceed $10,000.00 (or the maximum penalty allowed under state law). Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Payment of penalties does not constitute compliance with the permit. In addition to these penalties, (i) those violating this article shall be subject to all other consequences of such violations as provided in this article and, (ii) continued, habitual or gross violations or those caused by negligence or failure to install and operate property pretreatment units will be enforced under sections 86-165, 86-167 and 86-297.

Sec. 86-163. - Delinquent accounts. 
    If any amounts owed to the city for the use of the public sewer system are not timely paid as required by this article, other parts of this Code of Ordinances, the terms of any contract, or the terms of any arrangement made with the city to pay such amounts, the city may pursue all remedies available at law or in equity including, to the extent not otherwise precluded or limited by law, one or more of the following: 
(1)  A lawsuit against the property owner or any other person responsible for payment; 
(2)  Suspending, terminating or otherwise discontinuing city sanitary sewer service, water service or both services to the premises; 
(3)  Setting off the unpaid amounts against any amounts owed by the city to the owner of the premises or other responsible party; or 
(4)  Certifying such charge to the city assessor who shall assess the charge against the lot or parcel of land upon which is situated the premises served. The assessment shall then be collected or returned in the same manner as real property taxes. 
(5)  The city may also require an escrow deposit against future delinquent payments of such amounts. The deposit may be up to an estimated one-quarter's billing for sanitary sewer service, including any estimated surcharges, late payment fees, and interest. The deposit shall be held in a non-interest bearing escrow account to be used an applied against any amounts due for sanitary sewer service that are not paid when due. The amount used from the escrowed funds will be added to the amounts owed such that the user shall be obligated to maintain that escrow and timely pay all charges for sanitary sewer service in order to preclude use of the remedies provided in this section.

Sec. 86-253. - Wastewater contribution information. 
(a)  All nondomestic users proposing to connect to or to contribute to the sewage works shall submit information on their processes and wastewater to the city before connecting to or contributing to the sewage works. All existing industrial users connected to or contributing to the sewage works shall submit this information upon request of the director. At least 90 days prior to the commencement of discharge, new sources and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the information in this section. New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in subsections (a)(4) and (a)(7) of this section. The information submitted shall be sufficient for the city to determine the impact of the user's discharge on the sewage works and the need for pretreatment. Any statements or information submitted in connection with this section shall be signed by an authorized representative of the company. The user shall submit, in units and terms appropriate for evaluation, the following information: 
(1)  Name of the operator and owners, facility name, address and location. 
(2)  A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility. 
(3)  SIC number according to the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, Bureau of the Budget, 1972, as amended. 
(4)  Measurement of pollutants. For industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass where required by standard or control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. 
a.  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The city may waive flow proportional sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases samples must be obtained through time proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
b.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section. 
c.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula. 
d.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the director determines that the 40 CFR 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties approved by the director. 
e.  If this report is a baseline report, the city may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling; the methods of analysis; and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(5)  Average rate of production. 
(6)  Time and duration of contribution. 
(7)  Average daily and maximum wastewater flow rates from all regulated process streams and other waste streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula, including daily, monthly and seasonal variations, if any. The city may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows were justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
(8)  Industries identified as significant industries or subject to the national categorical pretreatment standards or alternative discharge limits or those required by the city must submit site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans and details to show all sewers, sewer connections, and appurtenances by the size, location and elevation. For industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards, a schematic process diagram identifying the location of points of discharge from all regulated processes as well as the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated point of discharge shall also be submitted. 
(9)  Description of activities, facilities and plant processes on the premises including all materials or pollutants which are or could be discharged. 
(10)  The user shall submit a certification statement reviewed and signed by an authorized representative indicating whether or not the pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance and/or additional pretreatment is required by the industrial user to meet applicable pretreatment standards. 
(11)  If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the user will provide the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. The following conditions shall apply to this schedule: 
a.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment facilities required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards. 
b.  No such increment shall exceed nine months. 
c.  No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the director including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress; the reason for delay; and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such increments of progress. 
(12)  Type and amount of raw materials. 
(13)  Number and type of employees, hours of operation of plant and proposed or actual hours of operation of pretreatment system. 
(14)  Location of sampling manhole. 
(15)  Any other information as may be deemed by the city to be necessary to evaluate the impact of the discharge on the sewage works. 
(b)  Any industrial user must inform the appropriate authorities upon discharge of hazardous waste as follows: 
(1)  Any industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of the constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. Industrial users shall provide this notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste commences. Any notification under this section need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements in this article. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous waste in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 40 CFR 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous wastes or listing any additional substances as hazardous wastes, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substances within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under subsection (b) of this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous waste generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(c)  All users shall be required to maintain records of wastewater contribution information for a period of at least three years.

    Upon the promulgation of any national categorical pretreatment standards, alternative discharge limits or other federal or state limitations, for a particular industrial subcategory, the pretreatment standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for uses in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article and shall be considered part of this article. Compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate subpart of 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N. Direct dischargers with NPDES permits modified or reissued to provide a variance pursuant to section 301(i)(2) of the Act shall be required to meet compliance dates set in any applicable categorical pretreatment standard. Existing sources which become industrial users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be considered existing industrial users except where such sources meet the definition of new source as defined in section 86-131. New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and shall start up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. The director shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements. 
(Ord. No. 21-18, § 1, 12-17-18) 
Sec. 86-294. - Equivalent mass and concentration limits. 
    When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the city may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The city shall calculate equivalent mass-per-day limitations and equivalent concentration limitations in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c)(2)-(4) and 40 CFR 403.6(c)(6)-(7). Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with these sections shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of section 307(d) of the Act and this article. Industrial users shall comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards for which the equivalent limitations were derived. Any industrial user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production based standard shall notify the city within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the city of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its wastewater discharge permit that were based on the original estimate of the long-term average production rate. 
(Ord. No. 21-18, § 1, 12-17-18)

(Ord. No. 21-18, § 1, 12-17-18) 
Sec. 86-301. - Procedures for prevention of accidental and slugload discharges; notification if discharge occurs. 
    Users shall provide protection from slugload discharges or accidental discharges of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. If deemed reasonably necessary by the director or as otherwise required by state or federal laws or regulations, the city may require the user to implement procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. Facilities to prevent slugload discharges or accidental discharges of prohibited material shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. Detailed information and plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection including descriptions of discharge practices and stored chemicals shall be submitted to the city for review and approval by the city before construction. All users shall complete construction of required facilities within the time period specified by the director. New users shall not be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until approved accidental discharge facilities have been constructed. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article or from otherwise meeting requirements of this article. In the case of a slugload discharge or an accidental discharge, the user shall immediately notify the director of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions. Accidental discharge shall also include any discharge where such discharge has the possibility of entering into any waters of the state. 
(1)  Within five working days following a slugload or accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to correct the situation and to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, penalty, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the sewage works treatment process, nor any other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(2)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees of the persons to notify in the event of an accidental discharge. Employers shall advise all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur of the emergency notification procedure. 
(Ord. No. 21-18, § 1, 12-17-18) 
Sec. 86-302. - Upset to constitute affirmative defense. 
(a)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (b) of this section are met. 
(b)  An industrial user wishing to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the causes of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken or planned to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(c)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(d)  In the usual exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the city's enforcement personnel should review any claims that noncompliance was caused by an upset. No determinations made in the course of the review constitute final city action subject to judicial review. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(e)  The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(Ord. No. 21-18, § 1, 12-17-18) 
Sec. 86-303. - Bypass. 
    For the purpose of this section, bypass shall mean the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of the industrial user's treatment facility. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to subsections (1) and (2) of this section. 
(1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city, if possible, at least ten days before the date of the bypass. An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the city within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(2)  Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage. Severe property damage shall mean substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgement to prevent a bypass which occurred during periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; 
c.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (1) of this section. 
(3)  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (2) of this section.

Sec. 90-100 TITLE
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the City of Wyoming Zoning Ordinance. Within the following text it may be referred to as the Ordinance.
Sec. 90-101 PURPOSE
This Ordinance is intended: to insure that uses of land shall be situated in appropriate locations and relationships; to limit the inappropriate overcrowding of land and congestion of population and transportation systems and other public facilities; to facilitate adequate and efficient provision of transportation systems, sewage disposal, water, energy, education, recreation, and other public service and facility needs and; to promote public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Wyoming.
Sec. 90-103 LEGAL BASIS
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, Public Act No. 110 of 2006 (MCL 125.3101 et seq.).
Sec. 90-104 SCOPE & INTERPRETATION
(1) Zoning applies to every building, structure or use. No building, structure or land shall be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, moved, placed, reconstructed, extended, enlarged or altered, except in conformity with this chapter.
(2) Uses not expressly permitted under this article are prohibited in all districts. Uses that are contrary to federal law, state law or local ordinance are prohibited. (Ord. No. 11-10, § 1, 12-6-10)
(3) In its interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, or general welfare. It is not intended by this Ordinance to impair or interfere with any other existing provision of law or Ordinance. However, where this Ordinance imposes a greater restriction than is required by existing Ordinance or by rules, regulations, or permits, the provisions of this Ordinance shall control.
(4) Except as otherwise noted in this Ordinance, nothing in this Ordinance shall be interpreted or construed to give rise to any permanent vested rights in the continuation of any particular use, district, zoning classification, or any permissible activities therein; and all rights are hereby declared to be subject to such subsequent amendment, change or modification hereof as may be necessary to the preservation or protection of public health, safety, and welfare.

Whenever any provision of this chapter is in conflict with any other provision of the Code, unless otherwise determined by the city council, the more restrictive provision shall govern.
(Code 1983, § 60.4)
Sec. 90-106 SEVERABILITY
If any portion of this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be found to be invalid by a court, such invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions or applications of the portion which can be given effect without the invalid portion or application, providing such remaining portions are not determined by the court to be inoperable, and to this end all portions of this chapter are declared to be severable.
Sec. 90-107 INTERPRETATIONS
If the meaning of this chapter is unclear in a particular circumstance, then the individual or body charged with interpreting or applying ordinance shall construe the provision to carry out the intent of the ordinance, if the intent can be discerned from other provisions of the ordinance or law.

Sec. 90-200 CONSTRUCTION OF LANGUAGE
(1) All words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common preferred use of the language; but technical words and phrases that may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law shall be construed and understood according to that peculiar and appropriate meaning.
(2) The definitions contained in this article are for the purposes of this chapter.
(3) The word "shall" is always mandatory and not discretionary. The word "may" is permissive.
(4) The terms "ordinance" and "act" shall be understood to include the term "as amended" where the context is appropriate.
(5) The particular shall control the general. For terms used in this chapter the use of a general term shall not be taken to be the same as the use of any other specific term. For example, a "drugstore," as used in this chapter, shall not be interpreted to be the same as a "retail business" since it is listed as a separate and distinct use.
(6) Words used in the present tense shall include the future; words used in the singular number shall include the plural; and the plural the singular, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
(7) A "building" or "structure" includes any part thereof.
(8) The word "person" includes an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an incorporated association, or any other similar entity. A masculine term shall include the feminine version of the term and vice versa.
(9) Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, the conjunctions noted below shall be interpreted as follows:
(a) "And" indicates that all connected items, conditions, provisions, or events shall apply.
(b) Or indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions or events may apply separately or in combination.
(c) "Eitheror" indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions or events shall apply separately, not in combination.
(10) Computing the number of days, the first day is excluded and the last day is included.

(11) All measurements and calculations shall be to the nearest integer, unless otherwise specified herein; however, fractional measurements that are less restrictive than stated minimums or maximums are not allowed. Calculations that yield a fractional result of exactly one-half (½, or .5) shall be rounded upwards to the next integer.
(12) The phrase "used for" includes "arranged for," "intended for," "occupied for," and "maintained for."
(13) Whenever a word or term defined hereinafter in the text of the ordinance, its meaning shall be construed as defined herein. Words or terms not herein defined shall have the meaning customarily assigned to them.
(14) Unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary, where an illustration accompanies any item in this chapter, the written text shall have precedence over said illustration.
(15) The terms "abutting" or "adjacent to" include property along the lot lines of the subject site including those of another community, but do not include lands separated by a public street right-of-way.

and this Code. Facilities may not exceed the height of the existing structure by more than 30 feet. New, freestanding communication towers are allowed as special uses in certain districts, as provided in this Code. Structural plans must be approved by the building inspector, based upon applicable regulations. The following additional requirements shall apply:
(a) Towers shall be installed on legal lots for the zoning district in which they are located, either as a principal use, or as an accessory use related to the principal use.
(b) Towers must be set back from all lot lines a distance equal to the height of the facility.
(c) The applicant must demonstrate that the tower is necessary at the proposed site in order to satisfy its function in applicant's grid system.
(d) The applicant must provide written documentation that a good faith effort has been made to locate the antenna on an existing structure within one-half mile of the proposed site, if any, and that applicant was denied reasonable use of the structure for antenna placement. As used in this subsection, a "good faith effort" includes, but is not limited to, contacting the owners of structures within these parameters to determine whether the applicant could use the structure for its purpose.
(e) The owner or operator of a tower shall agree to permit other communications service providers, including local government agencies, to use the tower, upon reasonable terms and conditions (e.g., sharing the cost of constructing, maintaining and operating the facility, along with the reimbursement for fees and costs incurred to obtain approval of the facility's location on the site).

If the planning commission has reason to anticipate the future use of the proposed facility by another government agency or wireless communication provider, the tower must be engineered and constructed to support additional antennae.
(f) The proposed tower must be structurally sound and be constructed in accordance with all federal, state or local standards and be capable of use in accordance with the requirements of this section. Facilities shall be inspected annually by the owner or operator and, in the event any safety standard is no longer met, the city shall be immediately notified.
(g) The tower's height must not exceed that minimally required to function in accordance with federal, state and local requirements.
(h) The Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority or any successor agency must approve the tower site plan and proposed tower for compliance with height and lighting requirements dictated by the Gerald R. Ford International Airport Zoning Ordinance and Federal Aviation Administration or other applicable standards.

Sec. 90-501 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
(1) Site plan review is required to provide city staff and the planning commission with the opportunity to review the proposed use of a site in relation to surrounding uses, planned future development, accessibility, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, roadway traffic, spatial relationships, off-street parking, public utilities, general drainage, environmental characteristics and other site elements which may affect the public health, safety, and general welfare, and its relationship and harmony with city ordinances and plans.
(2) Further, it is the intent of this article to require the eventual upgrade of redevelopment sites that do not conform with current standards of this article and ensure that the arrangement, location, design and materials within a site are consistent with the character of the city and the goals and design guidelines in the City of Wyoming Land Use Plan.
(Ord. No. 3-12, § 8, 3-5-12)
Sec. 90-502 USES REQUIRING SITE PLAN/SKETCH PLAN REVIEW
(1) There shall be two levels of site plan review:
(a) Sketch plan. A sketch plan level review is required for certain activities of a less intensive nature. Small-scale expansions of structures and change of uses may be eligible for sketch plan review.
(b) Full site plan review. A full site plan level review is required for all new nonresidential uses and multiple-family residential uses.
(c) Full site plan and sketch plan reviews and approvals shall be required for the activities or uses listed in table 90-502, plan review requirements.
(d) Specific site plan detail requirements, and review processes, for particular land uses identified within this ordinance (i.e., wind energy turbines, communication towers, auto plant development), shall have precedent over the more general regulations of this article.
(2) Approvals are obtained from the planning commission (PC), city council (CC), city planner (CP), or building official (BO) depending upon the nature of the proposal. Site plan reviews by the city planner or building official shall be administrative.

Sec. 90-503 SKETCH PLAN/FULL SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS
Sketch plans and full site plans and must be submitted in accordance with the following procedures and requirements:
(1) Submittal. The application shall be submitted by the owner of an interest in the land for which site plan approval is sought, or the designated agent of the owner. The application shall include a complete sketch plan or full site plan that includes the information required by section 90-1003. The plans shall be of the required size, format, and of the appropriate number, as set by city policy. The applicable review fees shall also be provided as set by the city council. Applicants are encouraged to obtain a pre-application conference with the city planner for the purpose of determining the approval type and process that shall be followed to obtain project approval. The meeting is a nonbinding and informal review of the proposal. It is intended to provide information to the applicant on the procedures, ordinance requirements, and policies of the city. It does not confer upon the applicant any development approvals or other rights.
(2) Administrative review by the city planner or building official. The city planner or building official shall conduct administrative reviews, with consideration by other city departments or agencies, as appropriate. Following the administrative review, the applicant shall revise the plan as necessary and provide revised plans for follow-up review. Once the city planner or building official determines the plans to be compliant, the plans shall be certified as approved with any conditions noted. The applicant shall have the right of appeal to the planning commission from any decision made on the sketch/ full site plan by the city planner or building official.
(3) Planning commission review.
(a) Application and review. Where planning commission review is required, the planning commission shall review the plans, together with the report and recommendations from staff, and any other agencies, as appropriate.
(b) Planning commission action. The planning commission shall make a determination based on the requirements and standards of this article to approve, approve with conditions, postpone a decision, or deny approval of the plan. If approved, any conditions shall be made part of the motion, and documented in the planning commission's minutes.
(4) Recording of site plan review action. The site plan shall be revised to reflect any conditions of approval and resubmitted to the planning department. The city planner shall review the revised plans for compliance with conditions of site plan approval. The city planner may grant final approval if he finds the site plan to properly address the required revisions and conditions and otherwise complies with this article. Copies of the approved site plan will be filed with the planning department, building department, and the engineering department.

(5) Board of zoning appeals. In any instance where the need for a variance from the board of zoning appeals is determined to be required, the plan review process shall be completed prior to BZA review.
(6) Building permit. An application for a building permit may be submitted at any time during the sketch/full site plan review process. A building permit shall not be issued until final approval of the site plan, sketch plan or special use, and any other plans as required. The applicant is responsible for obtaining all other applicable federal, state, county, city or utility permits. These permits shall be provided to the appropriate city departments prior to the issuance of building permits and before substantial development activity takes place.
(7) Expiration. If construction encompassing a minimum of 25 percent of the gross floor area of new buildings or additions, or site development areas involving no building construction, has not commenced within two years of site plan approval, approval becomes null and void and a new application for site plan review shall be required. The applicant may request, and the appropriate reviewing authority may grant, up to a one-year extension, provided a written request is received prior to the expiration date.
(8) Property maintenance. The owner of a property shall be responsible for maintaining the property on a continuing basis as required by the approved site plan until the property is razed, until new zoning regulations supersede the regulations upon which site approval was based, or until a new site plan approval is sought. Changes to the property that are determined by the city to be detrimental or inconsistent with the original design authorization shall require approval of the city under the requirements of this article. This maintenance requirement includes healthy landscaping, walls, fences, pavement, pavement markings, signs, building exterior, drainage facilities and all other elements of a site. Any property owner who fails to maintain a property in compliance with an approved site plan shall be deemed in violation of this article and a nuisance per se.
(Ord. No. 3-12, § 8, 3-5-12)
Sec. 90-504 SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
The data listed in table 90-504, site plan submittal requirements, shall be included with and as part of the site plan(s) or sketch plan(s) submitted for review unless waived in writing by the city planner or building official.

(d) The traffic impact analysis shall be developed in accordance with accepted practices in Michigan. The preparation shall be conducted by a qualified traffic engineering professional. Traffic count data shall be collected using accepted practices and shall not be over two years old. The forecasts shall be based on the data and procedures outlined in the most recent edition of trip generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). The applicant may use other commonly accepted sources of data or supplement the standard data with data from at least three projects in similar locations in Michigan.
(e) The traffic study shall provide at least three levels of analysis: current conditions, project impacts (projects permitted under requested zoning + existing), and future conditions (existing + project traffic + background traffic growth + traffic associated with other developments in the immediate area approved or under construction). The city may require corridor level computer modeling when multiple uses or projects are being considered.
(f) Any trip reduction for pass by trips, transit, ridesharing, other modes, internal capture rates, etc. shall be based both on ITE findings and documented survey results acceptable to the city. The community may elect to reduce the trip reduction rates used.
(g) The report shall evaluate the design of proposed access including: any sight distance limitations, proper spacing, and relationship to other access points, and potential for shared access facilities.
(h) The study shall outline mitigation measures and demonstrate any changes to the level of service achieved by these measures. Any alternatives or suggested phasing of improvements should be described. The mitigation measures may include items such as roadway widening, need for bypass lanes or deceleration tapers/lanes, changes to signalization, use of access management techniques, or a reduction in the proposed intensity of use. Proposed mitigation measures must be acceptable to the applicable road agency (city, Kent County, or MDOT). The responsibility, timing of roadway improvements, and relationship to available right-of-way shall be described.
(i) The requirement for a traffic impact study, or the specific study elements required may be waived or modified by the city. Reasons for the waiver or modification shall be documented. Factors to be considered include:
1. Roadway improvements are scheduled which are expected to mitigate any impacts associated with the proposed project.
2. The existing level of service is not expected to be significantly impacted by the proposed project due to specific conditions at this location.

Expansions to nonconforming buildings shall be as provided for in section 90-903.
(3) Privacy. The site design shall provide reasonable visual and sound privacy for dwelling units located adjacent to the site. Walls, berms, barriers and landscaping shall be used, as appropriate, for the protection and enhancement of property and the privacy of adjacent uses.
(4) Preservation of natural areas. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as practicable, by strategic building placement, minimizing tree and soil removal, alteration to the natural drainage courses, and the amount of cutting, filling and grading. Insofar as practical, natural features and the site topography shall be incorporated into the proposed site design.
(5) Drainage. Stormwater management system and facilities shall preserve natural drainage characteristics and enhance the aesthetics of the site to the maximum extent possible, and shall not substantially reduce or increase the natural retention or storage capacity of any wetland, water body, or watercourse, or cause alterations which could increase flooding or water pollution on or off the site.

Sec. 90-510 PROCEDURES FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
The city has established provisions for creating planned unit developments (PUD's) in order to permit flexibility in the regulation of land development; encourage innovation in land use and variety in design, layout, and type of structures constructed; achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy and the providing of public services and utilities; encourage useful open space; and provide better housing, employment and shopping opportunities particularly suited to the needs of the residents of the city.
(1) Objectives. The objectives of PUD's are to:
(a) Provide opportunities for development where potential land use conflicts make traditional zoning techniques inadequate for protection from adverse impacts;
(b) Preserve existing on-site natural features while allowing development at the maximum permissible density;
(c) Encourage the use of creative, imaginative and innovative approaches to land development; and
(d) Require the developer to utilize architectural standards, quality building materials and site amenities when deemed appropriate.
(2) Administration. Administrative procedures are as follows:
(a) Preapplication consultation. Communication between the developer and city staff prior to PUD application is encouraged. The meeting is intended to ensure that the developer is aware of the community's standards and posture on PUD's. Such consultation should occur prior to any extensive outlay of funds on the part of the developer, since the meeting is intended to encourage cooperation and mutual understanding between the applicant and the city. The developer should submit a preliminary sketch plan outlining general existing site characteristics, external and proposed internal land uses, and special relationships between plan features. To obtain information, the developer shall confer with planning department staff and other appropriate department heads in connection with the application for the PUD. The planning staff will offer advice to the applicant regarding his proposal and aid in his understanding of these requirements.

(a) Two or more buildings or uses may use a common parking facility; provided the total number of parking spaces is equal to the required number of spaces for all of the uses computed separately. Cumulative parking requirements for mixed-use developments or shared facilities may be reduced in conjunction with site plan approval where it can be determined that one or more of the factors listed in subsection (4) below apply.
(b) Parking facilities dedicated to and on the same site as a place of worship may be used to meet not more than 50 percent of the off-street parking requirement for theaters, stadiums, and other places of public assembly, stores, office buildings and industrial establishments lying within 300 feet of the place of worship, provided that the other uses are not normally operating between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Sundays and that the place of worship, through written agreement, makes the spaces available. A copy of this agreement shall be furnished to the city. Should the agreement be voided or expire for any reason, the uses utilizing the parking facility of the place of worship shall provide all required parking spaces in accordance with the requirements of this article, or shall be in violation thereof.
(4) Modification of parking requirements. The parking space requirements may be reduced by no more than 25 percent, as part of the site plan approval, based upon one or more of the following conditions:
(a) Shared parking by multiple uses where there will be a high proportion of multipurpose visits or where uses have peak parking demands during differing times of the day or days of the week. Pedestrian connections shall be maintained between the uses. For separate lots, they shall be adjacent to each other, with pedestrian and vehicular connections maintained between the lots. Shared parking agreements shall be filed with the city planning department after approval.
(b) Expectation of walk-in trade due to sidewalk connections to adjacent residential neighborhoods or employment centers. In allowing a parking space reduction, the site design shall incorporate pedestrian connections to the site and on-site pedestrian circulation providing safe and convenient access to the building.
(c) Availability of other forms of travel such as transit. To qualify, the site design must incorporate transit stops, pedestrian connections to nearby transit stops, or bicycle parking facilities, as applicable.
(d) Where the applicant has provided a parking study, conducted by a qualified professional, that demonstrates that another standard would be more appropriate based on actual number of employees or expected level of customer traffic. Actual counts at a similar establishment provided by the applicant may also be acceptable.

(e) A parking study may be required as part of site plan review to document that any one of the criteria a. through c. above would be met.
(5) Banked parking.
(a) Where a reduction in the number of parking spaces is not warranted but an applicant demonstrates that the parking requirements for a proposed use would be excessive, the site plan review authority may defer ("bank") some of the required parking. The site plan shall designate portions of the site for future construction of the required parking spaces. This banked area shall be maintained in a landscaped appearance and not be located within required greenbelts or parking lot setback areas and shall not be used for any other purpose.
(b) The site plan shall show the area proposed to be banked, with all required site plan elements, but shall indicate with hatching, dashed lines, or other means the area to be banked. The site plan shall include parking space requirements, with the number of spaces required, number proposed at initial construction, and number of spaces banked.
(c) Construction of part or all of the additional spaces designated for the banked parking area may be initiated by the owner or required by the city, based on parking needs or observation of parking deficiencies, and shall require administrative approval of an amended site plan.
(6) Parking lots serving adjacent commercial and industrial uses. A parking lot may be constructed in a different zoning district from the use being served, if approved by the planning commission. A parking lot constructed under this subsection must meet the following requirements:
(a) The area proposed for the parking lot shall be contiguous to, or immediately across a street right-of-way from, the property containing the use to be served. This parking shall not be located across a major thoroughfare.
(b) The proposed parking area shall be intended only to accommodate parking of passenger vehicles serving employees or customers of the use served. Outdoor storage of material or parking of equipment or vehicles other than passenger vehicles of employees or customers is prohibited.
(c) The parking area shall retain the requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. No use, other than accessory parking, shall be permitted upon the lot that is not otherwise permitted in that zoning district.

(d) The parking lot shall conform to the landscaping requirements of section 90-328. More extensive buffering or screening may be required during site plan review, if necessary, to protect adjacent uses, particularly if the lot is located within or adjacent to a residential district.
(7) Required off-street parking spaces. The minimum number of required off-street parking spaces shall be provided and maintained on the premises or as otherwise allowed by this article, on the basis of the following and the specific requirements of table 90-646.

(c) Each 24 inches of bench, pew or similar seating facilities shall be counted as one seat.
(d) Where parking requirements are based upon maximum seating or occupancy capacity, the capacity shall be as determined by the Building Code and the Fire Code.
(e) In order to minimize excessive areas of pavement, which reduces aesthetics and contributes to high rates of stormwater runoff, the minimum parking space requirements shall not be exceeded by more than 20 percent, except as approved by the site plan approval authority. In granting additional spaces, the site plan approval authority shall determine that the parking is needed, based on documented evidence of use and demand provided by the applicant.

Alternative paving materials, such as permeable/grass pavers or porous pavement, may be approved for overflow, seasonal or low use parking areas, based upon the review and recommendation of the city engineer. For storage areas, a substitute for hard-surfaced pavement may be approved during site plan review upon a determination that there are no adverse effects on adjoining properties.
(b) Surface water from parking areas shall be detained on site in accordance with the City of Wyoming Engineering Standards.

Sec. 90-603 DRIVEWAY ACCESS MANAGEMENT
(1) Purpose: The regulations of this section are designed to accomplish the following purposes:
(a) Preserve the capacity of the city's major streets by limiting and controlling the number, location and design of access points and by requiring alternate means of access through shared driveways, service drives, and access via cross streets in certain locations.
(b) Encourage efficient flow of traffic by minimizing the disruption and conflicts between through traffic and turning movements.
(c) Improve safety and reduce the potential for crashes. Figure 90-603-1: Driveway Types and Terms
(d) Avoid the proliferation of unnecessary curb cuts and driveways and, when the opportunities arise, eliminate or reconfigure existing access points that do not conform to the standards of this section.
(e) Implement the recommendations of the City of Wyoming Land Use Plan.
(f) Require longer frontages or wider minimum lot widths than required in underlying zoning districts to help achieve acceptable distances for separation of driveways.
(g) Require coordinated access among adjacent lands where possible.
(h) Avoid the need for unnecessary and costly reconstruction of roadways which disrupts business operations and traffic flow.
(i) Ensure efficient access by emergency vehicles.

2. A traffic impact study determines that additional access is justified without compromising traffic operations along the public street.
3. Two one-way driveways may be permitted where the frontage is at least 125 feet.
(5) Commercial/industrial driveway design.
(a) All commercial/industrial driveways shall be constructed according to the City of Wyoming or MDOT standards, as applicable. In commercial redevelopment areas, these standards shall be complied with to the maximum extent possible.
(b) For high traffic generators, or for commercial/industrial driveways along streets experiencing or expected to experience congestion, two egress lanes may be required.
(c) For a boulevard entrance, a fully curbed island, at least 180 square feet in area, shall separate the ingress and egress lanes. The radii forming the edges on this island shall be designed to accommodate the largest vehicle that will normally use the driveway.
(6) Shared driveways, frontage roads and service roads.
(a) The number of access points may be reduced where it is determined by the site plan review authority that there may be a beneficial effect on traffic operations and safety, while preserving the property owner's right to reasonable access. In this case, a shared commercial/industrial driveway, frontage road or rear service drive connecting two or more properties or uses may be required. Service roads may be required near existing traffic signals or near locations having potential for future signalization; along arterial roadways with high traffic volumes; and where a relatively high number of crashes or limited sight distances are found.
(b) Shared commercial/industrial driveways and service roads shall be within a recorded access easement. A draft of the access easement shall be provided to the city engineer for review prior to filing.
(c) Service road and shared driveway design standards.

This easement shall be 60 feet wide, except an access easement parallel to a public street right-of-way may be 40 feet wide, if approved by the city engineer. The required width shall remain free and clear of obstructions, unless otherwise approved.
3. Construction and materials. Service roads shall have a base, pavement and curb with gutter in accordance with the city engineer requirements. The minimum required width of the service road shall be 27 feet, measured back to back of curb.
4. Parking. The service road is not intended as a parking maneuvering aisle. The site plan review authority may require the posting of "no parking" signs along the service road. Temporary parking may be permitted in the easement area where a continuous service road is not yet available, provided that the layout provides for the removal of the parking to allow extension of the service road.
5. Access to service road. All access to the service road shall be in accordance with the driveway spacing standards of this section. The planning commission may allow additional driveways if recommended by the city engineer.
6. Temporary access. The site plan review authority, with concurrence of the city engineer, may approve temporary access where a continuous service road is not yet available and a performance guarantee is provided to assure elimination of temporary access when the service road is continued. Building permits shall not be issued until the performance guarantee has been deposited with the city.
7. Elevation. The site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the service road at the property line. The city engineer shall maintain a record of all service road elevations so that their grades can be coordinated.
8. Maintenance. Each property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of the easement and service drive across their frontage. The maintenance provisions shall be specified in the recorded access easement.

Editor's note Ord. No. 20-08, adopted January 5, 2009, amended art. XXIII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. XXIII consisted of §§ 90-79190-811 and pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for amendatory history.
Sec. 90-700 PURPOSE
The purpose of this article is to regulate signs within the City of Wyoming. The regulations and standards of this article are intended to be content neutral and are considered the minimum necessary to achieve a substantial government interest for public safety, aesthetics, and protection of property values. These objectives are accomplished by establishing regulations concerning the size, placement, construction, illumination, and other aspects of signs in the city so as to:
(1) Protect the public right to receive messages and information protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution;
(2) Recognize that the principal intent of commercial signs is for identification of an establishment on the premises, and not for advertising off-premises activities;
(3) Recognize that the proliferation of signs unduly distracts motorists and non-motorized travelers, reduces the effectiveness of signs directing and warning the public, causes confusion, reduces desired uniform traffic flow, and creates potential for accidents;
(4) Prevent signs that are potentially dangerous to the public due to structural deficiencies or disrepair;
(5) Enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities without excessive difficulty and confusion by restricting the number and placement of signs;
(6) Preserve and improve the atmosphere of the city by encouraging signs of consistent size and/or nature which are compatible with and complementary to related buildings and uses, and harmonious with their surroundings; and
(7) Regulate portable commercial signs in recognition of their significant negative impact on traffic safety and aesthetics.

If two back-to-back sign faces are of unequal size, the larger of the two shall be counted as the area of the sign.
3. For buildings containing multiple tenants. When a sign consists of lettering or other sign elements printed, painted or mounted on a wall or a window, the sign area shall be measured by enclosing the edges of the sign elements (i.e. letters, logos) within a parallelogram or rectangle.

Sec. 90-710 NONCONFORMING SIGNS
Nonconforming signs are those signs that do not comply with the size, placement, construction or other standards or regulations of this Article, but were lawfully established prior to its adoption. The intent of this Article is to encourage eventual elimination of nonconforming signs in a timely manner. This objective is considered as much a subject of public health, safety and welfare as the prohibition of new signs in violation of this article. Therefore, the purpose of administering this Article is to remove illegal nonconforming signs while avoiding any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights.
(1) Alteration or reconstruction. A nonconforming sign shall not be altered or reconstructed, unless the alteration or reconstruction is in compliance with this Article, except that nonconforming signs shall comply with the following regulations:
(a) Repairs and maintenance. Normal maintenance shall be permitted, provided that any nonconforming sign that is destroyed by any means to an extent greater than 50 percent of the sign's pre-catastrophe fair market value, exclusive of the foundation, shall not be reconstructed. Normal maintenance shall include painting of chipped or faded signs; replacement of surface panels provided the new panels are no larger than the existing panels; or, repair or replacement of electrical wiring or electrical devices.

(c) Substitution. No nonconforming sign shall be replaced with another nonconforming sign.
(d) Discontinuance. A nonconforming sign shall not be re-established after the activity, business, or use to which it is related has been discontinued for 90 days or longer.

(1) Unsafe signs. Any sign that becomes insecure, in danger of falling, or otherwise unsafe but not considered an immediate danger by the building official to the health or safety of the public shall be removed or repaired according to the process outlined in (5) below.
(2) Dangerous signs. Any sign constituting an immediate hazard to health or safety shall be deemed a nuisance and may be immediately removed by the city and the cost thereof charged against the owner of the property on which it was installed.
(3) Abandoned signs. Any sign that advertises a business that has been discontinued for at least 90 days or that advertises a product or service that is no longer offered shall be deemed abandoned, unless it is determined that business is temporarily suspended due to a change in ownership or management. In any case, however, if the structure remains vacant for at least six months, it shall be considered abandoned for purposes of this section. The owner or lessee of the premises shall take any one of the following alternatives relative to the abandoned sign: removal, replace the sign faces with blanks, or cover the sign faces. Any covering on a sign face shall be maintained, clean, and in good condition or the building official may require replacement of the covering, placement of sign blanks, or sign removal, as noted in paragraph (5) below.
(4) Illegally erected signs. The chief building official shall order the removal of any sign erected illegally in violation of this Article, according to the process outlined in (5) below.
(5) Process for enforcing violations. For violations of this Article, the building official shall send notice, by certified mail addressed to the property owner and to the owner of the sign if not the property owner, at their last known address. The notice shall describe the violation and require removal or repair.

(a) Building official review. The building official shall review the sign permit application for any sign proposed on a site or existing building where no other new construction is proposed.
(b) Issuance of a permit. Following review and approval of a sign application, the chief building official shall have the authority to issue a sign permit.
(c) Exceptions. A sign shall not be enlarged or relocated except in conformity with the provisions of this article for new signs, nor until a proper permit has been secured. However, a new permit shall not be required for ordinary servicing or repainting of an existing sign message, cleaning of a sign, changing sign panels, or changing of the message on the sign where the sign is designed for such changes (such as manual changeable copy lettering or numbers on a gasoline price sign).
(5) Inspection and maintenance.
(a) Inspection of new signs.
1. All signs for which a permit has been issued shall be inspected by the building official when erected. Approval shall be granted only if the sign has been constructed in compliance with the approved plans and applicable zoning ordinance and building code standards.
2. In cases where fastenings or anchorages are to be eventually bricked in or otherwise enclosed, the sign erector shall advise the chief building official when such fastenings are to be installed so that inspection may be completed before enclosure.
(b) Inspection of existing signs. The building official shall have the authority to routinely enter onto property to inspect existing signs. In conducting such inspections, the building official shall determine whether the sign is adequately supported, painted to prevent corrosion, and so secured to the building or other support as to safely bear the weight of the sign and pressure created by the wind.
(c) Correction of defects. If the building official finds that any sign is unsafe, insecure, improperly constructed, or poorly maintained, the sign erector, owner of the sign, or owner of the land shall make or cause the sign to be made safe and secure by completing any necessary reconstruction or repairs, or entirely remove the sign in accordance with the timetable established by the building official.

1. There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property or to the intended use that do not apply generally to other property or class of use in the same vicinity and district.
2. Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights.
3. The granting of such variance will not diminish the marketable value of adjacent land and improvements, or unduly increase congestion in the public streets.
4. The condition or situation of a specific piece of property, or the intended use of said property, for which the variance is sought is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such condition or situation.
(d) A use variance may be allowed by the board only in cases where there is evidence of unnecessary hardship in the official record of the hearing that all of the following conditions are met:
1. The condition, location or situation of the specific piece of property or of the intended use of the property is unique to that property in the zoning district in which it is located.

2. The building, structure or land cannot be reasonably used in a manner consistent with the uses allowed in the zoning district in which it is located.
3. The use variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood nor the intent of the city master plan, nor be of detriment to adjacent properties.

5. The variance will not impair the intent and purpose of this chapter.
6. The immediate unnecessary hardship causing the need for the variance request was not created by the applicant.

(5) In exercising such powers, the board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrator from whom the appeal is taken.
(6) If the board fails to make findings of fact as required by this section, the variance shall be null and void and no building or occupancy permit shall be issued.

The building official may extend either of the above time limits for an additional period, provided that the applicant demonstrates that the failure to commence or complete construction within the applicable time from the date of issuance of the building permit was due to special circumstances beyond the applicant's control and that an extension is necessary to complete such construction.

INTRODUCTION: HOW TO USE THE WYOMING FORM BASED CODE
FORM BASED CODES AND THE PUBLIC REALM
Form Based Codes are development regulations (a type of zoning
code) that emphasize the physical character of development (its
form) and de-emphasize the regulation of land use.
Form Based Codes emphasize the design of the public realm by
regulating individual building character, streetscapes, and public
spaces.
The public realm is the area defined by the building walls, the
streetscape and the street.
The Wyoming Form Based Code is organized by Context Areas
(similar to conventional zoning districts), Building Types, Frontage
Types, and Thoroughfare Types. These elements provide standards
for the creation of a public realm that is consistent with that
envisioned the City of Wyoming Land Use Plan.
The Wyoming Form Base Code also regulates land use, parking
requirements, signs, and subdivision standards.
The Public Realm illustration on this page indicates the components
of the public realm and also references where each component is
regulated within the Wyoming Form Based Code.
Building Type: Division 6 contains standards for Building
Types that describe the various forms of buildings that are
permitted as part of this Form Based Code. Each Building
Type has its own specific massing, composition, site
placement, and vertical dimension.
Frontage Type: Division 7 contains standards for Frontage
Types that describe the privately owned area between
the right-of-way line and the building. Frontage Types
are applied to Building Types to ensure that the building
engages the street and defines the public realm.
Thoroughfare: Division 8 contains guidelines for the space
between the right-of-way lines, including the sidewalk,
parkway, furnishing zone, parking lanes, and travel lanes.
Use: Division 4 contains use requirements for each
Context Area. Context Areas are similar to conventional
land use zoning districts. Each Context Area includes
Building Types, building height, and includes permitted and
special uses.

INTRODUCTION: HOW TO USE THE WYOMING FORM BASED CODE
START HERE: Choose one of the following three scenarios that best fits your proposed development project
I HAVE A
SPECIFIC USE
THAT I AM
CONSIDERING
FOR MY LAND
DEVELOPMENT
DIVISION 4 CONTEXT AREAS AND USE
Each Context Area has uses which are
permitted, not permitted, and conditionally
permitted.
Determine which of the Context Areas that
your specific parcel is located in.
Once you have determined the Context
Area, you can determine the uses that are
most appropriate within the Context Area.
DIVISIONS 2, 3, and 5
Review Division 2, Applicability and Procedures to understand the procedural requirements of the Wyoming Form Based Code.
Review Division 3, General Provisions for regulations that apply to all projects within the Form Based Code Area.
Review Division 5, Subdivision and Access Standards for regulations that apply to all projects within the Form Based Code Area.
DIVISION 4 CONTEXT AREAS AND USE
Each Context Area has uses which are
permitted, not permitted, and conditionally
permitted.
Determine which of the Context Areas that
the use you are considering is permitted in,
this will allow you to determine the Context
Areas and parcels within the Form Based
Code Area that are most appropriate for
your project.
DIVISION 4 CONTEXT AREAS AND USE
Each Context Area has uses which are
permitted, not permitted, and conditionally
permitted.
Determine which of the Context Areas that
the Building Type you are considering is
permitted in, this will allow you to determine
the parcels within the Form Based Code
Area that are most appropriate for your
project and the types of uses that are
permitted for your project.
DIVISION 6 BUILDING TYPE STANDARDS
Determine which of the Building Types
best fit the building that you want to
develop. Consider building site placement,
massing, composition, vertical dimensions,
appropriate Private Frontages, and
Context Areas where the Building Type is
permitted, when making your decision.
DIVISION 6 BUILDING TYPE STANDARDS
Determine which of the Building Types best fit the parcel and use that you want to develop.
Consider building site placement, massing, composition, vertical dimensions, appropriate
Private Frontages, and Context Areas where the Building Type is permitted, when making your
decision.
DIVISION 7 PRIVATE FRONTAGE TYPE STANDARDS
After you have determined your Building Type, you should reference the Private Frontage Types to determine the most appropriate frontage.
Frontages are determined by your Building Type. It is your choice to determine the frontage that best fits your project goals and the context.
DIVISION 8 THOROUGHFARE GUIDELINES
The Thoroughfare Guidelines will help you determine which streets and streetscapes are best suited to your project, if applicable. Thoroughfares
are determined based upon the Context Area that your project is located in.
DIVISION 9 OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS
The Off-Street Parking Standards will help you determine the parking requirements for your project.
DIVISION 10 SIGN STANDARDS
Each Building Type has specific sign quantities and sign sizes that are relative to the Context Area that it is located in, this Division will assist you
in determining the types, sizes, placement, and quantity of signs permitted for your project.

90-1100 TITLE
The following document shall be known as the City of Wyoming Form
Based Code.
90-1101 PURPOSE
A. The City of Wyoming Form Based Code is intended to support
redevelopment in designated Form Based Code Areas in
the City of Wyoming through the establishment of building
type standards, frontage type standards, and thoroughfare
guidelines. The purpose of the Form Based Code is to
create a compact, transit-oriented development pattern that
fosters multi-modal corridors, mixed-uses, and a diversity
of residential development. Designated Form Based Code
Areas are depicted in the City of Wyoming Zoning Map
(located in chapter 90 of the City Zoning Ordinance) and
include the following:
1. 28th Street Corridor. Redevelopment within the 28th
Street corridor between Clyde Park and Burlingame
Avenues shall adhere to the provisions, standards,
and guidelines established in this Form Based Code
in order to support the vision set forth in the Turn On
28th Street Corridor Sub Area Plan (an amendment
to the City of Wyoming Master Plan, adopted in
January 2012) and the City of Wyoming Land Use
Plan.
2. Division Avenue Corridor. Redevelopment within
the Division Avenue Corridor between Alger Street
and 60th Street shall adhere to the provisions,
standards, and guidelines established in this Form
Based Code in order to support the goals of the City
of Wyoming Land Use Plan, the tenants of Transit-
Oriented Development (TOD), and the goals of
the Rapids Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system (also
known as the Silver Line).
3. Burton Street Corridor. Redevelopment within the
Burton Street Corridor between Burlingame Avenue
and Clyde Park Avenue shall adhere to the provision,
standards, and guidelines established in this Form
Based Code in order to support the goals of the City
of Wyoming Land Use plan.
B. The City of Wyoming Form Based Code is a legal document
regulating building types and frontage types, and guidelines
for thoroughfare types wherever its Context Areas are
applied. It shall do so in conjunction with the municipal Zoning
Ordinance for areas zoned Form Based Code (FBC) on the
zoning map, by regulating land development to ensure a
compact, urban form.
TITLE, PURPOSE, AND SCOPE
90-1102 SCOPE
The City of Wyoming Form Based Code is a mandatory code that
applies to all new development and redevelopment within the
boundaries of the Zoning Map or other locations within the municipality
where the applicable Context Areas have been applied as outlined in
90-1200, Applicability.
For the 28th Street corridor, the boundaries generally include all lands
that abut 28th Street from Clyde Park Avenue west to Burlingame
Avenue.
For the Division Avenue corridor, the boundaries generally include all
lands that abut Division Avenue from Alger Street south to 60th Street.
For the Burton Street corridor, the boundaries generally include all
lands that abut Burton Street from Burlingame Avenue to Clyde Park
Avenue.
Within the City of Wyoming Zoning Ordinance, properties zoned and
thus regulated by the City of Wyoming Form Based Code are within the
Form Based Code (FBC) districts. This district directs property owners
and applicants to this Code for development standards. Wherever there
appears to be a conflict between the City of Wyoming Form Based
Code and other sections of the Citys Zoning Ordinance (as applied
to particular development within the FBC districts), the requirements
specifically set forth in the Form Based Code shall prevail.
For development standards not covered by the City of Wyoming Form
Based Code, the other applicable sections in the municipal Zoning
Ordinance shall apply. All development shall also comply with all other
local, state or federal regulations and ordinances.
Throughout this Form Based Code, photographs are used for
illustrative purposes only.

CONTEXT AREAS AND USE
Corridor Urban Area (CU): The Corridor Urban Area is the
equivalent of a downtown, with the highest concentration of
development, the tallest buildings, and the busiest streets.
This Area is characterized by mixed-use and retail buildings
set close to the sidewalk. These buildings contain ground
floor retail and commercial uses with housing and office uses
on the upper floors. The Corridor Center Area is the physical,
business and commercial hub of the City of Wyoming. The
Area has similar characteristics to the Corridor Center Area,
except that it allows taller buildings and may permit largeformat
retail.
Corridor General Area (CG): The Corridor General Area
represents a traditional urban development pattern with
mixed use, retail, live / work and apartment buildings. The
Area is characterized by a variety of Building Types set relatively
close to the sidewalk, but also allows a range of building
placement options that permit a varied street wall.
Corridor Sub-Urban Area (CS): The Corridor Sub-Urban
Area represents a transition district within the development
pattern by facilitating building placement that is varied and
setback from the street edge and less emphasis on commercial
uses. The Area permits flexible retail building placement
to encourage a varied street edge and also allows for a variety
of residential Building Types.
Corridor Edge Area (CE): The Corridor Edge Area represents
a district which transitions from urban districts to the existing
development pattern of the City. This Area promotes retail and
residential uses with building placement that is more consistent
with existing City development patterns and includes the flexibility
of locating limited parking in the front of retail buildings
that front on 28th Street,Division Avenue, and Burton Street.
Corridor Neighborhood Area (CN): The Corridor Neighborhood
Area is a residential district that allows rowhouses,
two-family and single-family homes. It is intended to address
redevelopment opportunities that are consistent with existing
adjacent single-family residential neighborhoods.
90-1400 PURPOSE
Division 4 identifies the Context Areas and Uses established for the
City of Wyoming Form Based Code and provides the attributes that are
allowed in each Area. These attributes include use, building types, and
building height (measured in feet). These Context Areas ensure that
proposed development is consistent with the City of Wyoming Land
Use Plan.
Each of the Context Areas described in this Division represent a
spectrum of development character and intensity, ranging from the
most urban intense (Corridor Center District) to the least urban intense
(Corridor Neighborhood District). Each Context Area establishes
character through its use of Building Types (Division 6) and the
associated Private Frontages (Division 7) that can be applied to those
Building Types.
90-1401 APPLICABILITY
Each Context Area established in the Context Area Map shall meet
the standards of this Division. Each Context Area includes permitted
and special uses (if applicable) building types, and building height. Key
maps are provided to quickly discern the district location.
90-1402 CONTEXT AREAS
The following Context Areas are specified in this Division:
Corridor Center Area (CC): The Corridor Center Area is the
equivalent of a downtown, with the highest concentration of
development and the busiest streets. This Area is characterized
by mixed-use and retail buildings set close to the sidewalk.
These buildings contain ground floor retail and commercial
uses with housing and office uses on the upper floors.
The Corridor Center Area is the physical, business and commercial
hub of the City of Wyoming. The Area limits building
heights to two (2) stories in order to provide visual connection
from 28th Street and to preserve business district character
along Burton Street.

90-1605 STANDARDS FOR ALL BUILDING TYPES
The following standards apply to all Building Types:
A. Principal Frontage: Principal frontages of buildings represent
the building front and are located at the public right-of-way
lines along the street, public path or civic space of address
for the building.
B. Secondary Frontage: Secondary Frontages of buildings
represent the building sides that are located at the public rightof-
way lines along all streets, public paths or civic spaces that
are not the street of address for the building. The side setback
for secondary frontages shall apply to all situations where
secondary frontages occur at more than one side of a building
(due to a parcel that is bound on more than two sides by rightof-
way lines).
C. Principal Frontage Transparency Requirements at First Story:
Each Building Types first story transparency at the Principal
Frontage Line is per the Private Frontage Requirements.
Secondary Frontages are required to use one (1) of the
following standards:
1. Transparency that is the same as what is required by
the upper stories for the Building Type.
2. Transparency that is the same as the Private
Frontage that has been applied to the Principal
Frontage.
D. Setback Measurements: For all Principal and Secondary
Frontage locations along the required 28th Street greenbelt,
the required build-to-lines, build-to-zones and setback
measurements shall be taken from the back edge (the edge
facing the private side of the right-of-way) of the greenbelt.
Refer to Division 3 for greenbelt measurement and design.
E. Frontage Percentages: Each Building Type indicates a
frontage percentage requirement along the Principal Frontage
Line. This percentage is the amount of a lot line adjoining the
public right-of-way that is occupied by the front façade of the
principal building. The front façade shall be parallel to the
right-of-way, located in accordance with the required build-tolines
or build-to-zones.
F. Private Frontages: Private Frontage Types define architecture
and design components for the entrance(s) to the building and
the area between the façade and the Frontage Line. Each
Building Type identifies the appropriate Private Frontage
Type(s). The use of one of the Private Frontage Types
identified is required. Refer to Division 7 for Private Frontage
Types.
G. Maximum Site Coverage: The maximum site coverage applies
to all buildings on a lot, including accessory buildings.

90-1804 HOW TO USE THIS DIVISION
Refer to sample pages on this sheet for references of how to use each
Thoroughfare Type Guideline. These pages are representative of the
layout for each Thoroughfare Type contained in this Division.
A. Thoroughfare Attributes. This box contains a table that
lists technical information that pertains to the dimensional
requirements and the performance standards that are
suggested for the Thoroughfare Type.
A description is also included as an introduction to the
Thoroughfare Type.
B. Thoroughfare Key. This box contains a thoroughfare key that
provides the basic nomenclature for the thoroughfare names.
These names allow the basic elements of the thoroughfare
to be quickly identified including the type and the design
dimensions. Each element of the name is briefly described
within this key.
A diagram that graphically describes the pedestrian realm
design zones is also included here. This diagram describes
the two basic zones of the public realm between the right-ofway
line and the street curb.
The information contained within this box is general to all
Thoroughfare Types.
C. Thoroughfare Cross-Section. This diagram provides a cross
section of the thoroughfare in order to describe its entire
assembly. The cross section will typically include everything
within the public realm - from right-of-way line to right-of-way
line. Dimensional parameters are indicated for sidewalks,
street pavement, travel lanes, parking lanes and bike lanes.
(Building masses are indicated for user orientation only.)
D. Thoroughfare Plan View. The second page of each
thoroughfare type has a diagram that provides a plan view
of the entire assembly. The plan view will typically include
everything within the public realm - from right-of-way line to
right-of-way line. Dimensional parameters are indicated for
sidewalks, street pavement, travel lanes, parking lanes and
bike lanes. Location of bulb-outs are conceptually indicated.
(Building masses are indicated for user orientation only).
Alley types do not include a plan diagram.

classification of use, off-street parking facilities shall be
provided as required by this Division.
B. If the intensity of use of any building (other than a singleor
two-family residence) or lot is increased, through the
addition of floor area, increase in seating capacity, number of
employees or other means, additional off-street parking shall
be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
90-1902 MAXIMUM OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES
The maximum number of required off-street parking spaces shall be
provided and maintained on the premises or as otherwise allowed by
this article, on the basis of the following and the specific requirements
of Section 90-600 in Article 6.
A. When units or measurements determining the number of

Parking space requirements may be reduced by no more than fifty (50)
percent (except as provided in the bicycle reduction in D.2.) as part of
the site plan approval by the site plan review authority, based upon one
or more of the following conditions:
A. Shared Parking with Staggered Peak Periods. Where a mix
of land uses on two (2) or more adjacent lots create staggered
peak periods of parking demand, the on-site parking
requirements for the adjacent lots may be reduced subject to
the following:
1. Shared parking areas shall be located within three
hundred (300) feet of the use.
2. Pedestrian connections shall be maintained between
the buildings or uses.
3. Lots shall be adjacent and shall be interconnected
for vehicular passage.

5. For shared parking with places of worship, the other
uses shall not normally operate between the hours of
6:00am and 6:00pm on Sundays.
B. Mixed Use Buildings. Where one (1) mixed use building
on one (1) lot creates staggered peak periods of parking
demand, the on-site parking requirements for the single lot
may be reduced subject to the following:
1. Mixed Use Building Type shall have different uses
on multiple floors that create a staggered demand.
C. Expectation of walk-in trade due to sidewalk connections to
adjacent residential neighborhoods or employment centers.
In allowing a parking space reduction, the site design shall
incorporate pedestrian connections to the site and on-site
pedestrian circulation providing safe and convenient access
to the building.
D. Availability of other modes of travel. To qualify, the site plan
must incorporate transit stops, pedestrian connections to
nearby transit stops, or bicycle parking facilities, as applicable.
1. Transit reduction. Structures or uses shall be within
three-hundred (300) feet of a transit stop. The Rapid
shall verify in writing that the transit stop is in a
permanent location.

reduced by one (1) space for every four (4) covered,
secure bicycle parking spaces that are provided on
site. Parking requirements may be further reduced
by four (4) spaces where free showers are available
for employee use within the building.
E. Where the applicant has provided a parking study, conducted
by a qualified professional, that demonstrates that another
standard would be more appropriate based on actual number
of employees or expected level of customer traffic. Actual
counts at a similar establishment provided by the applicant
may also be acceptable.
F. A parking study may be required as part of site plan review
to document that any one of the criteria A. through D. above
would be met.

required parking spaces in accordance with the requirements
of this article, or shall be in violation thereof.
90-1905 BANKED PARKING
A. Where a reduction in the number of parking spaces is not
warranted but an applicant demonstrates that the parking
requirements for a proposed use would be excessive, the site
plan review authority may defer (bank) some of the required
parking. The site plan shall designate portions of the site
for future construction of the required parking spaces. This
banked area shall be maintained in a landscaped appearance
and not be located within required greenbelts or parking lot
setback areas and shall not be used for any other purpose.
B. The site plan shall show the area proposed to be banked,
with all required site plan elements, but shall indicate with
hatching, dashed lines, or other means the area to be banked.

90-2100 APPLICABILITY
The following terms are defined for the purpose of the City of Wyoming
Form Based Code.
In instances where terms are not defined here, they may be defined
elsewhere in the existing municipal zoning ordinances. In such cases
the definitions contained within the existing zoning ordinances shall be
used for the administration of the City of Wyoming Form Based Code.
In instances where terms are defined in both the existing ordinances
and here, the definitions here shall prevail for the administration of the
City of Wyoming Form Based Code.
A
DEFINITIONS A
Active Use: A use at the street level of a building that allows physical
and visual activity to occur between the inside of the building and the
sidewalk area. A group of buildings with active street level uses will
generate pedestrian activity on the sidewalk and vehicular activity in
the thoroughfare. Typical active uses include retail and restaurants at
the street level.
Adjacent Grade: The exterior grade immediately adjacent to the
building or structure from which measurements shall be taken.
Alley: Refer to Rear Alley.
Apartment Building Type: A lot located and designed to accommodate
a multi-story building with multiple dwelling units above and beside
each other.
Architectural Elements: Elements of a building that may project from
the façade into the required setbacks, beyond the build-to-zones or
into the public right-of-way as indicated in Division 3: Encroachments.
These include balconies, awnings, canopies, eaves, cornices, bays,
and projecting signs.
At-Grade Entry: An entry door that has a zero-step entrance.
At-Grade Frontage: The at-grade is a frontage type placed along the
Principal Frontage line in a build-to-zone. It provides an at grade (zero
step) entry into residentially scaled buildings and may be associated
with lobby buildings (such as apartments).
Attic: An interior space of a building that has only a single floor of
habitable space and that occurs within the pitched roof structure,
whether conditioned or not. Attic space is typically not among the
number of stories regulated by Context Area or Building Type, unless
otherwise noted.
Awning: A retractable or fixed shelter projecting from and supported by
the exterior wall of a building and constructed of non-rigid materials on
a supporting framework.
Awning Sign: A sign that typically includes letters, logos, symbols and/
or designs that is integrated into an awning.
B
DEFINITIONS B
Balcony: An open outdoor portion of an upper floor.
Balcony Private Frontage: The balcony is a frontage type placed along
the Principal Frontage line. It is typically associated with mixed use
buildings. The frontage combines an upper balcony that is recessed
into the building mass with a storefront at the first story. The storefront
portion of this frontage shall be designed in a way that promotes an
attractive, convenient shopping experience.
Basement: An interior space of a building that has more than one half
(1/2) of its height below grade.
Bay or Bay Window: An interior portion of an upper floor extending
beyond the buildings exterior wall plane that is not supported from
below by vertical columns or piers.
Building Façade: The exterior walls of a building that face either a
principal or secondary frontage line.
Building Footprint: The shape and placement of the ground floor of a
structure on the parcel.
Building Footprint, Condominium Site: The area of the condominium
site within which the main building or structure may be constructed as
described in the master deed for the site condominium project.
Building Height: Refer to Height, Building.
Building To Line: A measurement that defines the edge in which the
building walls that face frontage lines are required to be built to. When
a build-to-line is indicated on a building type, it is a requirement and not
a permissive minimum as is a set back line.
Build To Zone: A measurement that defines the range (or zone) in
which building walls that face frontage lines are required to be located
within. When a build-to-zone is indicated on a building type, it is a
requirement that the building walls are constructed within this range.
Building Type: Building Types describe the various forms of buildings
that are allowable in the City of Wyoming Form Based Code. Each
building type has its own specific massing, composition, site placement
(disposition), and vertical dimension that create its unique attributes.
Building Types are regulated in Division 6 and are allowable within
various Context Areas.
Building Composition: The essential architectural characteristics that
define a specific Building Type.
C
DEFINITIONS C
Canopy: A fixed shelter projecting from and supported by the exterior
wall of a building and constructed of metal or other rigid materials.

churches, libraries, and schools, and do not contain retail, residential
or private office uses. Civic buildings are not required to meet the
building type standards or the private frontage standards of the City
of Wyoming Form Based Code. Civic buildings are typically sited in
locations of prominence, such as corners of major intersections,
terminating a street vista or overlooking or within a civic space. The
design of these building types is encouraged to allow greater flexibility
and distinctive architectural expression so that they can become
landmarks.
Civic Space: An outdoor area dedicated to public use that is strategically
placed to facilitate use by the surrounding community.
Clear Glass: Refer to Glass, Clear.
Context Area: Administratively similar to zoning districts in conventional
codes, except that they integrate form-based elements, including
Building Type, public realm standards, and Thoroughfare Type into the
regulation.
