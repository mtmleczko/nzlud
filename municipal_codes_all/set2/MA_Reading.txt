If the Moderator is unable to decide the vote by the show of hands, or if his decision is immediately questioned by seven (7) or more Members, or if the Moderator determines that a counted vote is required such as for a debt issue or Home Rule Petition, he shall determine the question by ordering a standing vote, and he shall appoint tellers to make and return the count directly to him.

When such motion is made at the session of the meeting at which the vote was passed, said motion shall be accepted by the Moderator but consideration thereof shall be postponed to become the first item to be considered at the next session, unless all remaining articles have been disposed of, in which case reconsideration shall be considered before final adjournment. There can be no reconsideration of a vote once reconsidered or after a vote not to reconsider. Reconsideration may be ordered by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the members present. Arguments for or against reconsideration may include discussion of the motion being reconsidered providing such discussion consists only of relevant facts or arguments not previously presented by any speaker. 
2.2.4.2 	Federal or State Law Affecting Reconsideration 
The foregoing provisions relating to motions to reconsider shall not apply to any such motion made by the Select Board and authorized by the Moderator as necessary for the reconsideration of actions previously taken by Town Meeting by reason of State or Federal action or inaction or other circumstances not within the control of the Town or Town Meeting. In the event such a motion to reconsider is made and authorized, said motion may be made at any time before the final adjournment of the meeting at which the vote was passed, said motion may be made even if the vote was already reconsidered or was the subject of a vote not to reconsider, and reconsideration may be ordered by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the Members present. 
2.2.4.3	 Posting and Advertising 
Notice of every vote to be reconsidered at an adjourned Town Meeting shall be posted by the Town Clerk in one (1) or more public places in each precinct of the Town as soon as possible after adjournment, and he shall, if practicable, at least one day before the time of the next following session of said adjourned meeting, publish such notice in Local News Medium published in the Town.

The Chairman of each precinct or his designee shall make such recommendations along with supporting evidence and rationale to Town Meeting. 
2.2.7.3	 Grouped by Precinct 
The names of the Members subject to removal in accordance with Section 2-6 of the Charter shall be grouped by precinct in the warrant article required by said section.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any board, committee or commission which meets the requirements of MGL Chapter 39 Section 23B concerning emergency meetings may, upon meeting such requirements, conduct such a meeting or hearing at a time scheduled for a Town Meeting.

8.7 News Racks 
8.7.1 Findings and Purpose 
Whereas, the proliferation of scattered news racks in the Town of Reading often block crosswalks and handicap ramps, unreasonably impedes access for the use and maintenance of poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants and mailboxes, unreasonably obstructs the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, unreasonably obstructs access to bus stops, taxi cab stands, valet parking areas, loading zones and fire lanes, impede emergency snow removal operations, creates undue nuisances and hazards to passersby in bad weather and storms and otherwise unreasonably restricts public access and creates undue perils and public safety hazards; and 
Whereas, news racks often create a visual blight due to their varying shapes and colors and disarray, and are often not properly maintained and are allowed to deteriorate, and fall into states of disrepair in which news racks collect trash and other debris, become covered with graffiti, are tipped over, moved, cause damage to curbs, sidewalks, streets, poles; traffic signals and signs, and or remain empty and abandoned; and 
Whereas, reasonable standards for the appearance, placement and maintenance of news racks in the public way will allow for unrestricted access to crosswalks and handicapped ramps and further provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience by alleviating unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, allow for reasonable access and use of poles, posts, traffic signs and signals, hydrants and mailboxes, bus stops, taxi stands, valet parking areas, loading zones and fire lanes, provide for the safety of the public and protection of property during times of snow emergencies and other bad weather conditions, and reduce the potential for creating perils in the way of passersby, safety hazards and visual blight that often are associated with unregulated news racks.

A 	PWSF Siting: A PWSF may be permitted within any district by Special Permit, subject to the purposes and standards established in this bylaw. The following list of allowable PWSF Locations is presented in order of preference. 1 First Preference: A site located entirely within an Interstate Highway 
right-of-way. 2 Second Preference: A site located entirely within an Industrial zoning district. 3 Third Preference: A site located entirely within a Business (Bus A and Bus C) zoning district. 4 Fourth Preference: A site located within the Residential S-15, S-20, S-40, A-40, A-80 or within the Business B zoning districts. 
B 	PWSF Installation Types: The following list of PWSF Installation Types is presented in order of preference. 1 First Preference: The following PWSF Installation Types are of equal 
preference to one another: 
a 	PWSF Collocation: A new PWSF may Collocate on any existing PWSF to the extent that such Collocation is found by the CPDC to be consistent with the purposes and standards established in this bylaw. 
b 	PWSF on Existing Electrical Utility Infrastructure: A PWSF may Collocate on existing electrical utility infrastructure such as utility poles or streetlights using unobtrusive architectures such as Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS). With respect to the use of utility poles, Collocation on existing electrical utility poles (and replacements thereof) is preferred above the installation of new electrical utility poles in public/private ways. In neighborhoods with underground electrical utilities, pole-mounted PWSF on existing electrical utility infrastructure are discouraged in favor of less visually obtrusive alternatives, such as placing a small antenna installation on existing electrical utility poles on a nearby street. 
c 	Other Implementations: A PWSF may be located using innovative alternatives that are in keeping with the purpose and intent of this Bylaw and that may become available after the adoption of this Bylaw. 
2 	Second Preference: PWSF Site Sharing. A new PWSF may share the same parcel with existing PWSFs, to the extent that such site-sharing is found by the CPDC to be consistent with the purposes and standards established in this bylaw. 
3 	Third Preference: A new PWSF installation on any existing structure, to the extent that such installation is found by the CPDC to be consistent with the purposes and standards established in this bylaw. 
4 	Fourth Preference: PWSF involving a new antenna tower. PWSFs which require the construction of a new antenna tower are least on the order of preference. 
5 	Waiver of Preferences: The CPDC may waive the preference orders designated for siting and types of PWSF pursuant to Section 5.6.3.1.A upon a finding that the siting at a location of lesser preference, or the installation of a PWSF type of lesser preference, would achieve a result more consistent with the purposes and standards established in this bylaw. 
5.6.3.2 General Special Permit Requirements A Use: PWSFs shall only be employed for the purpose of delivering wireless services to subscriber devices or supporting public safety communications, and shall not be used for storage, office, manufacturing, repair, or other activities unless separately permitted for such other activities. 
B 	Demonstration of need: 
1 	Need for service. The applicant must demonstrate the service objectives in the Town of Reading that the proposed PWSF will address in whole or in part. Such demonstration shall include: a Substantial written evidence including technical documentation 
demonstrating that there is a substantial deficiency in the applicant’s provision of service to the Town of Reading which fails to satisfy the service objectives; 
b 	detailed information about all existing and pending PWSFs regardless of ownership, control or the jurisdiction in which they are located, and associated coverage maps; 
c information about terrain, vegetation and land use within the proposed coverage area; d estimates with supporting documentation of the number of mobile and 
stationary subscribers affected by the claimed substantial deficiency; e network performance factors; and f other information relevant to the Applicant’s service objectives, or as 
may be required by the CPDC. 
2 	Need for location. The applicant must provide substantial written evidence including clear documentation showing how the improved service to the Town of Reading that applicant seeks could not be provided by utilizing one or more alternative locations of higher preference as described in Section 
5.6.3.1.A or, alternatively, how the proposed PWSF achieves a better result as described in Section 5.6.3.4.C. 
3 	Availability of alternatives. The CPDC, at its discretion, may require the applicant to consider specific potential alternatives at any level of the hierarchy in Section 5.6.3.1.A, if the CPDC determines that such locations may better achieve the purposes established in this bylaw. 
C 	Visual Guidelines: 
The construction, erection, installation and/or placement of all PWSF shall be reviewed by the CPDC within the public hearing process based on the following visual guidelines: 1 Concealment: To the maximum extent practicable, PWSFs shall conceal 
equipment, cables, and antennas within architectural surfaces that are ordinary and consistent with the context of the PWSF within the Town of Reading environs, such as steeples, concealed-antenna monopoles, flagpoles, smokestacks, faux chimneys and cupolas. 
2 	Screening, Camouflage and Landscaping: Wherever possible, PWSF shall be sited so as to minimize the visibility of such devices from adjacent property and shall be suitably screened from abutters and residential neighborhoods. Where elements of a PWSF will be visible to residential parcels and public or private ways, PWSFs shall employ screening and/or camouflage methods that are consistent with the context of the surrounding area such as fencing, vegetation, and paint color or patterns to match underlying surfaces in order to mitigate any undesirable visual bulk and distraction. Installation of free-standing PWSF shall minimize the removal of trees and other existing vegetation. 
3 	Scale: The visual characteristics of a PWSF shall be minimized with respect to being unreasonable in scale, such as a dominant or looming visual experience, disproportion to the site and its surroundings, or undesirable shadowing impacts. 
4 	Color: Free-standing, wall mounted and roof-mounted devices may be required to be painted or otherwise colored or finished in a manner which aesthetically minimizes the visual bulk of the devices to the surrounding landscape or on the building or structure to which they are attached. 
5 	Signs: There shall be no advertising permitted on or in the vicinity of PWSF. There shall be a sign not exceeding four square feet in area at each PWSF which shall display a phone number where the responsible party for the maintenance of the PWSF may be reached on a 24 hour basis. 
6 Lighting: Outdoor lighting of PWSFs shall be limited to that which is necessary for security and temporary maintenance at the discretion of the CPDC. PWSFs that are required to be marked and lighted for air navigation safety are discouraged. 
7 	Maintenance: The visual characteristics of a PWSF shall be maintained, repaired and replaced as necessary and as an ongoing condition of compliance to retain the characteristics approved by issuance of a special permit. 
8 Prohibitions: The following are specifically prohibited: a Lattice style antenna towers and facilities requiring three or more legs and/or guy wires for support; and b Fences utilizing razor wire or barbed wire or similar wire types. 
D Height: 1 Height General Regardless of the type of mount, a PWSF shall be no higher than ten feet above the average height of buildings within 300 feet of the proposed facility. In addition, the height of a PWSF shall not exceed by more than 10 feet the height limitations of the zoning district in which the facility is proposed to be located, unless the facility is completely camouflaged such as within a flagpole, steeple, chimney, or similar structure. Wireless service facilities may locate on a building that is legally non- conforming with respect to height, provided that the facilities do not project above the existing building height. 
2. Height, Ground-Mounted Facilities 
Ground-mounted wireless service facilities shall not project higher than ten feet above the average building height or, if there are no buildings within 300 feet, these facilities shall not project higher than ten feet above the average tree canopy height, measured from average grade level. If there are no buildings within 300 feet of the proposed site of the facility, all ground-mounted wireless service facilities shall be surrounded by dense tree growth to screen views of the facility in all directions. These trees may exist or may be planted on site. 
3 	Height, Side-and Roof-Mounted Facilities 
Side-and roof-mounted wireless service facilities shall not project more than ten (10) feet above the height of an existing building or structure nor project more than ten (10) feet above the height limit of the zoning district within which the facility is located. 
4 	Height, Preexistent Structures (Utility) 
New antennas located on any of the following structures existing on the effective date of this bylaw shall be exempt from the height restrictions of this bylaw provided that there is no increase in height of the existing structure as a result of the installation of a wireless service facility: Water towers, guyed towers, lattice towers, fire towers and monopoles. 
E 	Setbacks: 
All wireless service facilities and their equipment shelters shall comply with the 
building setback provisions of the zoning district in which the facility is located. 
In addition, the following setbacks shall be observed. 
1 In order to ensure public safety, the minimum distance from the base of 

any ground-mounted wireless service facility to any property line, shall be 
1.5 times the height of the facility/mount, including any antennas or other appurtenances. This set back is considered the “fall zone”. 
2 	In the event that a preexistent building or structure is proposed as a mount for a wireless service facility, the setback provisions of the zoning district shall apply. In the case of the preexistent non-conforming structures, wireless service facilities and their equipment shelters shall not increase any non-conformity. 
3 	Additional Required Setbacks: In all districts, PWSFs shall be placed no closer than 3 times the height of the Antenna above grade to an existing school, Child Care Facility, Nursing or Convalescent Home, or an Assisted Living Facility or any Residential Structure. 
F 	Security 
PWSF’s with a height of ten (10) feet or less or those on rooftops shall have provisions to prevent unauthorized persons from coming within five (5) feet thereof. 
5.6.3.3 Application Procedures A Preliminary Review: Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the Town Planner to initiate a dialogue well before final site selection and detailed application development. The Preliminary Review is intended to: 1 Provide the Applicant with the opportunity to discuss and clarify Zoning Bylaw requirements and CPDC Site Plan Review Guidelines and Regulations (adopted by the CPDC pursuant to Section 4.6.1.2) relevant to the Applicant’s prospective PWSF proposal; and  
2 	To review general concepts related to the PWSF and alternative means of implementation to determine the CPDC’s preferences. 
B 	Special Permit and Site Plan Approval: No PWSF, whether itself a principal use of a lot or as an accessory use to a communication facility, shall be constructed without a Special Permit having been granted by the CPDC. The CPDC may grant a Special Permit in accordance with the provisions of this Section and Section 4.4. Nothing in this section is intended to exempt PWSF from the requirement to receive Site Plan Approval pursuant to Section 4.6. 
C 	Consultant Review: When considering an application for a PWSF, the CPDC may determine the need for the assistance of a consultant technical expert in matters involving the placement, construction, need for coverage and modification of PWSFs, under the Zoning Bylaw and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, at the Applicant’s expense pursuant to MGL chapter 44 section 53G. To make the most productive use of the limited time authorized by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to hear the application, the CPDC may at its discretion engage a consultant immediately upon receipt of an application. 
5.6.3.4 Decision A Required Findings: To approve a Special Permit for a PWSF, the CPDC must make the following findings: 1 That the Applicant or co-Applicant has: a demonstrated that it is a Personal Wireless Services provider in the Town of Reading area, and has sufficient ownership or leasehold interest in the proposed site to construct the PWSF; b provided written assent to the Town that the Applicant will allow Site-Sharing, to the extent reasonably practicable and that is appropriate for the site and surroundings, in a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner; and 
c 	demonstrated that the construction, operation and maintenance of the proposed PWSF are consistent with applicable environmental regulations including, but not limited to, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) criteria and Wetland Protection regulations. 
2 	That the proposed PWSF (with conditions, if applicable): 
a 	is part of the orderly development of PWSFs in the Town of Reading, and will result in a substantial improvement in the provision of Personal Wireless Service in the Town of Reading; 
b 	is compatible with the Town of Reading’s character and is designed and screened in a manner that is sensitive to the surrounding neighborhood as well as the community at large; protects adjacent properties from unreasonable risks of PWSFs, to the extent permitted by law, including without limitation excessive noise levels, falling objects, fuel spills, and attractive nuisance; 
c 	if the proposed PWSF will Site-Share with an existing PWSF(s), that such Site Sharing is found by the CPDC to be consistent with the purposes established in this bylaw; 
d 	conforms with the PWSF Location and PWSF Installation preferences of Section 5.6.3.1.B to the extent necessary to conform with the purposes established in this bylaw; 
e 	ensures that all radio frequency (RF) emissions shall comply with the FCC requirements codified in 47 CFR Section 1.1307 et seq as further interpreted by FCC Office of Engineering and Technology Bulletin 65, Evaluating Compliance with FCC Guidelines for Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Magnetic Fields, or any successor regulation or bulletin, as same may be amended from time to time. 
f 	if proposed as a new antenna tower, the Applicant has documented that no combination of one or more alternative Collocations and/or Site Sharing can substantially satisfy the Applicant’s coverage objectives; and present a substantially less detrimental impact on the Town of Reading. 
g 	satisfies the Purposes established by the Zoning Bylaw and, without limitation, the specific requirements and guidelines established in this bylaw; and 
h 	if applicable, that the existing vegetation will be preserved or improved; and 
i 	where applicable, that disturbance of the existing topography has been minimized or that proposed manipulation of vegetation and disturbance of topography results in a lesser visual impact. 
B Form of Decision: The CPDC shall act on a Special Permit request for the placement of a PWSF in accordance with MGL Chapter 40A Section 9 and may approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application. The Decision of the CPDC shall be timely, in writing and based upon substantial evidence in the written record. 1 Approval: Any approved Special Permit shall authorize specific PWS provider(s) and specific wireless service(s) to be operated by the Applicant(s) at the Antenna height(s) or positions specified in the application or approval document. 2 Approval with Conditions: The CPDC may impose conditions of approval as necessary to ensure that the purposes of this bylaw are achieved. For any condition that the CPDC establishes with reporting or monitoring requirements, including without limitation noise or radio frequency emissions, the CPDC shall seek the advice of an expert in the relevant field pursuant to Section 5.6.3.3.C to identify the least burdensome protocol that is consistent with a legitimate public purpose identified by the CPDC. 3 Denial: Any denial shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in the record as required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 4 Reconsideration pursuant to Telecommunications Act: If the CPDC fails to find in favor of all elements of Section 5.6.3.4.A, the CPDC shall reconsider the proposed PWSF in the context of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. To approve the Special Permit under this section, the CPDC must make the following findings: a That a significant gap exists in the coverage area of the proposed PWSF, which significant gap is not necessarily equivalent to the lack of the Applicant’s stated coverage objectives; b That there are no viable alternatives involving one or more PWSFs to serve the significant gap; c That not granting a Special Permit for the proposed PWSF (including conditions, if any) would effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services; 
C 	Waivers: The CPDC may at its discretion authorize waivers in the Special Permit Approval with respect to the orders of preference in Section 5.6.3.1A and 5.6.3.1.B, and any dimensional or other requirements of Section 6.6.3.2.D and 5.6.3.2.E upon a finding that such waiver will achieve better results consistent with the purposes and standards established in this Section 5.6.3.

e 	For purposes of determining compliance with the foregoing requirements and the height limitations set forth in Table 6.3, all yards and buffer areas shall be measured from the boundary line between the Business C District and the adjoining S-20 District and the S-15 District. 
6.5	 Landscape Standards 
6.5.1 	Appropriate landscaping and design shall be incorporated into new nonresidential development and redevelopment projects within nonresidential districts and into new multi-family dwelling projects. Landscape design plans shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect; provided, however, that the CPDC may accept a plan prepared by one other than a landscape architect if it believes the plan meets the landscaping standards of this Section and is in concert with the intent thereof. Wherever possible, naturally occurring vegetation shall be incorporated into the landscape plan, which shall show the limits of work, existing tree lines, and all proposed landscape features and improvements including screening, planting areas, size and type of stock for shrubs and trees, and proposed erosion control measures. 
6.5.2 	Side yards required by the Intensity Regulations set forth in Section 6.0 of the Zoning Bylaw shall be landscaped. Such side yards shall be planted with a combination of grass, shrubs of appropriate height and shade trees. If there is not an adequate amount of side yard area to landscape, a fence may be allowed as an alternative; provided, however, that chain link fencing shall not be permitted. No parking area or driveway shall be allowed within such side yard. 
6.5.3 	Exposed storage areas, machinery, garbage dumpsters, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings, and structures shall be screened from the view of abutting properties and streets using plantings, fences, and other appropriate methods.

7.0 	NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES 
7.1 Overview 
Nonconforming Lots, Uses, Buildings and Structures shall be regulated as provided in Section 6 of Chapter 40A of the Massachusetts General Laws and as provided in the Zoning Bylaw. 
An “increase in the nonconforming nature of a building or structure” occurs when the change to the building or structure (1) extends the existing nonconformity or (2) creates a new nonconformity. An increase in the nonconforming nature of a building or structure will not result from replacement or repair, without undue delay, of a nonconforming portion thereof. 
“Alteration” of a nonconforming building or structure refers to alterations that provide for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent. 
7.2 Nonconforming Uses 
Nonconforming Single or Two Family uses located in Business or Industrial Districts, can be reconstructed, altered, extended, or structurally changed so long as the Building Inspector makes a determination that the nonconforming nature of the use is not increased. Other nonconforming uses may be extended upon a determination from the Building Inspector that such extensions are not substantial. 
Where the nonconforming nature of a Single or Two Family use is increased or where other nonconforming uses are changed or substantially extended, the use may be reconstructed, altered, extended, or structurally changed only if the Zoning Board of Appeals determines that such reconstruction, alteration, extension, or structural change shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the neighborhood and, on this basis, grants a Special Permit. 
Once a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use it may not revert to a nonconforming  use. 
7.3 Nonconforming Structures 
7.3.1 	The Building Inspector may grant a building permit for repair or interior renovations of nonconforming structures that are conforming as to use. The Building Inspector may grant a building permit for the alteration of a Nonconforming Single or Two Family dwelling that: a will not increase the footprint of the existing structure, create a new dimensional 
nonconformity or extend an existing dimensional nonconformity, regardless of whether the lot complies with the current area and/or frontage requirements, b complies with all current yard, lot coverage and building height requirements and the lot complies with all requirements except for area; or c complies with all current yard, lot coverage and building height requirements; and the lot complies with all requirements except for frontage. 
7.3.2 	For those alterations of a Single or Two Family dwelling not eligible for a building permit pursuant to Section 7.3, the Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a Special Permit to reconstruct, extend, alter, or structurally change a nonconforming building or structure upon a finding that such reconstruction, extension, alteration or structural change shall not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming building or structure. 
7.3.3 	Nothing in the Zoning Bylaw shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any nonconforming building or structure, or part thereof, declared unsafe by the Building Inspector. 
7.4 Variance Required Except as provided in Section 7.5 of the Zoning Bylaw, the reconstruction, alteration, extension or structural change of a nonconforming building or structure that results in a new nonconformity shall require a determination by the Zoning Board of Appeals as to whether it will grant a variance. 
7.5 Single Lot Exemption for Single Family and Two Family Dwelling Any increase in area, frontage, width, yard, or depth requirements of the Zoning Bylaw shall not apply to a previously undeveloped lot proposed to be used as the site of a Single or Two Family dwelling, that, at the time of recording or endorsement, whichever occurs sooner, was not held in common ownership with any adjoining land, conformed to then existing requirements at the time of such recording or endorsement, and had less than the increased requirement but at least five thousand (5,000) square feet of area and fifty (50) feet of frontage, whether or not such lot was zoned for residential or nonresidential use at the time of the increase. 
7.6 Change, Extension, or Alteration of a Pre-Existing Nonconforming Lot A nonconforming lot may be changed, extended or altered as a matter-of-right only if: a Such change, extension, or alteration will bring the lot into total conformance with the Zoning Bylaw in effect at the time of said change, extension or alteration; or b Such change, extension or alteration only enlarges the pre-existing nonconforming lot and does not reduce the area, frontage, width, or depth thereof; or c Such change, extension, or alteration deducts land from the nonconforming lot but in a manner that does not reduce the lot's area, frontage, width, depth, building setbacks, percent of building coverage or percent of open space below what is required by the Zoning Bylaw. 
7.7 	Reconstruction After Catastrophe A nonconforming Single or Two Family dwelling that has been destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty may be re-established, restored or reconstructed within two (2) years of the occurrence of the damage or destruction if there is no extension of the nonconformity or no new nonconformity. Any proposed change of use is subject to the provisions of the Zoning Bylaw. 
7.8 Voluntary Demolition and Reconstruction Any reconstruction, following voluntary demolition of a nonconforming structure, shall meet the following requirements: a A Single or Two Family dwelling that is nonconforming only with respect to lot size and/or frontage may be voluntarily removed or demolished and replaced by a new Single or Two Family dwelling. b In the event that the proposed reconstruction would (a) cause the structure to exceed the lot coverage of the original nonconforming building or structure or (b) cause the building or structure to be located on other than the original footprint, the Building Inspector may issue a Building Permit if the proposed reconstruction will not extend the nonconformity or create a new nonconformity. c A nonconforming building or structure that is accessory to a Single or Two Family Dwelling may be demolished and a new accessory building or structure may be built in the same footprint if the new accessory structure does not exceed the height and size limitations for accessory structures in effect at the time that the structure is rebuilt. 
7.9 Abandonment or Non-Use A nonconforming use of a structure or land that has been abandoned or not used for a continuous period of two (2) years shall not be reestablished, and any subsequent use of the structure or land shall conform to the provisions of the Zoning Bylaw. For the purposes of Section 7.0, temporary use or occupancy for one or more periods of less than sixty (60) days shall not be deemed to have interrupted a continuous period of non-use.

10.0	 OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
10.1 Floodplain Overlay District 
10.1.1 Statement of Purpose 
The purposes of the Floodplain Overlay District are to: 
1 Ensure public safety through reducing the threats to life and personal injury; 
2 Eliminate new hazards to emergency response officials; 
3 Prevent the occurrence of public emergencies resulting from water quality, 

contamination and pollution due to flooding; 
4 	Avoid the loss of utility services which if damaged by flooding would disrupt or shut down the utility network and impact regions of the community beyond the site of flooding; 
5 	Eliminate costs associated with the response and cleanup of flooding conditions; 
6 	Reduce damage to public and private property resulting from flooding waters. 
10.1.2 Boundaries of Floodplain District 
The Floodplain District is established as an overlay district. The Floodplain District includes all special flood hazard areas within the Town of Reading designated as Zone A and AE on the Middlesex County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the administration of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
The map panels of the Middlesex County FIRM that are wholly or partially within the Town of Reading are panel numbers 25017C0292E, 25017C0294E, 25017C0303E, 25017C0311E, 25017C0312E, 25017C0313E and 25017C0314E that go into effect on June 4, 2010. The exact boundaries of the District may be defined by the 100-year base flood elevations shown on the FIRM and further defined by the Middlesex County Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report dated June 4, 2010. The FIRM and FIS report are incorporated herein by reference and are on file with the Town Engineer. 
10.1.3 Definitions 
Area Of Special Flood Hazard: is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, V1-30, VE or V. 
Base Flood: means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Development: means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to building or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations. 
District: means floodplain district. 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): administers the National Flood Insurance Program. FEMA provides a nationwide flood hazard area mapping study program for communities as well as regulatory standards for development in the flood hazard areas. 
Flood Boundary And Floodway Map: means an official map of a community issued by FEMA that depicts, based on detailed analyses, the boundaries of the 100-year and 500 year floods and the 100-year floodway. (For maps done in 1987 and later, the floodway designation is included on the FIRM.) 
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): means an official map of a community issued by FEMA where the boundaries of the flood and related erosion areas having special hazards have been designated as Zone A or E. 
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): means an official map of a community on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
Flood Insurance Study: means an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards, and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of flood-related erosion hazards. 
Floodway: means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation. 
Lowest Floor: means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement or cellar). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, PROVIDED that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of NFIP Regulations 60.3. 
Manufactured Home: means a structure, transportable in one or more Sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles. 
Manufactured Home Park Or Subdivision: means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
New Construction: means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community. For the purpose of determining insurance rates, NEW CONSTRUCTION means structures for which the "start of construction" (as evidenced by issuance of a building permit) commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later. 
One-Hundred-Year Flood: - see Base Flood 
Regulatory Floodway: - see Floodway 
Special Flood Hazard Area: means an area having special flood and/or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, V, V1-30, VE. 
Structure: means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. STRUCTURE, for insurance coverage purposes, means a walled and roofed building, other than a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home on foundation. For the latter purpose, the term includes a building while in the course of construction, alteration, or repair, but does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in such construction, alteration, or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises. 
Substantial Damage: means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial Improvement: means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either (a) before the improvement or repair is started, or (b) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
Zone A: means the 100-year floodplain area where the base flood elevation (BFE) has not been determined. To determine the BFE, use the best available Federal, State, local or other data. 
Zone A1-30 and Zone AE: (for new and revised maps) mean the 100-year floodplain where the base flood elevation has been determined. 
Zone AH and Zone AO: means the 100-year floodplain with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
Zones B, C, and X: are areas identified in the community Flood Insurance Study as areas of moderate or minimal flood hazard. Zone X replaces Zones B and C on new and revised maps. 
10.1.4 Reference to Existing Regulations The Floodplain District is established as an overlay district to all other districts. All development in the district, including structural and non-structural activities, whether permitted by right or by special permit must be in compliance with Section 9 of Chapter 40A of the General Laws Chapter 131, Section 40 of the Massachusetts General Law and with the following: . Section of the Massachusetts State Building Code which addresses floodplain and coastal high hazard areas (currently 780 CMR 120.G, "Flood Resistant Construction and Construction in Coastal Dunes"); . Wetlands Protection Regulations, Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) (currently 310 CMR 10.00); . Inland Wetlands Restriction, DEP (currently 310 CMR 13.00); .

10.1.6.1 	If authorized by the Board of Appeals, commercial golf course, or non-profit social, civic or recreational use (but not including any use the chief activity of which is one customarily conducted as a business); and buildings and sheds accessory to any use permitted in the district. 
10.1.6.2 	If any land defined in the Bylaw as being in a Floodplain Overlay District is proven to be in fact neither subject to flooding nor unsuitable for human occupancy because of drainage and topographic conditions, and if the use of such land will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, the Board of Appeals may permit buildings for human occupancy on such land in accordance with the requirements of the underlying district after the necessary proof has been presented to and reported on by the Community Planning and Development Commission and the Board of Health. 
10.1.7 Uses Prohibited in the Floodplain Overlay District Dumping, filling or earth transfer or relocation operations are prohibited except for utility trenches, driveways, landscaping and accessory building foundations, or municipal or public facilities. 
10.1.8 	Conditions for Approval for uses Permitted in the Floodplain Overlay District 
10.1.8.1 	Within the floodplain overlay district, no new construction, substantial improvement or other land development shall be permitted unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood. For the purposes of this Section, substantial improvement shall be taken to mean any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either: a before the improvement is started, or b if the structure has been damaged and is being restored after the damage 
occurred. 
10.1.8.2 	For new construction, substantial improvements of existing structures or other land development, the following conditions shall apply: 1 All new construction or improvement of non-residential structures shall either 
have the lowest floor, including basement, at or above the base flood elevation, or along with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall be flood proofed; i.e., designed so that below the established base flood elevation, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
2 	Within Zones A and AE where base flood elevations are provided on the FIRM elevations shall be determined by using the flood profile contained in the Flood Insurance Study. 
3 	Within Zones A and AE, where the base flood elevation is not shown on the FIRM, the applicant shall obtain any existing base flood elevation data as a basis for the elevation and flood-proofing requirements of this Section and shall submit such base flood elevation data to the Board of Appeals at the time of making application for a special permit under this Section. When base flood data is not available, the base flood elevation shall be determined through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed by a registered professional engineer in accordance with standard engineering practices. 
4 	The structure will withstand the effects of flooding. The ground level around and extending 25 ft. outward from any building or structure in a Floodplain District shall be raised as necessary so that no part of the ground level area so defined, shall be below the elevation shown on the FIRM. Embankments subject to possible scouring by flood waters shall be properly stabilized and protected to prevent erosion by flood waters. 
5 	The containment of sewerage, safety of gas, electric, fuel, and other utilities from breaking, leaking, short circuiting, grounding, igniting, electrocuting or any other dangers due to flooding, will be adequately protected. 
6 	Safe vehicular and pedestrian movement to or over, and from the premises shall be provided on ways having a minimum profile elevation of no less than the base flood elevation. 
7 	Methods of drainage shall be adequate. 
8 	Other land in the Floodplain Overlay District shall be protected from impacts resulting from all work of development both approved and not approved on the premises. 
9 	Where watertight flood proofing of a structure is permitted, a registered professional engineer shall verify that the methods used will be adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures and velocities, impact and uplift, and other factors associated with the base flood. 
10 A registered professional engineer shall certify that the above minimum conditions listed in Sections 10.1.4 and 10.1.8 are satisfied in the design proposal. 
10.1.9	 Base Flood Elevation and Floodway Date 
10.1.9.1 	Floodway Data. In Zones A, and AE, along watercourses that have not had a regulatory floodway designated, the best available Federal, State, local or other floodway data shall be used to prohibit encroachments in floodways which would result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
10.1.9.2 	Base Flood Elevation Data. Base flood elevation data is required for subdivision proposals or other developments greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, within unnumbered A zones. 
10.1.10 Notification of Watercourse Alteration In a riverine situation, the Conservation Commission shall notify the following of any alteration or relocation of a watercourse: . Adjacent Communities

c 	Within thirty-five days of a request for a joint public hearing, the CPDC and the Conservation Commission shall hold at least one session of a joint public meeting with the Developer to discuss the development concept and the options, issues, concerns and other matters relative to the proposal. All ‘parties of interest’ shall be given such notice of this meeting as required for a public hearing under Massachusetts General Law Chapter 40A. Particular attention shall be paid to: 1 Obtaining input from both Commissions simultaneously. 2 Identifying concepts, options and approaches relative to the 
development, potentially acceptable to both Commissions within their respective purview, authority and responsibilities. 3 Reviewing mitigation measures which meet the concerns of both Commissions. 
d 	Within sixty-five days of the filing by the Developer of a complete Final PUD Plan, the CPDC shall hold a public hearing to consider issuance of a Special Permit to construct a PUD. The Final PUD Plan shall be a definitive plan of the development and contain such information as specified in Section 11.1.3.9 Approval of the Special Permit shall be granted upon determination by the CPDC that the Final PUD Plan conforms with and meets the applicable requirements, standards and guidelines set forth in Sections 11.1.4, 11.1.5, and 11.1.6 in a manner consistent with the concept presented and the Commission’s input received according to Paragraph 11.1.3.1.1.b The Special Permit may be granted with conditions, or not granted, or granted by inaction, according to Section 
11.1.3.11. 
The Final PUD Plan may include application for approval of a proposed subdivision of the site in accordance with the Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Reading. A separate endorsable Definitive Subdivision Plan meeting the requirements of said Rules and Regulations may be included as part of the Final PUD Plan documents, and the public hearing for consideration of such subdivision plan shall be held by CPDC concurrent with the Special Permit public hearing referenced herein. 
At the Developer’s election, the Conservation Commission shall hold at least one session of a public hearing simultaneously with the CPDC Special Permit public hearing referenced herein, for considering the Developer’s Notice of Intent relative to the proposed PUD development. The hearing shall be scheduled mutually between the CPDC and the Conservation Commission. The request for such simultaneous public hearing must be accompanied by or preceded by a complete Notice of Intent submission and all relevant application fees in accordance with Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 131, Section 40 and Reading General Bylaw, Section 7.1, and a waiver of the time requirements for the Conservation Commission’s holding of a hearing and issuance of an Order of Conditions under said Chapter 131, Section 40 and said General Bylaw, Section 7.1 The Conservation Commission may at its discretion continue sessions of its public hearing to or deliberate an Order of Conditions at places and times independent of the CPDC’s public hearing or meetings. 
11.1.3.2 Pre-Application Conference A Developer desiring to obtain a Special Permit to construct a Planned Unit Development may request a Pre-Application Conference with the Community Planning and Development Commission prior to submitting an application for the Special Permit. 
The purpose of the Pre-Application Conference shall be to discuss both the Developer’s intentions and the CPDC’s requirements with respect to the proposed PUD. Although not required, this preliminary meeting is desirable since it should help to clarify many procedural and policy issues. 
At the Pre-Application Conference, the CPDC shall discuss with the Developer the process for obtaining a Special Permit to construct a PUD and explain to him/her issues and scopes of studies that should be considered in planning the project, including specific submission items, such as appropriate vantage points for visual analysis and extent of the traffic study area. The need for a three-dimensional model for large projects shall be discussed by the developer and CPDC and a determination shall be made as to whether such a model shall be an application requirement. The CPDC shall review existing studies pertinent to the development and the status of other approved PUDs which should be considered in the Developer’s analyses. The Developer may discuss his/her development concept and range of options concerning development. Any statement at the Pre-Application Conference made by either the CPDC or the Developer concerning potential disposition of a Special Permit application or the final form of the development shall not be legally binding. 
The Developer shall not be required to present any written, quantitative, or graphic materials at the Pre-Application Conference. The CPDC shall make available to the Developer at this time any forms required for application for a Special Permit to construct a PUD. 
11.1.3.3 Special Permit Application A Developer who wishes to apply for a Special Permit to construct a PUD shall submit to the CPDC an application including a Preliminary PUD Plan submission for the entire proposed project. If the Developer of the PUD comprises more than one entity, all participating entities shall be signatories to the Special Permit application. Two copies of the Preliminary PUD Plan shall remain available to the public during the application process and shall be located in the Town Clerk’s Office and Reading Public Library. Any three-dimensional model of the proposed project as may be required shall be displayed at a suitable public building within the Town. 
The CPDC shall require a Submission Fee sufficient to cover consultant fees and any other costs associated with reviewing the Preliminary and Final Plan Submissions. The fee amounts shall be as specified in the CPDC’s “Fee Schedule for Site Plan Review Process.” 
11.1.3.4 Preliminary Plan Submission The Preliminary PUD Plan shall include a complete set of written, quantitative, and graphic materials in the appropriate number according to the PUD Plan Submission Regulations adopted by the CPDC and amended by it from time to time in accordance with Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 40A, Section 9. 
11.1.3.5 Town Review Between the date a Developer submits a complete application for a Special Permit to construct a PUD and the date of the first Public Hearing, the CPDC may distribute the Preliminary PUD Plan for review to Town Departments, elected and appointed Town Boards, and such professional planning, architecture, and engineering consultants as the CPDC deems appropriate and whose fees are paid for by the developer. All comments on the Preliminary PUD Plan shall be submitted in writing to the CPDC before the scheduled date of the first Public Hearing. All written comments shall be made a part of the public record on the application for a Special Permit and shall remain a public record. 
11.1.3.6 Public Hearing Within 65 days of the date of receipt of a complete application for a Special Permit to construct a PUD, the CPDC shall hold a Public Hearing. The purpose of the Public Hearing shall be to solicit public comments concerning the proposed PUD application. 
11.1.3.7 Action on Preliminary Plan Within 21 days after the opening of said Public Hearing, the CPDC shall make a determination concerning the Preliminary PUD Plan. The developer shall submit a final PUD Plan, as specified in Section 11.1.3.9. 
11.1.3.8 Public Improvements Compensation When reviewing a Developer’s Preliminary PUD Plan, the CPDC shall analyze the proposed PUD to determine what if any extraordinary public improvements are necessary to accommodate or service the project. The Developer shall be required by the CPDC to provide such needed improvements at no cost to the Town, or alternatively, to offset the expense of such improvements to be provided by the Town. The CPDC shall engage a consultant, at the expense of the applicant to estimate the costs of any such improvements. Such estimate shall be reviewed by the Reading Public Works Director and the Town Engineer. 
11.1.3.9 Submission of Final Plan The Final PUD Plan shall be a definitive plan of development with design sufficiently developed to provide the basis for the CPDC’s determinations regarding the requirements, standards, and guidelines of this PUD Bylaw, and shall include a complete set of written, quantitative, and graphic materials in the appropriate number according to the PUD Plan Submission Regulations adopted by the CPDC and amended by it from time to time in accordance with Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 40A, Section 9. The Final PUD Plan shall be consistent with the Preliminary PUD Plan except for changes by amendment or in accordance with comments of the CPDC on the Preliminary PUD Plan and shall satisfy all such comments. Two copies of the Final PUD Plan shall remain available to the public during the application process and shall be located in the Town Clerk’s Office and the Reading Public Library. Any three-dimensional model of the proposed project as may be required shall be displayed at a suitable public building within the Town. 
11.1.3.10 	Additions or Amendments to the Preliminary Plan Additions or amendments to the Preliminary PUD Plan at this stage shall be deemed either major or minor by the CPDC according to Sections 11.1.3.13 and 
11.1.3.14 Minor additions or amendments shall be authorized by written approval of the CPDC. Major additions or amendments shall be considered as original items to the application and be subject to the procedures specified in Section 
11.1.3.12. The CPDC shall decide whether proposed changes are major or minor. 
11.1.3.11 Decision on Final Plan The CPDC shall consider issuance of a Special Permit to construct a PUD in accordance with the Final PUD Plan. Approval of the Special Permit shall be granted upon determination by the CPDC that the Final PUD Plan conforms with and meets the applicable requirements, standards, and guidelines set forth in Sections 11.1.4, 11.1.5, and 11.1.6 The CPDC may grant the Special Permit with conditions, and the conditions shall be agreed to in writing by the Developer before the Special Permit is granted. If not granting a Special Permit to construct a PUD, the CPDC shall make its final decision in writing and shall specify its reasons for denial. If the CPDC makes no decision after the close of the Public Hearing, then the Final PUD Plan shall be considered approved and the Special Permit to construct a PUD shall be deemed granted. 
11.1.3.12 Amendments to Final Plan After approval of the Special Permit by the CPDC, the Developer may seek amendments to the Final PUD Plan. Amendments to the Final PUD Plan shall be considered major or minor. Minor amendments, as specified in Section 11.1.3.13 shall be authorized by written approval of the CPDC. Major amendments, as specified in Section 11.1.3.14 shall be grounds for reconsideration of the Special Permit to construct a PUD and shall be reviewed subject to procedures specified above in Sections 11.1.3.4 through 11.1.3.12, as applicable. Denial of a proposed major amendment shall not invalidate the Special Permit to construct a PUD in conformance with the previously approved Final PUD Plan. 
11.1.3.13 Minor Amendments Minor Amendments are changes which do not substantially alter the concept of the approved PUD in terms of floor area ratio, use, height, provision of open space, or the physical relationship of elements of the development. Minor amendments shall include, but not be limited to the following: small changes in floor area, mix of uses, site coverage, height, setbacks, or open space; small changes in the location of buildings, open space, or parking; or small changes in the alignment of minor streets on-site. 
11.1.3.14 Major Amendments Major Amendments represent substantial deviations from the PUD concept approved by the CPDC. Major amendments shall include but not be limited to the following: large changes in floor area, mix of uses, site coverage, height, setbacks, or open space; large changes in the location of buildings, open space, or parking; or large changes in the circulation system, including the number and location of access ways. 
11.1.3.15 Development Schedule The Developer shall begin construction of the PUD within 24 months of the date of the granting of the Special Permit (or, if applicable, following appeal as provided in Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 40A, Section 9) in reasonable conformance with the development schedule submitted with the Final PUD Plan. The CPDC shall grant in writing an extension of this time period of up to an additional 24 months upon determination of good cause. If the Developer fails to commence construction of the PUD within 24 months plus any approved extension period, the Special Permit shall lapse. 
11.1.3.16 Phased Development If a phased development is proposed by the Developer, the Final PUD Plan shall contain all required written, quantitative, and graphic information necessary to evaluate the proposed PUD as a whole and to serve as a basis for granting the Special Permit, plus a final Development Schedule for the completion of the PUD indicating the proposed dates and scope of work to be accomplished in each phase. Site improvements may be phased only in conformity with the phasing schedule included in the approved Final PUD Plan, and only to the extent that all requirements, standards, and guidelines of this PUD Bylaw are met in each phase. The initial phase shall include at a minimum the site improvements necessary for one or more buildings and may, at the Developer’s option, include one or more buildings. 
Deviations from the Final PUD Plan in any phase shall be designated a major or minor amendment to the Final PUD Plan by the CPDC and treated as such according to Section 11.1.3.13. 
If the PUD is to be developed in phases, the Developer shall begin the construction of each phase in accordance with the approved Phasing Schedule; however, the CPDC shall grant additional extensions in the timing of phases for up to 24 months each as minor amendments to the Final PUD Plan, upon the determination of a reasonable cause. If the Developer fails to commence construction of a PUD phase within the specified time limit for that phase, including any approved extension period, said failure shall be deemed a major amendment to the Final PUD Plan, and the phase at issue and all subsequent phases which depend upon said phase for their construction and operation in conformance with the Final PUD Plan must be re-approved in accordance with Section 11.1.3.13. 
11.1.3.17 Conformity with PUD Plan and Special Permit The CPDC shall include as a condition to all Special Permits granted for construction of PUDs that no construction of a PUD or any phase thereof may be authorized until the CPDC has reviewed and approved a Design Submission for work to be done, such submission to include architectural, site, and landscape design documents, sufficiently developed to permit review of conformance to the Final PUD Plan and Special Permit conditions, in accordance with the PUD Plan Submission Regulations of the CPDC. 
If deemed necessary by the CPDC, a Public Hearing may be held for review of any Design Submission. Design Submissions shall be reviewed by the CPDC solely for conformity with the Final PUD Plan, with Special Permit conditions, and, only to the extent not already reviewed and approved, with the requirements, standards, and guidelines applicable to the construction of the phase in question. If the CPDC makes no decision upon a Design Submission within 90 days of receipt of all required materials, said Special Permit condition shall be deemed to be satisfied regarding said PUD or phase thereof. 
The CPDC shall adopt regulations requiring one or more of the following in amounts and duration sufficient to guarantee that all commitments in the approved PUD Plan to provide public improvements or to take other actions are properly completed: performance bonds, deposit of money or negotiable securities with the Town, or a satisfactory agreement with a lending institution to retain funds pending completion of such improvements or actions. If a PUD Plan is being developed in phases such guarantees may be provided in the discretion of the CPDC in increments relative to the phases being developed. 
If, for any PUD or construction phase thereof, the CPDC finds that either the Developer has failed to begin development within the specified time period, including any approved extension period, or that the Developer is not proceeding in conformity with the Special Permit, then the CPDC may, after 60 days from written notice (and any additional period which the CPDC may deem necessary so as to provide the Developer reasonable opportunity to cure any deficiencies), revoke the Special Permit as it applies to the phase of construction at issue, and/or require that the Developer amend the Final PUD Plan subject to procedures specified in the Amendments to Final PUD Plan, Section 11.1.3.13. If the CPDC revokes the Special Permit for the PUD then the Final PUD Plan shall be null and void as it applies to the phase of construction at issue and all subsequent phases which depend upon said phase for their construction and operation in conformance with the Final PUD Plan. The provisions of this paragraph are additional to the Reading Building Inspector’s powers of enforcement under the Zoning Bylaw and Massachusetts State Building Code. 
Upon satisfaction of all applicable Special Permit conditions, the CPDC shall issue a certificate of compliance for one or more PUD phases. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a given PUD-I phase until a certificate of compliance has been issued. 
11.1.4 Use and Dimensional Requirements at PUD-I The following paragraphs shall serve as the basic Use and Dimension Requirements to which all PUD-I projects shall adhere within each PUD-I overlay district and shall be used by the Community Planning and Development Commission to evaluate any proposed project. 
11.1.4.1 PUD-I Parcel Size and Eligibility 
The minimum size of a PUD-I development parcel shall be 80,000 square feet. Development parcels of 500,000 square feet or larger shall be termed “large PUD-Is” and qualifying parcels smaller than 500,000 square feet shall be termed “small PUD-Is.” 
A development parcel may consist of land in more than one ownership, provided that all lots comprised by the parcel lie entirely within the PUD-I overlay district and are contiguous. Lots separated by a minor street or right-of-way as defined in Section 11.1.2.1 may be considered contiguous for this purpose. 
Proposed developments may include pre-existing buildings provided that all PUD­I requirements are satisfied by each new or existing building and for the PUD as a whole. More than one principal building may be located on a lot, Section 6.2.8 notwithstanding. 
11.1.4.2 PUD-I Permitted Uses 
Planned Unit Developments in an Industrial District may contain two or more of 
the following uses subject to the findings of the CPDC as to net benefit and 
adverse impacts of the proposed PUD: 
a Office use; 
b Research and Development uses, such as electronic or computer laboratories; 

biotechnology laboratories including those which utilize RDNA technology and low-level nuclear materials; light manufacturing related to electronic or computer laboratories or biotechnology laboratories including those which utilize RDNA technology and low-level nuclear materials, but excluding activities which exclusively possess, use or transfer licensed nuclear materials (including source materials, special nuclear materials, or by-product materials as defined in Title 10, Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, “Standards for Protection Against Radiation”), or other toxic or hazardous materials; 
c Hotel; 
d Restaurant (with no drive-thru service), place of assembly, and recreational 

use; e Retail; f Financial institution; g Consumer service, ancillary to a permitted primary use pursuant to this 
Section 11.1.4.2.; h Parking (including structured parking) to accommodate the above; i Residential uses within 200 feet of Residence Districts; j Open space. 
All other uses are excluded from a Planned Unit Development in an Industrial zone. 
11.1.4.3 PUD-I Intensity of Use The permitted intensity of use in a PUD-I development shall be expressed as the ratio of total gross building floor area to the area of the development parcel (Floor Area Ratio or “FAR”). Gross floor area shall be measured from outside wall surfaces and shall include ground floor areas of interior atriums and lobbies, and mechanical and utility space on habitable floors; but shall exclude rooftop space, balconies, elevator pits, or non-habitable areas enclosed by ornamental roofs. Structured parking shall not be counted in the determination of Floor Area Ratio. Areas classified as wetlands in Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 131, Section 40, as amended, may not exceed 10% of the development parcel area used to compute FAR. The basic allowable FAR for PUD-I developments is 0.50 for small PUD-Is and 0.55 for large PUD-Is. 
11.1.4.4 PUD-I Discretionary Intensity and Height Determination The CPDC may approve additional FAR above the basic ratio for small or large PUD-Is and additional height above the basic limit if it finds in applying the criteria of Section 11.1.4.5 that the net benefits to the Town are thereby increased. 
The CPDC may in no case increase the permitted Floor Area Ratio beyond 0.65 for small PUD-Is and 0.70 for large PUD-Is nor may it increase permitted height beyond the maximum limitations of Section 11.1.4.6. 
11.1.4.5 Criteria for Determining Increased Development Intensity and Height in a PUD-I District The basic allowable intensity of use may be increased in a PUD-I if the CPDC finds that provision of one or more of the following public improvements or amenities provides substantial public benefits. The additional building area permitted should be commensurate with the quality and value to the Town of one or more of the following improvements and amenities: a Significant improvement of the environmental condition of a site; b Provision of or contribution to off-site public facility improvements which enhance the general condition of the district and surrounding areas; c Dedication of open space or recreational facilities for use by the general public; d Provision of open space beyond 15% of the parcel area, or of outdoor recreational facilities for use by a PUD-I project’s occupants or by the general public, and of sufficient size and quality to offset fully any adverse aesthetic effects of proposed parking garages; e Work with other owners and tenants of a PUD-I overlay district to develop and achieve district wide and adjacent neighborhood improvement goals; f Provision of public art, distinctive and appropriate design, or other amenities that a Developer may propose which will provide unique advantages to the general public or contribute to achieving Town-wide improvement goals; g Provision of low or moderate income or elderly housing within the PUD-I in conformance with this PUD-I Bylaw and/or off site in a manner acceptable to the Reading Housing Authority. 
11.1.4.6 PUD-I Dimensional Requirements Each PUD-I development shall be governed by the dimensional requirements of this Section. These requirements apply only to the development parcel as a whole, not to individual lots within the PUD-I. 
The basic maximum height within a PUD-I shall be the lesser of 84 feet or six stories. Height shall be measured in the manner defined in Section 2.0. of this Bylaw. 
The maximum height of residential structures within a PUD-I shall not exceed 40 feet or three stories. If 10 percent of such units are restricted for low or moderate income or elderly housing, the maximum height of all proposed residential structures shall not exceed 50 feet or four stories. 
In a large PUD-I, the CPDC may in its discretion and in accordance with Section 
11.1.4.4 approve building heights up to 168 feet or 12 stories, whichever is less, 
subject to the following limitations: 
a Buildings with over eight stories may not contain in aggregate more than one 

third of the total gross floor area of the PUD-I; 
b 	At least one third of the gross floor area of the PUD-I shall be contained in buildings with six stories or lower; 
c 	Only one building over 10 stories may be built for every 1,000,000 square feet of PUD-I parcel area; 
d 	Buildings shall be oriented and arranged to provide the best overall appearance from important vantage points, which may be identified in a Pre-Application Conference; 
e 	The increase in permitted height may not have any significant adverse effect on the PUD-I Overlay District, adjacent residential districts or abutting property. 
However, the CPDC shall in no case approve building heights above the basic maximum height for any Planned Unit Development-Industrial in the area bounded by the MBTA railroad right-of-way and by the lots fronting on Ash Street. 
11.1.4.6.1 PUD-I Setbacks and Buffers 
All non-residential buildings shall be located at least 50 feet from the boundary of the PUD-I parcel. All non-residential buildings shall be located at least 150 feet from residential structures in existence at the time of Preliminary PUD-I Plan submission. 
All residential buildings within a PUD-I shall be at least 30 feet from the parcel boundary but no further than 200 feet from a Residential District. There shall be a landscaped and/or naturally vegetated buffer at least 50 feet wide where the development parcel abuts residential properties. Alternatively, where residential uses occur in the PUD-I, a landscaped and/or naturally vegetated buffer at least 30 feet wide shall be provided. 
Along major arterial streets, as defined in Section 11.1.2.1, buildings shall be set back at least 75 feet (or the height of the building if greater than 75 feet), and a landscaped and/or naturally vegetated buffer at least 50 feet wide shall be provided along such major streets, except where site entrances occur. 
No buffer may contain parking or paved surfaces except for pedestrian paths and site entrances. Between 9 00 a.m. and 3 00 p.m. (EST) from February 21 to October 21, no building may cast a shadow on any residential structure in existence at the time of Preliminary PUD-I Plan submission. 
A PUD-I shall set aside at least 15% of its total parcel area as required open space; additional open space will be considered in proposed development intensities in excess of the basic permitted FAR and height. 
Required Open Space shall have a minimum dimension of 20 feet (which may include the dimension across a water body) and shall be open to tenants and customers within the PUD-I; access by the general public is desirable and will be considered in proposals for additional development intensity and height. 
A PUD-I which includes residential use shall delineate the area of residential use and shall set aside at least 25% of the site within this area as open space available to and usable by the occupants of the residential units. 
Required Open Space may include: 
a 	Wetlands and water bodies, including the normal water surface area of detention or retention ponds up to 50% of the required open space area; 
b Vegetated/landscaped area, including buffers; c Pedestrian paths, sidewalks, and covered walkways; d Public plazas and hard surfaced recreation areas. 
11.1.5 Environmental Standards and General Development Guidelines In addition to conforming to the Use and Dimensional Requirements governing all PUD Overlay Districts, approval of a Special Permit to construct a PUD shall be granted also upon determination by the Community Planning and Development Commission that a proposed PUD satisfies the following criteria; in any disapproval of a PUD, the CPDC shall state in writing the specific reasons for its finding that the proposed PUD does not satisfy one or more of the criteria. Mitigation measures proposed by the Developer, at no cost to the Town, shall be considered. Mitigation measures may include, among other options the advancement or contribution to long term capital improvement projects. 
The following is the criteria CPDC shall use in making such satisfactory determinations: a That it conforms as appropriate to the existing policy plans established by the 
Town Meeting, Selectmen, and CPDC for the specific area of the Town in which the proposed PUD is located. 
b That there is no significant adverse effect under any of the following: 
1 	Quality of site design, building design, and landscaping as they affect occupants of the proposed development, the PUD Overlay District, adjacent residential districts, and the Town of Reading as a whole; 
2 	Traffic flow and safety in the context of this and other proposed developments in the PUD Overlay District and sensitive nearby areas, which may be identified in the scope of a State Environmental Impact Report and/or in a 
Pre-Application Conference; 3 Water quality, air quality, wetlands, and the natural environment; 4 Provision of open space; 5 Adequacy of utilities and other public works and impact on existing public 
facilities within the Town; and 
6 Potential fiscal impact to the Town of Reading. 
c 

That approval of the proposed PUD provides benefits to the Town which outweigh all adverse effects, as evaluated under the above criteria. 
11.1.5.1 Environmental Standards A PUD shall conform in each phase to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations (including all such regulations established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection) regarding the environment such as those concerning noise, air quality, wetlands, water quality, and protection from flooding. 
11.1.5.2 Transportation, Site Circulation and Parking No vehicular access (except for emergency vehicles and structured parking access) shall be allowed between the portion of a Planned Unit Development used for non-residential purposes and any residential street. Safeguards shall be imposed by the CPDC to prohibit or minimize commercial traffic access across residential areas. Dwellings built pursuant to a PUD-R Special Permit and which are located within 300 feet of a Town Boundary shall be accessed through the abutting municipality to the extent lawful and feasible as determined by the CPDC. 
11.1.5.2.1 Significant Traffic Impact 
The CPDC may not approve a proposed PUD which in its opinion has significant adverse traffic impact, as determined following examination by the CPDC of the Developer’s traffic analysis and any other traffic analysis of the affected area available to the CPDC which is germane to the proposed PUD. In making its determination, the CPDC shall consider the feasibility of any capacity improvements and mitigating measures proposed to be provided by the Developer at no cost to the Town. In making such determinations, the full traffic impact of all other previously approved and valid permits shall be considered, regardless of project phasing. Without limitation, the determination of significant adverse impact shall consider traffic volumes, speeds, and resulting levels of service on residential streets, approaches to the site of the proposed PUD, and other key locations, all of which may be identified in a Pre-Application Conference. 
11.1.5.2.2 Transportation Plan 
The PUD Developer shall prepare an acceptable Transportation Plan aimed at reducing traffic congestion through means such as spreading peak hour traffic, encouraging public transportation use and ride sharing. The Plan shall include transportation goals and specific means to achieve them, such as employment of a Transportation Coordinator to facilitate proposed actions; provision of shuttle bus service to public transportation; van-pooling programs; and flex-time requirements. The Plan shall to the extent feasible include provisions to establish a mechanism for participation in the Plan by subsequent owners and tenants of the PUD, and the Developer shall guarantee sufficient

Zoning Bylaw 	Planned Development 
financing of the Transportation Plan to initiate and continue its operation through the first year of PUD occupancy. Developers may arrange to coordinate their plans and share in the cost of such measures on an area wide basis. 
Site circulation shall meet accepted design standards for private automobiles, service vehicles, and emergency vehicles. 
It is highly desirable to consolidate access to PUD’s in a small number of widely spaced principal access points, which may be driveways or Town-accepted side streets lying entirely within the PUD Overlay District. Principal access should be consolidated in as few locations as possible and, if feasible, it is desirable for adjacent developments to share principal access. Principal access points generally should be spaced and aligned or alternated according to good traffic engineering practice, and should be signalized if necessary. 
Parking should be provided in at least the following ratios through each phase of development, unless the CPDC determines that a larger number of spaces are dictated by special circumstances: a For office and research and development uses, and uses ancillary 
to them, three parking spaces per 1000 gross square feet of floor area; b For hotels and customary uses within them, one parking space per rentable room or suite; 
c 	For residential uses, two parking spaces per unit, which parking spaces may be stacked (one space being located directly behind the other) to a depth of two spaces if serving the same residential unit. The CPDC may allow shared parking on adjacent premises to count towards the residential parking requirement, if the CPDC determines that such shared parking meets the criteria in Section 11.1.5.2.5; 
d 	For places of assembly, one parking space per four seats; 
e 	For restaurants, one parking space for every four persons of the rated seating capacity of the facility, plus one parking space for every employee on the largest shift; 
f 	For retail uses, one parking space per three hundred square feet of gross sales floor area; 
g 	For financial institutions, one parking space for each one hundred square feet of floor area devoted to general banking services for public uses, including area for automatic teller machines, plus one parking space for each two hundred and fifty square feet devoted to office use, plus stacking lanes for six cars at each drive-thru, plus one bypass lane for the drive-thru area. 
Ancillary uses should not normally require additional parking spaces. 
Loading requirements shall be determined based on activity analysis provided by the Developer. 
Parking stall size shall be at least 8.5 by 18 feet, with provision for larger spaces as required by the CPDC to accommodate short term parking, handicapped and large vehicles. Parking lots shall be landscaped in conformance with Section 11.1.5.5.6. 
11.1.5.2.5 	Shared parking may be approved by the CPDC as part of the PUD decision subject to the following criteria: a Shared parking areas must be shown on a plan, be definable, be 
separated by topography from other shared parking areas, and be in close proximity to the uses they serve; 
b 	Parking needs between the uses sharing parking areas shall be shown by the applicant to be different in terms of the times of the peak needs with little overlap of such peak needs; 
c 	The number of parking spaces for a shared parking area shall be at least the required number for the larger of the needs; 
d 	An executed lease or other form of agreement between or referencing the parties sharing parking must be filed with the CPDC and the Town Clerk prior to issuance of a building permit for the uses sharing the parking, such agreement shall be approved as to form, only, by Town Counsel; 
e 	If uses, or parties in interest noted in subsection d. above, change for the areas delineated on the PUD plan, then a modification subject to the requirements of Section 11.1.3.14 shall be filed and decided upon by the CPDC prior to the issuance of building permits for the proposed areas. 
11.1.5.2.6 	Roadways within a PUD shall be constructed in conformance with standards established by the Reading Department of Public Works. The design of the overall circulation pattern shall be prepared in accordance with the principles and concepts established in “Recommended Practices for Subdivision Streets” prepared by the Institute of Traffic Engineers (1965). 
11.1.5.3 Public Works Standards All on-site and off-site improvements, which include the installation of utilities, public lighting, sewers and other public improvements, shall be constructed according to the standards of the Reading Public Works Department and other appropriate departments. 
11.1.5.4 Control of Runoff and Flooding The Developer shall demonstrate that, as compared with the situation that would exist on the site without the PUD, no phase of the proposed PUD will result in an increase in the peak rate of storm run-off at the parcel boundary for the PUD as a whole for the 25, 50, and 100 year design storms, and that there will be no net loss in flood storage capacity for the 100 year design storm. In making such determinations, any state or local orders or requirements that apply (for example, required closure of landfills or existing Orders of Conditions under the Wetlands Protection Act) shall be assumed in the calculations of runoff and flood storage without the PUD, but alternative forms of development shall not be assumed. 
11.1.5.5 Design Quality Project design shall be reviewed by CPDC with input from Town officials, the review consultant(s) employed by the CPDC, and other property owners in the PUD Overlay District. The following are to be interpreted as guidelines to be applied flexibly by the CPDC and as appropriate to the situation under review, including factors such as foundation conditions and other extraordinary constraints. These guidelines apply to all site improvements, buildings and structures, including structured parking facilities. 
11.1.5.5.1	 Building Placement a Provide and preserve attractive views from major vantage points, especially from major thoroughfares and residential neighborhoods. 
b 	Avoid regular spacing and building placements that will be viewed as continuous walls from important vantage points, which may be identified in a PUD Pre-Application Conference. 
11.1.5.5.2	 Building Massing/Articulation a Avoid unbroken building facades longer than 100 feet. b Provide human scale features, especially at street level. c Avoid unarticulated and monotonous building facades and window 
placement. 
11.1.5.5.3	 Roofline Articulation a Provide a variety of building heights and varied roofline articulation. b Provide step backs above the fourth level on buildings within 100 feet of major streets. 
c 	In PUDs comprising three or more buildings, and where buildings over six stories in height are proposed, locate taller buildings away from major street and residential uses. 
11.1.5.5.4 Building Materials a Use materials and building treatments that reduce the visibility of buildings from distant vantage points and are compatible with backgrounds and surroundings. 
b 	Use materials and colors compatible with other quality buildings of similar scale in the area. 
11.1.5.5.5 Landscape Treatment a All open areas within a PUD should be landscaped in an appropriate manner utilizing both natural and manmade materials such as grass, trees, shrubs, attractive paving materials and outdoor furniture. b Deciduous trees should be planted along new and existing streets. c Plazas, arcades, malls, and similar amenities are encouraged. d Outdoor lighting should be considered in the landscaping plan and should be designed to complement both manmade and natural elements of the PUD and adjacent areas. e Intensive, high quality landscaping should be provided within the PUD where it abuts major streets and on internal drives to achieve a boulevard character. 
f 	Landscape treatment should be emphasized on site boundaries facing residential districts. g Existing vegetation shall be maintained wherever possible to provide buffers and enhance site development. 
11.1.5.5.6	 Parking Lots 
a 	Parking lots should use landscaping, screening, and terracing to break up large areas of pavement and to enhance the appearance of such areas to the greatest extent feasible, but no less than 5% of the total parking lot area. 
b 	Most parking lot landscaping should have a minimum dimension of five feet. 
c 	Trees and shrubs should be used to the maximum extent feasible. 
11.1.5.5.7	 Pedestrian Amenities 
a 	Emphasize pedestrian amenities such as covered walkways, landscaped open space, drop-off areas, and recreation facilities such as pedestrian and/or jogging paths along on-site watercourses or which follow a PUD parcel boundary. 
b 	Tree lined or otherwise appropriately landscaped pedestrian walkways should link together areas designated as open space within the boundaries of a site and wherever possible with designated open space throughout a PUD Overlay District. 
11.1.5.5.8 	Utilities a To the extent feasible, all utilities should be located underground. 
11.1.5.6 Signage 
11.1.5.6.1 	CPDC will review all allowed signage pursuant to the requirements of Section 11.1.5.6.4 and the following general criteria: a Signage shall minimally meet the purpose of facilitating public and 
private convenience and necessity; providing direction and facilitate proper traffic flow; alleviating congestion on public streets; providing sufficient access to private lands and businesses; minimizing curb cuts to public streets; or encouraging utilization of fewer (or a single) curb cuts by more than one user. 
b Sign scale is appropriate in relation to development scale, viewer 
distance and travel speed, and sign sizes on nearby structures. 
c Sign materials, colors, lettering style and forms are compatible 

with building design and use. 
d 	Sign content does not overcrowd the background. 
e 	Sign legibility is not impaired by excessive complexity, multiple 
lettering styles or colors or other distracting elements. 
f 	In cases where access to a public street is pursuant to Massachusetts State Curb Cut, the Massachusetts Highway Department shall be consulted. 
11.1.5.6.2 	CPDC will review all allowed signage pursuant to the requirements of Section 11.1.5.6.4 and shall use the following additional criteria to determine (unless otherwise provided for in this Section 11.1.5.6) the number, sizes/dimensions, and locations of all signs on the lot: a The relationship between the size of a building facade(s) with the 
size of the sign for that building; 
b 	The relationship between the number of tenants with the size of the sign; 
c 	The relationship between the size of a sign and the distance between the structure; 
d 	The relationship of the location of entrance points to the lot from existing roadways, the parking areas, and the internal circulation design to the location and size of signs; 
e 	The relationship of the topography of the lot and existing vegetation on or off the lot as it relates to the siting and visibility of a sign from the adjacent roadways; 
f 	The relationship of the topography of the lot to the siting and 
visibility of a sign from adjacent residential uses; 
g 	Site distance calculations and motor vehicle traffic and speeds; 
h 	The utility of the sign as it relates specifically to the purposes 
stated in Section 11.1.5.6.1.a above. 
11.1.5.6.3 Overall Signage Requirements a Signage shall be so designed, located, and sized to meet the minimal requirement of clear direction to the site and through the site. b No sign, portion of a sign, or structural support for such sign should extend above the lowest point of the main roofline of a building the sign serves in identifying, unless otherwise approved by the CPDC. c Any lighting of a sign shall be constant (non-blinking), stationary and installed in a manner that will prevent light from falling on any street or adjacent property. Lighting shall be directed solely at the sign, or be internal to the sign. All internally illuminated signs shall have an opaque background or signboard such that illumination shows through only the lettering and/or graphics. 
d 	No sign shall be illuminated between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 
6:00 a.m. except signs for businesses open during those hours. e Signs shall not be designed, colored, or placed to create a hazardous condition for motor vehicle traffic. 
f 	No animated, moving, or flashing signs shall be permitted on the building or in the building so as to be seen from the outside, on the lot or the adjacent lot. Traditional holiday decorations and lights, when in season, are allowed. 
g 	Temporary real estate signs advertising rental, lease, or sale of the property, or part thereof, shall be allowed for each use for up to ninety (90) days by application to the Building Inspector. Such signs shall be set back a minimum often (10) feet from the street line, shall be unlighted and shall not exceed sixteen (16) square feet in area. Renewals of temporary real estate signs shall be allowed by application to the Building Inspector. One such real estate sign per lot, not to exceed thirty-two (32) square feet in area and twelve (12) feet in height shall be allowed, upon application to the Building Inspector, for a period not to exceed the date of the end of the PUD decision appeal period to the date of occupancy of the first phase of the approved PUD development. 
h 	No window signs or any other interior signage that is visible from the outside is allowed. 
i 	Repair and Maintenance - The Building Inspector is authorized to order the repair or removal of any sign and its supporting structure that, in the judgment of the Building Inspector, is dangerous, or in disrepair, or which is erected or maintained contrary to this Bylaw. Such repair or removal shall be the responsibility of the building owner, and must be completed within thirty (30) days of notification by the Building Inspector. Appeals from the Building Inspector’s order shall be to the Zoning Board of Appeals. 
j 	Within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the closing of a business, all wording on any sign referencing that business must be painted over or obliterated by the applicant for the PUD special permit and/or the building owner. 
k 	Signs prohibited in Sections 8.2.5 a., b., and h are prohibited in a PUD. Signs exempted in Sections 8.2.5.a, f. and j. are exempted in a PUD. 
l 	Because parking is not allowed in front of the building in a PUD-B development, the CPDC may allow building signage on both the front wall and on the wall of the building facing the parking lot. 
11.1.5.6.4	 Allowed Signs in the PUD-I a Freestanding identification ground signs. 1 Identification signs may be placed as a ground sign between the street and the building. 
2 	If the lot faces on two (2) or more streets/highway, and/or if the lot has more than one entrance from a right of way, one (1) sign serving each street/highway shall be allowed, and one (1) sign per entrance shall be allowed, up to a maximum of three 
(3) free-standing signs per lot. 
b 	Directional signs, building markers. Such signs shall not exceed four (4) square feet in area, shall not be more than four (4) feet high if placed on the ground, and shall not extend above the roofline, if upon a wall. No advertisement is allowed on this type of signage. 
c 	One wall sign per building or tenant is allowed. For tenants or buildings facing more than one street/highway, one additional sign for that tenant is allowed facing such street/highway. 
d 	For each building within a PUD-I district, signs located at the entry door of specific tenants in a multi-tenant building. e Signs allowed in Sections 8.2.6.2.h. and j are allowed in a PUD-I. 
11.1.5.6.5 	Notwithstanding anything in this PUD Bylaw to the contrary, signage in a PUD-R shall be subject to the following additional limitations: (a) The residential portion of a PUD-R may only have low identification signage of a size and design as is approved by the CPDC, directional signage and such signage as is allowed in the underlying residential district. (b) Commercial signage must be located within 300 feet of a Town boundary and shall only face an interstate highway.

Such training and equipment shall be paid for by the developer or facility. 
11.1.6 Use and Dimensional Requirements as to PUD-R The following paragraphs shall serve as the basic Use and Dimension Requirements to which all PUD-R projects shall adhere within each PUD-R overlay district and shall be used by the Community Planning and Development Commission to evaluate any proposed project. 
11.1.6.1 Parcel Size and Eligibility 
The minimum size of a PUD-R development parcel shall be 10 acres. A development parcel may consist of land in more than one ownership, provided that all land comprising the parcel lies entirely within the PUD-R overlay district and is contiguous. Lots separated by a minor street as defined in Section 
11.1.2.1 or right-of-way or private way may be considered contiguous for this purpose. Proposed developments may include pre-existing buildings provided that all PUD requirements are satisfied by each new or existing building and for the PUD as a whole. More than one principal building may be located on a lot, Section 6.2.8 notwithstanding. 
11.1.6.2 Permitted Uses in PUD-R 
Planned Unit Developments in an underlying residential district may contain two or more of the following uses subject to the findings of the CPDC as to net benefit and adverse impacts of the proposed PUD: a Residential uses including one family dwellings, two-family dwellings town 
houses and apartments. b Any or all of the uses allowed in a PUD-I in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (f) and 
(h) of Section 11.1.4.2, housing for the elderly, day care facility, elder care facility, nursing home, medical clinic and ancillary offices and facilities, but only if such uses are located within 300 feet of a Town boundary. 
c  Retail, consumer service, restaurant (with no drive-thru service), and place of  
assembly and recreational use, but only if such use is located within 300 feet  
of a Town boundary and is specifically found by the CPDC to be ancillary to or  
supportive of a permitted use proposed in the PUD-R development.  
d  Open space: Areas used for open space, yards, buffer areas, private ways,  
walkways, driveways, parking, recreation areas and areas classified as  
resource areas in Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 131, Section 40, as  
amended, and in the Reading Wetlands Bylaw; such open spaces as may be  
included in determining open space requirements pursuant to Section  
11.1.6.4.2.e.  
e  Recreational Uses  
f  Public and Quasi-Public Uses as set forth in Section 5.3  
g  All other uses are excluded from a Planned Unit Development in a PUD-R.  
Adult Uses are expressly prohibited in a PUD-R District.  
h  To encourage and promote the establishment of those uses permitted in  
Section 11.1.6.2(b) within portions of a PUD-R district that are within 300 feet  
of a Town boundary, no two-family dwellings, or multifamily dwellings shall be  
built pursuant to a PUD-R Special Permit on land that is within 300 feet of a  
Town boundary for a period of seven years after the adoption of the Zoning  
Bylaw placing such land within the PUD-R overlay district.  
In  recognition of increased density and economic benefits to the applicant  

pursuant to a PUD-R Plan, the CPDC may consider and condition the number and interior layout of bedrooms in each residential unit that are being proposed by the developer in evaluating the criteria pursuant to Section 11.1.5 of this Bylaw. 
11.1.6.3 Intensity of Use in PUD-R 
11.1.6.3.1 Residential 
The basic permitted intensity of the residential use in a PUD-R development shall not average more than six (6) units to the acre for the portions of a PUD-R development that are more than 300 feet from a municipal boundary. 
If developed residentially, as per Section 11.1.6.2.h., the basic permitted intensity of residential use in a PUD-R development shall not average more than eleven (11) units to the acre for the portions of a PUD-R development that lies within 300 feet of a Town boundary. 
11.1.6.3.2 Uses as described in Section 11.1.6.2 b, c, and f, respectively 
The basic permitted intensity of commercial use in a PUD-R development, expressed as the Floor Area Ratio, is 0.55. In order to assist in making this calculation, plans submitted for a PUD-R Special Permit that contain a such use shall show what portion and area of the development parcel will be put to such use. Land under dwellings, residential court yards, residential driveways, non-structured parking areas that serve only residential uses and roadways that serve only residential uses shall not be counted as part of the development parcel in calculating the FAR. 
Areas which have been counted to satisfy the intensity limit for residential use may not be counted also to satisfy the intensity limit for commercial use and areas which have been counted to satisfy the intensity limit for commercial use may not be counted also to satisfy the intensity limit for residential use. 
11.1.6.4 Dimensional Requirements Each PUD-R development shall be governed by the dimensional requirements of this Section. These requirements apply only to the subject parcel as a whole, not to individual lots created within the PUD-R. 
11.1.6.4.1	 Height 
The maximum building height within a PUD-R shall be as follows: 
a 	The maximum building height as to a dwelling shall be 30 feet except that a dwelling that is more than 50 feet from the PUD-R parcel boundary may be 35 feet in height and a dwelling that is at least 150 feet from dwellings that are outside of a PUD and in existence at the time of Preliminary PUD Plan submission, may have a maximum height of 40 feet, excepting that a dwelling that is within 300 feet of the Town boundary may have a maximum height of 70 feet. 
b 	The maximum height of a commercial building shall be 72 feet. Height shall be measured in the manner defined in Section 2.0. of this Bylaw. 
11.1.6.4.2	 Setbacks and Buffers in a PUD-R a The extent of buffering and setbacks shall in every case be based 
upon the following criteria as reviewed by the CPDC: Existing topography Existing vegetation Existing and Proposed Structures within and outside the PUD-R district 
b 	Non-residential Setbacks 
All non-residential buildings shall be located at least 50 feet from the boundary of the PUD parcel, excepting a boundary which is also the Town boundary. Nonresidential buildings (except structured parking) shall not be located less than 150 feet from dwellings outside of a PUD and in existence at the time of Preliminary PUD Plan submission without the written consent of the owner of such dwellings and shall not be less than 50 feet from dwellings in the PUD parcel. There shall be a landscaped and/or naturally vegetated buffer at least 50 feet wide where a non-residential area of a PUD­R parcel abuts residential properties outside the PUD-R district. 
c 	Shadow Impact 
Between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. (EST) from February 21 to October 21, no building may cast a shadow on any dwelling outside of the PUD-R parcel and in existence at the time of Preliminary PUD Plan submission. 
d 	Residential Setbacks 
All dwellings within a PUD-R shall be at least 20 feet from the PUD­R parcel boundary, which 20 foot strip shall be landscaped and/or naturally vegetated, except that a dwelling that is between 30 and 35 feet in height must be at least 40 feet from the PUD-R parcel boundary (excluding a parcel boundary that is also a Town boundary) and a dwelling that is over 35 feet in height must be at least 50 feet from the PUD-R parcel boundary (excluding a parcel boundary that is also a Town boundary). Natural vegetation shall be preserved in the minimum setback area along the PUD-R parcel boundaries that abut property used for residential purposes as reviewed and determined by CPDC. Buildings within the PUD-R which contain residential units shall be no closer than 15 feet to each other. The CPDC may allow the required 20 foot residential setback strip for dwellings in a PUD-R parcel to be measured from the outer boundary of an abutting parcel in the PUD-R-C District provided that there are no buildings on that PUD-R-C parcel.  
e Open Space 
A PUD-R shall set aside at least 25% of its total parcel area as required open space. Required Open Space may include wetlands and water bodies; vegetated/landscaped area, including buffers; pedestrian paths, side-walks, and covered walkways; public plazas and hard surfaced recreation areas. Required Open Space shall have a minimum dimension of 20 feet (which may include the dimension across a water body) and shall be open to occupants within the PUD-R; access by the general public is desirable. 
f Recreation Space 
A PUD-R that includes land within three hundred (300’) of the Town boundary must provide at least 15% of land within three hundred feet (300’) of the municipal boundary for recreational uses, such uses being subject to approval of the CPDC. 
11.1.6.5 Private Ways Private ways shall be allowed in a PUD-R development, provided that: a Site circulation shall meet accepted standards in the judgment of the Town Engineer for private automobiles, service vehicles and emergency vehicles. b Private way pavement widths shall not be less than twenty four (24) feet. The construction standards for such private ways shall provide sufficient base and surface strength in the judgment of the Town Engineer to support normal vehicular usage, including but not limited to emergency vehicles and delivery trucks, and plowing. The allowable private way grades shall be between 1% and 10% and private ways shall have a minimum centerline radius of 75 feet. Private ways ending in a dead-end shall have a cul-de-sac with a minimum curve radius of forty-five feet. c A private way in a PUD-R must have adequate, alternative vehicle connectors to other private ways or roadways to provide alternative access for emergency vehicles. Such emergency access connectors may be gated in a manner satisfactory to the CPDC to avoid non-emergency use, but may cross any existing zoning district. d Drainage and surface runoff are suitably accommodated. e Ways shall be continuous and, where possible, in alignment with existing ways. All proposed ways shall compose a convenient system with adequate connections to ensure full movement of vehicular travel. f If adjoining property is not subdivided, consideration shall be given to the possibility of future connections. In any case where developable land, whether publicly or privately owned, adjoins the subject property, proposed ways and/or easements shall continue to the exterior boundary of the PUD-R site plan unless otherwise approved by the CPDC. 
PUD-R Plans shall specify that such private ways are not to be dedicated to the Town but are to remain private ways; and all deeds conveying any portion of land or a structure in a PUD-R development containing private ways shall specify that such private ways shall always remain private ways. 
Driveways which provide access only to one residential building that contains 15 or fewer units or driveways that provide access only to a residential parking area do not need to meet the private way requirements, but such driveways shall be of a sufficient layout to provide safe and adequate access, in the judgment of the CPDC as advised by the Town Engineer. 
11.1.6.6 Owners’ Association In order to ensure that private ways, common open spaces and common facilities within a PUD-R development will be properly maintained, each PUD-R development shall have one or more Owners’ Associations, which shall be an entity established in accordance with appropriate state law, and shall establish related covenants by suitable legal instruments recorded at the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds or Registry District of the Land Court. As part of the Final PUD­R Plan submission, the Developer shall supply to the CPDC copies of such proposed instruments for review and approval prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit. 
In cases where the PUD-R Plan proposes private ways, said legal instruments pertaining to the Owners’ Association shall specify that the Owners’ Association shall be solely responsible for private way maintenance, snow-plowing, trash removal, and improvements, for all costs associated with the operation and maintenance of street lighting, and for reimbursement to the Town of all costs incurred by the Town relative to such private ways. In cases where the PUD-R Plan shows private utilities, said legal instruments shall specify that the Owners’ Association shall be solely responsible for the operation and maintenance of said utilities. Such instruments shall provide for the periodic payment by owners within the PUD-R development of adequate amounts to maintain the private ways, private utilities, and open space and drainage system and set forth enforcement rights for collection of said periodic payment. 
11.1.6.7 Landscaping Requirements in PUD-R Notwithstanding any and all other requirements in Section 11.1, the following management of existing vegetation shall occur for PUD-R applications: a Prior to any cutting of vegetation and grading of the PUD-R, the developer and representative(s) of the Town of Reading delegated by CPDC, including any member of CPDC, the Town Planner, and/or the Tree Warden, shall meet on the site to review which existing site trees shall be saved. Before this meeting the developer shall have staked the corners and property lines of the PUD-application and the corners of all proposed structures’ locations, and the developer shall have clearly marked with red flagging each tree or group of trees the developer proposes to save. At this meeting, said CPDC representative(s) shall approve or amend on site such marked trees and any other they shall deem appropriate to be saved, which shall immediately be similarly marked by the developer. Should the developer object or take issue with any determination of the CPDC representative(s), the developer may appeal such determination to the full CPDC. b Prior to the commencement of any site grading, the developer shall erect around all such marked trees barriers for shielding around the trunks of such trees; these barriers shall be located no closer than six (6) feet from the trunk of each such tree or one-half (1/2) the distance from the trunk to the drip line of each such tree, whichever is greater. Also prior to the commencement of any site grading, the developer shall prepare a Record Plan showing the approximate location, size, and type of all such groups of marked 
trees to be saved and submit such Plan to the Tree Warden for verification. Any modification to the Record Plan may be made with the agreement of the above parties. 
c 
The Town Planner shall not approve a building permit for any construction and the Building Inspector shall not issue a building permit for any structure within the PUD-R until certification is received from the Tree Warden that these conditions have been complied with. 
11.1.6.8 Stormwater Drainage All PUD applications shall provide proof of compliance with the Department of Environmental Protection Stormwater Regulations. 
11.1.6.9 Pedestrian Access All PUD applications shall contain safe and convenient pedestrian access throughout the project site and connecting to adjacent roadways and/or parcels. 
11.1.6.10 Affordable Housing The intent of this Section is to increase the supply of housing in the Town of Reading that is available to and affordable by low and moderate income households and to encourage a greater diversity of housing accommodations to meet the needs of the Town and to develop and maintain a satisfactory proportion of the Town’s housing stock as affordable housing. 
Any PUD-R development shall provide within the Town of Reading, affordable housing units equal to ten percent of the total residential units in the PUD-R. For property within 300’ of the municipal boundary if developed residentially, requisite affordable units shall be equal to fifteen percent of the total residential units in this area. When the percentage calculation does not result in a whole number it shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. 
The following standards shall apply to assure the maximum public benefit from such affordable housing: 
a Restriction 
The developer shall provide an adequate guarantee, acceptable to the CPDC, to ensure the continued availability of the affordable units in perpetuity; such guarantee may include deed restrictions, recorded deed covenants relative to equity limitation, or other acceptable forms. 
b Marketing/Selection 
The marketing and household selection process as to the affordable units shall be conducted in collaboration with the Town or its designee. 
c Local Preference 
To the extent to do so would not cause the affordable units not to be qualified as affordable housing pursuant to guidelines established by the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development and to the extent allowed by law, preference as to affordable units shall be given initially to current Reading residents, employees of the Town of Reading, or those prospective buyers who were formerly Reading residents for ten (10) years or more. The Town shall establish an equitable procedure to implement this preference. 
d Appearance 
On site affordable housing units shall have a minimum gross floor area of one thousand (1,000) square feet and an exterior appearance designed to be substantially indistinguishable from market-rate units. 
e Minimize Fees 
If the affordable units are being sold as condominium units, in order to minimize the monthly condominium fees to be paid by those affordable units, the value assigned to such units and the percentage of interest in the common areas allocated to those affordable units shall recognize the affordable restrictions imposed on such affordable units, to the maximum extent allowed by Massachusetts General Law Chapter 183A and other applicable law. 
f Developing Units 
No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the building for the market rate residential units shall be issued for any PUD-R development until construction has commenced on one-sixth of the affordable units. No more than fifty percent (50%) of the occupancy permits for the market rate residential units shall be issued for any PUD-R development until occupancy permits are issued for one-third of the affordable. No more than eighty five percent (85%) of the occupancy permits for the market rate residential units shall be issued until occupancy permits have been issued for two thirds (2/3) of the affordable units. The CPDC may require financial assurances in an amount as determined by CPDC from the applicant for the remaining one third (1/3) of affordable units required to be provided. 
g Off-Site Units 
Up to 50% of the required affordable units may be located off- site from the PUD-R location within the Town of Reading. In order to use this option, the size and types of units, unit location, and density of said units shall be approved by the CPDC as part of their approval for the related PUD-R Special Permit. 
As a premium for the Developer being able to place affordable units off-site, for every three affordable units the developer elects to place off-site, the Developer must provide an additional bonus affordable unit, which additional bonus unit does not count towards the ten percent of affordable units the Developer is required to provide. The placing of bonus affordable units off-site does not result in a requirement of additional bonus units. 
11.1.7 Use and Dimensional Requirements in the PUD-B The following use and dimensional requirements shall be adhered to by all PUD-B Special Permit developments that lie within a PUD-B Overlay District and which shall be used by the CPDC in evaluating each PUD-B development proposal. 
11.1.7.1 Parcel Size and Eligibility 
The minimum land area of a project under a PUD-B Special Permit is three (3) acres in size. A development parcel may consist of land in more than one ownership, provided that all land comprising the parcel lies entirely within the PUD-B Overlay District and is contiguous. Lots separated by a minor street as defined in Section 11.1.2.1 or right-of-way or private way may be considered, in CPDC’s discretion, contiguous for this purpose.

11.2 Planned Residential Development (PRD) 
11.2.1 Purpose 
The purpose of the Planned Residential District (PRD) is to permit integrated high-quality residential developments with variable densities while permitting preservation of open space and natural features, allowing reduced infrastructure and site development costs, to promote a greater diversity of housing opportunities within the Town while respecting and enhancing the existing character of the Town and of the neighborhood, and to promote attractive standards of appearance and aesthetics consistent with that character. 
There shall be the following types of PRD Districts: 
PRD-G: General Planned Residential Development. 

PRD-M: Planned Residential Development on current or former municipally owned properties. There may be included in a PRD-M Zoning Overlay District privately owned property which was not former municipally owned property provided that any such property can only be used for the purposes of providing access to, drainage control from or open space recreational uses for a contiguous parcel or parcels of property which otherwise complies in all respects for development as a PRD-M. 
11.2.2 Planned Residential District as an Overlay District 
A PRD Zoning District shall take the form of an overlay district covering any part of an existing residential zoning district on the Reading Zoning Map. A PRD-M Zoning Overlay District shall be applied to a specific parcel or parcels only through specific action by Town Meeting in a manner identical to that required to amend the Reading Zoning Map. A PRD-G Zoning Overlay District may be applied to all or any portion of an underlying single-family residential zoning district (that is, S-10, S-20 or S-40) through action by Town Meeting to amend the Reading Zoning Map. 
For any land subject to a PRD Overlay District a Developer may choose to conform either to the zoning regulations which govern the underlying district or to the PRD overlay regulations and procedures set forth by this Section, the specific provisions of which shall supersede all other provisions in the Zoning Bylaw with respect to the underlying district including, without limitation, use, intensity, dimensions, parking, signage and site plan review; however, the provisions of any other overlay district shall continue to apply. 
Notwithstanding any subsequent change in the development density provisions of Section 11.2.4.3 hereof, the land placed in a PRD Zoning Overlay District shall be governed by the development density requirements in effect at the time Town Meeting created the applicable Zoning Overlay District and for a period of eight (8) years from the date of such Town Meeting action.

Two copies of the Final PRD Plan shall remain available to the public during the application process and shall be located in the office of the Community Development Department and in the Reading Public Library. 
11.2.3.3.9 Contents of Final PRD Plan Submission All Final PRD Plan submissions shall be made in conformance with said PRD Plan Submission and Development Regulations in effect at the time of final submission. 
11.2.3.3.10 Amendments Additions or amendments to the approved Preliminary PRD Plan shall be determined solely by CPDC as either major or minor as defined below. The CPDC shall have the entire, exclusive, and final discretion to determine whether a proposed change constitutes a minor or a 
11.2.3.3.10.1
11.2.3.3.10.2
11.2.3.3.11
major amendment, and its decision shall be conclusive. Minor additions or amendments shall be authorized by written approval of the CPDC. 
Major additions or amendments shall be considered as original items to the Preliminary PRD Plan application and shall be grounds for reconsideration of the approved Preliminary PRD Plan and shall be reviewed subject to the procedures specified in Sections 11.2.3.3.1 to 
11.2.3.3.6 inclusive. Denial of a major addition or amendment shall not constitute disapproval or modification of the previously approved Preliminary PRD Plan. 
 Minor Amendments 
Minor amendments are additions or changes which do not, in the determination of the CPDC, substantially alter the concept of the PRD, as reflected in the approved Preliminary or Final PRD Plan, as appropriate, in terms of floor area ratio, use, height, provision of open space, or layout or other physical relationships of the elements of the development. Minor amendments shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: small changes in floor area, site coverage, height, setbacks, or open space; small changes in the location of buildings, open space, or parking; or small changes in the alignment of minor streets and ways on the site. 
 Major Amendments

Major amendments shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: large changes in floor area, site coverage, height, setbacks, or open space; large changes in the location of buildings, open space, or parking; or large changes in the circulation system, including number and location of access ways. 
 Public Hearing and Decision on Final Plan 
Within sixty-nine days after the close of the Public Hearing referred to in Section 11.2.3.3.5, the CPDC shall hold a Public Hearing to consider issuance of a Special Permit to construct a PRD in accordance with the Final PRD Plan. Approval of the Special Permit shall be granted upon determination by the CPDC that the Final PRD Plan conforms with and meets the requirements, standards, and guidelines set forth in this PRD Bylaw in a manner consistent with the approved Preliminary PRD Plan, and contains all revisions required by the CPDC in its conditional approval of said Plan. 
The CPDC may grant the Special Permit with conditions consistent with its approval of the Preliminary PRD Plan, and the conditions shall be agreed to in writing by the Developer before the Special Permit is granted. If not granting a Special Permit to construct a PRD, the CPDC shall make its final decision in writing and shall specify its reasons for denial. If CPDC makes no decision within ninety days after the close of the Public Hearing referred to in Section 11.2.3.3.5, then the Final PRD Plan shall be considered approved and the Special Permit to construct a PRD in accordance with the submitted Final PRD Plan shall be deemed granted. 
11.2.3.3.12 Amendments to Final Plan After approval by the CPDC of the Special Permit to construct a PRD, the Developer may seek amendments to the Final PRD Plan. Such amendments shall be determined solely by the CPDC to be minor or major. Minor amendments, as defined in Section 11.2.3.3.10.1, shall be authorized by written approval of the CPDC. Major amendments, as defined in Section 11.2.3.3.10.2, shall be grounds for reconsideration of the Special Permit to construct a PRD and shall be reviewed as if it were an entirely new PRD Plan, that is, in accordance with the procedures specified in Sections 11.2.3.3.1 to 11.2.3.3.11 inclusive. Denial of any proposed major amendment shall not invalidate the Special Permit to construct a PRD in conformance with the previously approved Final PRD Plan. 
11.2.3.3.13 Development Schedule The Developer shall begin construction of the PRD within twenty-four months of the date of the granting of the Special Permit (or, if applicable, following appeal as provided in Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 40A, Section 9) in reasonable conformance, as defined solely by the CPDC, with the development schedule submitted with the Final PRD Plan. The CPDC shall grant in writing an extension of this time period of up to an additional twenty-four months upon determination by CPDC of good cause. If the Developer fails to commence construction of the PRD within twenty-four months plus any approved extension period, the Special Permit shall lapse and be deemed null and void. 
11.2.3.3.14 Phased Development If a phased development is proposed by the Developer, the Final PRD Plan shall contain all required written, quantitative, and graphic information as specified in Section 11.2.3.3.9 for evaluating the proposed PRD as a whole and to serve as a basis for granting the Special Permit, plus a final development schedule for the completion of the PRD indicating the proposed dates and scope of work to be accomplished in each phase. Site improvements may be phased only in conformity with the phasing schedule included in the approved Final PRD Plan, and only to the extent that all requirements, standards, and guidelines of this PRD Bylaw are met in each phase. The initial phase shall include at a minimum the on-site and off-site improvements necessary for one or more buildings and may, at the Developer's option, include one or more buildings. 
Deviations, deletions, additions, or changes from or to the approved Final PRD Plan in any phase shall be designated a minor or major amendment, as defined in Sections 11.2.3.3.10.1 and 11.2.3.3.10.2, to the Final PRD Plan by the CPDC and treated as such in accordance with Section 11.2.3.3.12. 
If the PRD is to be developed in phases, the Developer shall begin the construction of each phase in accordance with the approved development and phasing schedule; however, the CPDC shall grant additional extensions in the timing of phases for up to twenty-four months each as minor amendments to the Final PRD Plan, upon the CPDC's determination of good cause. If the Developer fails to commence construction of a PRD phase within the specified time limit for that phase, including any approved extension period, said failure shall be deemed a major amendment to the Final PRD Plan, and the phase at issue and all subsequent phases which depend upon said phase for their construction and operation in conformance with the Final PRD Plan shall be re-approved in accordance with Section 
11.2.3.3.12. 
11.2.3.3.15 Conformity with PRD Plan and Special Permit The CPDC shall include as a condition to all Special Permits granted for the construction of PRDs that no construction of a PRD or any phase thereof may be authorized until the CPDC has reviewed and approved a Design Submission for work to be done. The Design Submission shall include architectural, site, and landscape design documents, sufficiently developed, as determined by the CPDC, to permit review of conformance to the Final PRD Plan and Special Permit conditions, in accordance with the PRD Plan Submission Regulations established by the CPDC. 
If deemed necessary by the CPDC, a Public Hearing may be held for the review of any Design Submission. Design Submissions shall be reviewed by the CPDC solely for conformity with the Final PRD Plan, with Special Permit conditions, and, only to the extent not already reviewed and approved, with the requirements, standards, and guidelines applicable to the construction of the phase in question. If the CPDC makes no decision upon a Design Submission within ninety days of its positive determination as to the sufficiency and completeness of the Design Submission, said Special Permit condition shall be deemed to be satisfied regarding said PRD or phase thereof. 
The CPDC shall adopt regulations or impose conditions as part of a Final PRD Plan approval requiring one or more of the following in amounts and duration sufficient to guarantee that all commitments in the approved PRD plan to provide public improvements or to take other actions are properly completed: performance bonds, deposit of money or negotiable securities with the Town, or a satisfactory agreement with a lending institution to retain funds pending completion of such improvements or actions. 
If, for any PRD or phase thereof, the CPDC finds that either the Developer has failed to begin development within the specified time period, including any approved extension period, or that the Developer is not proceeding in conformity with the Special Permit, then the CPDC may, after sixty days from written notice (and any additional period which the CPDC may deem necessary so as to provide the Developer reasonable opportunity to cure any deficiencies), revoke the Special Permit as it applies to the phase of construction at issue, and/or require that the Developer amend the Final PRD Plan subject to the procedures specified in Section 11.2.3.3.12. 
If the CPDC revokes the Special Permit for the PRD then the Final PRD Plan shall be null and void as it applies to the phase of construction at issue and all subsequent phases which depend upon said phase for their construction or operation in conformance with the Final PRD Plan. 
The provisions of this paragraph are additional to the Reading Zoning Enforcement Officer's powers of enforcement under the Reading Zoning Bylaw and Massachusetts State Law. 
Upon satisfaction of all applicable Special Permit conditions, the CPDC shall issue a Certificate of Compliance for one or more PRD phases as appropriate. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for a given PRD phase until a Certificate of Compliance has been so issued.

11.2.5.4. may allow fewer spaces. 
2 	PRD-G: None, except that one space shall be provided for any common building or facility, except that CPDC at its discretion and in accordance with Section 11.2.5.4 may allow fewer spaces. Maximum number of dwelling units contained within the parcel shall be determined as follows: 
1 	PRD-G: Maximum basic development density for a PRD-G development shall be based on the underlying zoning district in which the development is located, as follows: a The Developer shall first submit to the Reading Conservation 
Commission a Request for Determination of Applicability, if required by law, relative to the parcel contemplated to be developed in accordance with this Section 11.2 in accordance with Chapter 131, Section 40 of the Massachusetts General Law and Section 7.1. of the Reading General Bylaw, and obtain from said Conservation Commission an approved delineation of the bounds of any wetlands resource area on the parcel and/or within the jurisdiction of the Conservation Commission up to 200 feet from any portion of the parcel; 
b 	The Developer shall then submit to the CPDC a schematic Subdivision Plan which meets the requirements as specified for a Preliminary Subdivision Plan in the Rules and Regulations Governing the Subdivision of Land in Reading; this plan shall accurately depict the bounds of wetland resource areas as approved as stipulated above; upon written request of the Developer, the CPDC may waive those portions of the Preliminary Subdivision Plan content requirements relative to detailed utility engineering which in the estimation of the CPDC are not necessary for the full determination as to the extent of the parcel's buildability in conformity with said Rules and Regulations and the Reading Zoning Bylaw. The number of building lots shown on such schematic Subdivision Plan proven by the Developer, and accepted by vote of the CPDC at a Public Hearing to consider such schematic Subdivision Plan, to conform with the requirements of Section 6.0 of the Reading Zoning Bylaw applicable to the underlying zoning district in which the parcel is located, shall constitute the maximum basic development density, in terms of number of dwelling units, which shall be allowed for any PRD-G development on the parcel; 
c 	Accompanying the submission to the CPDC of such schematic Subdivision Plan, the Developer shall also submit a request to CPDC to review at said Public Hearing a schematic PRD Plan which shall conform to the requirements relative to a contents of a Preliminary PRD Plan as set forth in Section 11.2.3.3.3. This plan shall accurately depict the bounds of wetland resource areas as approved as set forth above, together with the proposed number of dwelling units shown on such schematic PRD Plan to be equal to or fewer than the maximum basic development density as determined in subparagraph (b) above, plus any additional dwelling units proposed in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.2.4.3.1 relative to the provision of affordable or moderately-priced housing; 
d 	Following the close of the Public Hearing at which both the schematic Subdivision Plan and the Schematic PRD Plan are reviewed, the CPDC shall consider whether or not it will request that an Article be placed on the Warrant for a Town Meeting to place a PRD-G Zoning Overlay District on the parcel as specified in Section 11.2.2.; 
e 	Following favorable action by Town Meeting, the Developer may proceed with a Preliminary PRD Plan and a Final PRD Plan as set forth in this Section 11.2. 
2 	PRD-M: 10 dwelling units per gross acre, with the additional limitation that no PRD development may contain more than 100 residential units. 
11.2.4.3.1	 Increased Development Intensity and Height PRD-G: The basic intensity, but not height, factors specified in Section 
11.2.4.3 may be increased as follows, provided that in no case shall the development density be increased to a level equal to more than one-hundred-twenty percent (120%) of the basic density. 1 For every affordable housing unit provided, one additional market-
rate housing unit may be provided. 
2 	For every two moderately priced housing units provided, one additional market-rate housing unit may be provided. 
PRD-M: The basic intensity and height factors specified in Section 
11.2.4.3. may be increased up to the following levels if the CPDC finds that a proposed provision of public improvements or amenities by the Developer would result in substantial benefit to the Town and the general public: 1 Maximum floor area ratio: 0.65 2 Maximum building height: 72 feet, not to exceed six stories, except 
that not more than one-third of the total number of any PRD development's residential units may be contained in a building or buildings greater than 48 feet in height. 
3 	Maximum number of dwelling units per gross acre of land contained within the parcel: 16 dwelling units, with the additional limitation that no PRD-M development may contain more than 160 residential units. 
The aforementioned improvements or amenities which CPDC may consider in granting some amount of increased intensity and height shall include one or more of the following, provided that, in the estimation of the CPDC, the benefit to be derived from the proposed improvements or amenities shall be commensurate with the amount of increased intensity or height allowed: 1 Significant improvement of the environmental quality or condition 
of the site and its surrounding areas, including a decrease in runoff, 
2 	Provision of or contribution to off-site public facility improvements beyond those necessary to mitigate the effects of the proposed development which improvements would enhance the general condition of the surrounding areas, 
3 	Dedication of open space or recreational facilities for use by the general public, 
4 	Active cooperation by the Developer with other owners in the vicinity to develop and achieve district-wide and adjacent neighborhood improvement goals and objectives, 
5 	Provision of public art, distinctive and appropriate design, or other amenities which would provide unique advantages to the general public or contribute to achieving Town-wide goals and objectives, 
6 	Provision of affordable housing within the PRD in conformance with this PRD Bylaw and/or offsite in a manner acceptable to the Reading Housing Authority in excess of the amount required in Section 11.2.4.2.1. 
11.2.4.3.2 Fractional Computations 
For all PRD density calculations which result in a fractional number, only fractions equal to or greater than x.76 may be rounded up to the next highest whole number; all other fractional numbers shall be rounded down to the nearest lower whole number. 
11.2.4.4 Limitation of Subdivision and Ownership No lot or development parcel shown on a PRD plan for which a permit is granted pursuant to this PRD Bylaw and remains validly in effect may be further subdivided, and a note to this effect shall be shown on the plan. 
All wetlands and adjacent 25-foot buffer area contained in a PRD parcel shall be held in common ownership under the purview of the PRD's Residents Association; such 25-foot buffer area shall not count toward open space as required in Section 
11.2.5.3. 
11.2.5 Development Standards 
All PRD developments shall conform to the following development standards: 
11.2.5.1 Screening 
Within the required setbacks, landscaping shall be provided so as to provide effective screening of the PRD from visibility from abutting properties. To the greatest extent practical, existing natural vegetation shall be preserved and enhanced. Except as necessary for vehicular access, natural grades and contours within these setbacks shall not be altered in any manner, and no parking, loading and unloading space, or any other physical improvement shall be made. All plantings shall be properly installed and maintained. 
11.2.5.2 Shadows 
Between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. (EST) from February 21st to October 21st, no building may cast a shadow on any residential structure in existence at the time of Preliminary PRD Plan submission. 
11.2.5.3 Open Space 
A minimum of 40% of the PRD parcel shall be devoted to open space, completely devoid of any structure, or parking, loading and unloading space or access way thereto, or as private yards, patios, or gardens for the exclusive or principal use by residents of individual dwelling units. To the greatest extent possible such open space shall be left in its undisturbed natural condition or developed so as to be appropriate, in size, shape, dimension, location, and character to assure its use as a park, recreational area, and visual amenity for the development and its residents. 
In evaluating the suitability and quality of the open space proposed to be provided, the CPDC shall apply the following standards: 
a Usability 
Other than wetlands, floodplains, and water bodies, including the normal water surface area of detention ponds, which may count for up to twenty-five percent of a PRD project's required open space area, all open space must have a surface which is adequately drained and permits active and passive recreational use. Such surface may include any combination of grass, plant materials, wood, or paving materials which allow pedestrian and recreational use. No open space shall be considered usable if the slope of the finished grade exceeds ten percent. 
b Location 
The nearest part of the open space shall not be more than 30 feet walking distance from the nearest point of any building it is proposed to serve. 
c Size and shape 
No open space shall be considered usable unless it has a minimum area of 1000 square feet and no dimension less than twenty-five feet. 
d Structures and facilities 
All usable open space shall be open to the sky, and may include unroofed facilities such as tennis courts, swimming pools, or similar recreational facilities. 
11.2.5.4 Site Circulation and Parking Site circulation shall meet accepted standards for private automobiles, service vehicles, and emergency vehicles. It is highly desirable to consolidate access to a PRD in a small number of widely spaced principal access points, which may be driveways or Town-accepted side streets within or adjacent to the PRD Overlay District. Principal access should be consolidated in as few locations as possible and, if feasible, it is desirable for adjacent developments to share principal access. Principal access points should be spaced and aligned or alternated according to good traffic engineering practice, and should be signalized if necessary. 
Parking stall size shall be in accordance with the Reading Zoning Bylaw and shall be landscaped in accordance with Section 11.2.5.5.5. A minimum of five percent of the gross area of each parking lot shall be devoted to interior landscaped areas, of as uniform a distribution as practicable throughout the parking lots and planted intensively with trees and taller shrubs. 
Roadways and drives within a PRD shall be constructed in conformance with standards established by the Reading Department of Public Works, if proposed to be dedicated to the Town. The design of the overall circulation pattern shall be prepared in accordance with the principles and concepts established in "Recommended Practices for Subdivision Streets" prepared by the Institute of Traffic Engineers (1965) or such other standard as accepted by the CPDC through duly adopted regulation. 
Private on-site roadways shall be allowed in any PRD development provided that: 
Pavement widths for traveled ways (that is, not including parallel or perpendicular on-street parking) shall not be less than twenty (20) feet for two-way traffic or twelve (12) feet for one-way traffic. 
Drainage and surface runoff are suitably accommodated if no curbing is to be provided. Construction standards referenced above, other than pavement widths and curbing, shall be adhered to. 
All PRD Plans shall specify that such roadways are proposed not to be dedicated to the Town but are to remain private roadways; and all deeds conveying any portion of land or a structure in any PRD development containing private roadways shall specify that such roadways are and are always to remain private roadways. 
All on-site and off-site improvements, which include the installation of utilities, public lighting, sewers, and other public improvements shall be constructed in accordance with the standards of the Reading Department of Public Works and other appropriate departments. Utilities, including water, sewer, or storm drainage, proposed to be dedicated to the Town shall be contained in suitable easements which conform to standards set forth by the Reading Department of Public Works. 
The determination as to whether any lesser number of off-street loading and unloading spaces are allowed shall be determined by the CPDC as part of its review and approval of the Preliminary PRD Plan. 
11.2.5.5 Design Quality Project design shall be reviewed by CPDC with input from Town officials, any review consultant(s) employed by the CPDC, and others as appropriate. The following in this Section are to be interpreted as guidelines to be applied flexibly by the CPDC and as appropriate to the situation under review, including factors such as foundation and soil characteristics and other extraordinary site constraints. These guidelines apply to all site improvements and buildings and structures: 
11.2.5.5.1	 Building Placement a Provide and preserve attractive views from major vantage points, especially from major thoroughfares and residential neighborhoods, 
b 	Avoid regular spacing and building placements that will be viewed as continuous walls from important vantage points, which may be identified in a PRD Pre-Application Conference. 
11.2.5.5.2	 Building Massing/Articulation a Avoid unbroken building facades longer than 100 feet, b Provide human-scale features, especially at lower levels, c Avoid unarticulated and monotonous building facades and window 
placement. 
11.2.5.5.3	 Roofline Articulation a Provide a variety of building heights and varied roofline articulation, utilities should be located underground, 
b 	Locate taller buildings away from major streets and off-site single-family residential areas. 
11.2.5.5.4	 Building Materials 
a 	Use materials and building treatments that reduce the visibility of buildings from distant vantage points and that are compatible with backgrounds and surroundings, 
b 	Use materials and colors compatible with other quality buildings of similar scale in the vicinity. 
11.2.5.5.5	 Landscaping 
a 	All open areas within a PRD should be landscaped in an appropriate manner, utilizing both natural and man-made materials such as grass, trees, shrubs, attractive paving materials and outdoor furniture, 
b 	Deciduous trees should be placed along new and existing streets and ways, 
c 	Outdoor lighting should be considered in the landscaping plan and should be designed to complement both man-made and natural elements of the PRD and adjacent areas, 
d 	Intensive, high-quality landscaping should be provided within the PRD where it abuts major streets, existing residential areas, and along internal drives, 
e 	Parking lots should use landscaping and terracing to break up large areas of pavement and to enhance a residential flavor and appearance; trees and shrubs should be used to the maximum extent feasible. 
11.2.5.5.6  Pedestrian Amenities  
a b  Emphasize pedestrian/oriented features such as covered walkways, pergolas, outdoor sitting plazas, landscaped open space, drop-off areas and recreational facilities, Tree-lined or otherwise appropriately landscaped pedestrian paths and walkways should link together areas designated as open space within the site and whenever possible to adjoining public areas.  
11.2.5.5.7  Utilities  
a  To the maximum extent feasible, all utilities should be located underground.  
11.2.5.6  Signage  

a 	At each principal entrance to the site, one sign only shall be permitted, of a maximum signboard area of twelve (12) square feet, with content limited to identifying the name and address of the development. Within the development, signs, not to exceed one square foot each, of a number and location to be approved as part of the PRD Plans, may be permitted for the sole purposes of orientation and direction, and of identifying common building spaces. 
11.2.5.7 Environmental Standards and General Development Guidelines 
In addition to conforming to the Use and Dimensional Requirements governing PRD Overlay Districts, approval of the Special Permit to construct a PRD shall be granted only upon determination by the CPDC that a proposed PRD satisfies the following criteria; in any disapproval of a PRD, the CPDC shall state in writing the specific reasons for its finding that the proposed PRD does not satisfy one or more of these criteria; mitigation measures proposed by the Developer, at no cost to the Town, shall be considered in making these determinations: a That the proposed PRD conforms as appropriate to existing policy plans 
established by the Town Meeting, the Board of Selectmen, and the CPDC for the specific area of the Town in which the PRD is proposed to be located; b That there is no significant adverse effect under any of the following: 
1 	Quality of site design, building design, and landscaping as they affect occupants of the proposed development, the PRD Overlay District, adjacent residential districts and the Town as a whole, 
2 	Traffic flow and safety in the context of this and other proposed developments in the PRD Overlay District and sensitive neighboring areas, which may be identified in the scope of a State Environmental Impact Report and/or in a Pre-Application Conference, 
3 Water quality, air quality, wetlands and the natural environment, 
4 Provision of open space, 
5 Adequacy of utilities and other public works and impact on existing public 

facilities within the Town, and 6 Potential fiscal impact to the Town of Reading. c 
That approval of the proposed PRD provides benefits to the Town which outweigh all adverse effects, as evaluated under the above criteria. 
11.2.5.7.1 Environmental Standards 
A PRD shall conform in each phase to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations (including all such regulations established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection) regarding the environment, including those concerning noise, air quality, wetlands, water quality, runoff and erosion control, and protection from flooding. 
11.2.5.7.2 Significant Traffic Impact 
The CPDC may not approve a proposed PRD development which in its opinion has significant adverse traffic impact, as determined following examination by the CPDC of the Developer's traffic analysis and any other traffic analysis of the affected area available to the CPDC which is germane to the proposed PRD development. In making its determination, the CPDC shall consider the feasibility of any capacity improvements and mitigating measures proposed to be provided by the Developer at no cost to the Town. In making such determinations, the full traffic impact of all other Preliminary or Final PRD Plans shall be considered, regardless of project phasing. Without limitation, the determination of significant adverse impact shall consider traffic volumes, speeds, effect on pedestrian safety and access, and resulting levels of service on residential streets, approaches to the site of the proposed PRD, and other key locations, all of which may be identified in a Pre-Application Conference. 
11.2.5.7.3 Control of Runoff and Flooding 
The Developer shall demonstrate that, as compared with the situation that would exist on the site without the development, no phase of the proposed PRD will result in an increase in the peak rate of storm runoff at the parcel boundary for the PRD as a whole for the 25-, 50-, and 100-year design storms, and that there will be no net loss in flood storage capacity for the 100-year design storm. In making such determinations, any state or local orders or requirements of applicable Wetlands Protection Laws or Bylaw shall be assumed in the calculations of runoff and flood storage without the PRD, but alternative forms of development shall not be assumed. In addition, the Developer will demonstrate that any adverse existing off-site runoff and erosion conditions or off-site runoff and erosion conditions which would result from the development of the PRD are fully identified and that workable and acceptable mitigation measures are proposed as part of the Preliminary and Final PRD Plans. To assist in its evaluation of any PRD Plans, the CPDC may require the Developer to submit said plans to the Reading Conservation Commission for review and recommendations to the CPDC. 
11.2.6 Resident's Association In order to ensure that common open space and common facilities within the development will be properly maintained, each PRD development shall have a Resident's Association, which shall be in the form of a corporation, non-profit organization, or trust, established in accordance with appropriate state law by a suitable legal instrument or instruments recorded at the Middlesex South Registry of Deeds or Registry District of the Land Court. As part of the Final PRD Plan submission, the Developer shall supply to the CPDC copies of such proposed instrument, which shall at a minimum provide the information required by said PRD Plan Submission and Development Regulations in effect at the time of Final PRD Plan submission. 
In cases where the PRD Plan proposes private roadways which do not meet standards established by the Reading Department of Public Works, said legal instruments pertaining to the Resident's Association shall specify that the Resident's Association shall be solely responsible for roadway maintenance, snow-plowing, and improvements, for all costs associated with the operation and maintenance of street lighting, and for reimbursement to the Town of all costs incurred by the Town relative to such private roadways in all acts of maintaining or repairing utility lines contained in utility easements dedicated to the Town. In cases where the PRD Plan shows private utilities, said legal instruments shall specify that the Resident's Association shall be solely responsible for the operation and maintenance of said utilities. 
12.0 APPLICABILITY AND SEVERABILITY 
12.1 Severability 
If any provision of the Zoning Bylaw shall be found invalid for any reason in a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall be construed as narrowly as possible, and the balance of the Zoning Bylaw shall be deemed to be amended to the minimum extent necessary, so as to secure the purposes thereof, as set forth in Section 1.0.

available for inspection by applicants; c when and where a briefing session (if any) will be held; d the qualifications required of applicants; e the categories of designers' consultants, if any, for which applicants must list names of consultants 
they may use; f whether the fee has been set or will be negotiated; if the fee has been set, the amount of the fee must be listed in the advertisement; g when and where the RFQ can be obtained and the applications must be delivered. 
6 	The RFQ shall include the current "Standard Designer Application Form for Municipalities and Public Agencies not within DSB Jurisdiction," which is available for download from the Massachusetts Designer Selection Board website at Procedures for Municipalities and Public Agencies not within DSB Jurisdiction The Application Form may be amended to include additional information on a project-specific basis. 
7 	The Committee shall evaluate applicants based on the following criteria: a prior similar experience; b past performance on public and private projects; c financial stability; d identity and qualifications of the consultants who will work with the applicants on the project; and e any other criteria that the Committee considers relevant to the project. 
8 	The Committee shall select at least three finalists. Finalists may be required to appear for an interview or provide additional information to the Committee, provided that all finalists are afforded an equal opportunity to do so. 
9 	The Committee shall rank the finalists in order of qualification and transmit the list of ranked finalists to the Approving Body. No person or firm, including applicants' listed consultants, debarred pursuant to MGL chapter 149, § 44C, shall be included as a finalist on the list. 
The list must be accompanied by a written explanation of the reasons for selection including the recorded vote, if any. The written explanation and recorded vote, if any, shall be public records and shall be maintained in the contract file. 
10 If the fee was set prior to the selection process, the Approving Body shall select a designer from the list of finalists. If the Approving Body selects a designer other than the one ranked first by the Committee, the Approving Body shall file a written justification for the selection with the Committee and maintain a copy in the contract file. 
11 If the fee is to be negotiated, the Approving Body shall review the list of finalists and may exclude any designer from the list if a written explanation of the exclusion is filed with the Committee and maintained in the contract file. The Approving Body shall request a fee proposal from the first ranked designer remaining on the list and begin contract negotiations. If the Approving Body is unable to negotiate a satisfactory fee with the first ranked designer, negotiations shall be terminated and undertaken with the remaining designers, one at a time, in the order in which they were ranked by the Committee until agreement is reached. In no event may a fee be negotiated which is higher than the maximum fee set by the Approving Body prior to selection of finalists. 
12 If the Approving Body is unable to negotiate a satisfactory fee with any of the finalists, the Approving Body shall recommend that the Committee select additional finalists. 
13 The Approving Authority may allow a designer who conducted a feasibility study to continue with the design of a project. However, the Approving Authority may commission, at its discretion, an independent review, by a knowledgeable and competent individual or business doing such work, of the feasibility of the designer's work to insure its reasonableness and its adequacy before allowing the designer to continue on the project, provided the Approving Authority otherwise complies with the statutory requirements for selecting a designer under Chapter 7C of the General Laws, including those set forth in MGL chapter 7C, § 54(a)(i). 
14 Every contract for design services shall include the following: a certification that the designer or construction manager has not given, offered, or agreed to give any person, corporation, or other entity any gift, contribution, or offer of employment as an inducement for, or in connection with, the award of the contract for design services; b certification that no consultant to, or subcontractor for, the designer or construction manager has given, offered, or agreed to give any gift, contribution, or offer of employment to the designer or construction manager, or to any other person, corporation, or entity as an inducement for, or in connection with, the award to the consultant or subcontractor of a contract by the designer or construction manager; c certification that no person, corporation, or other entity, other than a bona fide full-time employee of the designer or construction manager, has been retained or hired by the designer or construction manager to solicit for or in any way assist the designer or construction manager in obtaining the contract for design services upon an agreement or understanding that such person, corporation, or other entity be paid a fee or other consideration contingent upon the award of the contract to the designer; and d certification that the designer has internal accounting controls as required by MGL chapter 30, § 39R(c), and that the designer has filed and will continue to file an audited financial statement as required by M.G.L. c. 30, § 39R(d). 
All fees shall be stated in design contracts, and in any subsequent amendments thereto, as a total dollar amount. Contracts may provide for equitable adjustments in the event of changes in scope or services. 
15 The Awarding Authority shall not enter into a contract for design services unless the Awarding Authority or the designer has obtained professional liability insurance covering negligent errors, omissions, and acts of the designer or of any person or business entity for whose performance the designer is legally liable arising out of the performance of the contract. The total amount of such insurance shall at a minimum equal the lesser of one million dollars or ten percent of the project's estimated cost of construction, or such larger amounts as the Awarding Authority may require, for the applicable period of limitations. A designer required by the Awarding Authority to obtain all or a portion of such insurance coverage at its own expense shall furnish a certificate or certificates of insurance coverage to the Awarding Authority prior to the award of the contract. 
16 Every contract for design services shall include a provision that the designer or its consultants shall not be compensated for any services involved in preparing changes that are required for additional work that should have been anticipated by the designer in the preparation of the bid documents, as reasonably determined by the individual responsible for administering the design contract. 
17 In the event of an emergency that precludes the normal use of these designer selection procedures, the Approving Body may elect to authorize expedited procedures to address the emergency. The Approving Body shall document in writing the reasons for the emergency declaration, the proposed scope of work, the estimated cost of construction, the established fee for the needed design services, and any other relevant information. 
The Approving Body may select three finalists from any standing list of designers who have applied for projects of a similar nature, or may otherwise select three designers to be considered as finalists for the project. The Approving Body shall rank the finalists in order of qualification and select the designer for the emergency work. 
18 The Awarding Authority shall publish the name of any designer awarded a contract in the Central Register. 
19 The following records shall be kept by the Awarding Authority: a all information supplied by or obtained about each applicant; b all actions taken relating to the project; and any other records related to designer selection. 
All records shall be available for inspection by the state Designer Selection Board and other authorized agencies. 
20 The Awarding Authority shall evaluate designers' performance on contracts using the Designer Selection Board evaluation form(s) in accordance with MGL chapter 7C, § 48(g), and file completed evaluations with the Board and any other agency named in MGL chapter 7C, § 48(g). 
21 Nothing in these Procedures shall be interpreted to require the establishment of a board or waive or reduce the requirements of any other applicable law or regulation. 
22 For any municipal design or construction project that includes funding provided by the Commonwealth, in whole or in part (such as reimbursements, grants and the like), cities and towns must incorporate minority-owned business enterprise and women-owned business enterprise participation goals. If applicable, the Awarding Authority shall take steps to assure that it complies with all State Office of Minority and Women Business Assistance requirements.

Application for Minor Change - Approved Signs in the Business B District 
ADMINISTRATIVE RULE 
Application for Minor Change - Approved Signs in the Business B District 
Minor changes to signs in the Business B district that have already received a Certificate of Appropriateness from the CPDC pursuant to Section 6.2.4 of the Zoning Bylaw are eligible to receive administrative approval from the Town Planner provided that: 1 No change is proposed in the use category, for example, a new restaurant is proposed in a 
former restaurant location, and 
2 	No changes are proposed in the type, materials, size, lighting, or audio/visual aspects of the new sign, for example a blue awning with white letters will replace a green awning of the same size, shape, type and materials with white letters of the same size, shape, type and materials, and in the same sign location, and 
3 	No substantial change in the graphic design element is proposed, for example a single solid-colored graphic will replace a different single, solid colored graphic. A new sign with a multi-colored graphic replacing a solid colored graphic would require a hearing for a new Certificate of Appropriateness, and 
4 	No outstanding sign or zoning violations are present and that the property is free and clear of nonconformities that could reasonably be corrected at the same time. 
If the application meets all of the above criteria, the Town Planner may issue a new Certificate of Appropriateness. If the above criteria are not met or the Town Planner determines that the sign change is not minor, the application will be referred to the CPDC for a public hearing on the issuance of a new Certificate of Appropriateness in accordance with Section 6.2.4 of the Zoning Bylaw. 
Procedure: 
Submittal of a written request for administrative approval accompanied by a copy of the prior Certificate of Appropriateness, photographs of the existing sign(s), and color rendering of proposed sign. The Town Planner will act on the written request within 21 days of receipt.

3.6.5 Legal Advertising and Filing Costs 
All expenses for legal notice advertising, abutter notification, and recording and filing of plans and documents shall be paid by the applicant.

3.7 Completeness of Application 
3.7.1 	Before CPDC may act on an application filed pursuant to these Regulations, CPDC or the Town Planner shall first determine whether the application is complete and properly submitted.

If an application is determined not to be complete or not to be a proper submittal, it shall be denied without need of a public hearing; CPDC or the Town Planner shall send written notice to the applicant by registered mail at least seven days beforehand that CPDC will be considering such denial. The notification of any such denial or other action by CPDC shall be filed with Town Clerk within seven days following the vote by CPDC to do so. 
3.7.2 	If additional material as required herein or a request for a waiver is submitted after the original date of filing of the application, it shall not be considered by CPDC as part of the application nor shall it be considered as material perfecting the completeness of the application, unless it is accompanied by an Acceptance of Additional Application Material and New Submission Date form (Form D), filed with CPDC and the Town Clerk, signed by the applicant agreeing and acknowledging that the date of submission of such additional material shall supersede the original date of filing for purposes of determining the date by which CPDC must take action and make notification thereof with respect to the application. 
3.8 Waivers In accordance with MGL Chapter 41, Section 81R, CPDC may at its discretion waive strict compliance with these Regulations in any particular case where such action is determined by CPDC to be in the public interest and not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of these Regulations or with Subdivision Control Law. A waiver may be approved only by a vote of the majority of the full membership of CPDC, which may make approval of any waiver conditional on requirements it specifies to be fulfilled by the applicant in the proposed subdivision, its vicinity, or the Town of Reading. 
If an applicant desires certain requirements waived for a plan submitted pursuant to these Regulations, the request for waiver shall be submitted as part of the application as set forth in Section 3.7. The request shall cite the particular provision of these Regulations for which the waiver is requested and give justification therefor. 
3.8.1 Waiver of a Submission Requirement 
If an applicant has, in the application, requested a waiver of a submission requirement, and if CPDC makes a finding that the waiver would not violate State Law or local Bylaw or would not impair the ability of CPDC or other Town Boards or officials to understand the nature and impacts of the proposed plan or to process the application, then CPDC may grant the waiver. If such a finding is not made then CPDC shall not grant the waiver, and the application may be determined not to be proper or complete and may be denied on that basis. 
3.8.2 Waiver of a Development Standard 
An applicant may, in the original application or in writing subsequent thereto, request a waiver of a development standard contained in these Regulations. CPDC may, in its sole discretion grant, the waiver on a finding by CPDC that the waiver would be in the public interest and not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the Subdivision Control Law and these Regulations. If such a finding is not made then CPDC shall not grant the waiver, and the application may be determined not to be proper or complete and may be denied on that basis. CPDC may require on-site or off-site improvements to be done by the applicant of cost reasonably related to the value of the waivers granted. 
3.9 	Consent of the Property Owner When the applicant does not own the property shown in a plan submitted with an application pursuant to these Regulations, the applicant shall state the nature of his or her interest in the property and shall submit the written consent of the record owner by having such owner endorse the application. In cases where the record owner is not an individual (e.g. a corporation, partnership, trust, or some other similar entity), proper documents shall be submitted with the application granting the party signing authority on behalf of the ownership entity. An application made by someone other than the record owner without such endorsement shall not be considered a proper submission. 
3.10 Withdrawal An applicant may withdraw a submitted plan by filing with CPDC, the Board of Health, and the Town Clerk a written request for withdrawal on a Request to Withdraw an Application for Subdivision Approval form (Form E). If such request is filed before the date of publication of the first notice of public hearing, such request does not require CPDC approval; otherwise, the withdrawal is valid only upon approval by vote of a majority of the membership of CPDC. 
3.11 	Extension An applicant or CPDC may request an extension of the statutory time limits for CPDC to take and file notification of action on the submitted application in order to provide additional time to discuss issues related to the application. The request shall be made in writing on a Request for Extension of Statutory Deadline form (Form F), and shall be effective when signed by both the applicant and the Chairman of CPDC, and shall be filed with the Town Clerk. 
3.12 	Rights of Others in Land Shown on a Plan The approval of a plan by CPDC does not affect any rights which others may have in or over the land being divided or subdivided, nor does it give the applicant the right to perform work on land owned by others. CPDC assumes that any plans submitted for its consideration are correct unless evidence is presented to the contrary. The acquisition of necessary rights and the presentation of complete and accurate information to CPDC are responsibilities of the applicant, and failure to do so, including the failure or inability to obtain all necessary permits, licenses, releases, or rights may constitute reason for denial of a plan or for rescission of approval of a Definitive Plan. 
3.13 	Endorsement and Certification Endorsement of Approval-Not-Required and Certification of Definitive Plans shall be by signature on the first page of the plans of the majority of the full membership of CPDC following a vote by a majority of the full membership of CPDC in favor of a motion to endorse an Approval-Not-Required Plan or to approve, with or without conditions, a Definitive Plan; the signature of the Chairman of CPDC on subsequent pages of a set of Definitive Plans shall attest to the signature of such majority on the first page thereof as an alternative to the signature on all such subsequent pages of such majority. 
3.14 	Public Open Spaces and Protection of Natural Features Before approval of a Definitive Plan, the Commission may require that the Plan show a park or parks suitably located for playground or recreation purposes or for providing light and air. The park or parks shall not be unreasonable in area in relation to the land being subdivided and the prospective uses of such land. The Commission may by appropriate endorsement on the Plan require that no building be erected upon such park or parks for a period of not more than three years from the date of Definitive Plan approval without its approval. This land shall be made available for acquisition by the Town with just compensation to the owner thereof. The failure of the Town to make such an acquisition within such three years shall free the owner from this requirement. 
The Commission may also require that the Plan make accommodation for or provide access to existing or potential greenways, bikeways, open space, Town Forest, Town Conservation land and natural areas, identifiable in accordance with criteria established in the Town of Reading's Master Plan or Open Space and Recreation Plan. 
Due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as large trees, water courses, scenic points, historic spots, and similar community assets, which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the property. 
3.15	 Off-Site Mitigation 
3.15.1 	It shall be the responsibility of an applicant who has received subdivision approval under these Regulations to properly repair or remedy any damage done to, or debris or other materials deposited on properties or ways within or outside of the subdivision, by any party performing work within the subdivision. CPDC may hold an appropriate bond amount against the fulfillment of this responsibility. 
3.15.2 	If CPDC finds in reviewing a proposed subdivision plan that the proposed subdivision creates or aggravates adverse impacts on abutting or nearby properties, public or private ways or other facilities of the Town of Reading , then the CPDC as a condition of approval of any such plan may require the applicant to take such actions as are necessary to mitigate the creation or aggravation of such adverse impacts. The conditions or requirements imposed by CPDC shall be proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts caused by the proposed development. If the CPDC finds that the proposed subdivision cannot be serviced by the public or private ways or other facilities of the Town of Reading in a manner so as to insure that the purposes of the Subdivision Control Law and of these Regulations are met, then the CPDC shall require that reasonable and appropriate improvements be made to the public or private ways or other facilities so as to insure compliance of such subdivision with the Subdivision Control Law and these Regulations. Such improvements shall be consistent with the requirements of Sections 7.0 and 8.0 hereof. 
3.16 Blasting If there is any blasting needed in any development approved in accordance with these Regulations, the applicant shall be responsible for implementing the following program: a The party conducting the blasting shall have a certificate of competence from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and shall have requisite insurance and blasting, public liability insurance as required by 527 CMR 13.00 effective March 1, 1996 and as may be amended from time to time. b The party conducting the blasting shall obtain a permit from the Fire Chief and shall file with the Fire Chief a statutorily required bond with sureties, as required by MGL Chapter 148 Section 10A, 527 CMR 1.04, and MGL Chapter 148 Section 19. c A pre-blast survey shall be conducted of all improvements on properties any portion of which lie within 500 feet of the blast location. d At a minimum all provisions of 527 CMR: Board of Fire Prevention Regulations, 13.00 Explosives, shall be fully adhered to. 
3.17 	Accuracy of Plans Applicants are hereby notified that all details, including but not limited to site grading or the preservation of trees indicated as to be saved or preserved, shown on any approved Definitive Subdivision Plan are binding on the applicant for full and faithful implementation. 
3.18 	Continuance of Obligation Applicants are hereby notified that CPDC shall hold the applicant, or the applicant's heirs, successors, or assigns in the entirety of the subdivision, solely responsible for the complete, proper, legal, and workmanlike compliance with these Regulations, with all terms and conditions of approval of the applicant's Definitive Subdivision Plans, and with all other applicable laws, Bylaw, and regulations. This responsibility shall cease upon the issuance by the CPDC of a Certificate of Completion (Form O) for the subdivision.

Traffic Engineers, Recommended Practice); 
Highway Capacity Manual (Transportation Research Board, Special Report 
209); 
Trip Generation Guidelines (Institute of Traffic Engineers). 

Due consideration shall be given to sight distances, according to criteria set forth in Section 7.1.6., in the study area, high-accident locations identified by the Police Department or state agencies, proportion of peak hour traffic volume compared with average daily volume, street and intersection layout, existing traffic control devices, public transportation routes, traffic speeds, adequacy of sidewalks and pedestrian ways, adequacies of horizontal and vertical geometry and layout of streets and intersections, and other factors affecting the efficiency and safety of travel. 
Data Collection 
Data for all study area intersections shall include volume and turning movement counts during peak traffic hours (and during site generation peak hours if different), accident research for the past three years, stopping sight distance measurements, vehicle travel speeds, and for all study area travel ways identification of all locations and segments where the vertical and/or horizontal sight distances are inadequate. 
Existing Conditions Analysis 
The study shall develop adjustment factors from available data in order to estimate average and peak-season peakhour traffic conditions; shall perform Level of Service (LOS) calculations at each intersection and analyze accident, sight distance, travel speed and other relevant data to identify locations with existing safety or capacity problems. 
No Build Analysis 
For comparative purposes, the study shall assess future conditions without the proposed subdivision. This assessment shall reflect at minimum a five-year projection into the future, unless otherwise directed by the Town Planner in particular cases; shall be based on future traffic growth estimation rates currently in use by appropriate state or regional agencies; shall factor into the analysis known major development in, or which will have impact upon, the study area; and shall calculate Levels of Service and compare them to existing conditions. The purpose of this analysis is to establish baseline conditions against which the anticipated future impacts of the proposed subdivision can be evaluated. 
Build Analysis 
The study shall calculate daily and peak-hour traffic generated from the proposed subdivision and distribution of traffic along travel ways leading from or to the subdivision; shall add all subdivision generated traffic to the No Build Analysis and calculate respective Levels of Service and compare these to those of the Existing Conditions and No Build Analyses and thereby identify the subdivision's projected impacts. 
g Mitigation of Impacts 
Pursuant to Section 3.15.2. hereof, the traffic study shall propose to the CPDC mitigation measures to address the traffic impacts, if any, of the subdivision. In general, mitigation measures shall result in the restoration of projected Levels of Service to those identified in the Existing Conditions Analysis. All mitigation measures so proposed shall be considered commitments by the applicant as part of the application made pursuant to these Regulations. 
4 Environmental Impact Report An Environmental Impact Report shall be provided in order to enable CPDC to assess the impact of the proposed subdivision on the Town's natural and social resources and on the provision of municipal services, and to ascertain the suitability of mitigation measures proposed by the applicant relative to such concerns as impact on Town infrastructure and services, recycling of stormwater into the ground, surface drainage effects, aquifer protection, water and air quality; preservation of botanical resources, wildlife habitats, historic structures, archaeological resources, geological features; existing or potential trails, greenways, and open space, recreation resources, and environmental health and safety.

Such conveyance shall grant, without cost and free of all liens and encumbrances, to the Town perpetual rights and easements to construct, inspect, repair, renew, replace, operate and forever maintain these utilities and to do all acts incidental thereto, in, through and under the whole of all streets in the subdivision, or such other land within or without the subdivision under which such utilities lie, including all easements. These provisions shall not be so construed as to relieve the developer and his successors in title of responsibility to complete all construction, as required by developer's covenants and agreements with the Town, and to thereafter maintain all streets and utilities in a satisfactory condition until they are accepted by the Town. 
Acceptance by CPDC of the improvements required for a Definitive Subdivision Plan does not constitute the laying out or acceptance of by the Town of any streets, bikeways, or footpaths within a subdivision. The subdivider shall retain title to the fee of each street, path, or easement in or appurtenant to the subdivision until conveyed to the Town and accordingly accepted, and shall maintain and repair the roads and drainage facilities in a manner satisfactory to CPDC during that period. 
If the subdivider chooses not to offer the right-of-way and other access easements in fee to the Town, this shall be noted on the Definitive Subdivision Plan and the subdivider shall propose and implement mechanisms for perpetual maintenance of the same acceptable to the CPDC. 
If the subdivider declared the intent to offer the right-of-way and other access easements to the Town, the subdivider shall submit all necessary documentation for street acceptance, including plans in a form acceptable to the Registry of Deeds, legal description, easements, and any grants of rights necessary. The subdivider shall maintain fee ownership of the road in question until the road is accepted as a public way. Proposed deed language that demonstrates compliance with this section shall be submitted to Town Counsel for review. 
9.5.2.3 As-Built Plan Upon completion of construction, and before release of a performance guarantee, the subdivider shall have prepared and submitted "As Built Plans" at the same scale as the street plans, which shall indicate the actual location of all of the following: a Boundaries of the right of way; b Boundaries of roadway improvements; c Building locations, driveway locations and other major site improvements; d Permanent monuments; e Location and inverts, with elevation, of the required utilities, hydrants and drainage; f Location of any other underground utilities, such as electricity, telephone lines, and street lighting g Lot boundaries. 
A Registered Land Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer retained by the subdivider, shall certify the completion of the construction of the ways and services as shown in the As-Built Plans and certify the accuracy of the As-Built Plans themselves. The As-Built Plans must be to the satisfaction of CPDC in terms of their content and form. An electronic copy of the as-built plan shall be submitted to the Engineering Division in a format acceptable to the Town Engineer. 
9.5.2.4 Releases and Certification of Completion 
When an applicant believes that the subdivision ways and installation of municipal services have been completed, the applicant shall in addition to the requirements of MGL Chapter 41, Section 81U: a Make a written request (Form O) for a Certificate of Completion, including 
a release of surety (Form M) if applicable, 
b 	Provide a mylar and three copies of a complete As-Built Plan as specified in Section 9.5.2.3 above, 
c 	Provide two copies of a certificate by the same Registered Land Surveyor or Professional Engineer which shall describe such work which has been completed, with itemization of work subject to any previous surety reductions, and which shall make a finding as to whether such work has fully complied with the approved Definitive Subdivision Plans, conditions of approval of same, and the Covenant. 
d 	Identify any exceptions from the approved Definitive Subdivision Plans and/or conditions of approval of such plans; such request for Certificate of Completion shall specify any minor exceptions only as approved by the Commission, together with any financial guarantee acceptable to the Commission concerning such exceptions; these exceptions shall not relate to such major improvements as streets, sidewalks, utilities, and drainage appurtenances. 
The acceptance of any subdivision roadway as a public street shall not be placed on any Warrant of any Town Meeting, nor shall CPDC recommend such acceptance, unless the subdivision containing such street shall have first been issued said Certificate of Completion and according to Section 9.6 hereof. 
In the event that a deviation from the above-referenced approvals is found, then prior to CPDC's entertaining any vote with respect to the requested reduction, such deviation shall be corrected to CPDC's satisfaction, or shall be subject, at the applicant's or CPDC's election, to the provisions of Section 
6.2.5 hereof. 
In the event that CPDC finds that required construction or installation, or the approved plan, or any condition of approval thereof, has not been fully or satisfactorily completed, then it shall specify such by registered mail to the applicant with a copy to the Town Clerk, as required by MGL Chapter 41 Section 81U. 
9.6 	Acceptance of Ways in a Subdivision as Public Ways Approval of a Definitive Subdivision Plan shall not of itself constitute the laying out or acceptance by the Town of any way shown on such Plan as a Town way, or the establishment as a public improvement for which the Town is responsible for, or the acceptance of any park playground, reserved area or other work or improvement shown on the Plan. 
The ways shown on such Definitive Subdivision Plan shall not become public ways unless and until laid out and accepted as Town ways in accordance with law, and such ways, if not laid out and accepted as Town ways, shall not be opened to public use unless such opening has been approved in the manner provided in MGL Chapter 41 Section 74. 
For those streets proposed to be accepted as public ways, the developer shall submit a Street Acceptance Plan to the Engineering Division for review and approval. The street acceptance plan shall be mylar conforming the rules and regulations of the register of deeds. An electronic copy of the street acceptance plan shall be submitted to the Engineering Division in a format acceptable to the Town Engineer. 
The Commission will ordinarily not report favorably upon the laying out of a Town way within a proposed subdivision, or approve the opening of a way therein for public use, except in accordance with the Street Acceptance Criteria stated below, and unless the owner of the subdivision has caused such way to be located and constructed in accordance with the provisions of these Rules and Regulations or, in the case of the laying out of a Town way, has agreed to pay the cost of laying out and constructing such way, through betterment assessments under MGL Chapter 80 or in some other equally effective manner. 
9.6.1 Street Acceptance Criteria The following criteria are those on which the Commission will base its recommendations to Town Meeting concerning the acceptance of streets: a If the proposed acceptance is not of a street developed through approval by CPDC under the Subdivision Regulations, the Planned Residential Development Bylaw, or the Planned Unit Development Bylaw, then the Commission will customarily have no recommendation; this would include: 1 Existing private streets not developed under Subdivision Control Law, and 2 Existing private subdivision streets approved by the Board of Survey (prior to July 1, 1986) under Subdivision Control Law, The recommendation of acceptance of such streets, and the decision as to whether or not to levy betterments for any needed improvements, appropriately reside with the Board of Selectmen as Road Commissioners, with the advice of Town Counsel, the Department of Public Works, the Conservation Commission, and other appropriate officials. b If the proposed acceptance is of a street developed through approval by CPDC under the Subdivision Regulations, the Planned Residential Development Bylaw, or the Planned Unit Development Bylaw, then the CPDC will not recommend such acceptance until: 1 All road and utility work has been given final inspection by the Town Engineer, found acceptable and so reported to CPDC, 2 The Town Planner, with input from the Town Engineer, the Tree Warden, the Health Director, the Fire Chief, the Building Inspector, and the Conservation Administrator, has reported to CPDC that all approval conditions have been met and occupancy permitted, 3 CPDC, in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations, or in accordance with the PRD or PUD Bylaw as appropriate, has formally voted either to issue a Certificate of Compliance or to recognize full completion of the development, respectively, 4 All bonds or other forms of surety under the discretion of CPDC have been released in full, except those pertinent to Section 9.5.2.4.d.; or if any part of the bond or other form of surety has been seized and appropriated, that all work done by the Town relative thereto has been completed and found acceptable by the Town Engineer,

The Director of Public Works, or authorized agent ("the Director"), will act for the Commission in the inspection of the work to insure compliance with these Regulations and to report to the Commission his recommendations as to approval or disapproval of the work. The Director will make certain inspections as prescribed herein in order to check the adequacy of the work at various stages prior to such work being covered by subsequent work. However, the Commission, the Director, and such other persons as the Commission may designate shall have the right to inspect the work at any time. Therefore, the developer shall at any time provide safe and convenient access to all parts of the work for inspection by the Commission or its authorized agents. 
All work which has been disapproved or is not acceptable to the Commission shall be removed and replaced or otherwise corrected to the point of complying with the requirements of the Commission for acceptance. Any work which has been covered by subsequent work prior to acceptance or is otherwise not available or obscured to the point of rendering inspection of the work difficult shall be considered to be not acceptable to the Commission. Such subsequent work shall be removed as directed by the Director to insure availability of the work to be inspected as required herein, and release of the performance guarantee of all work prescribed herein and on the Definitive Subdivision Plan and in the conditions of approval thereof, and as directed by the Commission shall be dependent thereon. 
At points as further described hereinafter, the construction of the required improvements shall be inspected by the Director, and unless approval of the work completed, including approval of materials used, to each such point has been given in writing, no further work shall be commenced. Such inspections may include the taking of certain samples for laboratory analysis or testing in such cases, the developer shall insure that the Director is in no way hindered or obstructed in the course of obtaining such samples. Where such samples are removed from the completed work the developer shall replace and restore such work, to the satisfaction of the Director to its condition prior to the taking of the sample. 
The Director may require certified copies of delivery receipts or bills of lading or other certification as to the description of materials used or incorporated in the work. The Director may also require a sample of any materials or supplies which may be incorporated in the work; such samples shall be furnished at the expense of the developer, and the developer shall be liable for all costs and fees incurred by the Commission as a result of transporting and testing such materials.

If requested, the developer shall also submit samples for testing one (1) week in advance of the date the test results are needed In the event the Director makes an inspection of the work at the time designated and finds that such work is not at the proper state of completion or that the work has been covered or otherwise obscured, the Director shall notify the developer and the Commission as to the additional steps the applicant shall take to complete the work to the point required or to the extent the work shall be uncovered or exposed to full view. The developer shall notify the Director again when the work is ready. 
The developer shall be liable for all costs and fees incurred by the Commission as a result of requests by the developer for an inspection of the work which, in the opinion of the Commission, was not at an acceptable stage of completion for such inspection. 
 Lines and Grades 
The Director will advise the Commission at any time during the construction, if, in his opinion, he believes that the work has not been laid out to the lines and grades as shown on the Definitive Plan or in the conditions of approval thereof. Any costs which, in the opinion of the Commission, are the responsibility of the developer shall be in addition to the fees required elsewhere herein. 
Inspection of Required Improvements 
The following inspections of the required improvements will be made by the Director. 
These inspections may be in addition to any other inspections the Commission may 
make or cause to be made. 
a First Inspection: An inspection will be made of the work upon completion of all 

clearing, grubbing and excavation and all work incidental thereto as may be required or implied. No fill shall have been placed at the time of this inspection. 
b 	Second Inspection: An inspection will be made of the completed drainage system (without backfill) as required or implied herein or on the Definitive Plan or in the conditions of approval thereof. At the same time, or such other time as the work may be available, an inspection will be made of the completed municipal services (without backfill) as required on the Definitive Plan or in the conditions of approval thereof. The inspection of the required municipal services will be made by the agencies responsible for the particular service. Each agency so involved will notify the Director of the approval of such work. Backfill of any portion of the drainage system or municipal services shall not be made until after receipt of notification of approval or acceptance by the Director or agency responsible. The inspection of the construction of the ways shall include the inspection of the backfilling and compaction of all utility trenches as may be installed by utility companies, and such work shall be performed in the manner as required by these Regulations, the Definitive Subdivision Plan, and the conditions of approval thereof. It shall be the developer's responsibility to insure compliance with these requirements.

c 
Third Inspection: An inspection will be made of the compacted fill as may be required to bring the roadways to their proposed grades. The developer shall notify the Director as to his source of gravel for fill as soon as such information is known, so that samples may be taken and analyzed by the Director. The developer is hereby advised not to proceed with the filling operation until such time as the Director notifies the developer that gravel proposed for the fill is acceptable, if the developer proceeds with the fill prior to such notice he does so at his own risk. The developer shall not use a gravel source other than the one designated without prior notice to the Director. 
d 	Fourth Inspection: An inspection will be made of the compacted roadway foundation. A gravel sample or samples may be taken at the option of the Director in the same manner as prescribed for the Third Inspection. The roadway foundation will be checked for proper grade and alignment.

Town of Reading Massachusetts 
Historical Commission 
Rules and Regulations General Information August 9, 2017 
Section 1 	Introduction 
The Reading Historical Commission (RHC) was established by a vote of Town Meeting, November 14, 1977. The Mission of the Reading Historical Commission is to identify and record historic assets of the Town and to develop and implement programs for their preservation. To accomplish its mission, the Reading Historical Commission has adopted the following Rules and Regulations, which may be amended as needed, as provided in the Reading Town Charter, Section 8.8. 
Section 2 	Organization, Powers, Functions and Duties of the Reading Historical Commission 
Members are appointed by the Board of Selectmen to staggered, three-year terms unless filling a vacancy. 
Associate Members are appointed by the Board of Selectmen for two-year terms. The number of appointed Associate Members shall not exceed two-thirds (2/3) of the number of regular members. If any regular member is absent from a meeting, disqualified from acting, or otherwise unable to deliberate on a particular matter that comes before the Reading Historical Commission, the chair may designate one or more Associate Members to deliberate and vote on any matter before the Reading Historical Commission. If more than one Associate Member is available to fill a temporary vacancy, the chair shall designate the Associate Member having the greatest tenure on the Reading Historical Commission; provided, however, that any Associate Member so designated shall be entitled to continue to participate in the matter as necessary and to remain qualified to vote thereon. 
The Reading Historical Commission without limitation has the following powers, functions and duties: 
a  To administer Reading’s Historic Demolition Delay Bylaw, Reading General Bylaws,  
Section 7.2 et seq.  
b  To participate in research, advocacy, survey, public education and other programs  
designed to preserve the Town’s cultural assets.  
c  Subject to appropriation, to employ consultants and incur other expenses appropriate to  
the carrying on of its work; to accept money gifts or donations and expend the same for  
such purposes; to maintain and expend funds in available RHC accounts in accordance  
with applicable Reading Historical Commission or Town Guidelines, including without  
limitation the Reading Historical Commission Preservation Trust Fund Account and  
Reading Historical Commission Guidelines for the Historical Commission Preservation  
Trust Fund, adopted November 7, 2002; and to charge filing fees for applications.  
d  To advise the Town’s Boards, Commissions and other Public Bodies in matters  
concerning Reading’s historic assets.  
e  To participate in environmental or other review and compliance projects that affect  
properties listed on the National and State Registers of Historic Places and receive  
federal or State funding in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic  
Preservation Act 36 CFR, Part 800, Massachusetts General Law Chapter 9, Sections 26­ 
27C, as amended by Chapter 254 of the Acts of 1988, and 950 CMR 70.00 – 73.00.  
f  To administer on behalf of the Town any properties or easements, restrictions or other  
interests in real property which the Town may have or may accept as gifts or otherwise,  
and which the Town may designate the Reading Historical Commission as the  
administrator thereof.  

Section 3 Historic Demolition Delay Bylaw, General Bylaw Section 7.2 et seq 
The following rules guide the Reading Historical Commission in applying the Historic Demolition Delay Bylaw (Bylaw); the full provisions of the Demolition Delay Bylaw govern in all cases. The following rules are only applicable to those structures included on Reading’s List of Historic Structures identified in the Bylaw: 
a 	Structures Included General Bylaw, Section 7.2.3 requires the Reading Historical Commission to provide to the Building Inspector the List of Historic Structures for administering the Demolition Delay Bylaw, which List is to be updated by Reading Historical Commission from time to time; and further requires that List to contain all structures included on the Town’s Historical and Architectural Inventory, past, present and future. In furtherance of this directive, Reading Historical Commission considers every outbuilding and secondary structure specifically identified or referenced anywhere on an Inventory Form B filed as a part of the Town’s Historical and Architectural Inventory, to be within the purview of the Bylaw’s requirement for inclusion and protection. 
b 	Procedures For Demolition Delay Public Hearings The Reading Historical Commission will use the set of procedures for Demolition Delay Public Hearings it adopted on January 28, 2014. 
c 	Scope Of Reading Historical Commission’s Consideration Reading Historical Commission’s consideration under the Historic Demolition Delay Bylaw applies to all exterior and interior features of a structure. 
d 	Duration Of Demolition Delay Hearing Decision And Early Release The results of a Demolition Delay Hearing are in effect for the duration of the delay period. If the Reading Historical Commission issues an early release of the delay period, that delay period is considered terminated as of the date of the Commission’s decision letter or where applicable, upon completion of any conditions for release as required and contained in the decision letter. 
e 	Early Release, Conditions and Agreement To Mitigate Effects Of Demolition Reading Historical Commission may consider an early release from an approved demolition delay period, per General Bylaw Section 7.2.6.3. In doing so, an applicant may agree to accept a demolition permit on specified conditions acceptable to the Reading Historical Commission. Such conditions may include an applicant’s submission of its plans for the use and improvement of the property after demolition to the Reading Historical Commission for its review and approval, or in the alternative, agreement to mitigate the effects of demolition in some other way. Such mitigation measures may include without limitation, photographing or documenting the building and its significant features; or preserving on site or elsewhere, some of these architectural features; or benefitting monetarily or otherwise some other Town historic resource or historic objective within the purview of the Reading Historical Commission. If the Reading Historical Commission, which may recommend changes, finds the conditions acceptable, and the Reading Historical Commission and the applicant are able to agree in writing upon whatever stipulations may be necessary to ensure that the conditions will be carried out as planned, the Reading Historical Commission shall advise the Building Inspector in writing of that agreement. At any time after receiving such written notice and authorization, the Building Inspector may issue a Demolition Permit, subject to such stipulations and pre-conditions, if any, as the Reading Historical Commission and the applicant may have agreed upon as mitigation for demolition. 
f  Demolition Permit Expiration Before Building Is Demolished If a Demolition Permit is issued by the Building Inspector, and if the Permit subsequently expires (see definitions below) but the building is not demolished before the expiration, the property owner first must repeat the Demolition Delay process before proceeding further.  
g  Effect Of Non-Issuance Of Demolition Permit Following Hearing If a Demolition Permit is not issued by the Building Inspector within two years after the close of a Demolition Delay Hearing, the property owner first must repeat the Demolition  

Delay process before proceeding further. 
Section 4 General Information 
The following relevant information, unrelated to the Historic Demolition Delay process, is provided here only as general reference information. 
The following definitions are applicable, in general, to structures in the Town of Reading: 
a Demolition Permit A type of Building Permit issued for an initial period of six months. 
b 	Demolition Permit Expiration A Demolition Permit will expire if demolition is not started within the first six months. If demolition is started but not completed in the first six months, the Building Inspector may grant the property owner an additional six months to complete the demolition. After one year from issuance of the Permit, the Building Inspector can extend the permit for up to two more six-month periods. A Demolition Permit cannot be extended beyond a period of two years. 
c 	Demolition Delay Non-Transferability An Reading Historical Commission Demolition Delay Hearing Decision runs and applies only to the individual owner who originally applied for the demolition permit that was the subject of that Demolition Delay Hearing. Any resulting demolition delay decision or period is not transferable, and any subsequent owner intending to demolish a structure must first repeat the Demolition Delay process before proceeding further. 
The following definitions are applicable only to those structures included on Reading’s List of Historic Structures or within a Local Historic District: 
a “Demolition by Neglect” If the Reading Historical Commission is made aware of historic properties in physical decline that would lead to probable demolition by neglect, then the RHC may notify the Building Inspector and encourage stabilization of the structure. Regarding a vacant historic property in such physical decline, the Reading Historical Commission may alternatively request action under Town of Reading, General Bylaws, Section 8.10, Maintenance of Vacant Buildings and Land. 
b 	Local Historic Districts Reading’s Local Historic District Bylaw, General Bylaw, Section 7.3 et seq., governs designated local historic districts and supercedes Reading Historical Commission jurisdiction. Structures located within a Local Historic District (LHD) are subject only to that Local Historic District Bylaw, and such structures are not covered by Reading’s Historic Demolition Delay Bylaw.

which are part of vista(s) paralleling roadways or which create a frame of reference
for more distant views, and trees whose presence contributes substantially to the
rural or woodland character of the roadway, particularly in comparison to more
developed or urbanized nearby areas;
b Bordering stone walls of either historical significance or aesthetic value;
c Any other bordering natural or man-made feature(s) of either historical significance
or aesthetic value which would be adversely affected by any alteration of the
roadway;

Town of Reading Wetlands Protection Regulations Conservation Commission
4 Wetlands Protection Regulations – August 2016
SECTION 1 INTRODUCTION
The citizens of the Town of Reading, Massachusetts, through Town Meeting action, gave
the Conservation Commission power to regulate and protect wetlands and floodplains by
adding Section 7.1, Wetlands Protection, to the Reading General Bylaw. This
Amendment to the Town Bylaw was approved by the Massachusetts Attorney General on
February 29, 1980.
All filings made under the Wetlands Protection Act (Massachusetts General Laws,
Chapter 131, Section 40) are also subject to the Town of Reading General Bylaw,
Section 7.1 Some projects not subject to the Wetlands Protection Act may still be
subject to Section 7.1.
From time to time and after a public hearing, the Commission amends the Reading
Wetlands Protection Regulations. Amendments are intended to formalize actions that the
Commission has taken to address recurrent issues, to clarify the language used in the
regulations, and to maintain consistency with changes made by the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts in the Wetlands Protection Act and its accompanying regulations, Title
310, Code of Massachusetts Regulations, Section 10.00. The amendments are based on
the current body of experience and knowledge that the Commission has accumulated in
implementing both the Act and the Wetlands Protection Regulations. The amendments
are also based on new scientific and regulatory literature and workshops promulgated by
the Massachusetts Association of Conservation Commissions and the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection. The amendments are intended to further
clarify and streamline the regulatory process, to be more consistent with aspects of the
State regulations, and to protect specific resources in Reading that are not well
addressed in the statewide wetlands protection regulations.
Submission guidelines and forms are available through the office of the Conservation
Commission at the Reading Town Hall. These guidelines are intended to maximize
efficiency in project review, minimize post-application redesign, and minimize delay in
the permitting process.
The Reading Conservation Commission recognizes that environmental review is a sitespecific
process. The submission guidelines are therefore intended to be taken as
guidelines in the broadest sense. The Commission intends that consultants have
maximum flexibility in design and freedom to employ innovative techniques to minimize
adverse environmental impacts. Pre-application conferences and site visits are strongly
encouraged.
Town of Reading Wetlands Protection Regulations Conservation Commission
5 Wetlands Protection Regulations – August 2016
SECTION 2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
A Authority
1 These Regulations are promulgated under the authority of the Home Rule Amendment of
Article LXXXIX (89), of the amendments of the Constitution of Massachusetts, 1966 and
Section 7.1 of the General Bylaw of the Town of Reading (“the Bylaw”), and shall be
effective upon the fulfillment of all legal requirements.
B Purpose
1 These Regulations are promulgated to create uniformity of process and to clarify and
define the provisions of the Town of Reading Wetlands Protection Bylaw.
C Jurisdiction
1 Areas Subject to Protection under the Bylaw (Resource Areas):
Consistent with 310 CMR 10.55(2)(c)1 and 2, any fresh water wetland including marsh,
meadow, or bog, that supports a preponderance of hydrophytic vegetation; the
substrate in the uppermost foot is predominantly undrained hydric soil and the substrate
is saturated with water or covered by shallow water at some time during the growing
season of each year; any creek, river, stream, pond (including vernal pool), or lake
whether permanent or intermittent; any land under water bodies; any land subject to
flooding; and any riverfront area.
2 Activities Subject to Regulation under the Bylaw:
Any activity proposed or undertaken within an area specified above which will remove,
fill, dredge or alter that area is subject to regulation under the Bylaw and requires the
filing of a Notice of Intent or an Abbreviated Notice of Intent.
3 Activities within the Buffer Zone:
Any activity proposed or undertaken within one hundred feet of all areas specified above
except for land subject to flooding, (hereinafter called the Buffer Zone) which, in the
judgment of the issuing authority, is likely to alter an area subject to protection under
the Bylaw is subject to regulation and requires the filing of a Notice of Intent, or an
Abbreviated Notice of Intent.
4 Activities outside the Buffer Zone:
Any activity proposed or undertaken outside the areas specified above and outside the
Buffer Zone is not subject to regulation under this bylaw and does not require the filing
of a Notice of intent or Abbreviated Notice of Intent unless that activity is more likely
than unlikely to alter an area subject to protection under this bylaw. In the event that
the Commission determines that such activity is more likely than unlikely to alter an
area subject to protection under the Bylaw, it shall impose conditions on the activity or
any portion thereof as it deems necessary to contribute to the protection of the interests
identified in the Bylaw.
D Filing Fees
1 The local newspaper charges the applicant for publishing the legal notice of the public
hearing or public meeting that is required by law for all Requests for Determination,
Notices of Intent, Abbreviated Notices of Intent, Abbreviated Notices of Resource Area
Delineation, and Amendments to Orders of Conditions.

E Variance from Regulations
1 The Conservation Commission may grant a variance from strict compliance with these
regulations for a proposed activity when the Commission finds that:
a There are no reasonable conditions or alternatives that would allow the project to
proceed in compliance with the performance standards in these Regulations; and
b Mitigating measures are proposed that will allow the project to be conditioned so as
to have no adverse impact upon the wetland values set forth in Section 7.1 of the
Reading General Bylaws; and
c The variance is necessary to accommodate an overriding community, regional, state,
or national public interest. In the case of owner occupied single or two family
residences, mitigation which improves the resource area quality may be considered
to accommodate the public interest.
2 Any request for a variance shall be submitted to the Commission in writing as part of a
Notice of Intent or a Request to Amend an Order of Conditions. The applicant shall
submit an analysis of alternatives explored that would allow the project to proceed in
compliance with these Regulations and an explanation of why each alternative is
unreasonable. The applicant shall also submit a description of the mitigating measures
to be used to prevent adverse impacts upon wetland values. The applicant shall also
submit evidence that an overriding public interest is associated with the project that
justifies the variance. After holding a public hearing on the Notice of Intent or Request to
Amend an Order of Conditions, the Commission shall issue a written decision concerning
the request for a variance as part of the Commission’s decision on said Notice of Intent
or Request to Amend an Order of Conditions.
F Burden of Proof
1 Any person who files a Request for Determination of Applicability, Notice of Intent or
Abbreviated Notice of Intent to perform any work within an area subject to protection
under the Bylaw, or within the Buffer Zone, has the burden of demonstrating to the
Commission that:
a The area is not significant to any of the interests identified in the Bylaw; or
b The proposed work will contribute to the protection of the interests identified in the
Bylaw by complying with the performance standards listed in these regulations.
Town of Reading Wetlands Protection Regulations Conservation Commission
8 Wetlands Protection Regulations – August 2016
G Emergencies
1 Any person requesting permission to do an emergency project shall specify why the
project is necessary for the health or safety of the citizens of the Commonwealth and
what agency of the Commonwealth or subdivision thereof, including the Town of
Reading, is to perform the project or has ordered the project to be performed. If the
project is certified to be an emergency by the Conservation Commission or its
Administrator, the certification shall include a description of the work which is to be
allowed and shall not include work beyond that necessary to abate the emergency. A
site inspection shall be made prior to certification.
2 The time limitation for performance of emergency work shall not exceed 30 days unless
written approval of the Commission is obtained. However, if the emergency work is for
Immediate Response Actions approved by the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection, Bureau of Waste Site Cleanup, in accordance with the
provisions of 310 CMR 40.0410, then the time limit shall not exceed 60 days unless
written approval of the Commission is obtained.
3 The recipient of an emergency certificate may be required by the Administrator or a
member of the Commission to meet with the Commission to explain the nature and
extent of the work performed and its long-term impacts upon the interests protected by
Section 7.1 of the Reading General Bylaws and these Regulations. The Commission may
require that the recipient of the emergency certificate, the owner of the subject
property, and/or the persons responsible for the emergency shall file a Notice of Intent
documenting the impacts and setting forth a proposal for restoration, mitigation, and
other actions to ameliorate the impacts.
H Enforcement
1 The Commission shall have the authority to enforce the Bylaw and these Regulations by
means of violation notices, and/or enforcement orders, administrative orders, civil
actions and/or criminal proceedings. The enforcing person shall mean any member of
the Commission or its agent. In addition, pursuant to Reading General Bylaws Section
7.1: the provisions of said Bylaw and these Regulations may be enforced by noncriminal
disposition (fines) in accordance with the provisions of Bylaw Section 7.1 and
Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 40 Section 21D. For the purposes of such
noncriminal disposition the term “enforcing person” shall mean any member of the
Conservation Commission, the Conservation Administrator or his or her designee.
2 Any enforcing person taking cognizance of a violation of RGB Section 7.1 or these
regulations may, as an alternative to initiating criminal proceedings, give the offender a
written notice to appear before the clerk of the district court having jurisdiction thereof
at any time during office hours, not later than twenty-one days after the date of such
notice. Such notice shall be in triplicate and shall contain the name and address, if
known, of the offender, the specific offense charged, and the time and place for his
required appearance. Such notice shall be signed by the enforcing person and shall be
signed by the offender whenever practicable in acknowledgement that such notice has
been received.
3 The Town shall fix as penalty for such a violation a specific sum of money not exceeding
three hundred dollars ($ 300.00). The payment to said clerk of such sum shall operate
as a final disposition of the case.

provisions of the Bylaw without the required authorization; or cause, suffer or allow such
activity; or leave in place unauthorized fill; or otherwise fail to restore illegally altered
Town of Reading Wetlands Protection Regulations Conservation Commission
9 Wetlands Protection Regulations – August 2016
land to its original condition; or fail to comply with an enforcement order issued
pursuant to the provisions of this bylaw.
5 Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense, except that any
person who fails to remove unauthorized fill or otherwise fails to restore illegally altered
land to its original condition after giving written notification of said violation to the
Conservation Commission shall not be subject to additional penalties under the Bylaw
unless said person thereafter fails to comply with an enforcement order or order of
conditions
6 Any person who violates any provision of said Bylaw or of these Regulations or of any
condition of an order or a permit issued pursuant hereto, or who allows such violation to
occur on his or her property, may be ordered to restore the property to its original
condition and take other actions deemed necessary to remedy such violations, and shall,
at the discretion of the enforcing person, be punished by a fine of not more than $ 300
for each offense. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, failure to pay said fine within
twenty-one (21) calendar days may result in criminal prosecution.
7 Citations issued by the enforcing person shall subsequently be presented to the
Conservation Commission for its review. If the Commission does not take action at that
time, it shall be deemed to approve of the issuance of such citation. Upon review, the
Commission may, at its discretion, withdraw the citation. Notwithstanding said review,
during the review the violator shall remain subject to all other provisions of this section.
8 The Town shall be the beneficiary of all fines imposed on account of the violation of said
Bylaw or these Regulations, in order to help defray the expense of enforcing the same.

I Limited Projects
1 If a project is considered limited as specified in 310 CMR 10.53(3) an Order of
Conditions can be issued under the Reading Wetland Regulations notwithstanding the
provisions of the Reading Wetland Protection Regulations if all conditions specified in 310
CMR 10.53(3) are satisfied.
J Normal Maintenance
1 Maintenance of existing developed or landscaped yards or structures within the buffer
zone that does not result in any net loss of native vegetation or permanently alter the
soil surface (other than for planting of vegetation) is exempt from filing under the
Reading Wetland Regulations. Examples include but are not limited to: trimming of
branches and shrubs, pruning (but not removing) trees, and removal of invasive
species. If ornamental shrubs located within 25 feet of a Resource Area are removed,
they must be replaced by a similar shrub.
Town of Reading Wetlands Protection Regulations Conservation Commission
11 Wetlands Protection Regulations – August 2016
SECTION 3 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR RESOURCE AREAS
A General
1 The following section is intended to notify applicants proposing work that may alter
areas subject to protection under the Bylaw of what performance standards should be
applied, and to identify the level of protection needed to protect the interests identified
in the Bylaw.
B Banks
1 Proposed work that may alter a bank shall not adversely affect the following:
a The stability of the bank;
b The capacity of the channel to convey water;
c Ground water and surface water quality;
d The capacity of the bank to provide important fisheries, wildlife habitat, food, shelter,
migratory, breeding, and overwintering areas; or
e The function of the bank to recharge or discharge groundwater.
C Fresh Water Wetlands
1 Because of the history, geography, geology and hydrology of Reading some wetlands
may not qualify for state protection under 310 CMR 10.55 due to being isolated or
disconnected from water bodies. These will be protected under the local By-Law
provided that: (1.) they are 500 or more square feet in area, and (2.) they meet all of
the other criteria of 310 CMR 10.55 with the exception of connection to water bodies.
2 It is the Commission’s policy that there shall be no net loss of fresh water wetlands,
including marshes, wet meadows, bogs, and swamps.
3 Any proposed work that may alter a fresh water wetland shall not destroy or otherwise
impair any portion of the area. However, the Commission may issue an Order of
Conditions permitting work that results in the alteration of less than 5000 square feet of
fresh water wetland, provided the following requirements are met:
a There is no reasonable alternative to a proposed crossing, utility easement, or
roadway drainage structure;
b All design mitigations, including the utilization of structures such as headwalls, have
been utilized to minimize the alteration of wetlands;
c A revegetation plan addressing issues of interspersion and diversity of vegetation has
been submitted, describing the construction and the amount of recreated fresh water
wetland necessary to compensate for that portion that is proposed to be destroyed;
d The replacement fresh water wetland area must adequately replicate the wetland
functions to be lost, and shall be at a 2:1 ratio to the area lost. The replacement
freshwater wetland shall have an unrestricted hydraulic connection to the same fresh
water wetland, waterbody, or waterway associated with the lost area;
e The replacement area shall be located in the same general area of the fresh water
wetland, water body, or reach of the waterway as the lost area;
f All surface vegetation and contours of the replacement area shall be substantially
restored within two growing seasons; and
Town of Reading Wetlands Protection Regulations Conservation Commission
12 Wetlands Protection Regulations – August 2016
g Excavation and soil preparation: Timing of any preparation of any replacement area
shall be specified in the Order of Conditions.
4 Supporting biological data for fresh water wetland delineation shall be considered valid
for a period of three years from the date of the issuance of an Order of Conditions or a
Determination of Applicability.
D Zone of Natural Vegetation
1 Bordering any wetland, the Commission may require a Zone of Natural Vegetation (ZNV)
of sufficient width and vegetative community type to assure that silt, soil, fertilizer in
solution, organic chemicals, herbicides, organic manures, oils or petroleum products
which may be carried by surface run-off shall not reach that wetland, but instead will be
trapped by the natural mulch, soil and roots; and that light levels and temperature shall
be moderated; and that dispersal of seeds of exotic or otherwise disruptive plant
species, such as phragmites reed and purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) shall be
avoided; and that other alterations shall be avoided or mitigated within the wetland.
2 Under most conditions, a zone width of a minimum of twenty-five feet would be
considered sufficient to accomplish this purpose. A wider ZNV may be required,
depending on specific site conditions, such as grades, soil permeability or other impact
potential.
3 Excavations for proposed structures extend beyond the finished limits of the structures.
The extent of excavation varies depending on: the nature of the structure; the soil;
depth of excavation; type of equipment used; construction techniques; slope; incidence
of precipitation; groundwater flow; soil saturation and freeze/thaw cycles; existing
vegetative cover; or other ground cover. An area of curtilage is developed around
structures as a result of access for finish work, maintenance, foot traffic, and machine
travel such as lawnmowers; and to provide a clear area for security; and to prevent
moisture damage and physical damage from shading and plant structures such as tree
limbs.
4 To protect the integrity of the Zone of Natural Vegetation, including the associated root
system and canopy, no new foundations, including footings, frost walls or other inground
structures, shall be permitted within ten feet of the ZNV. Depending on special
site conditions, a greater distance may be required. Associated structures, including but
not limited to the following: cantilevered structures, bay windows, eaves, and, garrisons,
or other overhangs, may protrude to no closer than seven feet from the ZNV.
5 Notwithstanding the standards of the preceding paragraph, the Commission may grant a
reduced setback distance of structures from the ZNV as a consideration of specific site
conditions, such as limited vegetative cover or an existing developed condition, and
provided that a permanent physical delineation, such as a solid hedge or an appropriate
permanent fence or wall, of sufficient height, shall be provided and shall be maintained
between the structure and the ZNV.
6 Permanent markers shall be installed and maintained in convenient locations along the
limits of the ZNV, such as at any corners or along a radius, no more than fifty feet apart.
Markers may be stone or concrete bounds, metal pipes or rods, trees, shrubs or other
structures as approved.
E Land Subject to Flooding
1 Proposed work that may alter land subject to flooding shall not adversely affect the
interests protected under the Bylaw, including the flood control capacity of said area.
Town of Reading Wetlands Protection Regulations Conservation Commission
13 Wetlands Protection Regulations – August 2016
2 Additional alterations beyond the above threshold, or altering vernal pool habitat, may
be permitted if they will have no adverse effects on important wildlife habitat, food,
shelter, migratory, breeding or overwintering areas.
3 Construction of the compensatory storage area shall be completed prior to any alteration
of the existing storage area.
4 Compensatory storage shall be provided for all flood storage volume that will be lost as
the result of a proposed project within land subject to flooding, when in the judgment of
the issuing authority said loss will cause an increase or will contribute incrementally to
an increase in the horizontal extent and level of flood waters during peak flows.
Compensatory storage shall mean a volume not previously used for flood storage and
shall be incrementally equal to the theoretical volume of flood water at each elevation,
up to and including the 100-year flood elevation, which would be displaced by the
proposed project. Such compensatory volume shall have an unrestricted hydraulic
connection to the same waterway or water body. Further, with respect to waterways,
such compensatory volume shall be provided within the same reach of the river, stream,
or creek.
5 Work within land subject to flooding, including that work required to provide the abovespecified
compensatory storage, shall not restrict flows so as to cause an increase in
flood stage or velocity.
6 Work in those portions of land subject to flooding found to be significant to the
protection of wildlife habitat shall not impair its capacity to provide important wildlife
habitat functions. Except for work that would adversely affect vernal pool habitat, a
project or projects on a single lot, for which Notice(s) of Intent is filed on or after
November 1, 1987, that (cumulatively) alter(s) up to 10% or 5,000 square feet
(whichever is less) of land in this resource area found to be significant to the protection
of wildlife habitat, shall not be deemed to impair its capacity to provide important
wildlife habitat functions. Additional alterations beyond the above threshold, or altering
vernal pool habitat, may be permitted if they will have no adverse effect on wildlife
habitat, as determined by procedures contained in 310 CMR l0.60
F Land Under Water
1 Proposed work that may alter land under water shall not adversely affect the following:
a Water storage or carrying capacity of the waterbody, or of the land under the
waterbody;
b Groundwater or surface water quality;
c The ability to provide important fisheries and wildlife habitat, food, shelter,
migratory, breeding, and overwintering areas.
G Riverfront Area
1 Riverfront area shall be defined as in Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 131, Section
40 and 310 CMR 10.00, as amended, except that all land within 200 feet of any stream
or river that is also deemed to be a manmade canal in Reading shall be defined and
protected as Riverfront Area. Proposed work in riverfront areas, including work within
200 feet of any perennial stream, river, or manmade canal, shall conform to the
performance standards of 310 CMR 10.58, as amended.
H Public and Private Water Supply
Town of Reading Wetlands Protection Regulations Conservation Commission
14 Wetlands Protection Regulations – August 2016
1 Projects proposed in areas significant to public or private water supply shall be required
to demonstrate that there will be no adverse impact on the water resources. Projects
proposed for the Aquifer Protection District shall comply with the provisions of the
Aquifer Protection Bylaw, Section 4.8 of the Reading Zoning Bylaws.
I Side Slope Grades Near Wetlands
1 Side slopes within 100 feet of a wetland shall have a finished grade according to the

1 The Town of Reading accepts and adopts the current (effective Jan 1, 2012)
requirements, definitions, performance standards, and regulatory restrictions for vernal
pools as specified pursuant to 310 CMR 10.00 and the Massachusetts Division of
Fisheries and Wildlife Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program criteria at 321
CMR 10.00. All Vernal Pools currently listed as certified by Natural Heritage and those
that meet the criteria as so defined are protected by the Reading local regulations.
K Wildlife Habitat
1 The Town of Reading accepts and adopts the current (effective Jan 1, 2012)
requirements, definitions, performance standards, and regulatory restrictions for wildlife
habitat as specified in the Massachusetts Wetland Regulations 310 CMR 10.00 for
jurisdictional wetlands under these Town of Reading Wetland Protection Regulations.
L Erosion Control
1 Disturbed soils areas near and within wetland resource areas shall be stabilized and
protected from the erosive forces of wind and water. Erosion and sedimentation control
devices shall be kept in functional condition until the soils are stabilized by vegetation
and until removal of the devices is authorized by the Commission or its administrator.
M Crossing of Wetlands
1 In addition to the provisions of Section C, proposed crossings of wetland areas shall
include the following: retaining walls, embankments, or other structures shall be
required, to minimize wetland alteration.
N Stormwater Runoff
1 There shall be no significant change in runoff characteristics to any resource area. Any
change in stormwater runoff characteristics, which may result in increased flooding off
the site or degradation of water quality, must be mitigated by on-site controls. Such
controls may include, but are not limited to, storm water detention facilities and
stormwater retention facilities which do not alter existing wetlands.
O Discharge of Runoff into Resource Areas
1 All discharges must be appropriately treated to mitigate for turbidity, sedimentation,
erosion, nutrients, water volume and rate, temperature, oil and grease, and other toxic
substances. There shall be no unmitigated point source discharges directly into any
resource areas or into their zones of natural vegetation (see Section D).

SECTION 4 DETERMINATION OF APPLICABILITY
A General
1 Any person who proposes to perform work within the Buffer Zone, or who desires a
ruling as to whether or not the Bylaw applies to an area, or work to be performed on an
area, shall submit to the Conservation Commission by certified mail or hand delivery a
Request for Determination of Applicability. Any meeting held under the Bylaw shall be
held simultaneously under the Wetlands Protection Act, M.G.L. Ch. 131, s.40, as it
applies.
B Filing Procedure
1 The applicant shall obtain a certified abutters list, available from the Reading Assessors
Office. The applicant shall submit stamped or properly metered (no date), legal-sized
envelopes addressed with the names of all abutters, the applicants, their
representatives, and all owners.
2 The applicant shall submit an original and eleven copies of the Request for
Determination and of all supporting materials.
3 The applicant shall provide proof of payment for the required legal notice(s) prior to the
public meeting.
C Public Meeting
1 The Commission shall hold a public meeting within twenty-one days of the submittal of a
complete Request for Determination or by a later date agreed upon by the applicant.
The Commission may continue the public meeting beyond the 21 days, with the consent
of the applicant.
D Determination of Applicability
1 The Commission shall close the public meeting and issue its Determination within
twenty-one days of the submittal of a complete Request for Determination, or by a later
date agreed upon by the applicant.
E Appeal of Determination of Applicability
1 Any person may appeal a Determination to Superior Court according to the provisions of
the Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 249, Section 4
F Work Pending Appeal
1 Upon the issuance of a Positive Determination, work may not proceed until a judicial
determination has been made by a court of competent legal jurisdiction that the
proposed work is not subject to the bylaw or until a Notice of Intent has been filed and
an Order of Conditions has been received by the applicant.
2 Upon the issuance of a Negative Determination, work may not proceed for the appeal
period except at the applicant’s risk.
G Minor Projects
1 Some projects are simple, routine, and involve very little activity or alteration within the
Buffer Zone, and no significant potential adverse impact on a resource area. For such
projects, it would be unreasonable to interpret this section to require a full
Determination of Applicability. To avoid unnecessary regulation and its allied costs to the
property owner, we establish a set of minor projects. These require the written approval
of the Conservation Administrator or other agent duly appointed by the Commission. If a
project is denied by the Administrator or other agent the decision may be appealed to
Town of Reading Wetlands Protection Regulations Conservation Commission
16 Wetlands Protection Regulations – August 2016
the Commission. Once approved unless contested, the project is merely reported to the
Commission. The following minor projects, subject to the following conditions, shall
require only the written approval of the Conservation Administrator or other agent duly
appointed by the Commission.
2 Conditions
a The limit of the resource area must be clearly evident to the Conservation
Administrator.
b A complete written description of all of the work and protective or mitigative
measures, and an accurate sketch or plan must be submitted to the Conservation
Administrator.
c All conditions prescribed by the Administrator must be met.
d The Administrator shall provide a copy of the proposal and any conditions to the
Commission at its next regular meeting.
e If the Administrator grants approval, the proponent may proceed with the project at
his/her own risk pending a review by the Commission; any person may file a formal
Request for Determination pursuant to the preceding Section 4.A., and the
Commission's Determination shall supersede the Administrator's decision.
3 Minor Projects checklist
Projects which have met Minor Project status are listed on the Minor Projects Checklist
available from the Conservation Office in Town Hall.
4 Minor Projects include:
a Installation of unpaved pedestrian walkways for private use;
b Installation of fencing or free-standing stone walls, provided that they will not
constitute a barrier to wildlife movement;
c Pruning of trees and shrubs located more than 50 feet from a wetland resource area,
and pruning of existing landscaped areas regardless of distance to wetlands;
d Planting of species of trees, shrubs, or groundcover native to Massachusetts, but
excluding planting of turf lawns where turf lawns do not presently exist;
e Conversion of existing lawns to uses accessory to existing single family houses,
provided that the activity is located more than 50 feet from wetland resource areas,
such as: open slotted decks without roofs; above-ground pools; freestanding (no
foundation) sheds under 15 feet by 15 feet; steps under 100 square feet; patios
under 100 square feet; porches under 100 square feet on existing foundations or on
concrete footings;. The conversion of such accessory uses to lawn is also allowed.
5 Conversion of impervious surfaces to vegetated areas in the Buffer Zone;
6 Activities that are temporary in nature, have negligible impacts, necessary for planning
and design purposes, and are located 35 feet from the resource area (e.g., installation of
monitoring wells, exploratory borings, sediment sampling, and surveying).
7 Buffer Zone projects that are not permitted by this procedure include but are not limited
to the following work (note: no work in a resource area can be permitted by this
procedure):
a New or increased foundations;
Town of Reading Wetlands Protection Regulations Conservation Commission
17 Wetlands Protection Regulations – August 2016
b Filling, grading, or machine excavation;
c Additions except as listed in subsection 2;
d Work within 100 feet of a known vernal pool;

SECTION 5 NOTICE OF INTENT
A General
1 It is recommended that all applicants confer with the Conservation Administrator prior to
filing.
2 Any person who proposes to do work that will remove, fill, dredge or alter any area
subject to protection under the Bylaw shall submit a Notice of Intent.
a The requirement of the Bylaw to obtain or apply for all permits, variances, and
approvals required by local bylaw with respect to the proposed activity shall include
only those which are obtainable at the time the Notice of Intent is filed.
b Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, when an applicant for a Comprehensive
Permit (under M.G.L. Chapter 40B, Sections 20-23, a.k.a. Chapter 774) from a Board
of Appeals has received a determination from that Board, whether to grant or deny
the permit, and in the case of a denial, has appealed to the Housing Appeals
Committee, said applicant shall be deemed to have obtained all local permits
obtainable at that time.
c The applicant shall either obtain all permits prior to filing a Notice of Intent, or may
file a Notice of Intent after the filing of application(s) for all such obtainable permits.
The Notice of Intent shall then include any information submitted in connection with
such other application(s) that is necessary to describe the effect of the proposed
activity on the environment.
3 If the Conservation Commission rejects a Notice of Intent because of a failure to obtain
or apply for all permits, variances, and approvals, it must specify in writing the permit,
variance, or approval that has not been obtained or applied for. A ruling by the
municipal body within whose jurisdiction the issuance of the permit, variance, or
approval lies or by the Town Counsel concerning the applicability of such permit,
variance, or approval shall be acceptable by the Commission.
4 Notwithstanding the foregoing, when the Commission has determined that an activity
outside the areas subject to protection under this bylaw and outside the Buffer Zone is
likely to alter an area subject to protection under this bylaw, the Commission may
require such plans, supporting calculations and other documentation as are necessary to
describe the entire activity.
B Abbreviated Notices
For certain purposes, other forms of Notices may be used.
1 The applicant shall have the option to file an Abbreviated Notice of Intent for proposed
work only when the following criteria are met:
a The proposed work is within the Buffer Zone, or within land subject to flooding;
b The proposed work will disturb less than one thousand square feet of surface area
within the Buffer Zone and/or land subject to flooding; and
c The proposed work will not require a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 10 or
Section 404 permit, or a license from the Department of Environmental Protection
Division of Waterways pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 91 (Waterways License).

Town of Reading Traffic Rules and Regulations Purpose Scope and Authority
Page | 3 Traffic Rules and Regulations – July 9, 2019
PURPOSE SCOPE AND AUTHORITY
As of August 20, 2013, the Town of Reading is home to over 100 miles of public roadway.
These roadways provide residents and visitors with safe and efficient paths of travel
throughout town. These roadways also provide an ample supply of parking.
In addition to regulated on-street parking, the town provides several public parking lots to
ensure that a proper supply of parking is available to the commercial and commuting needs
of the community. The town has put much thought into the design, placement and
regulation of such parking. The proper regulation and use of public parking, particularly in
the Downtown area of the community, is necessary in order to avoid congestion, reduce
traffic collisions, prevent the monopolizing of prime storefront parking (often by employees)
and provide convenience to customers and therefore enhance the business environment. To
address these issues the Board of Selectmen has adopted a set of rules governing the use
of public parking in town, which are part of these Traffic and Parking Regulations.
These Traffic and Parking Regulations also provides limited regulation regarding the
operation of motor vehicles.
The Town of Reading derives its authority to enact these regulations from several sources:
(1) Section 22 of Chapter 40 of the Massachusetts General Laws, (2) Section 2 of Chapter
85 of the Massachusetts General Laws, (3) Section 9 of Chapter 89 of the Massachusetts
General Laws, and (4) Article 8 of the General Bylaws of the Town of Reading. Such
regulations may be enacted by the Board of Selectmen and may apply to any ways upon
which the motoring public enjoys a right of access and where relevant signs and signals
appear. The Reading Police Department is responsible for the enforcement of the
regulations contained herein.

5.2 Reading Community Access Stickers - Residents Only
Notwithstanding the exceptions detailed in Article 5.2.1 below, between the hours of
6:00 AM and 10:30 AM, parking on designated streets and parking lots in and around
the Reading Train Depot will be authorized by permit only, excluding Saturdays,
Sundays and holidays. Areas to which this Article has been applied are listed under
Article 12.
Access to such regulated parking, to the Compost Center, and to overnight parking in
municipal parking lots designated by the Board of Selectmen for overnight parking will
be restricted to those vehicles that display a Reading Community Access sticker for the
current year.
Pursuant to Article 3.2 clear and appropriate signage will be posted in the parking areas
restricted by this Article.
Resident Permit stickers in the form of a Reading Community Access sticker will be
available to Reading residents only at a cost of $25.00. Seniors over the age of 65 will
receive a discount of $10.00.
Residents who have more than one vehicle registered to the same family at the same
address may secure a Reading Community Access sticker for each vehicle. The cost for
each vehicle shall be $25.00. There are two discounts that may apply. The first discount,
known as the Multi-Vehicle Discount, is given to those residents who simultaneously
apply for and purchase multiple stickers at the same time. The multi-vehicle discount
reduces the cost of subsequent stickers to $10.00. The second discount, known as the
Senior Discount, reduces the cost of the initial vehicle to $15.00 for those residents over
the age of sixty-five.
These stickers will be available at the Reading Police Station, 15 Union Street, at any
time, day or night. Reading Community Access stickers will be issued on an annual basis
beginning January 1. They will be available throughout the year but the cost will not be
prorated. To obtain a Reading Community Access sticker, Reading residents must show
identification to prove that they live in the Town, and that their vehicle is registered in
Town of Reading Traffic Rules and Regulations Stopping Standing and Parking
Page | 14 Traffic Rules and Regulations – July 9, 2019
the Town of Reading. Identification must include a Massachusetts Driver's License and a
Massachusetts Vehicle Registration both showing the same owner’s name at the same
Reading address. Reading Community Access stickers will be issued only to the vehicle
owner. For leased vehicles, proof from the leasing agency that the resident requesting
the sticker has control of the vehicle and that it is garaged at the resident’s principle
residence will be required.
Residents whose street frontage has a posted “Resident Parking” restriction are eligible
to apply for a Reading Community Access permit at no charge. The Town will issue said
stickers to abutting residents on the same basis as noted above. This subset of residents
shall be issued a number of Reading Community Access stickers equal to the number of
vehicles registered at the address. The Reading Community Access stickers issued to
said subset of residents will be modified such that the stickers are easily identified, and
will not allow access to the Compost Center or to commuter parking in the designated
lots, or to other sites for which the regular Reading Community Access sticker is
required.
All such parking will be available on a first come, first serve basis, which is to say that
the purchase of Reading Community Access stickers by residents does not guarantee a
parking space. All permit stickers must be placed on the left side, rear window of the
vehicle, as far towards the rear as possible. Only current stickers may be displayed—
previous year’s stickers must be removed. Permit stickers are not transferable to any
other vehicle. If a vehicle is sold, the sticker must be removed, and the old sticker may
be submitted to the Reading Police Department. A new sticker will then be issued at no
additional cost for the period that the old sticker applies.
No person shall sell, offer for sale, give, trade or otherwise transfer a Reading
Community Access sticker to another person, or affix the sticker to a motor vehicle other
than for the one issued or alter the sticker. Violation of this section will result in
revocation of the sticker and parking privileges, and may be prosecuted according to
law.
Parking in all regulated areas, where not parallel to the street, will be front-in parking
only to enable the Town to properly enforce these requirements. Parking in designated
areas without a sticker shall subject the vehicle owner to a parking fine in accordance
with Town regulations and denial of access to the Compost Center.
Handicapped Parking will be permitted in designated spaces with a State Handicapped
Parking Permit, and no Reading Community Access sticker or Employee Parking sticker
will be required.
All other posted Rules and Regulations of the Town, in addition to the permit parking
regulations, must be followed.
5.2.1 Employee Parking Stickers - Downtown Business District
Pursuant to Article 5.4.1.1 most parking in the Downtown Business District is limited
to one-hundred twenty minutes from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM on Mondays, Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.
However, specific parking areas within the Downtown Business District may be
designated as Employee Parking and will allow, by official permit only, employees of
downtown businesses to park within said areas without being subject to the time
restriction detailed in Article 5.2. Employee parking will be limited to designated
Town of Reading Traffic Rules and Regulations Stopping Standing and Parking
Page | 15 Traffic Rules and Regulations – July 9, 2019
areas, which will be identified by official signage. Areas to which this Article has been
applied as listed under Article 12.
Employee parking stickers shall be available for a fee of twenty dollars per month,
sold annually. The Chief of Police shall have the authority to establish such rules and
regulations as are appropriate to ensure that such stickers are being used by
employees of the businesses located in the Downtown Business District. Permits will
be for parking during working hours only.
For residents whose street frontage has a restriction for Employee Parking, the Town
will issue upon application to the resident on the same basis as noted above,
Employee Parking stickers equal to the number of vehicles registered at the address.
There will be no charge for the Employee Parking sticker in this situation.
All such parking will be available on a first come, first served basis, which is to say
that purchase of Employee Parking stickers by employees does not guarantee a
parking space.
Employee parking stickers may be sold in the amount of twenty percent more than
the total of designated spaces in order to achieve full utilization of the Employee
Parking areas.
Employee parking stickers are available as units to be displayed by hanging from the
interior rear-view mirror. Permit stickers are not transferable to any other vehicle.
No person shall sell, offer for sale, give, trade or otherwise transfer an Employee
Parking sticker to another person. Violation of this section will result in revocation of
the sticker and parking privileges, and may be prosecuted according to law.
Parking in all regulated areas, where not parallel to the street, will be front-in
parking only to enable the Town to properly enforce these requirements. Parking in
designated areas without a sticker shall subject the vehicle owner to a parking fine in
accordance with Town regulations and denial of access to the Compost Center.
Handicapped Parking will be permitted in designated spaces with a State
Handicapped Parking Permit, and no Employee Parking sticker will be required.
All other posted Rules and Regulations of the Town, in addition to the permit parking
regulations, must be followed.

FOREWORD
The Town of Reading Home Rule charter adopted on March 24, 1986 and amended
November 13, 2004 provides that:
"The Board of Cemetery Trustees shall be responsible for the preservation, care,
improvement and embellishment of the Town's cemeteries and burial lots therein and
such other powers and duties given to the Board of Cemetery Trustees under the
Constitution and General Laws of the Commonwealth, by the Charter, by bylaw or by
Town Meeting vote."
Working under this charge, the Board of Cemetery Trustees strives not only to fulfill its
legal responsibilities regarding the Town's cemeteries, but also to preserve the aesthetic
quality of our heritage. The Trustees encourage public comment at regularly scheduled
meetings or via correspondence.
TOWN OF READING - CEMETERY REGULATIONS
The Board of Cemetery Trustees has set forth the following regulations for the
ownership, care and use of burial sites in the Town's cemeteries. The authority to do this
is found in Chapter 114 of Massachusetts General Laws.
Town of Reading Cemetery Regulations Department of Public Works
Cemetery Division
4 Cemetery Regulations – 2018
RESIDENT REQUIREMENTS
1 The sale of lots is limited to current Reading residents only.
OWNERSHIP OF LOTS
2 The Trustees shall set the price of lots which includes perpetual care. All lots must be
paid in full at the time of the sale.
3 The owner of a lot(s) is limited to burying human remains in that site. In each regular
grave space, one full size interment and one cremation urn, or two cremation urns will
be allowed. Two cremation urns may be interred in each urn lot.
4 When a lot is purchased, the owner will be issued a deed specifying the location and
dimensions of the lot. The deed will contain certain terms and conditions for the use of
this lot. The Trustees are responsible for corner posts set at each lot. These will clearly
define the number of the lot.
5 The owner of a lot may only transfer ownership of that lot by deed if such transfer is
approved by the Trustees. A fee will be charged for the recording of deed transfer. The
owner does not have a right to lease or sell the property.
6 Lots may be resold only to the Town of Reading, at the original purchase price.
7 Upon the death of the lot owner, the right of burial shall pass as provided by the
statutes of Massachusetts in force at that time. The Trustees will require proof of the
rights of ownership of such lot.
CARE OF LOTS
8 "Perpetual Care" means the cutting of grass on the grave or lot at reasonable intervals,
raking, clean-up, reseeding and other work as may be necessary to keep the lot(s) in
good condition. Perpetual care does not include the repairing or replacing of memorials.
USE OF LOTS
9 In order to preserve the aesthetic quality of Reading’s cemeteries, and to ensure the
safety of the public and cemetery staff, the following rules shall apply:
? The owner of a lot(s) does not have the right to plant trees, shrubs or plants, or to
erect a fence, curbing, hedge or any other landmark on the lot(s).
? The Trustees have the right to remove any shrub, hedge, root or branch that they
may deem detrimental to other cemetery lots.
? Tributes shall be limited to fresh flowers in shatter-resistant vases, potted plants, or
floral baskets not to exceed the width of the lot, the height of the headstone and no
more than one foot (12 inches) forward of the headstone. No other decorations or
objects will be allowed, and will be removed.
? The Trustees have the right to remove any unsightly flowers, old vases, other
containers, or any other decorations/objects that do not conform to the above, or
that create a safety concern for the public and cemetery staff.
? No vigil lights, solar lights, wooden crosses, or shepherd hooks will be allowed on
any lot or grave.
Town of Reading Cemetery Regulations Department of Public Works
Cemetery Division
5 Cemetery Regulations – 2018
? Tributes on single graves, veterans sections and urn lots are limited to one shatterresistant
container with a maximum diameter of 8 inches or one floral basket per

MEMORIAL REGULATIONS
10 A memorial may be installed on a lot. The Trustees must approve the design and
specifications for any memorial. Markers shall be of granite or bronze; upright
memorials shall be of granite. No other materials shall be allowed.
11 Where permitted only one upright memorial of granite may be placed on a lot subject to
limitations as outlined in other sections of these regulations. One marker may be set on
an individual grave. Markers may not be set to embrace two or more graves. All markers
shall be set flush with the ground. The foundations for all memorials will be installed by
the Cemetery Department and a fee will be charged.
12 In Laurel Hill, a memorial will not be installed unless the lot is endowed with perpetual
care. On old lots matching markers may be used if existing markers exceed regulation
size. If upright headstones become broken or excessively tipped, the Trustees reserve
the right to lay these into the ground as markers.
13 Neither the Trustees nor the Town shall be liable for damage to memorials or markers at
any cemetery.
14 Any company or individual who is to set a grave box or work on or erect a memorial
must obtain written permission from the Cemetery Supervisor before beginning work,
and the work must be performed under the supervision of the Supervisor. The work area
must be left in proper condition. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in
the company or individual being barred from future work.

provided, however, that any Associate Member so designated shall be entitled to continue to
participate in the matter as necessary and to remain qualified to vote thereon.
The Reading Historical Commission without limitation has the following powers, functions

Town of Reading Rules and Regulations Historical Commission
2 Rules and Regulations – August 9, 2017
Section 3 Historic Demolition Delay Bylaw, General Bylaw Section 7.2 et seq
The following rules guide the Reading Historical Commission in applying the Historic
Demolition Delay Bylaw (Bylaw); the full provisions of the Demolition Delay Bylaw govern in
all cases. The following rules are only applicable to those structures included on Reading’s
List of Historic Structures identified in the Bylaw:
a Structures Included
General Bylaw, Section 7.2.3 requires the Reading Historical Commission to provide to
the Building Inspector the List of Historic Structures for administering the Demolition
Delay Bylaw, which List is to be updated by Reading Historical Commission from time to
time; and further requires that List to contain all structures included on the Town’s
Historical and Architectural Inventory, past, present and future. In furtherance of this
directive, Reading Historical Commission considers every outbuilding and secondary
structure specifically identified or referenced anywhere on an Inventory Form B filed as a
part of the Town’s Historical and Architectural Inventory, to be within the purview of the
Bylaw’s requirement for inclusion and protection.
b Procedures For Demolition Delay Public Hearings
The Reading Historical Commission will use the set of procedures for Demolition Delay
Public Hearings it adopted on January 28, 2014.
c Scope Of Reading Historical Commission’s Consideration
Reading Historical Commission’s consideration under the Historic Demolition Delay Bylaw
applies to all exterior and interior features of a structure.
d Duration Of Demolition Delay Hearing Decision And Early Release
The results of a Demolition Delay Hearing are in effect for the duration of the delay
period. If the Reading Historical Commission issues an early release of the delay period,
that delay period is considered terminated as of the date of the Commission’s decision
letter or where applicable, upon completion of any conditions for release as required and
contained in the decision letter.
e Early Release, Conditions and Agreement To Mitigate Effects Of Demolition
Reading Historical Commission may consider an early release from an approved
demolition delay period, per General Bylaw Section 7.2.6.3. In doing so, an applicant
may agree to accept a demolition permit on specified conditions acceptable to the
Reading Historical Commission. Such conditions may include an applicant’s submission
of its plans for the use and improvement of the property after demolition to the Reading
Historical Commission for its review and approval, or in the alternative, agreement to
mitigate the effects of demolition in some other way. Such mitigation measures may
include without limitation, photographing or documenting the building and its significant
features; or preserving on site or elsewhere, some of these architectural features; or
benefitting monetarily or otherwise some other Town historic resource or historic
objective within the purview of the Reading Historical Commission. If the Reading
Historical Commission, which may recommend changes, finds the conditions acceptable,
and the Reading Historical Commission and the applicant are able to agree in writing
upon whatever stipulations may be necessary to ensure that the conditions will be
carried out as planned, the Reading Historical Commission shall advise the Building
Inspector in writing of that agreement. At any time after receiving such written notice
and authorization, the Building Inspector may issue a Demolition Permit, subject to such
stipulations and pre-conditions, if any, as the Reading Historical Commission and the
applicant may have agreed upon as mitigation for demolition.
Town of Reading Rules and Regulations Historical Commission
3 Rules and Regulations – August 9, 2017
f Demolition Permit Expiration Before Building Is Demolished
If a Demolition Permit is issued by the Building Inspector, and if the Permit subsequently
expires (see definitions below) but the building is not demolished before the expiration,
the property owner first must repeat the Demolition Delay process before proceeding
further.
g Effect Of Non-Issuance Of Demolition Permit Following Hearing
If a Demolition Permit is not issued by the Building Inspector within two years after the
close of a Demolition Delay Hearing, the property owner first must repeat the Demolition
Delay process before proceeding further.
Section 4 General Information
The following relevant information, unrelated to the Historic Demolition Delay process, is
provided here only as general reference information.
The following definitions are applicable, in general, to structures in the Town of Reading:
a Demolition Permit
A type of Building Permit issued for an initial period of six months.
b Demolition Permit Expiration
A Demolition Permit will expire if demolition is not started within the first six months. If
demolition is started but not completed in the first six months, the Building Inspector
may grant the property owner an additional six months to complete the demolition. After
one year from issuance of the Permit, the Building Inspector can extend the permit for
up to two more six-month periods. A Demolition Permit cannot be extended beyond a
period of two years.
c Demolition Delay Non-Transferability
An Reading Historical Commission Demolition Delay Hearing Decision runs and applies
only to the individual owner who originally applied for the demolition permit that was the
subject of that Demolition Delay Hearing. Any resulting demolition delay decision or
period is not transferable, and any subsequent owner intending to demolish a structure
must first repeat the Demolition Delay process before proceeding further.
The following definitions are applicable only to those structures included on Reading’s List
of Historic Structures or within a Local Historic District:
a “Demolition by Neglect”
If the Reading Historical Commission is made aware of historic properties in physical
decline that would lead to probable demolition by neglect, then the RHC may notify the
Building Inspector and encourage stabilization of the structure. Regarding a vacant
historic property in such physical decline, the Reading Historical Commission may
alternatively request action under Town of Reading, General Bylaws, Section 8.10,
Maintenance of Vacant Buildings and Land.
b Local Historic Districts
Reading’s Local Historic District Bylaw, General Bylaw, Section 7.3 et seq., governs
designated local historic districts and supercedes Reading Historical Commission
jurisdiction. Structures located within a Local Historic District (LHD) are subject only to
that Local Historic District Bylaw, and such structures are not covered by Reading’s
Historic Demolition Delay Bylaw.

DANGER – ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION
Follow Instructions
? Avoid too frequent or lengthy exposure. As with natural sunlight, exposure to a
tanning lamp may cause eye and skin injury and/or an allergic reaction. Repeated
exposure may cause chronic damage characterized by wrinkles, dryness, fragility,
bruising of skin and skin cancer.
? Wear protective eyewear. FAILURE TO USE PROTECTIVE EYEWEAR MAY RESULT
IN SEVERE BURNS OR LONG TURN INJURY TO THE EYES
? Ultraviolet radiation from tanning lamp aggravates the effects of the sun. Do not
sunbathe before or after exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
? Abnormal or increased skin sensitivity or burning may be caused by certain food,
cosmetics or medications, including but not limited to tranquilizers, diuretics, high
blood pressure medications, birth control pills and skin creams. Consult a physician
before using a sunlamp or tanning device if you are using medication, have a history
of skin problems or believe you are especially sensitive to sunlight. Pregnant women
or women on birth control medication who use a tanning device may develop
discolored skin.
? IF YOU DO NOT TAN IN THE SUN YOU WILL NOT TAN FROM THE USE OF THIS
DEVICE. Use of a tanning device does not provide a substantial protective base
against the effects of the sun.

cessation of pumping, and reference point used for all measurements.
In order to demonstrate that the well capacity can provide the required volume of water,
a pumping test shall be conducted in the following manner:
1 The volume of water necessary to support the household's daily need shall be
determined using the following equation: (number of bedrooms plus one bedroom) x
(110 gallons per bedroom) x (safety factor of 2) = number of gallons needed daily.
2 The storage capacity of the well shall be determined using the measured static water
level and the depth and radius of the drillhole or casing.
3 The required volume shall be calculated by adding the volumes of water in (1) and
(2) above. It is this volume of water that must be pumped from the well within a
twenty-four (24) hour period.
The pumping test may be performed at whatever rate is desired. Following the pumping
test, the water level in the well must be shown to recover to within eighty-five (85)
percent of the prepumped static water level within a twenty-four (24) hour period.
Example 1: a one bedroom house with a well six (6) inches in diameter containing 200 ft.
of standing water:
1 bedroom + 1 bedroom = (2 bedrooms) x (110 gallons per bedroom) x (safety factor
of 2) = 440 gallons needed daily.
2 the volume of a 6-inch well is 1.5 gallons for every foot of water column length.
Therefore, (200 ft. of standing water) x (1. 5 gal/ft.) = 300 gallons.
3 440 gallons + 300 gallons = 740 gallons that must be pumped from the well in 24
hours or less to demonstrate suitable capacity. Recovery to at least 85% of the static
water level must also occur within 24 hours after cessation of pumping.
Example 2: For a 4 bedroom house with a well that is six (6) inches in diameter containing
100 ft. of standing water:
1 4 bedroom house + 1 bedroom = (5 bedrooms) x (110 gallons per bedroom) x
(safety factor of 2) = 1,100 gallons needed daily.
2 the volume of a 6-inch well is 1.5 gallons for every foot of water volume length.
Therefore, (100 ft. of standing water) x (1. 5 gal/ft.) = 150 gallons.
3 1,100 gallons + 150 gallons=1250 gallons that must be pumped from the well in 24
hours or less to demonstrate suitable capacity. Recovery to at least 85% of the static
water level must also occur within 24 hours after cessation of pumping.
VIII Water Quality Testing
After the construction of the well has been completed and disinfected, and prior to using
it as a private drinking water well, baseline water quality testing shall be conducted.
A water sample shall be collected either after purging three (3) well volumes or following
the stabilization of the pH, temperature and specific conductance in the pumped well.
The water sample to be tested shall be collected at the pump discharge or from a
disinfected tap in the pump discharge line. In no event shall a water treatment device be
installed prior to sampling.
Water quality tests utilizing the applicable US EPA approved method for drinking water
testing, shall be conducted by a Massachusetts certified laboratory and shall include
analysis for the following parameters:
Arsenic
Chloride
Town of Reading Community Services
Health
Copper
Fluoride
Hardness
Iron
Lead
Manganese
pH
Sodium
Total Coliform bacteria
E. coli bacteria
Nitrate/Nitrite
In wells drilled into bedrock the Board of Health requires that in addition to the
parameters listed above, a Gross Alpha Screen and Radon test be performed. If the
Gross Alpha screen detects radiation of 15 pci/l or more, then the water must be
analyzed for Radium and Uranium concentrations.
The owner of every well used for drinking water including those serving a property which
is rented or leased shall have its water tested at a Massachusetts certified laboratory for
the following chemical and bacteriological parameters at a minimum of once a year:
total coliform bacteria, e. coli bacteria, nitrate, nitrite, pH, conductivity, sodium, and
iron. All other required chemical parameters should be tested at a minimum of every ten
(10) years. The Board of Health may require more frequent testing, or testing for
additional parameters, where other water quality problems are known or suspected to
exist.
The owner of a rental property shall provide results of all water quality tests to all
tenants of the property and the Board of Health. In cases where the well water does not
meet the water quality standards outlined above, the Board of Health may require the
property owner to provide an alternative approved source of drinking water for the
tenants.
Prior to selling, conveying, or transferring title to real property, the owner shall have
tested the water of every private drinking water well serving that property. A water
sample from each well shall be submitted to a Massachusetts certified laboratory for
testing for the parameters listed in the Water Quality section of this document. This
water quality testing shall have been performed not more than one (1) year prior to
transfer of the property. Results of the water quality testing shall be submitted to the
Board of Health prior to property transfer.
In addition, the owner shall give copies of all available water quality test results of which
he/she has knowledge (regardless of age of results) for the private well in question to
any buyer and/or broker involved in the transfer. In the event that there is no buyer at
the time the water is tested, a copy of all water test results must be given by the owner
to the buyer before the property is put under agreement.
For irrigation wells, the Board requires annual testing for E. coli bacteria and
Nitrate/Nitrite, as accidental consumption could result in acute exposure.
The Board reserves the right to require retesting of the above parameters, or testing for
additional parameters when, in the opinion of the Board, it is necessary due to local
conditions or for the protection of public health, safety, welfare and the environment. All
costs and laboratory arrangements for the water testing are the responsibility of the
applicant.
Following a receipt of the water quality test results, the well owner shall submit a Water
Quality Report to the Board, which includes:
1 a copy of the certified laboratory's test results
2 the name and contact information of the individual who performed the sampling
Town of Reading Community Services
Health
3 where in the system the water sample was obtained
This regulation requires that private drinking water wells meet all current Massachusetts’
Primary and Secondary Drinking Water Standards and Guidelines adopted by the
MassDEP Office of Research and Standards (ORS). In any case where a private drinking
water well does not meet such Standards or Guidelines, as it deems necessary for the
protection of public health, safety or welfare, that the Board may take action, but not
limited to, requiring the property owner to provide an alternative source of drinking
water.
IX Well Construction
Pursuant to 310 CMR 46.02 (1), no person in the business of digging or drilling shall
construct a well unless certified by the MassDEP Well Drillers Program.
Any work involving the connection of the private well to the distribution system of the
residence must conform to the local plumbing code. All electrical connections between
the well and the pump controls and all piping between the well and the storage and/or
pressure tank in the house must be made by a pump installer or certified well driller,
including the installation of the pump and appurtenance(s) in the well or house.
A physical connection is not permitted between a water supply, which satisfies the
requirements of these regulations, and another water supply that does not meet the
requirements of these regulations without prior approval of the Board.
a General Well Design and Construction
All private wells shall be designed and constructed such that:
1 the materials used for the permanent construction are durable in the specific
hydrogeologic environment that occurs at the well site
2 no unsealed opening is be left around the well that could conduct surface water
or contaminated groundwater vertically to the intake portion of the well or
transfer water from one formation to another.
Permanent construction materials shall not leach or contribute toxic substances,
taste, odors, or bacterial contamination to the water in the well.
The driller shall operate all equipment according to generally accepted standards in
the industry and shall take appropriate precautions to prevent damage, injury or
other loss to persons and property at the drilling site.
Well construction design shall ensure that surface water does not enter the well
through the opening or by seepage through the ground surface. Construction site
waste and materials shall be disposed of in such a way as to avoid contamination of
the well, any surface water or the aquifer. During any time that the well is
unattended, the contractor shall secure the well in a way as to prevent either
tampering with the well and/or the introduction of foreign material into the well.
All water used for drilling, well development, or to mix a drilling fluid shall be
obtained from a source, which will not result in contamination of the well or the
water bearing zones penetrated by the well. Water from wetlands, swamps, ponds
and other similar surface features shall not be used.
Water shall be conveyed in clear sanitary containers or water lines and shall be
chlorinated to an initial concentration between 50 mg/l and 100 mg/1.All drilling
equipment including pumps and down hole tools, shall be cleaned and disinfected
prior to drilling each new well or test hole.
All drilling fluids shall be nontoxic. Drilling fluid additives shall be stored in clean
containers and shall be free of material that may adversely affect the well, the
aquifer, or the quality of the water to be pumped from the well. Surfactants shall be
Town of Reading Community Services
Health
biodegradable. The use of biodegradable organic polymers shall, when possible, be
avoided.
All wells, including those that have been hydrofractured, shall be developed in order
to remove fine materials introduced into the pore spaces or fractures during
construction. One or more of the following methods shall be used for development:
overpumping, backwashing, surging, jetting, air-lift pumping.
The completed well shall be sufficiently straight so that there will be no interference
with installation, alignment, operation or future removal of the permanent well
pump.
b Well Casing
Private water supply wells shall be constructed using either steel or thermoplastic
well casing. The casing shall be of adequate strength and durability to withstand
anticipated formation and hydrostatic pressures, the forces imposed on it during
installation, and the corrosive effects of the local hydrogeologic environment.
All casing used in the construction of private wells shall be free of pits, breaks,
gouges, deep scratches and other defects. If previously used casing is installed, it
shall be decontaminated and disinfected prior to installation.
Installation of water well casing shall be done in a manner that does not alter the
shape, size, or strength of the casing and does not damage any of the joints or
couplings connecting sections of the casing. A standard driveshoe shall be used when
casing is installed. The drive shoe shall be either welded or threaded to the lower
end of the string of casing and shall have a beveled metal cutting edge forged, cast,
or fabricated for this specific purpose.
Upon completion of the installation procedure, the entire length of the casing above
the intake shall be watertight.
Well casing shall not be cut off below the land surface unless a pitless adapter or a
pitless unit is installed or an abandoned well is being permanently plugged. Well
casing terminating above-grade shall extend at least twelve (12) inches above the
predetermined ground surface at the wellhead except when the well is located in a
floodplain. When a well is located in a floodplain, the well casing shall extend at least
two (2) feet above the level of the highest recorded flood. The top of the well casing
shall be reasonably smooth and level.
c Well screen
A well screen is required for all drilled wells that are completed in unconsolidated
formations. All well screens shall be of Grade 304 stainless steel. Wells completed in
bedrock do not require a screen unless the bedrock formation is brittle in nature or
has a potential for collapse. The well screen aperture openings, screen length, and
diameter shall be selected so as not to limit the aquifer’s water yielding
characteristics while preventing access of soil particles that would detract from well
efficiency and yield.
d Grouting and Sealing
Private wells drilled in bedrock shall be grouted from the ground surface or to the
bottom of the pitless adaptor (if present) to fifteen (15) feet into competent bedrock.
Neat cement grout, sand cement grout, or Bentonite grout shall be used. It shall
have a permeability of at least 1 x 10-7 and be emplaced using standard grouting
techniques as described in the MassDEP Private Well Guidelines, as amended.
All wells completed with the casing extending above grade shall have a surface seal
designed to eliminate the possibility of surface water flowing down the annular space
between the well casing and the surrounding backfilled materials. The surface seal
shall extend to a depth below the local frost line.
Town of Reading Community Services
Health
e Wellhead Completion
All wells shall be equipped with a sanitary seal or watertight cap designed to prevent
surface water and foreign matter from entering the well.
All wells except flowing artesian and dug wells shall be vented. The opening of the
vent pipe shall be covered with a 24 mesh corrosion resistant screen and shall be
large enough to prevent water from being drawn into the well through electrical
conduits or leaks in the seal around the pump when the pump is turned on. The vent
pipe shall terminate in a downward position at or above the top of the casing.
All connections to a well casing made below ground shall be protected by either a
pitless adapter or a pitless unit that complies with the most recent revision of
National Sanitation Foundation Standard Number 56, entitled "Pitless Well Adapters."
Above-grade connections into the top or side of a well casing shall be at least twelve
(12) inches above the established ground surface or two (2) feet above the level of
the highest known flood, whichever is higher. Above-grade connections shall be
sealed so that they are watertight.
The ground immediately surrounding the well casing shall be sloped downward and
away from the well in all directions to eliminate the possibility of surface water
ponding.
f Disinfection
Upon completion of well construction, the well driller shall disinfect the well. If a
pump is to be installed immediately upon completion of the well, the pump installer
shall disinfect the well and the pumping equipment after the pump has been
installed.
If the pump is not installed upon completion of the well, the pump installer shall,
upon installation, disinfect the well and the pumping equipment. The pump installer
shall also disinfect the entire water supply system immediately after any
maintenance or repair work is done on the pump.
When a well is disinfected, the initial chlorine concentration shall be 100 mg/l
throughout the entire water column.
For newly constructed or altered wells in which the pump is not immediately
installed, the chlorine concentration used to disinfect the well shall be 100 mg/l.
Upon installation of the pump, the well, the pumping equipment, and the distribution
system, if connected, shall be disinfected with a chlorine concentration of 100 mg/l.
The disinfectant solution shall remain undisturbed in the well for a minimum of two
(2) hours. After all the chlorine has been flushed from the water supply system, a
water sample shall be collected and submitted to a Massachusetts certified
laboratory. For new wells, the sample shall be tested pursuant to Section VI of these
regulations.
Only certified well drillers are authorized to physically alter, or repair a well. For
wells, that have undergone repair, a sample shall be tested for total coliform bacteria
and any other parameters deemed appropriate by the Board, prior to being put back
in use.
X Decommissioning
Abandoned wells, test holes, and borings shall be decommissioned so as to prevent the
well, including the annular space outside the casing, from being a channel allowing the
vertical movement of water.
The owner of a private well shall decommission the well if any of the following criteria
are met:
Town of Reading Community Services
Health
1 construction of the well is terminated prior to completion of the well
2 the well owner notifies the Board that the use of the well is to be permanently
discontinued.
3 the well has been out of service for at least three (3) years
4 the well is a potential hazard to public health or safety and the situation cannot be
corrected
5 the well is in such a state of disrepair that its continued use is impractical or unsafe
6 the well has the potential for transmitting contaminants from the land surface into an
aquifer or from one aquifer to another and the situation cannot be corrected
The property owner shall ensure that that all abandoned wells and test holes or borings
associated with the well installation are properly plugged before work at the site is
completed. Only certified well drillers may plug abandoned wells, test holes, and
borings.
Abandoned overburden wells or borings shall be completely filled with a low permeability
grout, which cures with a final permeability of less than 1x10-7 cm/sec. Wells shall be
plugged with neat cement grout, sand cement grout, concrete, or bentonite grout.
Regardless of the type used, the grout used for plugging shall:
1 be sufficiently fluid so that it can be applied through a tremie pipe from the bottom
of the well upward
2 remain as a homogeneous fluid when applied to the subsurface rather than
disaggregating by gravity into a two phase substance
3 be resistant to chemical or physical deterioration
4 not leach chemicals, either organic or inorganic, that will affect the quality of the
groundwater where it is applied
The plugging materials shall be introduced at the bottom of the well or boring and
placed progressively upward to a level approximately four (4) feet below the ground
surface. Sealing materials shall not be poured from the land surface into the well,
borehole, or annular space being sealed.
The well driller shall install a surface seal after the well or boring has been plugged.
Before the surface seal is placed, casing remaining in the hole shall be cut off. The
remaining four (4) feet at the top of the well or boring shall then be filled with concrete.
The top of the seal shall comprise a concrete slab above the top of the plugged well or
boring. This concrete slab shall be at least six (6) inches thick and shall be at least two
(2) feet greater in diameter than the well casing or borehole wall.
XI Enforcement
The Board has authority to investigate suspected or known violations of these
regulations and/or violations of any Water Supply Certificate conditions. The Board may
take actions, as it deems appropriate, within its authority for the protection of public
health, safety welfare, or the environment, and to enforce any of the provisions of this
regulation.

SECTION 15 PUBLIC NUISANCES
The Board of Health shall order the owner or occupant of any private premises, at his own
expense, to remove any nuisance, source of filth or cause of sickness found thereon within
twenty-four hours, or within such other time as it considers reasonable after notice and an
owner or occupant shall forfeit twenty-five dollars ($25) for every day during which he
knowingly violates such an order.
Posting Board of Health Order
Such order shall be in writing, and be served personally on the owner, occupant or his
authorized agent by any person authorized to serve civil process; or a copy of the order
may be left at the last and usual place abode of the owner, occupant or agent, if he is
known and within or without the commonwealth; or a copy of the order may be sent to
the owner, occupant or agent by registered mail, return receipt requested, if he is known
and within the commonwealth. If the order is directed against the owner and if the
residence and whereabouts of the owner of his agent are unknown or without the
commonwealth, the Board may direct the order to be served by posting a copy
thereof in a conspicuous place on the premises and by advertising it for at least
three out of five consecutive days in one or more newspapers of general
circulation within the municipality wherein the building is situated.
Compliance to BOH Order
If the owner or occupant fails to comply with such order, the board may cause the
nuisance, source of filth or cause of sickness to be removed, and all expenses incurred
thereby shall constitute a debt due the Town upon the completion of the removal and the
rendering of an account therefore to the owner, his authorized agent, or the occupant,
and shall be recoverable from such owner or occupant in an action of contract.
Payment of Action by Board of Health
A debt due the Town shall constitute a lien on the land upon which the structure is located
if a statement of claim, signed by the Board of Health and setting forth the amount
claimed without interest, is filed with the Registry of Deeds within ninety days after the
debt becomes due. Such lien shall take effect upon the filing of the statement and shall
continue for two years from the first day of October next following the date of such filing.
Within a reasonable time after filing the statement of claim with the Registry of Deeds
(and certainly before the expiration of the two year period during which the lien is in
effect), the Board of Health shall certify to the assessors the claims upon the land. The
assessors shall turn in; commit such claims with their warrant to the collector of taxes,
who shall have the same powers and duties with respect to such claim as in the case of
the annual taxes upon real estate. The provisions of law relative to the collection an
annual tax, the sale or taking of land for the nonpayment thereof, and the redemption of
land sold or taken shall apply to such claim.
The provisions of the above paragraph relative to lien for such debt and the collection of
the claims for such debt shall apply to any debt referred to in this section; expect that the
Board of Health shall act hereunder in place of the Board of Selectmen.

SECTION 16 PROHIBITING SMOKING and TOBACCO and
NICOTINE PRODUCTS USE in WORKPLACES and
PUBLIC PLACES
16.1 PURPOSE
Whereas conclusive evidence exists that tobacco smoke causes cancer, respiratory and
cardiac diseases, negative birth outcomes, irritations to the eyes, nose, and throat; and
Whereas the harmful effects of tobacco smoke are not confined to smokers but also
cause severe discomfort and illness to nonsmokers; and
Whereas the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classified secondhand smoke as a
known human carcinogen and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
of the World Health Organization also classified secondhand smoke as a known human
carcinogen (IARC-WHO, 2002); and
Whereas public health authorities, including the Surgeon General and the National
Cancer Institute, have found that smokeless tobacco use is hazardous to health and can
lead to nicotine addiction; and
Whereas the National Cancer Institute states that chewing tobacco and snuff contain 28
cancer-causing agents and the U S National Toxicology Program has established
smokeless tobacco as a “known human carcinogen;” and
Whereas, the National Cancer Institute and the International Agency for Research on
Cancer report that the use of smokeless tobacco causes oral, pancreatic, and esophageal
cancer; and
now, therefore, the Board of Health recognizes the right of those who wish to breathe
smoke free air and the adverse health effects of using smokeless tobacco and nicotine
containing products establishes this regulation to protect and improve the public health
and welfare.
16.2 AUTHORITY
This regulation is promulgated under the authority granted to the Reading Board of
Health pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 111 Section 31 that “[b]oards
of health may make reasonable health regulations." It is also promulgated pursuant to
Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 270 Section 22(j) which states in part that
“[n]othing in this section shall permit smoking in an area in which smoking is or may
hereafter be prohibited by law including, without limitation: any other law or health

SECTION 17 APPLICATION REVIEW FEES SPECIAL ACCOUNT
In accordance with Chapter 593 and Chapter 111 Section 31 of the MGL the Reading
Board of Health adopts these regulations to protect the health and safety of the
community.
17.1 When reviewing an application, the Board of Health may determine that the assistance
of outside consultants is warranted due to the size, scale or complexity of a proposed
project, because of a project’s potential impacts or because of the expertise required.
The Board of Health may require that applicants pay a “review fee” consisting of the
reasonable costs incurred by the Board of Health for the employment of outside
consultants engaged by the Board of Health to assist in the review of an application.
17.2 In hiring outside consultants, the Board of Health may engage engineers, planners,
lawyers, urban designers or other appropriate professionals who can assist the Board of
Health in analyzing a project to ensure compliance with all relevant laws,
ordinances/bylaws and regulations.
17.3 Funds received by the Board of Health pursuant to this section shall be deposited with
the municipal treasurer who shall establish a special account for this purpose.
Expenditures from the special account may be made at the direction of the Board of
Health without further appropriation. Expenditures from this special account shall be
made only in connection with the review of a special project or projects for which a
review fee has been or will be collected from the applicant. Failure of an applicant to pay
a review fee shall be grounds for denial of the application/permit.
17.4 Review fees may only be spent for services rendered in connection with the specific
project from which they were collected. Accrued interest may also be spent for this
purpose. At the completion of the Board of Health’s review of a project, any excess
amount in the account, including interest, attributable to a specific project, shall be
repaid to the applicant or the applicant’s successor in interest. For the purpose of this
regulation, any person or entity claiming to be an applicant’s successor in interest shall
provide the Board of Health with documentation establishing such succession in interest.
17.5 Any applicant may make an administrative appeal from the selection of the outside
consultant to the Board of Selectmen. Such appeal shall be in writing and within 10 days
of the Board of Health’s decision. The grounds for such an appeal shall be limited to
claims that the consultant selected has a conflict of interest or does not possess the
minimum, required qualifications. The minimum qualifications shall consist either of an
educational degree in, or related to, the field at issue or three or more years of practice
in the field at issue or a related field. The required time limit for action upon an
application by the Board of Health shall be extended by the duration of the
administrative appeal. In the event that no decision is made by the Board of Selectmen
within one month following the filing of the appeal, the selection made by the Board of
Health shall stand.

7 SURETY
7.1 Pursuant to Chapter 44, Section 53G½ of the Massachusetts General Laws, if the
CPDC requires a Permittee to post a cash bond to secure the performance of its
obligations under a Stormwater Permit, the CPDC shall specify the amount of such
cash bond based on an estimate of the cost to perform such obligations. Before
commencing construction, the Permittee shall deposit such sum with the Town
Treasurer. The Town Treasurer shall deposit such sum in a special account in the
municipal treasury and shall be kept separate and apart from all other monies. Any
interest earned on the account shall be added to the funds in the account.
7.2 At the time that the cash bond is deposited, the Permittee shall also submit to the
CPDC an authorization signed by the Property owner for any authorized Town
employee or agent to enter onto the property, after providing written notice as set
forth below, to complete any requirements of the Stormwater Permit.
7.3 Upon fulfillment of all requirements of the Stormwater Permit (except those that
survive the submission of the as-built plan) and submission of the as-built plan to
the CPDC, the Permittee may submit a written request to the CPDC for return of the
cash bond.
7.4 The CPDC shall review such written request and shall make a determination as to
whether all requirements of the Stormwater Permit (except those that survive the
submission of the as-built plan) have been met. If so, the CPDC shall authorize the
Treasurer to return the cash bond, plus any interest earned, to the Permittee. If the
CPDC determines that any requirements of the Stormwater Permit have not been
met, it may authorize the expenditure of all or portion of the cash bond to complete
such requirements. The CPDC shall return to the Permittee any portion of the special
account monies that remain after completion of all requirements.
7.5 The CPDC may, in its sole discretion, release a portion of a cash bond upon written
request by the Permittee after partial completion of a phased project.
7.6 If, at any time after issuance of a Stormwater Permit, the CPDC determines that the
Permittee has not completed requirements of the Stormwater Permit in a timely
manner, it may issue a written order to the Permittee to complete specified
requirements by a specified deadline. The CPDC shall provide a copy of such written
order to the Property owner(s). If the Permittee does not complete such
requirements by the specified deadline, the CPDC or any authorized Town employee
or agent may enter onto the Property to complete such requirements, and the CPDC
may authorize the expenditure of all or a portion of the cash bond to perform this
work.
8 WAIVER
8.1 The CPDC may waive strict compliance with any requirements of these Regulations,
where such action is allowed by federal, state and local law and the Town’s NPDES
stormwater discharge permit, is in the public interest, and is not inconsistent with
the purpose and intent of the Bylaw and these Regulations. In making this
determination, the CPDC shall consider whether:
8.1.2 The purposes of the Bylaw and these Regulations will be protected;
8.1.3 Strict application of the requirement to be waived would undermine the public
interest;
8.1.4 Specific substitute requirements can be adopted that will result in substantial
protection of the public health, safety, convenience and welfare; and
8.1.5 Any activity made possible by the waiver will not violate the provisions of any
state or federal law (including the Town’s NPDES stormwater discharge
permit) or local bylaw or be materially inconsistent with the Bylaw.
