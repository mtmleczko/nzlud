ELEMENTARY STATEMENT
This edition of the Municipal Code of the City of Bethany is a recodification of the Revised 2006
Municipal Code. In preparing this Code the editors used as source material portions of the Revised
2006 Code, ordinances passed subsequent to that date and modifications agreed upon during
the editorial conferences and incorporated herein by the adopting ordinance. In order to trace
the evolution of each Section, the reader's attention is directed to the history note appearing in
parentheses at the end of that Section. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new
and was agreed upon at the editorial conference and adopted for the first time with the adoption
of the Code. Three further sources of reference are to be found at the end of this Code. The first
is a cross reference of the old Code Section numbers to the new Code Section numbers. The second
is a cross reference of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature that have been retained
in this volume. The third is a cross reference of the State Statutes that are of a similar nature
or enable the corresponding Section of this Code.
Format
The Code is divided into seven Titles with Chapters of a like nature grouped therein. Each Chapter
is given a three digit location number corresponding to the Title in which it resides. Each Section
is given number corresponding to the Chapter in which it resides. This number is separated
by a decimal point. The digits ahead of the decimal point represent the Chapter location and the
digits behind the decimal point represent the Section within that Chapter. By allowing intervals
between Chapter and Section designations, future additions to the Code have been facilitated. In
operating under this format, the City maintains great flexibility in the placement of new material.
Table of Contents and Alphabetical Index
For those frequent users who become very familiar with the Code, the editors have placed a Table
of Contents in the front of the text. Those less familiar with the Code and infrequent users will
find an alphabetical index at the end of the Code. Much care is taken to ensure ease of access with
this index while maintaining a reasonable size.
Update Service
As those who use this book are well aware, there is a need for constant revision. The use of a
looseleaf binder is meant to facilitate this need. As new ordinances affecting this Code are passed,
they should be forwarded to the publisher from time to time for adaptation to the Code. Update
pages can then be forwarded to the City for insertion in the Code. It is the ultimate responsibility
of the holder of the volume to make sure that his or her book is brought up to date in this manner.
In Appreciation
The publishers would like to thank the following people for their time and effort during this recodification:
City Administrator, Tony Stonecypher; City Clerk, Marilyn Smith; Police Chief,
Brian Groom; Municipal Judge, Thomas Alley; Fire Chief, John Gannan; Water/Sewer Superintendent,
George Hulet; Gas Superintendent, Ted Clemmons. In addition to their help, we are
grateful to other department heads and staff members who devoted their time. This combined effort
cannot help but end in a Code that the City can be proud of and which will be a useful tool
for the entire community for years to come.

purpose at the principal office of the body holding the meeting, or if no such office
exists, at the building in which the meeting is to be held.
B. Notice conforming with all of the requirements of Subsection (A) of this Section shall be
given at least twenty-four (24) hours, exclusive of weekends and holidays when City Hall

good cause such notice is impossible or impractical, in which case as much notice as is
reasonably possible shall be given.
C. The City shall allow for the recording by audiotape, videotape or other electronic means
of any open meeting. The City may establish guidelines regarding the manner in which
such recording is conducted so as to minimize disruption to the meeting. No audio
recording of any meeting, record or vote closed pursuant to the provisions of Section

Section 140.050. Closed Meetings — How Held.
A. Except as set forth in Subsection (D) of Section 140.040, no meeting or vote may be

governmental body. The vote of each member of the governmental body on the question
of closing a public meeting or vote and the specific reason for closing that public
meeting or vote by reference to a specific Section of this Chapter shall be announced
publicly at an open meeting of the governmental body and entered into the minutes.
B. Any meeting or vote closed pursuant to Section 140.020 shall be closed only to the
extent necessary for the specific reason announced to justify the closed meeting or vote.
Public governmental bodies shall not discuss any business in a closed meeting, record or
vote which does not directly relate to the specific reason announced to justify the closed
meeting or vote. Public governmental bodies holding a closed meeting shall close only an
existing portion of the meeting facility necessary to house the members of the public
governmental body in the closed session, allowing members of the public to remain to
attend any subsequent open session held by the public governmental body following the
closed session.
Section 140.060. Journals of Meetings and Records of Voting.
A. Except as provided in Section 140.020, rules authorized pursuant to Article III of the

if a roll call is taken, as to attribute each "yea" and "nay" vote, or abstinence if not
voting, to the name of the individual member of the public governmental body. Any
votes taken during a closed meeting shall be taken by roll call. All public meetings shall
be open to the public and public votes and public records shall be open to the public for
inspection and duplication. All votes taken by roll call in meetings of a public
governmental body consisting of members who are all elected, shall be cast by members
of the public governmental body who are physically present and in attendance at the
meeting. When it is necessary to take votes by roll call in a meeting of the public
governmental body, due to an emergency of the public body, with a quorum of the
members of the public body physically present and in attendance and less than a quorum
of the members of the public governmental body participating via telephone, facsimile,
Internet, or any other voice or electronic means, the nature of the emergency of the
public body justifying that departure from the normal requirements shall be stated in the
minutes. Where such emergency exists, the votes taken shall be regarded as if all
members were physically present and in attendance at the meeting.

convenient to the public, the nature of the good cause justifying that departure from the
normal requirements shall be stated in the minutes.
Section 140.080. Segregation of Exempt Material.
If a public record contains material which is not exempt from disclosure, as well as material
which is exempt from disclosure, the custodian shall separate the exempt and non-exempt
material and make the non-exempt material available for examination and copying in accord
with the policies provided herein. When designing a public record the custodian shall, to the
extent practicable, facilitate a separation of exempt from non-exempt information. If the
separation is readily apparent to a person requesting to inspect or receive copies of the form,
the custodian shall generally describe the material exempted unless that description would
reveal the contents of the exempt information and thus defeat the purpose of the exemption.
Section 140.090. Custodian Designated — Response To Request For Access To Records.
A. The City Clerk shall be the custodian of records and will be responsible for maintenance
and control of all records. The custodian may designate deputy custodians in operating
departments of the City and such other departments or offices as the custodian may
determine. Deputy custodians shall conduct matters relating to public records and
meetings in accord with the policies enumerated herein.
B. Each public governmental body shall make available for inspection and copying by the

the designated custodian. No public governmental body shall, after August 28, 1998,
grant to any person or entity, whether by contract, license or otherwise, the exclusive
right to access and disseminate any public record unless the granting of such right is
necessary to facilitate coordination with, or uniformity among, industry regulators having
similar authority.

and the place and earliest time and date that the record will be available for inspection.
This period for document production may exceed three (3) days for reasonable cause.
D. If a request for access is denied, the custodian shall provide, upon request, a written
statement of the grounds for such denial. Such statement shall cite the specific provision
of law under which access is denied and shall be furnished to the requester no later than
the end of the third (3rd) business day following the date that the request for the
statement is received.
Section 140.100. Violations — Remedies, Procedure, Penalty — Validity of Actions By
Governing Bodies in Violation — Governmental Bodies May Seek Interpretation of Law.
A. The remedies provided by this Section against public governmental bodies shall be in
addition to those provided by any other provision of law. Any aggrieved person, taxpayer
to, or citizen of this State may seek judicial enforcement of the requirements of Sections
610.010 to 610.026, RSMo. Suits to enforce Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., shall
be brought in the Circuit Court for the County in which the public governmental body
has its principal place of business. Upon service of a summons, petition, complaint,
counterclaim or cross-claim in a civil action brought to enforce the provisions of Sections
610.010 to 610.027, RSMo., the custodian of the public record that is the subject matter
of such civil action shall not transfer custody, alter, destroy or otherwise dispose of the
public record sought to be inspected and examined, notwithstanding the applicability of
an exemption pursuant to Section 610.021, RSMo., or the assertion that the requested
record is not a public record until the court directs otherwise.
B. Once a party seeking judicial enforcement of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.,
demonstrates to the court that the body in question is subject to the requirements of
Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., and has held a closed meeting, record or vote, the
burden of persuasion shall be on the body and its members to demonstrate compliance
with the requirements of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo.
C. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body or a
member of a public governmental body has knowingly violated Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., the public governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil
penalty in an amount up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). If the court finds that there
is a knowing violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., the court may order the
payment by such body or member of all costs and reasonable attorney fees to any party
successfully establishing a violation. The court shall determine the amount of the penalty
by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the seriousness of the offense, and
whether the public governmental body or member of a public governmental body has
violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
140:9 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 140.100 BETHANY CITY CODE Section 140.110
D. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body or a
member of a public governmental body has purposely violated Sections 610.010 to
610.026, RSMo., the public governmental body or the member shall be subject to a civil
penalty in an amount up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). If the court finds that there
was a purposeful violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., then the court shall
order the payment by such body or member of all costs and reasonable attorney fees to
any party successfully establishing such a violation. The court shall determine the
amount of the penalty by taking into account the size of the jurisdiction, the seriousness
of the offense, and whether the public governmental body or member of a public
governmental body has violated Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., previously.
E. Upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a public governmental body has
violated any provision of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., a court shall void any
action taken in violation of Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., if the court finds under
the facts of the particular case that the public interest in the enforcement of the policy of
Sections 610.010 to 610.026, RSMo., outweighs the public interest in sustaining the
validity of the action taken in the closed meeting, record or vote. Suit for enforcement
shall be brought within one (1) year from which the violation is ascertainable and in no
event shall it be brought later than two (2) years after the violation. This Subsection shall
not apply to an action taken regarding the issuance of bonds or other evidence of
indebtedness of a public governmental body if a public hearing, election or public sale
has been held regarding the bonds or evidence of indebtedness.
F. A public governmental body which is in doubt about the legality of closing a particular
meeting, record or vote may bring suit at the expense of that public governmental body
in the Circuit Court of the County of the public governmental body's principal place of
business to ascertain the propriety of any such action, or seek a formal opinion of the
attorney general or an attorney for the governmental body.

time not to exceed the average hourly rate of pay for clerical staff of the public
governmental body. Research time required for fulfilling records requests may be
charged at the actual cost of research time. Based on the scope of the request, the
public governmental body shall produce the copies using employees of the body
that result in the lowest amount of charges for search, research, and duplication
time. Prior to producing copies of the requested records, the person requesting the
records may request the public governmental body to provide an estimate of the
cost to the person requesting the records. Documents may be furnished without
charge or at a reduced charge when the public governmental body determines that
waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because it is likely to
contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of
140:10 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 140.110 OPEN MEETINGS AND RECORDS POLICY Section 140.120
the public governmental body and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the

rate of compensation for the trained personnel required to duplicate such maps,
blueprints or plats. If programming is required beyond the customary and usual
level to comply with a request for records or information, the fees for compliance
may include the actual cost of such programming.

engine mounted entirely in front of the windshield and the entrance door behind the front
wheels, and which is used for the transportation of school children shall be equipped
with a crossing control arm. The crossing control arm, when activated, shall extend a
minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches from the face of the front bumper. The crossing
control arm shall be attached on the right side of the front bumper and shall be activated
by the same controls which activate the mechanical and electrical signaling devices
described in Subsection (B) of this Section. This Subsection may be cited as "Jessica's
Law" in commemoration of Jessica Leicht and all other Missouri school children who
have been injured or killed during the operation of a school bus.
D. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the driver of a school bus in the process of
loading or unloading students upon a street or highway shall activate the mechanical and
electrical signaling devices, in the manner prescribed by the State Board of Education, to
communicate to drivers of other vehicles that students are loading or unloading. A public
school district has the authority pursuant to Section 304.050, RSMo., to adopt a policy
which provides that the driver of a school bus in the process of loading or unloading
students upon a divided highway of four (4) or more lanes may pull off of the main
roadway and load or unload students without activating the mechanical and electrical
signaling devices in a manner which gives the signal for other drivers to stop and may
use the amber signaling devices to alert motorists that the school bus is slowing to a stop;
provided that the passengers are not required to cross any traffic lanes and also provided
that the emergency flashing signal lights are activated in a manner which indicates that
drivers should proceed with caution and, in such case, the driver of a vehicle may
proceed past the school bus with due caution. No driver of a school bus shall take on or
discharge passengers at any location upon a highway consisting of four (4) or more lanes
of traffic, whether or not divided by a median or barrier, in such manner as to require the
passengers to cross more than two (2) lanes of traffic; nor shall any passengers be taken
on or discharged while the vehicle is upon the road or highway proper unless the vehicle
so stopped is plainly visible for at least five hundred (500) feet in each direction to
drivers of other vehicles in the case of a highway with no shoulder and a speed limit
greater than sixty (60) miles per hour and at least three hundred (300) feet in each
direction to drivers of other vehicles upon other highways, and on all highways, only for
such time as is actually necessary to take on and discharge passengers.
E. The driver of a vehicle upon a highway with separate roadways need not stop upon
meeting or overtaking a school bus which is on a different roadway, which is proceeding
in the opposite direction on a highway containing four (4) or more lanes of traffic, or
which is stopped in a loading zone constituting a part of, or adjacent to, a limited or
controlled access highway at a point where pedestrians are not permitted to cross the
roadway.

driveway shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite
direction when the making of such left turn would create a traffic hazard.
E. The City may, on any section of road where construction or major maintenance
operations are being effected, fix a speed limit in such areas by posting of appropriate
signs, and the operation of a motor vehicle in excess of such speed limit in the area so
posted shall be deemed prima facie evidence of careless and imprudent driving and a
violation of Section 340.150.
Section 340.210. Distance At Which Vehicle Must Follow.
The driver of a vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonably safe
and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon and the
condition of the roadway. Vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or
residence district in a caravan or motorcade, whether or not towing other vehicles, shall be so
operated, except in a funeral procession or in a duly authorized parade, so as to allow
sufficient space between each such vehicle or combination of vehicles as to enable any other
vehicle to overtake or pass such vehicles in safety. This Section shall in no manner affect
Section 304.044, RSMo., relating to distance between trucks traveling on the highway.

Section 304.156, RSMo., including notice that any property remaining unredeemed after
thirty (30) days may be sold as scrap property may then dispose of such property as
provided in this Subsection. Such sale shall only occur if at least thirty (30) days has

with no satisfactory arrangements made with the towing company for continued storage,
and the owner or holder of a security agreement has not requested a hearing as provided
in Section 304.156, RSMo. The towing company may dispose of such abandoned
property by selling the property on a bill of sale as prescribed by the Director of Revenue
to a scrap metal operator or licensed salvage dealer for destruction purposes only. The
towing company shall forward a copy of the bill of sale provided by the scrap metal
operator or licensed salvage dealer to the Director of Revenue within two (2) weeks of
the date of such sale. The towing company shall keep a record of each such vehicle sold
for destruction for three (3) years that shall be available for inspection by law
enforcement and authorized Department of Revenue officials. The record shall contain
the year, make, identification number of the property, date of sale, and name of the
purchasing scrap metal operator or licensed salvage dealer and copies of all notifications
issued by the towing company as required in this Chapter. Scrap metal operators or
licensed salvage dealers shall keep a record of the purchase of such property as provided
in Section 301.227, RSMo. Scrap metal operators and licensed salvage dealers may
obtain a junk certificate as provided in Section 301.227, RSMo., on vehicles purchased
on a bill of sale pursuant to the Section.

storage and other charges which can be imposed by towing and storage companies
operating within the City, and which are consistent with this Chapter and with Sections
304.155 to 304.158, RSMo. Any violation of said established maximum charges shall be
deemed a violation of this Section of the Code and shall be punishable pursuant to
Section 100.220.
C. A towing company may impose a charge of not more than one-half (½) of the regular
towing charge for the towing of abandoned property at the request of the owner of
private real property or that owner's agent pursuant to this Chapter if the owner of the
abandoned property or the owner's agent returns to the abandoned property before it is
removed from the private real property. The regular towing charge may only be imposed
after the abandoned property has been removed from the property and is in transit.
Section 397.060. Sale of Abandoned Property By City. 6

property, in accordance with its established provisions and regulations and may transfer

complete abandoned property identification number, and the odometer reading of the
abandoned property, if available and shall be lawful proof of ownership for any dealer
registered under the provisions of Section 301.218, RSMo., or Section 301.560, RSMo., or for

ARTICLE II
Non-Conforming Lots, Non-Conforming Uses of Land, Non-Conforming Structures,
Non-Conforming Uses of Structures and Premises, and Non-Conforming Characteristics
of Use
Section 405.040. Non-Conforming Uses.
[R.O. 2006 §400.040; Ord. No. 545 §4, 8-19-1968]
A. Intent. Within the districts established by this Chapter or amendments that may later be
adopted there exist:
1. Lots
2. Structures
405:4 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 405.040 ZONING REGULATIONS Section 405.040
3. Uses of land and structures, and
4. Characteristics of use which were lawful before August 19, 1968, or the date of
any amendment to this Chapter, but which would be prohibited, regulated or
restricted under the terms of this Chapter of future amendment. It is the intent of
this Chapter to permit these non-conformities to continue until they are removed,
but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this Chapter that
non-conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district.
B. Non-conforming uses are declared by this Chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses
in the districts involved. A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of
land, or a non- conforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be
extended or enlarged after August 19, 1968, by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other
uses, of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
C. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Section shall be deemed to require a change in
the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction
was lawfully begun prior to the effective date (August 19, 1968) of adoption or any
amendment to this Chapter, and upon which actual building construction has been carried
on diligently. "Actual construction" is hereby defined to include the placing of
construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where
excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun
preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to
be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
D. Non-Conformity Lots Of Record.
1. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family
dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of
record at the effective date (August 19, 1968) of adoption or any amendment to
this Chapter, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
Chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such
lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other
than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard
requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment.
2. If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous
frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage of an amendment
to this Chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements
established for lot width and area, the land involved shall be considered to be an
undivided parcel for the purposes of this Chapter, and no portion of said parcel
shall be used or sold in a manner which diminished compliance with lot width and
area requirements established by this Chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel
405:5 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 405.040 BETHANY CITY CODE Section 405.040
be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in
this Chapter.
E. Non-Conforming Uses Of Land (Or Land With Minor Structures Only). Where at the
time of passage of this Chapter lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted
by the regulations imposed by this Chapter, and where such use involves no individual
structure with a replacement cost exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), the use
may be continued for a period of two (2) years from August 19, 1968, so long as the use
remains otherwise lawful, provided:
1. No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date (August 19,
1968) of adoption or any amendment to this Chapter.
2. No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of
the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date (August
19, 1968) of adoption or any amendment to this Chapter.
3. If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more
than thirty (30) days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which such land is located.
4. No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this Chapter shall be
erected in connection with such non-conforming use of land.
F. Non-Conforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date (August
19, 1968) of adoption or any amendment to this Chapter, that could not be built under
the terms of this Chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increased its non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to
decrease its non-conformity.
2. Should such non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of structure be
destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its
replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be constructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this Chapter.
3. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever it shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is
moved.
G. Non-Conforming Uses Of Structures Or Of Structures And Premises In Combination. If
lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) or more, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the
effective date (August 19, 1968) of adoption or any amendment to this Chapter, the
lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
405:6 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 405.040 ZONING REGULATIONS Section 405.040
1. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Chapter in the district
in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed,
moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use
permitted in the district in which it is located;
2. Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building
which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date
(August 19, 1968) of adoption, or any amendment to this Chapter, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building;
3. If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a structure, or
structure and premises, may as a special exception be changed to another
non-conforming use provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by general rule
or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is
equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
non-conforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may
require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of
this Chapter.
4. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be
resumed.
5. When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive months or for
eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period (except when government
action impedes access to the premises) the structure or structure and premises in
combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
6. Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
non-conforming status of the land. "Destruction", for the purpose of this
Subsection, is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of
the replacement cost at the time of destruction.
H. Repairs And Maintenance.
1. On any non-conforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
non-conforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive
months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the
current replacement cost of the non-conforming structure or non-conforming
portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing
when it became non-conforming shall not be increased.
2. If a non-conforming structure or portion containing a non-conforming use becomes
physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is
declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of
405:7 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 405.040 BETHANY CITY CODE Section 405.060
physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
3. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to
a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any
official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
I. Uses Under Special Exception Provisions Not Non-Conforming Uses. Any use which is
permitted as a special exception in a district under the terms of this Chapter (other than a
change through Board of Adjustment action from a non-conforming use to another use
not generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a non-conforming use in such
district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use.

be considered minimum standards in those districts for which they are specified:
1. Physical appearance. Automobile junk, salvage, wrecking, storage, and similar
operations shall be shielded from view from streets and from adjacent properties in
another district by means of a sturdy, slight obscuring fence in good repair. All
other operations shall be carried on within enclosed buildings except that new
materials or equipment in operable condition may be stored in the open. Normal
daily wastes of an inorganic nature may be stored in containers not in a building
when such containers are not readily visible from a street. The provisions of this
paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the display of merchandise or vehicles
for sale or the storage of vehicles, boats, farm machinery, trailers, mobile homes or
similar equipment when in operable condition.
405:9 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 405.070 BETHANY CITY CODE Section 405.070
2. Fire hazard. No operation shall involve the use of highly flammable gasses, acid,
liquids, grinding processes or other inherent fire hazards. This provision shall not
be construed to prohibit the use of normal heating fuels, motor fuels, and welding
gasses when handled in accordance with other ordinances of the City.
3. Noise. No operation shall be carried on which involves noise in excess of the
normal traffic noise of the adjacent street at the time of the daily peak hour of
traffic volume. Noise shall be measured at the property line and when the level of
such noise cannot be determined by observation with the natural senses, a suitable
instrument may be used and measurement may include categorizations into a
reasonable number of frequency ranges. All noises shall be muffled so as not to be
objectionable due to intermittence, beat frequency, or shrillness.
4. Sewage and liquid wastes. No operation shall be carried on which involves the
discharge into a sewer, water course or the ground of liquid wastes of any
radioactive nature, or liquid wastes of a chemical nature which are detrimental to
normal sewage plant operation or corrosive and damaging to sewer pipes and
installations.
5. Air-contaminants.
a. Air-contaminants and smoke shall be less dark than designated Number One
on the Ringlemann Chart as published by the United States Bureau of Mines,
except that smoke of a density designated as Number One shall be permitted
for one (1) four (4) minute period in each one-half (½) hour. Light colored
contaminants of such an opacity as to obscure an observer's view to a degree
equal to or greater than the aforesaid shall not be permitted.
b. Particulate matter or dust as measured at the point of emission by any
generally accepted method shall not be emitted in excess of two-tenths (.2)
grains per cubic foot as corrected to a temperature of five hundred degrees

(½) hour, at which time it may equal but not exceed six-tenths (.6) grains per
cubic foot as corrected to a temperature of five hundred degrees Fahrenheit
(500° F).
c. Because the possibilities of air contamination cannot reasonably be
completely covered in this Section, there shall be applied the general rule that
there shall not be discharged from any sources whatsoever such quantities of
air contaminants or other materials in such quantity as to cause injury
detriment, nuisance or annoyance to any considerable number of persons or
to the public in general or to endanger the comfort, repose, health or safety of
any such considerable number of persons or have a natural tendency to cause
injury or damage to business, vegetation or property.
6. Odor. The emission of odors that are generally agreed to be obnoxious to any
considerable number of persons, shall be prohibited. Observations of odor shall be
made at the property line of the establishment causing the odor. As a guide to
classification of odor it shall be deemed that strong odors of putrefaction and
fermentation tend to be obnoxious and that such odors as associated with baking or
405:10 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 405.070 ZONING REGULATIONS Section 405.070
the roasting of nuts and coffee shall not normally be considered obnoxious within

so mounted as to minimize vibration and in no case shall such vibration exceed a
displacement of three thousands (.003) of an inch measured at the lot line. The use
of steam or broad hammers shall not be permitted.
9. Glare and heat. All glare, such as welding arcs and open furnaces shall be shielded
so that they shall not be visible from the lot line. No heat from furnaces or
processing equipment shall be sensed at the lot line to the extent of raising the
temperature of air or materials more than five degrees Fahrenheit (5° F).
B. Mobile Home Park Standards. A mobile home park development may be established in
specified districts according to the procedures for granting a special exception, provided
that the following conditions are met:

use and character of the park, and shall be located, designed, and intended to
some frequent trade or service needs of persons residing in the park;
4. The establishments and related parking areas shall present no visible evidence of
their commercial character from any portion of any residential district outside the
park.

hardship. A variance from the terms of this Chapter shall not be granted by the

variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
Chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.

conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Chapter. Violation of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Title and punishable
under Section 405.170 of this Chapter.
h. Under no circumstances shall the Board of Adjustment grant a variance to
allow a use not permissible under the terms of this Chapter in the district
405:19 Supp. #2, 2/14

noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors, or electrical interference detectable to the
normal senses off the lot, if the occupation is conducted in a single-family
residence or outside the dwelling unit if conducted in other than a single-family

405:26 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 405.180 ZONING REGULATIONS Section 405.180
when required off-street parking spaces are filled. Required off-street loading space is not
to be included as off-street parking space in computation of required off-street parking
space.
LOT — For the purposes of this Chapter, a lot is a parcel of land of at least sufficient
size to meet minimum zoning requirements for use, coverage, and area, and to provide
such yards and other open spaces as are herein required. Such lot shall have frontage on
an improved public street and may consist of:
1. A single lot of record;
2. A portion of a lot of record;
3. A combination of complete lots of record and portions of lots of record, or of
portions of lots of record;
4. A parcel of land described by metes and bounds; provided that in no case of
division or combination shall any residual lot or parcel be created which does not
meet the requirements of this Chapter.
LOT FRONTAGE — The front of a lot shall be constructed to be the portion nearest the
street. For the purposes of determining yard requirements on corner lots and through lots,
all sides of a lot adjacent to streets shall be considered frontage, and yards shall be
provided as indicated under "Yards" in this Section.
LOT MEASUREMENTS —
1. Depth: The distance between the midpoints of straight lines connecting the
foremost points of the side lot lines in front and the rearmost points of the side lot
lines in the rear.
2. Width: The distance between straight lines connecting front and rear lot lines at
each side of the lot, measured across the rear of the required front yard, provided
however, that width between side lot lines at their foremost points (where they
intersect with the street line) shall not be less than eighty percent (80%) of the
required lot width except in the case of lots on the turning circle of cul-de-sacs
where the eighty percent (80%) requirement shall not apply.
LOT OF RECORD — A lot which is part of a subdivision recorded in the office of the
County Recorder, or a lot or parcel described by metes and bounds, the description of
which has been so recorded.
LOT TYPES — The diagram (Figure 1) which follows illustrates terminology used in
this Chapter with reference to "corner" lots, "reversed frontage" lots and "through" lots:
See Page 26 of Zoning Ordinance Book.
In the diagram, "A" represents a "corner" lot, defined as a lot located at the intersection
of two (2) or more streets. A lot abutting on the curved street or streets shall be
considered a corner lot if straight lines drawn from the foremost points of the side lot
lines to the foremost point of the lot meet at an interior angle of less than one hundred
thirty-five degrees (135°). See lots marked A(1) in the diagram.
405:27 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 405.180 BETHANY CITY CODE Section 405.180
"B" represents an "interior" lot, defined as a lot other than a corner lot with only one (1)
frontage on a street.
"C" represents a "through" lot, defined as a lot other than a corner lot with frontage on
more than one (1) street. Through lots abutting two (2) streets may be referred to as
double frontage lots.
"D" represents a "reversed frontage" lot, defined as a lot on which the frontage is at right
angles or approximately right angles (interior angle less than one hundred thirty-five
degrees (135°) ) to the general pattern in the area. A reversed frontage lot may also be a
corner lot (A-D in the diagram), an interior lot (B-D) or a through lot (C-D).
MOBILE HOME PARK DEVELOPMENT — A planned residential development for
mobile home units meeting the requirements of the mobile home park standards
contained in this Chapter.
OUTDOOR ADVERTISING BUSINESS — The outdoor advertising business is the
provision of outdoor displays or display space on a lease or rental basis only, and in
conformity with the outdoor advertising standards contained in this Chapter.
PARKING SPACE, OFF-STREET — For the purpose of this Chapter, an off-street
parking space shall consist of a space adequate for parking an automobile with room for
opening doors on both sides, together with properly related access to a public street or
alley and maneuvering room. Required off-street parking areas for three (3) or more
automobiles shall have individual spaces marked, and shall be so designed, maintained,
and regulated that no parking or maneuvering incidental to parking shall be on any public
street, walk, or alley, and so that any automobile may be parked and unparked without
moving another.
For purposes of rough computation, an off-street parking space and necessary access and
maneuvering room may be estimated at three hundred (300) square feet, but off-street
parking requirements will be considered to be met only when actual spaces meeting the
requirements above are provided and maintained, improved in a manner appropriate to
the circumstances of the case, and in accordance with all ordinances and regulations of
the City.
ROADSIDE STANDS — A structure not exceeding five hundred (500) square feet in
floor area for the sale of agricultural products grown on the premises. Roadside stands
shall be so situated as to be accessible from the roadway without interfering with the
normal flow of traffic, but in all cases shall be at least thirty-five (35) feet from the
roadway.
SIGN — Any device designed to inform or attract the attention of persons not on the
premises on which the sign is located, provided however, that the following shall not be
included in the application of the regulations herein.
1. Signs not exceeding one (1) square foot in area and bearing only property
numbers, post box numbers, names of occupants of premises, or other
identification of premises not having commercial connotations;
2. Flags and insignia of any government except when displayed in connection with
commercial promotion;
405:28 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 405.180 ZONING REGULATIONS Section 405.180
3. Legal notices; identification, information, or directional signs erected or required
by governmental bodies;
4. Integral decorative or architectural features of buildings, except letters, trademarks,
moving parts, or moving lights;
5. Signs directing and guiding traffic and parking on private property, but bearing no
advertising matter.
SIGNS, NUMBER AND SURFACE AREA — For the purpose of determining number
of signs, a sign shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device
containing elements organized, related, and composed to form a unit. Where matter is
displayed in a random manner without organized relationship of elements, or where there
is reasonable doubt about the relationship of elements, each element shall be considered
to be a single sign.
The surface area of a sign shall be computed as including the entire area within a regular
geometric form or combinations of regular geometric forms comprising all of the display
area of the sign and including all of the elements of the matter displayed. Frames and
structural members not bearing advertising matter shall not be included in computation of
surface area.
SIGN, ON-SITE — A sign relating in its subject matter to the premises on which it is
located, or to products, accommodations, services, or activities on the premises, and
constructed in conformity with the on-site sign standards contained in this Chapter.
On-site signs do not include signs erected by the outdoor advertising industry in the
conduct of the outdoor advertising business.

generally or without restriction throughout the zoning division or district but which, if
controlled as to number, area, location, or relation to the neighborhood, would promote
the public health, safety, welfare, morals, order, comfort, convenience, appearance,
prosperity, or general welfare. Such uses may be permitted in such zoning division or
district as special exceptions, if specific provision for such special exceptions is made in
this Zoning Code.

UTILITY SUBSTATIONS — Utility substations are structures necessary for the
functioning of a utility, but not including general business offices, maintenance facilities
and other general system facilities, and conforming to the yard requirements of the zone
in which the utility substation is located and having a landscaped or masonry barrier on
all sides.
VARIANCE — A variance is a relaxation of the terms of the Zoning Code where such
variance will not be contrary to the public interest and where, owning to conditions
peculiar to the property and not the result of the actions of the applicant, a literal
enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary and undue hardship. As used
in this Chapter, variance is authorized only for height, area, and size of structure or size
of yards and open spaces; establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited shall
not be allowed by variance, nor shall a variance be granted because of the presence of
non-conformities in the zoning district or uses in an adjoining zoning district.
YARD — A yard is a required open space other than a court unoccupied and
unobstructed by any structure or portion of a structure from thirty (30) inches above the
general ground level of the ground lot upward, provided however that fences, walls,
poles, posts, and other customary yard accessories, ornaments, and furniture may be
permitted in any yard subject to height limitations and requirements limiting obstruction
of visibility.
YARD, FRONT — A front yard is a yard extending between side lot lines across the
front of a lot adjoining a public street.
1. In any required front yard, no fence or wall shall be permitted which materially
impedes vision across such yard above the height of thirty (30) inches, and no
hedge or other vegetation shall be permitted which materially impedes vision
across such yard between the heights of thirty (30) inches and ten (10) feet.
2. In the case of through lots, unless the prevailing front yard pattern on adjoining
lots indicates otherwise, front yards shall be provided on all frontages. Where one
(1) of the front yards that would normally be required on a through lot is not in
keeping with the prevailing yard pattern, the Administrative Official may waive the
405:32 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 405.180 ZONING REGULATIONS Section 405.180
requirement for the normal front yard and substitute therefor a special yard
requirement which shall not exceed the average of the yards provided on adjacent
lots.
3. In the case of corner lots which do not have reversed frontage, a front yard of the
required depth shall be provided in accordance with the prevailing yard pattern and
a second front yard of seventy-five percent (75%) in depth required generally for
front yards in the district shall be provided on the other frontage.
4. In the case of reversed frontage corner lots, a front yard of the required length
shall be provided on either frontage, and a second front yard of seventy-five
percent (75%) the depth required generally for front yards in the district shall be
provided on the other frontage.
5. In the case of corner lots with more than two (2) frontages, the Administrative
Official shall determine the front yard requirements subject to the following
limitations:
a. At least one (1) front yard shall be provided having the full depth required
generally in the district;
b. No other front yard on such lot shall have less than seventy-five percent
(75%) the full depth required generally.
6. Depth of required front yards shall be measured at right angles to a straight line
joining the foremost points of the side lot lines. The foremost point of the side lot
lines, in the case of rounded property corners at street intersections, shall be
assumed to be the point at which the side and front lot lines would have met
without such rounding. Front and rear front yard lines shall be parallel.
YARD, SIDE —
1. A side yard is a yard extending from the rear line of the required front yard to the
rear lot line, or in the absence of any clearly defined rear lot line to the point on
the lot farthest from the intersection of the lot line involved with the public street.
In the case of "through lots", side yards shall extend from the rear lines of front
yards required. In the case of "corner lots", yards remaining after full and
three-quarter depth front yards have been established shall be considered side
yards.
2. Width of a required side yard shall be measured in such a manner that the yard
established is a strip of the minimum width required by district regulations with its
inner edge parallel with the side lot line.
YARD, REAR —
1. A rear yard is a yard extending across the rear of the lot between inner side yard
lines. In the case of through lots and corner lots, there will be no rear yards, but
only front and side yards.
405:33 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 405.180 BETHANY CITY CODE Section 405.180
2. Depth of a required rear yard shall be measured in such a manner that the yard
established is a strip of the minimum width required by district regulations with its
inner edge parallel with the rear lot line.
YARD, SPECIAL — A special yard is a yard behind any required yard adjacent to a
public street, required to perform the same functions as a side or rear yard, but adjacent
to a lot line so placed or oriented that neither the term "side yard" nor the term "rear
yard" clearly applies. In such cases, the Administrative Official shall require a yard with
minimum dimensions as generally required for a side yard or a rear yard in the district,
determining which shall apply by the relation of the portion of the lot on which the yard
is to be located to the adjoining lot or lots, with due regard to the orientation and location
of structures and buildable areas thereon.

Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purpose
Section 410.010. Statutory Authorization.
[R.O. 2006 §410.010; Ord. No. 1011 Art. 1 §A, 9-5-2000]
The legislature of the State of Missouri has in Section 89.020, RSMo., delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations
designed to protect the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the City of Bethany,
Missouri, ordains as follows.
Section 410.020. Findings of Fact.
[R.O. 2006 §410.020; Ord. No. 1011 Art. 1 §B, 9-5-2000]
A. Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of
Bethany, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
B. General Causes Of The Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by:
1. The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing
increases in flood heights and velocities, and
2. The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to
others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
C. Methods Used To Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that is the
basis of this Chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards
which consist of a series of interrelated steps.
1. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit
a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the
area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this
Chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be
expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this Chapter. It is in the
general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent (1%)
chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as delineated on the Federal Insurance
Administrator's FIS and illustrative materials dated October, 1981, as amended,
and any future revisions thereto.
410:2 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 410.020 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT Section 410.040
2. Calculations of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic
engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to
convey the regulatory flood.
3. Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood
heights more than one (1) foot at any point.
4. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is
permitted that would cause any increase in flood height.
5. Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines,
but still subject to inundation by the base flood.
Section 410.030. Statement of Purpose.
[R.O. 2006 §410.030; Ord. No. 1011 Art. 1 §C, 9-5-2000]
A. It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare;
to minimize those losses described in Section 410.020(A); to establish or maintain the
community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the
requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this Chapter to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of
flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
2. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses,
be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
3. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended
development purposes due to the flood hazard.
ARTICLE II
General Provisions
Section 410.040. Lands To Which Chapter Applies.
[R.O. 2006 §410.040; Ord. No. 1011 Art. 2 §A, 9-5-2000]
This Chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Bethany identified
as numbered and unnumbered A Zones and AE Zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) dated April 1, 1982, as amended,
and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this Chapter, no development shall be
permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit granted by the City
of Bethany or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the
City of Bethany or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion
and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and as
specifically noted in Article IV.

Section 410.050 BETHANY CITY CODE Section 410.090
Section 410.050. Floodplain Administrator.
[R.O. 2006 §410.050; Ord. No. 1011 Art. 2 §B, 9-5-2000]
The Building Inspector is hereby designated as the Floodplain Administrator under this
Chapter.
Section 410.060. Compliance.
[R.O. 2006 §410.060; Ord. No. 1011 Art. 2 §C, 9-5-2000]
No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be
located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of
this Chapter and other applicable regulations.
Section 410.070. Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
[R.O. 2006 §410.070; Ord. No. 1011 Art. 2 §D, 9-5-2000]
It is not intended by this Chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements,
covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this Chapter imposes greater restrictions, the
provisions of this Chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this Chapter are
hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
Section 410.080. Interpretation.
[R.O. 2006 §410.080; Ord. No. 1011 Art. 2 §E, 9-5-2000]
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Chapter shall be held to be
minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body and shall
not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by State Statutes.
Section 410.090. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
[R.O. 2006 §410.090; Ord. No. 1011 Art. 2 §F, 9-5-2000]
The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger
floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This Chapter does
not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such
areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This Chapter shall not create a liability on
the part of the City of Bethany, any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
may result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.

A. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article II, Section 410.040 are
areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following
provisions shall apply:
1. The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle
that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the
waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that
flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
2. The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development, within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
3. If Article IV, Section 410.160(2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of Article IV.
4. In unnumbered A Zones, the community shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize
any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State
or other sources as set forth in Article IV, Section 410.130(B).

levels during the base flood discharge would result.
D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon:
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause,
2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant, and

rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or
b. One hundred fifty (150) days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable
benchmark.
2. If the City has not made a decision within the ninety (90) or one hundred fifty
(150) day period, the Board of Aldermen shall issue a brief written order at the end
of the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.

the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates will be capped at that
level.
2. If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be greater
than the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30, 1992, reduced by ten
percent (10%), or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change
in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992, and the initial
date of regulation.

permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service

(10%), will prescribe the cable operator's new rates.

1. By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable operator's
proposed rates, the Board of Aldermen shall adopt its decision by formal
resolution. The decision shall include one (1) of the following:

a cost-of-service analysis, the Board of Aldermen shall approve the initial
basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or

cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the Board
of Aldermen shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC's
reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis.
2. Rollbacks and refunds. If the Board of Aldermen determines that the initial basic
cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable
operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the Board of Aldermen

applicable. In addition, the Board of Aldermen may order the cable operator to pay
to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed

and
b. Act to approve the rate increase within thirty (30) days from the date the

the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The Board of
Aldermen may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the cable operator makes

the price cap or below the cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable
operator's new rate.
I. Decision. The Board of Aldermen's decision concerning the requested rate increase, shall
be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is
disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other parties to the
proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision. Objections

rate increased by a cost-of-service showing, the Board of Aldermen

A. Purpose. The purpose of this Article is:
1. To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or pollution by
containing within the consumer's internal distribution system or private water
system contaminants or pollutants which could backflow through the service
connection into the public potable water supply system.
2. To promote the elimination, containment, isolation, or control of existing
cross-connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable
water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures, and
industrial-process systems.
3. To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection
control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or
pollution of all potable water systems.
B. Application. This Article shall apply to all premises served by the public potable water
system of the City of Bethany.
C. Policy. This Article will be reasonably interpreted by the Water Purveyor. It is the Water
Purveyor's intent to recognize the varying degrees of hazard and to apply the principle
that the degree of protection shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard. The
Water Purveyor shall be primarily responsible for protection of the public potable water
distribution system from contamination or pollution due to backflow or contaminants or
pollutants through the water service connection. The cooperation of all consumers is
required to implement and maintain the program to control cross-connections. The Water
Purveyor and consumer are jointly responsible for preventing contamination of the water
system.
If, in the judgment of the Water Purveyor or his/her authorized representative,
cross-connection protection is required through either piping modification or installation
of an approved backflow prevention device, due notice shall be given to the consumer.
The consumer shall immediately comply by providing the required protection at his/her
own expense; and failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the consumer to provide
such protection shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises
until such protection has been provided.

A. Electrical, gas, water, sewer and waste collection and disposal services to be supplied by
or through the City will not commence until proper application is approved by the City
Clerk. Application for commencement of electrical, gas, water, sewer and waste
collection and disposal services to be supplied by or through the City shall be made in
writing upon a form prepared by the City Clerk. A photo ID of the applicant is required.
Said application must be made and signed by the record owner of a property and/or by
one who has entered into an agreement to rent or lease said property. If the City Clerk
deems it necessary, said Clerk may require proof that the applicant has such an interest in
the property prior to accepting the application for commencement of services. At the time
of the application for services, there shall be paid to the City Clerk a deposit for each
service applied for. For residential customers, such deposit will not exceed one hundred
dollars ($100.00) each for electrical and gas and fifty dollars ($50.00) for water service.
For commercial customers, such deposit will be set by the City Clerk.
B. At the time of discontinuance of such service, the aforesaid deposit or deposits shall be
applied to the billing for the month in which said service is discontinued; any excess
remaining shall be paid to the person in whose name such service has been billed. For
residential customers who have been required to pay a deposit, if for one (1) full year
after payment of a deposit and the customer pays all of the utility billings for that year,
the Clerk may make a refund of the deposit by applying that deposit amount to the
customer's succeeding billings.
Section 715.020. Billing.
[R.O. 2006 §720.020; Ord. No. 736 §10, 4-16-1984; Ord. No. 966 §3, 3-31-1997; Ord. No.
1062, 7-21-2003]
Billings for utility services supplied by or through the City shall be made in the name of the
applicant for commencement of services. The City Clerk shall cause all billings for utility
services supplied by or through this City to be mailed to the person in whose name such
services are billed on or before the last day of the month in which such services are assessed.
Section 715.030. Payment and Procedure Upon Non-Payment.

§3, 3-16-2009]
A. A delinquent date shall be printed on the customer’s utility bill. If any bill shall be
overdue, a penalty of seven and one-half percent (7.5%) shall be added thereto to the
715:2 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 715.030 UTILITY BILLING Section 715.035
current amount due beginning the 16th day of the month. [Ord. No. 1170 §4, 3-4-2011;
Ord. No. 1171 §3, 3-4-2011]
B. A disconnect notice shall be printed on the customer's utility bill. This shall be the only
notice of disconnect the customer shall receive. If the entire bill or any portion thereof
remains unpaid and/or overdue by the fourth (4th) Wednesday of the month, the City
Clerk may issue an order to disconnect the utility service.
C. If any billing or charge remains overdue past the fourth (4th) Wednesday of the month,
the City Clerk may cause that utility service to be disconnected. In determining when and
whether to disconnect service, the Clerk will consider the previous payment history of
the user, the time of year when the disconnection would occur, any efforts which the user
has made to satisfy the overdue amount and any other factors deemed relevant by the
Clerk. If utility service is so disconnected, a reconnect fee of one hundred dollars
($100.00) must be paid. Any additional thirty dollar ($30.00) reconnect fee will be due if
reconnection is requested after 5:00 P.M. weekdays or on weekends and holidays. Once
utility service has been disconnected per the terms of this Subsection, a new application
for service may be requested before service is restored.
D. If utility service is disconnected per Subsection (D) above, the City Clerk may reject
future applications for utility service made by the person responsible for the overdue bill
until said overdue bill, together with all penalties and interest due and owing, are paid in
full. The Clerk may also reject reconnection of utility service for the address or location
where the disconnection occurred until any outstanding overdue amounts for that address
or location, together with all penalties and interest due and owing are paid in full.
Section 715.035. Occupant and Owner Liable For Payment of Services.
A. Sewerage services, water services, or water and sewerage services combined shall be
deemed to be furnished to both the occupant and owner of the premises receiving such
service and, except as otherwise provided in Subsection (B) of this Section.
B. When the occupant is delinquent in payment for thirty (30) days, the City, shall make a
good faith effort to notify the owner of the premises receiving such service of the
delinquency and the amount thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
to the contrary, when an occupant is delinquent more than ninety (90) days, the owner
shall not be liable for sums due for more than ninety (90) days of service. Any notice of
termination of service shall be sent to both the occupant and owner of the premises
receiving such service.
C. The provisions of this Section shall apply only to residences that have their own private
water and sewer lines. In instances where several residences share a common water or
sewer line, the owner of the real property upon which the residences sit shall be liable for
water and sewer expenses.
D. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the City when terminating
service due to delinquency of payment by a consumer shall not be liable for any civil or
criminal damages.
715:3 Supp. #2, 2/14
Section 715.035 BETHANY CITY CODE Section 715.050
E. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to unapplied-for utility services. As used in
this Subsection, "unapplied-for utility services" means services requiring application by
the property owner and acceptance of such application by the utility prior to the
establishment of an account. The property owner is billed directly for the services
provided, and as a result, any delinquent payment of a bill becomes the responsibility of
the property owner rather than the occupant.

1062, 7-21-2003]
If any person or entity violates the terms of this Chapter in any manner, the City Clerk may
cause the utility service for that person or entity to be disconnected. To the extent that any
person or entity has failed to pay utility billings, penalties and interest, the City may enforce
collection of such billings, penalties and interest by bringing legal action against the person or
entity responsible for payment thereof. In such legal action, the City will be entitled to
recover the sums due and owing for services, together with all penalties and interest assessed,
plus court costs and a reasonable attorney fee as determined by the court presiding over the
matter. Remedies provided in this Chapter are cumulative and not mutually exclusive and
shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies allowed or provided by law.
