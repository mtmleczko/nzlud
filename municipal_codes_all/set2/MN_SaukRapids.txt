SECTION      1.09     DEFERRED ASSESSMENTS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS

In accordance with Minnesota Statute 435.193, the City of Sauk Rapids, may, in its discretion, defer the payment of a special improvement assessment for any homestead property owned by a person 65 years of age or older for whom it would be a hardship to make the payments.  Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the determination of hardship on the basis of exceptional and unusual circumstances not covered by the standards and guidelines where the determination is made in a non-discriminatory manner and does not give the applicant an unreasonable preference or advantage over other applicants.  The following provisions of this Section establish the standard and guidelines for determining the existence of a hardship.

 

Subd.  2.         Procedure To Obtain Deferred Assessment. The homeowner shall make application for deferred payment of special assessments on forms prescribed by both the City Clerk and  the Benton County Auditor.  The respective forms shall be returned to the Sauk Rapids City Clerk, wherein the application will be reviewed by the City Clerk and a written recommendation be submitted to the Council; both items will be considered by the City Council.  The City Clerk shall notify by mail the applicant of the date of the Council meeting on which the application will be reviewed.  The application shall require a certification of the applicant that the information contained in or made a part thereof is true and correct.  The application shall require as  an attachment, a copy of the most recently filed tax return.  In the event no income tax form was prepared, then the applicant shall submit the information which would have been used to determine net income.  In the event the deferment of the assessment is granted, the City shall record a notice of deferment with the County Recorder and the County Auditor of Benton County, which will set forth the legal description of the homestead property involved as well as the amount of the assessment, and the rate of interest charged on the assessment.

 

In addition, the City Clerk shall provide in the notice requirement when adopting the assessment roll for a special improvement project, a statement that applications for deferment of special assessments under this ordinance be made to the City Clerk within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice.

 

Subd.  3.         Termination Of Right To Deferred Payment Status.    The status of deferment on special assessments as described above shall terminate and all amounts of accumulated plus applicable interest shall become due upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

 

                        A.        The death of the owner provided that the spouse is otherwise not eligible for the benefits hereunder;

 

                        B.        The sale, transfer or subdivision of the property or any part thereof;

 

                        C.        If the property for any reason loses its homestead status; or

 

                        D.        If for any reason the municipality deferring the payment shall determine that there would be no hardship, and may thereon require immediate or partial payment, whichever would be specified.

 

Subd.  4.         Annual Review.  The City Council may annually review all deferments previously made.  The procedure shall be the same used as for the consideration of a new application.

 

Subd.  5.         Standards For Establishing Hardship.  The following standards shall be utilized as a basis for determining the existence of a hardship for which a special assessment deferral may be granted in the City of Sauk Rapids.

 

                        A.        The applicant must be 65 years of age or older.

 

                        B.        The applicant must be the owner of the homestead subject to special improvement assessments for which deferral is requested under this section.

 

                        C.        When the average annual payment for all assessments levied against the subject property exceeds 3% of the Adjusted Gross Income of the applicant as evidenced by documentation.  (The definition of average annual payment of an assessment shall be the total cost of the assessment divided by the number of years over which it is spread).

 

Subd.  6.         Special Consideration.  The deferment for special assessments under this section shall apply only to the principal.  The interest rate charged shall be the same as that levied on the other property on the applicable assessment roll, said interest shall be paid as it comes due, and shall not be affected by any deferment granted herein.

 

Any deferment granted under this section shall pertain to special improvement assessments only, and shall affect only those assessments to be levied.  All those special assessments levied prior to January 16, 1978 shall be paid and the deferral shall not apply.  However, the now levied special assessments may be used in the computations or average annual payment for determining hardship under this Section.

 

 

SECTION      1.10 CODE OF ETHICS

 

Subd. 1.          Policy and Purpose. It is imperative that all persons acting in the public service not only maintain the highest possible standards of ethical conduct in their transaction of public business but that such standards be clearly defined and known to the public as well as to the persons acting in public service.

 

The proper operation of a democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial, and responsible to the people. Governmental decisions and policies must be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure. Public office may not be used for personal gain. Citizens must have confidence in the integrity of their government officials.

 

In recognition of these goals, there is hereby established a Code of Ethics for elected or appointed public officials and city employees. The purpose of this Code is to establish ethical standards of conduct for such persons by establishing acts which are incompatible with the City’s best interests and requiring disclosure of private or financial interest in matters involving the City. The provisions and purposes of this Code are declared to be in the best interests of the City of Sauk Rapids.

 

Subd. 2.          Scope of Persons Covered.

 

a.         Except as qualified herein, the provisions of this Code of Ethics are applicable to the Mayor, all members of the City Council, all appointed city officials, and all city employees.

 

Subd. 3.          Other Laws Applicable.

 

a.         Persons covered by this code may be subject to a number of statutory provisions regarding conflict of interests. The City expects its employees and officers and appointees to become familiar with these provisions, which include: Minn. Stat. Section 471.87 (personal interest in public contract); Minn. Stat. 412.311 (personal interest in public contract) Minn Stat. 609.42 (bribery); Minn Stat. 609.43 (official misconduct, failure to perform official duties) Minn Stat. 609.44 (refusal to surrender official incidents of office to successor); Minn. Stat. l3D.Ol  l3D.07 (open meeting); Minn. Stat. 471.895 (prohibited gifts); Minn. Stat. Chapter 211A and 21lB (Campaign practices); Minn. Stat 469.113 (housing authority conflicts).

 

b.         Compliance with Program Requirements. Some grants, programs or contracts administered by the City contain specific conflict of interest requirements. The City expects that any city employees, officers, and appointees will be familiar with requirements applicable to the grants, programs or contracts in which they may be involved.

 

Subd. 4.          Identification or disclosure of Conflicts and Potential Conflicts of interest.

 

All persons covered by this code will disclose Potential Conflicts and Conflicts of interest to an appropriate third party for independent evaluation.  “Conflict” shall have that meaning as defined in Subdivision 5.  A “Potential Conflict” shall be defined as follows:

 

a.         Engages or intends to engage in a business or transaction which may reasonably be perceived as incompatible with the proper discharge of one or more official city duties; or

                                   

                        b.         May reasonably be perceived as tending to impair the persons independent             judgment or action in the performance of city duties; or

 

c.         Sponsors, advocates or acts upon City legislation which may affect the covered person’s personal or financial interest which differs materially from that of the public at large.                                

 

                        Each covered person has an obligation to identify Potential Conflicts of interests so that potential for a Conflict may be independently assessed. When there is a Potential Conflict or appearance of Conflict, it must be disclosed and independently evaluated. City employees will disclose any Conflict or Potential Conflict to their immediate supervisor and to the City Administrator on the Conflict Disclosure Form. City Council members will disclose any Conflict or Potential Conflict to the Council. Members of Boards and Commissions will disclose any Conflict or Potential Conflict to the City Administrator and to the Board or Commission on which they serve. All others will disclose to the City Administrator.

 

Only Conflicts and Potential Conflicts as defined by this Section or other applicable law are required to be disclosed.  It is anticipated that employees and members of the Council, Boards, or Commissions will have questions about when a Conflict or Potential Conflict exists and whether or not disclosure is appropriate.  They are encouraged to contact the City Administrator or City Attorney with their questions.

 

                       

                        Members of the Council, Boards, and Commissions will follow the following process when disclosing:

 

                        A.        When the Conflict or Potential Conflict is known sufficiently prior to the meeting at which the action related to the Conflict will occur:

 

i.                    The individual will fill out a Conflict Disclosure Form, describing the basis for the Conflict.

 

ii.                  If the matter involves a Potential Conflict, the individual should provide the Conflict Disclosure Form to and seek the opinion of the City Administrator, who may confer with the City Attorney, to determine the existence of a Conflict.

 

iii.                If, after review, it is determined that a Conflict does not exist, the determination will be certified on the Conflict Disclosure Form.

 

iv.                If a Conflict does exist, the Conflict Disclosure Form will be provided to the other members of the Council, Board, or Commission prior to the meeting and the individual will abstain from discussing and acting on any matter related to the Conflict.

 

                        B.        When the Conflict or Potential Conflict becomes known at the meeting, or there is otherwise insufficient time to proceed as described in Item A of this Subdivision 4:

 

                                    i.          The individual will fill out the Conflict Disclosure Form and provide it to the other members of the Council, Board, or Commission prior to the meeting.

 

                                    ii.         If there is not enough time to fill out the Conflict Disclosure Form prior to the meeting at which the action on the matter related to the Conflict will be taken, the individual will fill out the form after the meeting and the Form will then be distributed to the other members.

 

iii.                In either case, the individual should seek an oral determination on the Conflict or Potential Conflict prior to acting.  If it is determined that there is no Conflict, the determination will be certified on the Conflict Disclosure form when it is filled out after the meeting.

 

                                    iv.        If it is determined that there is a Conflict, the individual will abstain from discussing and acting on any matter related to the Conflict.

SECTION      1.11  CODE OF CONDUCT                      

 

Subd. 1.          Policy and Purpose. 

 

A.           It is the policy of the City of Sauk Rapids to provide a safe, secure and    healthy environment for employees, public officials and citizens when engaged in city business.  The City is committed to working to maintain a work environment free from acts or threats of violence, harassment, intimidation and other disruptive behavior. 

 

B.           Acts of violence, threats, harassment, intimidation and other disruptive behavior in the workplace will not be tolerated.  All reports of such conduct will be taken seriously and will be dealt with in a timely and appropriate manner.  The behavior described above can include oral or written statements, gestures, or expressions that communicate either a direct or indirect threat.  Individuals who commit such acts may be removed from city property and may be subject to disciplinary action, criminal penalties, or both.

 

C.           The cooperation of all persons subject to this Code is needed to implement this policy effectively.  They should not ignore violent, threatening, harassing, intimidating or other disruptive behavior.  If they observe or experience any behavior prohibited by this Code, by anyone engaged in city business or acting on behalf of the city in any way, it should be reported immediately to any city employee or city official who will initiate the appropriate action.

 

D.           Councilmember’s statutory duties are performed primarily by the Council as a whole.  The Council, and not individual members, supervises administrative officers and employees.   Individuals do not give orders or otherwise supervise City employees, unless directed to do so by the Council.  The Council as a unit, however, has complete authority over all administrative affairs in the City; this authority is primarily implemented through the City Administrator.  It is the policy of the Council that each Council person will respect the abilities, experience, and dignity of each City employee. 

 

Subd. 2.          Council Conduct with City Staff.  

 

A.           The Council adopts the following policies regarding council conduct with City Staff: 

 

1.      Questions of City staff and/or requests for information shall be directed to the City Administrator, City Clerk, or Department Heads.  Materials supplied to a Council member in response to a request will be made available to all members of the Council.

 

               2.      Except as part of an official council employee evaluation or disciplinary proceedings, council members shall never express concerns about the performance of a City employee in public.  Council members do not criticize the conduct or performance of employees to the employee directly, or to the employee’s supervisor.  Comments about staff performance shall be made to the City Administrator in accord with personnel procedures.  

 

   3.      Individual Council members may not attempt to influence staff on the making of appointments, awarding of contracts, selecting of consultants, processing of development applications, or granting of City licenses and permits.

 

   4.      Routine secretarial support will be provided to all Council members incident to their official duties.  Requests for additional staff support, even in high priority or emergency situations, shall be made to the City Administrator who is responsible for allocating City resources in order to maintain a professional, well-run City government.

 

B.           The Council adopts the following policies regarding council conduct with the public: 

 

1.      The Council and its members will endeavor to conduct proceedings without signs of partiality, prejudice, or disrespect toward individuals participating in a public forum.

 

2.      The Mayor (or Acting Mayor in the Mayor’s absence) will determine and announce limits on speakers at the start of the public meeting.  Generally, each speaker will be allocated ten (10) minutes.  If many speakers are anticipated, the Mayor may shorten the time limit and/or ask speakers to limit themselves to new information and points of view not already covered by previous speakers.  Subject to reasonable rules set by the council, no speaker will be turned away unless exhibiting inappropriate behavior.   The Mayor’s rulings made pursuant to this subdivision are subject to reversal by a majority vote of the Council. 

 

3.      Only the Mayor (or Acting Mayor), and not individual Council members, can interrupt a speaker during a presentation.  Upon conclusion of a presentation, consistent with any rules established for the hearing, Council members may question speakers.  The Council does not belligerently challenge or belittle speakers. 

 

4.      The City Attorney serves as advisory parliamentarian for the City and is available to answer questions or interpret situations according to parliamentary procedures.  Final rulings on parliamentary procedure are made by the Mayor, subject to the appeal of the full Council.

 

C.                 The Council adopts the following policies regarding council conduct in unofficial settings.

 

1.         It is appropriate for Council members to give a brief overview of City policy when asked about a specific issue by constituents and to refer to City staff for further information.  Councilpersons lack power to overtly or implicitly promise Council action, or to promise that City staff will perform or expedite a specific service or function (fix a pothole, rush a permit, etc).

 

2.         The Council endeavors to maintain an atmosphere that respects each member.  It is unacceptable to make derogatory personal comments about other Council members.  

 

Subd. 3.          Scope of Persons Covered.  The provisions of this Code shall apply to all employees, elected officials, department heads, other “exempt” employees, members of boards/commissions/committees, and citizen volunteers engaged in city business or representing the city in any way.  Any employee included in a collective bargaining agreement entered into in accordance with the Public Employment Labor Relations Act of 1971, as amended, or who is subject to other statutory requirements, shall be exempt from any provision of this Code which is inconsistent with or less restrictive than such agreement or statute.

A.                The fair and prompt resolution of an employee’s job-related conflicts and concerns is essential to the creation of a positive working environment.   The following employee conflict resolution guidelines are designed to help employees and their supervisors work together to resolve job-related problems and conflicts.   Employees will follow these guidelines as soon as possible after conflict or concern arises.   The fact that a dispute is pending does not afford an employee with an excuse for failing to attend to duties. 

 

B.                 The City Administrator may intervene in, and alter, the dispute resolution process as appropriate to protect employees from harassment, discrimination, abuse or other inappropriate behavior, or may refer the matter to the City Attorney or appropriate governmental authority. 

 

C.                 If a conflict, concern or problem arises, the employee will discuss it with the person with whom there is a conflict or concern, unless the circumstances and nature of the problem make the discussion inappropriate, unsafe or counterproductive.   The two individuals will discuss the problem and decide on a mutually acceptable resolution.   This applies to conflicts among employees or with a Supervisor.

 

D.                If a conflict or concern with another individual is not satisfactorily resolved, (and the concern does not involve the employee’s supervisor) the employee will discuss the problem with their Supervisor.  They will discuss the conflict or concern and work on constructive steps to resolve the conflict or concern together. 

 

E.                 If the problem is not satisfactorily resolved, the employee and Supervisor will discuss the problem with a Department Head, if applicable.   They will discuss the conflict or concern and work on constructive steps to resolve the conflict or concern together. 

 

F.                  If the problem is not satisfactorily resolved, the employee, Supervisor and Department Head will discuss the problem with the City Administrator.  They will discuss the conflict or concern and work on a mutually acceptable resolution within 5 working days.  

 

G.                The employee may submit a written statement to the City Administrator regarding the incident if the previous steps have not resolved the conflict.  The City Administrator may include input from employees with knowledge of the fact or concern.  After any further discussion, and review of the facts, the City Administrator will attempt to work out a mutually acceptable resolution within 5 working days after receiving the written statement. 

 

H.                In the event that a conflict or concern is not resolved, or the City Administrator does not respond, the employee may submit a written statement to the Mayor, (or to such other Council person as the Council may designate to handle conflict resolution matters) who in his discretion may seek Council action on the matter. 

 

I.                   In the event that the conflict or concern puts any employees’ safety at risk, or there is an illegal activity taking place, the City Administrator should be contacted immediately.  If the conflict or concern putting the employee’s safety at risk is caused by the City Administrator, or the City Administrator is involved with an alleged illegal activity, the employee should contact both the Mayor and Chief of Police directly. 

 

J.                   Where a collective bargaining agreement provides conflict resolution relief, initiation of the conflict resolution procedure herein does not stay or delay the deadlines for notification under a collective bargaining agreement unless the parties agree in writing to a delay.

 

K.                Where an employee has a conflict or concern involving a councilperson, the employee will raise that concern in the first instance with the City Administrator.   Subject to review by the Council, the City Administrator may initiate a conflict resolution procedure involving that Councilperson, and may make such modifications in the procedure as may be appropriate under the circumstances.  Where an employee alleges official misconduct, or other unlawful conduct by an elected official, the Council shall assign responsibility for investigation and shall determine the manner of review, with the advice of the City Attorney. 

 

Subd. 6.          Complaints Regarding Council or Appointive Board Conduct.  

 

A.                The Council will appoint a committee of two of its members to supervise the administration of complaints regarding the conduct of council members or members of appointed boards.   Each member shall serve for a period of two years with one of the members being initially appointed for a one-year term.  Thereafter, the membership of the Committee will rotate, so that a one new member will be appointed each year.  Whenever a complaint is directed to the conduct of a council member on the committee, the council will replace that council member with an alternate on all proceedings on that matter.

 

B.                 When a citizen (other than an employee) registers a complaint about the conduct of a councilperson, that complaint will be forwarded to the City Administrator, who will notify the committee and the party complained against of the nature of the complaint.   At the initial step, the City Administrator will contact the citizen and the party complained against and attempt to resolve the matter informally.  If the matter can be resolved informally, to the satisfaction of the citizen, the Administrator will report to the Committee on the resolution of the complaint or concern. 

 

C.                 The administrator’s conduct of conflict resolution under this subdivision will be subject to the review of the Committee. 

 

D.                If the administrator is unable to resolve the complaint to the satisfaction of the citizen, the administrator will make a recommendation to the Committee as to whether further action by the Committee may be appropriate.   The Committee may meet with the person complained against, or jointly with the complainant and person complained against, may designate an individual to engage in mediation or conflict resolution,  may recommend changes in behavior or conduct, may determine that no action is appropriate, may refer the matter to the City Attorney, may refer the matter to the entire council for action or may take such other action as may reasonably be appropriate. 

 

E.                 In all respects the actions of the Committee are subject to the review and direction of the full council.

 

F.                  In cases of repeated problems of a similar nature, where the Committee is unable voluntarily to obtain compliance with code of conduct standards, or in extraordinary circumstances involving a single act of misconduct, the Committee may recommend that the Council publicly admonish or censure a Council member. 

 

Subd. 7.          Discipline (Corrective Action); in general.  

 

A.        City Employees covered by this Code shall be subject to disciplinary action for failing to fulfill their duties and responsibilities.    Certain city employees are employed at will; this ordinance does not alter the at-will employment relationship of those employees.   The City may terminate the employment of an employee at will without resorting to disciplinary proceedings.  The conduct of disciplinary proceedings shall not waive or impair the City’s right to terminate an employee at will.  This ordinance provides for disciplinary action to redress violations of the provisions of this ordinance.  It does not limit the authority of the City as employer to discipline for other reasons. 

 

B.        The City Administrator shall implement disciplinary and corrective action in accordance with the City’s personnel manual, or other disciplinary procedures which may be adopted by the City Administrator, subject to Council review.  The City Council reserves the right to amend, suspend or waive provisions of the City’s personnel manual and to adopt procedures appropriate to a particular case.   

 

C.                 Evidence of the following acts are examples of cause that justify disciplinary or corrective action under this ordinance:

 

1.         Negligence in the performance of duty;

 

2.         During the period of employment, a felony or gross misdemeanor conviction, any conviction involving moral turpitude, or any con-viction based on abuse or misuse of employment powers, duties or responsibilities including a violation of the Code of Ethics;

 

3.         Insubordination, including, but not limited to:  refusal to obey a lawful order which a superior is entitled to give and have obeyed; refusal to do assigned work which thereby causes, or is likely to cause, loss or injury to the City or to the public; or, failure to observe legal or administrative policies, standards, and procedures specifically including local, State and federal safety and equal employment opportunities, duties and responsibilities;

 

4.         Inducing or attempting to induce an officer or any employee of the City, including employees otherwise excluded from this Code, to commit an unlawful act, or to act in violation of any lawful and reasonable administrative rule or order;

 

5.         Possession or use of intoxicating substances or narcotics while on duty without a prescription from a licensed physician;

 

6.         Carelessness or negligence in the handling or control of City property;

 

7.         Being habitually tardy or being absent from work without permission;

 

8.         Dishonesty in the performance of employment duties and responsibilities;

 

9.         Use of City time, equipment, or information for outside employ-ment or any other personal benefit, except to the extent authorized by the personnel manual. 

 

10.       Sexual harassment, discrimination, or engaging in verbal abuse or violation of the City’s Personnel Policy dealing with such matters. 

 

11.       Violation of City policies, or other good and sufficient reasons as determined by the City Administrator;

 

12.       Making false or misleading or slanderous statements about city   employees or officers.

 

Subd 8.           Written Disciplinary Form. 

 

A.        The personnel manual shall provide for a form upon which a supervisor (including the City Administrator) may initiate disciplinary action under this ordinance.  A supervisor may act upon the written complaint of another employee or such other information as the supervisor believes may justify disciplinary action. 

 

B.        Supervisors will keep a record of all complaints or concerns in the personnel file of the affected employee sufficient to show the nature of the charge or concern and the manner in which the matter was handled and disposed of.   If the charge or concern is determined to be without merit, the file will so reflect. 

 

C.        An employee or citizen may file a formal written complaint alleging misconduct by an employee covered under this code.   The allegation shall be handled under applicable law and procedures, including the data practices act.

 

D.        Where a formal written complaint is filed against an employee, within 72 hours of the date/time that the incident was initially reported, the original Complaint Form will be forwarded to the department head that supervises the accused employee.  If the department head is the person being accused or when accusations are made against appointed members of boards and commissions, the completed Complaint Form shall be forwarded to the City Administrator.  If the City Administrator is the subject of the accusation, the original Complaint Form shall be forwarded to the Council. 

 

E.         Unless confidentiality is provided by law, the person specified in Subparagraph “d” (above) shall immediately forward a copy of the complaint form to the accused employee/city official using Form 2 (Employee/Public Official Notification). 

 

Subd. 9.          Suspension From Duties. 

 

A.                             City employees.  The City Administrator may summarily suspend with or without pay and relieve from duty an employee accused of misconduct pending an investigation into the allegations.  An employee normally shall be summarily suspended when:

 

1.         He/she is under investigation for a felony crime when the proof is

            great, or serious misconduct when the presumption is great.

 

2.         He/she is physically or mentally unable to perform duties satisfactorily (as determined by his/her supervisor).

                       

3.         No crime or misconduct is alleged, but activity resulting in death

      or great bodily harm to a human being, due to its severe nature,

      requires intense and prudent investigation.

 

B.        Members of boards and commissions.  The City Council may suspend the activities of appointed members of any board or commission pending an investigation into alleged misconduct.  Members of boards and commissions will normally be suspended or censured for reasons found above.

 

Subd. 10.        Investigations of Misconduct. 

 

A.        Subject to direction by the City Administrator, the department head, or other person identified in Subd. 7 (d), is responsible for the initial review and subsequent investigation of a misconduct complaint.  The City Administrator may assign the investigation to such other person as the City Administrator deems appropriate under the circumstances.

 

B.        If, during the course of the misconduct investigation, a possible criminal violation is noted, a copy of the misconduct complaint and all relevant information gathered to that point shall be forwarded to the police department for appropriate action.  Referral of the complaint for prosecution by criminal authorities does not preclude the furtherance of disciplinary sanctions imposed under this Code.

 

C.        Any person, who is subject to a misconduct investigation, shall be afforded all rights and protections provided by law, labor agreement, and department/city policies.

 

Subd. 11.        Disciplinary Review Procedures. 

 

A.                The City Administrator may implement a progressive disciplinary process designed to resolve disciplinary matters informally, at the supervisor level, at the level of City Administrator, or at the Council.   All disciplinary actions may be reviewed by the Council.   No such process shall alter the at-will employment status of employees at will. 

 

B.                 Notifications.  When a department head or supervisor intends to initiate disciplinary action, the department head will provide written notice to the employee and will provide an informal opportunity to respond to the proposed action. 

 

C.                 Whenever possible, the department head shall notify the employee of the final disposition of the case no later than thirty (30) business days after said final disposition.

 

D.                If the employee agrees to a disciplinary action, the employee will complete a written form acknowledging that agreement and waiving any right to a hearing that may exist.  

 

E.                 If the employee disagrees with a disciplinary action, the employee may seek review of the action under procedures established by the City Administrator.   For actions which do not involve termination, suspension without pay or other discipline providing a direct financial loss to the employee, the employee has the right to seek review by the City Administrator.   For actions involving termination, suspension without pay or other discipline providing a direct financial loss to the employee, the employee may seek review by the City Administrator, and may request the Council review the decision of the City administrator. 

 

F.                  If an employee wishes to seek review at the next level, the employee must file a written request for review within 10 calendar days of the date of the notice of discipline.  

 

G.                The City Administrator has authority to implement all forms of discipline, subject to review by the Council, except termination.  The City Administrator has authority to recommend termination, but implementation of a termination decision requires Council action.   If the Administrator recommends a termination, the employee will be notified of the recommendation, and the recommendation will also be conveyed to the Council.   If an employee wishes to appeal from a recommendation of disciplinary termination, the employee must appeal within 10 days of the date of the notice of termination.    If the employee fails to appeal, the Council may act summarily without further proceedings, or it may conduct such further proceedings as it deems prudent.   If the employee does appeal a recommended termination for disciplinary reasons, then the Council will proceed in accord with Subdivision 12.  Nothing in this subdivision limits the Council’s authority to terminate employees who are employed at will.

 

Subd. 12.        Appeal Process. 

 

A.        For actions involving termination, suspension without pay or other discipline providing a direct financial loss, the employee may appeal the decision to the City Council by serving written notice to the Mayor within ten (10) business days after receipt by said individual of the written Disposition Form. 

 

B.                 The Mayor shall then arrange to have a confidential, initial personnel hearing placed on the agenda for the next regularly scheduled Council meeting or at a Special Council Meeting held solely for that purpose.

 

C.                 The Council may proceed to resolve the dispute utilizing on the written administrative record or by assigning the matter to a hearing officer for recommended decision.

 

D.                Hearing Officer Procedure.  Where the Council determines that the taking of oral testimony or other evidence by a neutral examiner would aid the Council, the Council may appoint a neutral examiner to take evidence and to make a recommended decision.  In its resolution appointing the neutral examiner, the Council may establish the procedural requirements for the hearing.  The examiner’s recommendation shall be presented to the Council, along with whatever written record is maintained, for de novo determination by the Council.

 

E.                 Hearing by Council on the Record.  The Council may determine to resolve a dispute regarding discipline upon the written administrative record prepared by the City Administrator, and such written evidence including affidavits and documentary evidence, as well as written argument submitted by the grieving employee.   If the Council adopts this procedure, the Council may establish the procedural requirements, including time limits, for submission of information to the Council.  Unless the Council otherwise provides, the Council will not receive oral presentations or argument. 

 

Subd. 13.        Effective Date.  This ordinance shall be in full force and effect sixty days from and after its passage and publication as required by law.

 

SECTION 1.12 CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS

 

Subd. 1. Purpose 

The purpose and intent of this section is to establish regulations that will allow law enforcement access to Minnesota’s Computerized Criminal History information for specified non-criminal purposes of employment background checks for the positions described in Section 1.12 Subd. 3 and licensing background checks for city licenses described in Section 1.12 Subd. 4.

SECTION 1.20: ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS

 

Subd. 1. Purpose.

            The City Council seeks to offer an alternative method of enforcement for City Code violations rather than relying on the criminal court system. The formal criminal prosecution process does not provide an environment to adequately address the unique and sensitive issues that are involved in City Code violations, including, but not limited to neighborhood concerns, livability issues, economic impact, physical limitations of the offenders and the stigma and unintended consequences of being charged with or convicted of a misdemeanor offense. In addition, the court system is a slow and overburdened process that is not conducive to dealing with the violations in a prompt and timely manner.  Finally, the penalties afforded the criminal court system are restricted to fines or physical confinement, which are not effective solutions to address City Code violations.

 

In order to provide more flexibility in addressing City Code violations on an individualized basis that will be more efficient and effective, the City Council finds that an alternative enforcement process is necessary. Therefore, to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Sauk Rapids, it is the City Council's intent to create a process for the use and imposition of administrative civil penalties that will provide the public and the City of Sauk Rapids with a more effective alternative method for addressing City Code violations.

 

Subd. 2. Alternative Methods of Enforcement.

A violation of the City Code is a misdemeanor; however, this Section seeks to gain compliance with the City Code prior to the commencement of any formal civil or criminal court action. The Administrative Civil Penalties proceedings are in addition to any other legal or equitable remedy available to the City for City Code violations. The City may, in its, discretion, choose not to issue an administrative citation and may initiate criminal charges instead. The selection of a method of enforcement is based on the nature of the violation and history of compliance.

 

Subd. 3. Authority to Issue Compliance Letters and Administrative Citations.

The following City employees and agents are authorized to issue compliance letters and administrative citations for violations of the City Code:

 

A.                Licensed peace officers and Community Service Officers of the Sauk Rapids Police Department;

B.                 Community Development Director;

C.                 Zoning Administrator;

D.                Building Official;

E.                 Fire Marshal;

F.                  Public Works Director;

G.                Other staff as directed by the City Administrator.

 

Subd. 4. Compliance Letter.

A. Contents of Compliance Letter.

If a City employee or agent identified in Subdivision 3 determines that a City Code violation has occurred, when appropriate, a compliance letter shall be issued to the owner of the property. The compliance letter shall contain the following information:

 

1)      A description or address of the property on which the City Code violation has occurred;

 

2)      The nature of the violation, including a reference to the appropriate City Code Section, if applicable;

 

3)      A compliance deadline, providing a reasonable time for compliance based on the nature of the violation;

 

4)      A statement that failure to correct the violation may result in the imposition of an administrative citation, including a civil penalty and stating the amount of the penalty as provided in the City’s fee schedule as amended from time to time.

 

B. Service of Compliance Letter.

The compliance letter shall be served on the owner by certified mail sent to the property address and the address listed on property tax statements or by personal service.

 

C. Reasonable Extensions.

Following service of the compliance letter, the City shall attempt to work with the owner to resolve the violation, including but not limited to offering reasonable extensions for compliance.

 

D. Exceptions to Issuance of a Compliance Letter.

For violations of any of the following sections, the City shall not be required to issue a compliance letter and may proceed directly to issuance of an administrative citation as provided in Section 1.20 Subdivision 5.

 

1)      Repeat Offender. If the same owner commits a subsequent violation within 24 months after a compliance letter has been issued for a same or similar offense, no compliance letter shall be required for the new violation.

 

2)      License and Permit Violations. For any license or permit violations, including but not limited to: liquor, peddlers, gambling, fireworks, amusement/special event, garbage, gas, or not having a license or permit, no compliance letter shall be required.

 

Subd 5. Administrative Citation.

 

A. Upon an owner's failure to correct the violation specified in the compliance letter within the time frame established in the compliance letter or any extension thereof granted by the City, or for any offense for which a compliance letter is not required, an administrative citation may be issued to the owner. The administrative citation shall be served on the owner, license holder, or permit holder by certified mail or by personal service and shall contain the following information:

 

1)      A description or address of the property on which the City Code violation has occurred;

 

2)      A copy of the relevant portion of the City Code that the owner is alleged to have violated;

 

3)      The amount of the administrative civil penalty for the specific City Code          violation, which shall be due and payable to the City within 30 days of the date the citation is mailed or personally served;

 

4)      A statement that the violation must be corrected or a subsequent administrative or a criminal citation may be issued;

 

5)      A statement that the City Code violation and the amount of the administrative civil penalty may be contested to be heard before an independent Hearing Officer, by notifying the Administrative Services Coordinator  in writing within 20 days after the citation was mailed or personally served;

 

6)      The amount of the fee to hold the hearing.

 

7)      A statement that if the owner contests the validity of the violation and the owner is found by the Hearing Officer to not be in violation, that the City will refund the cost of the hearing fee;

 

8)      A statement that failure to pay the administrative civil penalty may result in it being assessed against the property if appropriate.

 

B. Payment of Penalty and Correction of Violation.

If the owner pays the administrative civil penalty and corrects the City Code violation, no further action will be taken against the owner, license holder, or permit holder for that same violation.

 

C. Payment of penalty without Correction of Violation.

If the owner, license holder, or permit holder pays the administrative civil penalty but fails to correct the City Code violation, the City may issue a subsequent administrative citation, initiate criminal proceedings or initiate any other proceedings or remedies available in order to enforce correction of the City Code violation.

 

D. No Payment of penalty and/or no Correction of Violation.

If the owner, license holder, or permit holder fails to pay the administrative civil penalty and/or fails to correct the City Code violation, the City may do any of the following, or any combination thereof:

 

1)      Assess the administrative civil penalty against the property if appropriate;

 

2)      Issue a subsequent administrative citation, thereby commencing a new administrative penalties process;

 

3)      Initiate criminal proceedings;

 

4)      Initiate other enforcement action authorized by law.

 

Subd. 6. Contesting the Administration Citation.

An owner, license holder, or permit holder receiving an administrative citation may contest the alleged City Code violation and the amount of the administrative civil penalty. In order to contest any part of the administrative citation, the owner, license holder, or permit holder must notify the Administrative Services Coordinator in writing within 20 calendar days after the citation is mailed or personally served stating that the owner contests the alleged violation, the amount of the penalty or both. The written request must be accompanied by a fee for the cost of the hearing.

 

Subd. 7. Administrative Citation Hearing.

A. Scheduling the Hearing.

After receipt of the written notice to contest the citation as provided in Section 1.20 Subdivision 6, the Administrative Services Coordinator shall schedule a hearing before an independent hearing Board or Commission, depending on the violation, which will be held within 60 days, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties. The Administrative Services Coordinator shall notify the owner of the date, time, and location of the hearing.

 

B. Independent Hearing Officer.

An independent Hearing Officer, which shall be the City Planning Commission or Housing Appeals Board depending on the violation, shall preside over the administrative citation hearing.

C. Conduct of the Administrative Citation Hearing.

 At the hearing, both parties may be represented by counsel, shall have the opportunity to present testimony, shall be able to call and question witnesses and introduce any exhibits; however, strict rules of evidence shall not apply.

The Hearing Officer shall receive and give weight to the evidence, including hearsay evidence.

The hearing shall be recorded and a full record of the proceedings shall be maintained by the City according to its data retention schedule.

4)      Make a finding that no violation has occurred and dismiss the administrative citation.

The Hearing Officer may announce a decision at the conclusion of the hearing or may take the matter under advisement. The Hearing Officer shall issue a decision in the form of an order and shall serve a written copy of the order upon the parties no later than 45 days after the hearing. Any administrative civil penalty that the independent Hearing Officer imposes must be paid to the City within the timeframe established in the order. If no date is specified, it must be paid within 30 days of the Hearing Officer's order. If the administrative civil penalty is not paid, the City may assess the civil penalty against the owner's property if appropriate. If the Hearing Officer determines that no violation occurred, then the City may not proceed with criminal prosecution for the same act or conduct. A determination of no violation shall not preclude the City from issuing administrative citations or proceeding with criminal prosecution for subsequent acts or conduct.

 

F. Hearing Cost.

If the violation is upheld, then the City shall not refund the cost of the hearing.

 

G.  Failure to Appear.

No street or public way shall be vacated; no street, park, public way, public building or structure shall be constructed or authorized or any real property be acquired by this municipality until and unless it shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for its recommendation; provided that the Council shall have the power to overrule the Commission in such cases by a majority of the members of the Council.  Failure of the Commission to act within thirty days after the date of official submission to the Commission shall be deemed approval, unless a longer period be granted by the Council.

Subd.              9.         Placing Items on Agenda.

Subd.  1.         Permits Required. (See Also 4.11 Excavating Contractors License)

 

A.        No contractor shall commence any excavation until a permit shall be issued therefor.

 

B.        No permit for the making of any excavation on any street, alley or other public grounds shall be issued to any person unless he or they be licensed as provided herein, or unless such person is exempted from the licensing requirement in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.

 

C.    No permit shall be issued except to a licensed contractor and then only after the required permit fees have been paid to the City Treasurer by the applicant for the permit and the receipt therefor filed with the Public Works Superintendent.

 

 

SECTION      3.02     TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTOR

 

Subd.  1.         Regulations for Public Safety.

 

A.        Before commencing any excavation, the contractor holding the permit for a project shall set up an effective system to protect vehicular traffic and pedestrians from the excavation in accordance with Appendix B of the Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

 

B.        Whenever possible, excavations shall be made in such a manner as to allow traffic to pass through the construction area.  If it is not practicable to allow traffic to pass, a suitable detour shall be established on a route approved by the City Engineer or Superintendent of Public Works.

 

C.        If blasting is necessary in effecting the excavation, permission must be received from the Chief of Police, and due precaution and care shall be exercised to avoid damage to persons or property.  Proof of adequate insurance by blaster will be required.

 

Subd.  2.         Regulations for Protection of Existing Improvements.

 

A.        Before commencing any excavation, the contractor shall determine what improvements exist within the limits of the construction area and shall make detailed arrangements with the owners thereof for the protection or replacement of such improvements.

 

B.        Installation of pipes under city arterial streets will be done by jacking or boring whenever possible.

 

C.        When making excavations, the various materials excavated shall be piled separately.  All concrete and bituminous materials, any soil which cannot be properly compacted, and all other deleterious materials shall be removed from the construction site.

 

Subd.  3.         Restoration of Right-Of-Way.

 

A.        All surplus materials or debris shall be removed from the right-of-way immediately following completion of the basic work.

 

B.        The restoration, as well as all excavation and backfill compaction work, shall be performed in accordance with the current standards for such work, as used by the City on its construction projects, and with such special requirements established by the City Engineer or Superintendent of Public Works.

 

C.        If settlement occurs at the site of excavation, or adjacent thereto, at any time within one year from the date of final completion of the original restoration, the contractor shall be responsible for reimbursing the city for such failure in accordance with the directions of the City Engineer.  In addition, the contractor shall be responsible for reimbursing the city for any expenses incurred in the placement of warning devices and barricades for the protection of traffic.

 

Subd.  4.         City to Have Right to Complete Work.

 

A.        All work covered under this Section shall be accomplished expeditiously until completion, in order to avoid unnecessary inconvenience to traffic, to pedestrians, and for the protection of other public interests.  Wherever it is necessary to excavate in a roadway for the purposes of installation, repair, or maintenance, or other public purpose, resurfacing of said roadway must be accomplished within 48 hours following the beginning of excavation.  If the work is not completed satisfactorily within said time, the City shall have the right to complete restoration, either with its own resources or contract for same; and the contractor shall be responsible for costs.

 

B.        Where applicable, the applicant shall state in his or their application for permit, the amount of additional time that may be necessary to complete the work.  Upon review of the application, the City Engineer shall have the right to extend the time allowance in an amount which he/she determines is reasonable in order to complete the work.  In all instances, the criteria used to judge the amount of time for extension will be to allow the minimum amount of time to reasonably complete the work in a workmanship like manner and to prevent unnecessary traffic congestion.

 

C.        In the event that the work is not being accomplished expeditiously, or if work on any excavation is ceased or abandoned without due cause, the City Engineer may, after six hours written notice to the holder of the permit of the city's intention to do so, have city forces correct said work, backfill the excavation and effect all restoration as required by this Section.

 

D.        In the event settlement of an excavation occurs within one year of the date of final restoration and the contractor is notified of such settlement, he or they shall accomplish the required restoration or repair within the time limit specified by the City Engineer.  Thereafter, if said work has not been accomplished, the City Engineer may have city forces accomplish the work required.

 

E.        In the event city forces accomplish work in  accordance with either of these provisions the entire cost of such work, including any materials used therefore, shall be a liability of the holder of the permit.  Thereafter, if payment therefore is not made within 30 days of the billing date, no additional permits shall be issued to said contractor until payment has been made by the contractor or by his bonding company.

 

Subd.  5.         Regulations Regarding Installation of Water And Sewer Services.

 

A.        All taps to water mains shall be made by city forces unless otherwise agreed by the City.  A schedule of charges for the making of such taps shall be established by resolution of the City Council.  Payment for the making of such taps shall be made by the Excavating Contractor at the time he or they secure a permit unless payment therefore has already been made.

 

B.        All sanitary sewer service connection shall be made to existing wyes, tees or risers where such connection points are available at a reasonably convenient location.  The pipe saddle shall be designed for use with the size of main sewer pipe which is being tapped and shall be a design which will prohibit any protrusion beyond the inside wall of the main sewer.  Pipe saddles used on vitrified clay pipe or polyvinyl chloride pipe sewers shall be cemented to the main sewers utilizing an epoxy cement or other water tight cementing agent approved by the City Engineer.  Pipe saddles on other types of sewer pipe shall be attached in a manner which accomplishes a rigid and water tight connection meeting the approval of the plumbing inspector.  The pipe saddle used on any particular installation shall be designed specifically for use with the same type of gaskets as are used on the balance of the sewer service pipe.

 

C.        All water service and sewer service connections shall be installed with a minimum of seven feet of each cover within the street right-of-way unless the depth of the existing main lines makes it impossible to install the service connection at such depth.  Where it is impossible to provide seven feet of cover at any point within the street right-of-way, said service connections shall be protected by insulation in a manner approved by the City Engineer or Superintendent of Public Works.

 

Subd.  6.         Permission To Dig In Frozen Grounds.  No person shall make any excavation within any street or highway within (10) feet of any laid water pipe while the ground is frozen, or dig up or uncover so as to expose to the frost any municipal water pipe or sewer, except on written permission of the Public Works Superintendent.

If Grantee fails either to cure the alleged violation or breach within the time prescribed or to commence correction of the violation or breach within the time prescribed and thereafter diligently pursue correction of such alleged violation or breach, the Grantor shall then give written notice of not less than fourteen (14) days of a public hearing to be held before the Council.  Said notice shall specify the violations or breaches alleged to have occurred.  At the public hearing, the Council shall hear and consider relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and its decision.  In the event the Council finds that a material violation or substantial breach exists and that Grantee has not cured the same in a satisfactory manner or has not diligently commenced to cure of such violation or breach after notice thereof from Grantor and is not diligently proceeding to fully cure such violation or breach, the Council may revoke and terminate the Franchise or impose any other remedy permitted by the Franchise Agreement or Applicable Laws.  Grantee may appeal on such action to any court and/or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction and the Franchise shall remain in full force and effect during the pendency of any such appeal.

 

Subd. 31.        Force Majeure; Grantee’s Inability to Perform.  In the event Grantee’s performance of any of the terms, conditions or obligations required by this Ordinance or a Franchise granted hereunder is prevented by a cause or event not within Grantee’s reasonable control, such inability to perform shall be deemed excused for the period of such inability and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this Section, causes or events not within the reasonable control of Grantee shall include, without limitation, acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court, failure or loss of utilities, inability to obtain equipment or supplies from vendors, explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides and fires.

                        A.        A Grantee shall not abandon any portion of its Cable System without giving at least three (3) months prior written notice to Grantor.  A Grantee shall not abandon any portion of the Cable System without compensating Grantor for any damages resulting to the City from the abandonment.

 

                        B.        Grantor, upon such terms as Grantor may reasonably impose, may give Grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any System facility or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained in, on, under or over the Franchise Area.  Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in this Ordinance, the Grantee shall remove all abandoned facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from Grantor and shall restore any affected street to its former state at the time such facilities and equipment were installed, so as not to impair its usefulness.  In removing its plant, structures and equipment, Grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation made by or on behalf of Grantee and shall leave all Streets and other public ways and places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles or attachments.  Grantor shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the Streets, public ways, public places, cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to and after removal.  The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this Ordinance and any security fund provided for in the Franchise Agreement shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by Grantee with the terms and conditions of this Section.

 

                        C.        Upon abandonment of any Franchise property in place, the Grantee, if required by the Grantor, shall submit to Grantor a bill of sale and/or other an instrument, reasonably satisfactory in form and content to the Grantor, transferring to the Grantor the ownership of the Cable System property abandoned.

 

                        D.        At the expiration of the term for which the Franchise is granted, or upon its earlier revocation or termination, as provided for herein and/or in the Franchise Agreement, in any such case without renewal, extension or transfer, the Grantor shall have the right to require Grantee to remove, at its own expense, all above-ground portions of the Cable Television System from all Streets and public ways within the City within a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty (180) days, except to the extent Grantee is authorized or utilizing the System pursuant to other Applicable Laws.

 

                        E.        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Ordinance, the Grantee may, with the consent of the Grantor, abandon any underground Franchise property in place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the Street or public rights-of-way in which such property is located or with the use thereof by any public utility or other cable Grantee.

 

Subd. 33.        Extended Operation And Continuity Of Services.  Upon the expiration, revocation or termination of the Franchise, Grantee may continue to operate the Cable Television System for a period of time not to exceed six (6) months from the date of such expiration, revocation or termination under the terms and conditions of this Ordinance and the Franchise and to provide the regular Subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time.

 

Subd. 34.        Receivership and Foreclosure.

                        A.        A Franchise granted hereunder shall, at the option of Grantor, cease and terminate one hundred twenty (120) days after appointment of a receiver or receivers, or trustee or trustees, to take over and conduct the business of Grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred twenty (120) days, or unless: (1) such receivers or trustees shall have, within one hundred twenty (120) days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this Ordinance and the Franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivers or trustees within said one hundred twenty (120) days shall have remedied all the defaults and violations under the Franchise and/or this Ordinance or provided a plan for the remedy of such defaults and violations which is satisfactory to the Grantor; and (2) such receivers or trustees shall, within said one hundred twenty (120) days, execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the Franchise and this Ordinance.

 

                        B.        In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the Franchise property, or any material part thereof, Grantor may give notice of termination of any Franchise granted pursuant to this Ordinance upon Grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which the event the Franchise granted and all rights and privileges of the Grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty (30) days after such notice has been given, unless (1) Grantor shall have approved the transfer of the Franchise in accordance with the provisions of the Franchise and this Ordinance; and (2) such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with Grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the Franchise.

 

Subd. 35.        Rights Reserved To Grantor.

 

                        A.        In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the Grantor by this Ordinance, the Grantor reserves to itself every right and power which is required to be reserved by a provision of any ordinance or under the Franchise.

 

                        B.        The Grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the Franchise, except those required by Applicable Laws, if the Grantor, in its reasonable opinion, determines (1) that it is in the public interest to do so, and (2) that the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the Grantee or the Subscribers.  Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the Franchise unless the statement so recites.

 

Subd. 36.        Rights of Individuals. 

 

                        A.        Grantee shall not deny Cable Service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against Subscribers, Channel users, or general citizens on the basis of race, color, religion, disability, national origin, age, gender or sexual preference.  Grantee shall comply at all times with all other Applicable Laws, relating to nondiscrimination.

 

                        B.        Grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment opportunity requirements of Applicable Laws, as now written or as amended from time to time.

 

                        C.        Neither Grantee, nor any Person, agency, or entity shall, without the Subscriber’s consent, tap or arrange for the tapping, of any cable, line, signal input device, or Subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose except routine maintenance of the System, detection of unauthorized service, polling with audience participating, or audience viewing surveys to support advertising research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior cannot be identified.

 

                        D.        In the conduct of providing its Cable Services, Grantee shall take reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a Subscriber’s or general citizen’s right of privacy or other personal rights through the use of the System as such rights are delineated or defined by Applicable Laws.  Grantee shall not, without lawful court order or other applicable valid legal authority, utilize the System’s interactive two-way equipment or capability for unauthorized personal surveillance of any Subscriber or general citizen.

 

                        E.        No signals of a Class IV Channel may be transmitted from a Subscriber terminal for purposes of monitoring individual viewing patterns or practices without the express written permission of a Subscriber.  The request for permission must be contained in a separate document with a prominent statement that the Subscriber is authorizing the permission in full knowledge of its provisions.  The written permission must be for a limited period of time not to exceed one year which is renewal at the option of the Subscriber.  No penalty may be invoked for a Subscriber's failure to provide or renew the authorization.  The authorization is revocable at any time by the Subscriber without penalty of any kind.  The permission must be required for each type or classification or Class IV Channel cable communications activity planned.

 

1.         No information or data obtained by monitoring transmission of a signal from a Subscriber terminal, including but not limited to the lists of the names and addresses of the Subscribers or lists that identify the viewing habits of Subscribers may be sold or otherwise made available to any Person other than to Grantee and its employees for internal business use, or to the Subscriber who is the subject of that information, unless the Grantee has received specific written authorization from the Subscriber to make the data available.

 

            2.         Written permission from the Subscriber must not be required for the systems conducting system wide or individually addressed electronic sweeps for the purpose of verifying system integrity or monitoring for the purpose of billing.  Confidentiality of this information is subject to paragraph 1 above.

 

Subd. 37.        Severability.  If any provision of this Ordinance is held by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid or unenforceable as conflicting with any Applicable Laws now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such Governmental Authority to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such Applicable Laws, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part of this Ordinance, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof.  In the event that such Applicable Laws are subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the provision hereof which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with such laws, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on Grantor and Grantee, provided that Grantor shall give Grantee thirty (30) days written notice of such change before requiring compliance with said provision or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required for Grantee to comply with such provision.

Subd.  3.         Restrictions

 

                        A.        All gas pipes, mains, regulators, and other property and facilities shall be located and constructed so as not to interfere with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along and over said Public Ways and so as to not disrupt normal operation of City Utility System previously installed therein.  Company's construction, operation, repair, maintenance and location of such facilities shall be subject to permits if required by separate ordinance and to other reasonable regulations of the City to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this franchise agreement.  Company may abandon underground gas facilities in place, provided, at City’s request, Company will remove abandoned metal pipe interfering with a City improvement project.

 

                        B.        Company shall not construct any new or modified installations within or upon any Public Grounds without receiving the prior written consent of the City Council which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the City Council; provided that, the City will not unreasonably withhold consent to necessary modifications to existing facilities located within Public Grounds.

 

                        C.        In constructing, removing, replacing, repairing, or maintaining said gas pipes, mains and appurtenances, Company shall, in all cases, place the Public Ways in, on, under or across which the same are located in as good condition as they were prior to said operation and maintain any restored paved surface in such condition for two years thereafter.

Company shall also restore Public Grounds to the condition they were in prior to disturbance by the Company.  

 

Subd.  4.         Tree Trimming

 

Company is also granted the permission and authority to trim all shrubs and trees, including roots, in the Public Ways of City to the extent Company finds necessary to avoid interference with the proper construction, operation, repair and maintenance of gas facilities, provided that Company shall save City harmless from any liability in the premises.  Except in emergency situations, Company will provide 24 hours prior written or telephone notice to the City Public Works Department of trimming activities within Public Ways. 

 

Subd.  5.         Service and Rates

Subd.  6.         Relocating

 

                        A.        Whenever City at its cost shall grade, regrade, or change the line of any Public Way, or construct or reconstruct any City Utility System therein and shall, in the proper exercise of its police power, and with due regard to seasonable working conditions, when necessary, and after approval of its final plans have been obtained, order Company to relocate permanently its mains, services, and other property located in said Public Way materially interfering with the City’s planned construction, Company shall relocate its facilities at its own expense.  City shall give Company reasonable notice of plans to grade, regrade or change the line of any Public Way or to construct or reconstruct any City Utility System therein.  However, after Company has so relocated, if a subsequent relocation or relocations shall be ordered within five (5) years from and after first relocation, City shall reimburse Company for such non-betterment relocation expense which Company may incur on a time and material basis; provided, if subsequent relocations are requested because Company facilities materially and necessarily interfere with the extension of a City Utility System to previously unserved areas, Company may be required to relocate at its own expense.    The City may require Company to relocate, facilities within Public Grounds if necessary for an approved public project within said Public Grounds.  However, after Company has so relocated within Public Grounds, if a subsequent relocation or relocations within the same Public Grounds shall be ordered within five (5) years from and after first relocation, City shall reimburse Company for such non-betterment relocation expense.  The City may also require that facilities be relocated from Public Ways and Public Grounds for redevelopment projects completed by the City, its Housing and Redevelopment Authority or other development entity created by the City in the future (i.e. City EDA).  However, after Company has so relocated within Public Ways and/or Public Grounds, if a subsequent relocation or relocations within the same Public Ways or Public Grounds shall be ordered within five (5) years from and after first relocation, City shall reimburse Company for such non-betterment relocation expense.  It is understood and agreed that cost savings to the City is considered a valid reason to require relocation.  The City may, in its discretion, allow the Company to reimburse the City for additional costs incurred by allowing facilities to remain in their current location as an alternative to moving the facilities.  

 

                        B.

The City shall not be indemnified for losses or claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or claims arising out of or alleging the City's negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or inspection of, Company's plans or work.  The City shall not be indemnified if the injury or damage results from the performance in a proper manner of acts reasonably deemed hazardous by Company, and such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by City after notice of Company's determination.

 

                        B.        In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances where this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its sole cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Company within a period wherein Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice.  If Company is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company may not settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City; and Company, in defending any action on behalf of the City shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf.

 

Subd.  8.         Vacation of Public Ways

 

The City shall give Company at least two weeks prior written notice of a proposed vacation of a Public Way.  Except where required solely for a City or City Housing and Redevelopment Authority improvement project, the vacation of any Public Way, after the installation of gas facilities, shall not operate to deprive Company of its rights to operate and maintain such gas facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to Company.  In no case, however, shall the City be liable to pay damages to Company for failure to specifically preserve a right-of-way under Minnesota Statutes, Section 160.29.

During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in lieu of any permit or other fees being imposed on the Company for working within Public Ways, the City may impose on the Company a franchise fee.

                        B.        Equitable Fee.   The City will use all reasonable efforts to legally collect  franchise fees equitably from other providers of energy to the extent the City has the legal authority to do so.

Where a provision of any other City ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail.

 

                        B.        If either party asserts that the other party is in default in the performance of any obligation hereunder, the complaining party shall notify the other party of the default and the desired remedy.  The notification shall be written.  Representatives of the parties must promptly meet and attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute.  If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days of the written notice, the parties may jointly select a mediator to facilitate further discussion.  The parties will equally share the fees and expenses of this mediator.  If a mediator is not used or if the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days after first meeting with the selected mediator, either party may commence an action in District Court to interpret and enforce this franchise or for such other relief as may be permitted by law or equity for breach of contract, or either party may take any other action permitted by law.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Subdivision shall not apply to questions regarding the City’s ability to require payment of Franchise Fees or the City’s ability to require Company to acknowledge and accept this Franchise.  In the event that the City is required to expend legal fees in enforcing the terms of this Franchise, the City shall be entitled to recoup such fees from Company. 

 

                        C.        This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between the City and Company as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto.

 

                        D.        Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity of this Ordinance.  Any governmental unit succeeding the City shall, without the consent of Company, succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the City provided in this Ordinance.

 

                        E.        Nothing in this Ordinance relieves any person from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging Company's facilities while performing any activity.

 

                        F.         Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent or prohibit the City from adopting other Ordinances generally regulating excavation or other work within Public Ways and/or Public Grounds.  Company shall comply with all such present and future ordinances as if such terms were expressly contained within this Agreement.

City hereby grants Company, for a period of ten (10) years from the date hereof, the non-exclusive right to transmit and furnish electric energy for light, heat, power and other purposes for public and private use within and through the limits of City as its boundaries now exist or as they may be extended in the future.  For these purposes, Company may construct, operate, repair and maintain electric distribution system and electric transmission lines, including poles, lines, fixtures, and any other necessary appurtenances in, on, over, under and across the Public Ways and Public Grounds of City.  Company may do all reasonable things necessary or customary to accomplish these purposes, subject, however, to the further provisions of this franchise agreement and subject to compliance with other applicable City Ordinances.

 

Subd.  3.         Restrictions

 

                        A.        Company facilities included in such electric distribution system, transmission lines and appurtenances thereto, shall be located and constructed so as not to interfere with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along and over said Public Ways and so as not to disrupt normal operation of any City Utility System previously installed therein.  Company's construction, operation, repair, maintenance and location of such facilities shall be subject to permits if required by separate ordinance and to other reasonable regulations of the City to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this franchise agreement.  Company may abandon its underground electric facilities in place, provided, at the City’s request, Company will remove abandoned metal or concrete encased conduit interfering with a City improvement project.

 

                        B.        Company shall not construct any new or modified installations within or upon any Public Grounds without receiving the prior written consent of the City Council which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the City Council; provided that, the City will not unreasonably withhold consent to necessary modifications to existing facilities located within Public Grounds.

 

                        C.        In constructing, removing, replacing, repairing, or maintaining said poles, lines, fixtures and appurtenances, Company shall, in all cases, place the Public Ways in, on, under or across which the same are located in as good condition as they were prior to said operation and maintain any restored paved surface in such condition for two years thereafter.  City hereby waives any requirement for Company to post a construction performance bond, certificate of insurance, letter of credit or any other form of security or assurance that may be required, under a separate existing or future ordinance of the City, of a person or entity obtaining the City=s permission to install or maintain facilities in a Public Way.  Company shall also restore Public Grounds to the condition they were in prior to disturbance by the Company.  

 

Subd.  4.         Tree Trimming
 

Company is also granted the permission and authority to trim all shrubs and trees, including roots, in the Public Ways of City to the extent Company finds necessary to avoid interference with the proper construction, operation, repair and maintenance of gas facilities, provided that Company shall save City harmless from any liability in the premises.  Except in emergency situations, Company will provide 24 hours prior written or telephone notice to the City Public Works Department of trimming activities within Public Ways. 

 

Subd.  5.         Service and Rates

 

The service to be provided and the rates to be charged by Company for gas service in City are subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission of this State or its successor agency.

 

Subd.  6.         Relocating

 

                        A.        Whenever City at its cost shall grade, regrade, or change the line of any Public Way, or construct or reconstruct any City Utility System therein and shall, in the proper exercise of its police power, and with due regard to seasonable working conditions, when necessary, and after approval of its final plans have been obtained, order Company to relocate permanently its mains, services, and other property located in said Public Way materially interfering with the City’s planned construction, Company shall relocate its facilities at its own expense.  City shall give Company reasonable notice of plans to grade, regrade or change the line of any Public Way or to construct or reconstruct any City Utility System therein.  However, after Company has so relocated, if a subsequent relocation or relocations shall be ordered within five (5) years from and after first relocation, City shall reimburse Company for such non-betterment relocation expense which Company may incur on a time and material basis; provided, if subsequent relocations are requested because Company facilities materially and necessarily interfere with the extension of a City Utility System to previously unserved areas, Company may be required to relocate at its own expense.    The City may require Company to relocate, facilities within Public Grounds if necessary for an approved public project within said Public Grounds.  However, after Company has so relocated within Public Grounds, if a subsequent relocation or relocations within the same Public Grounds shall be ordered within five (5) years from and after first relocation, City shall reimburse Company for such non-betterment relocation expense.  The City may also require that facilities be relocated from Public Ways and Public Grounds for redevelopment projects completed by the City, its Housing and Redevelopment Authority or other development entity created by the City in the future (i.e. City EDA).  However, after Company has so relocated within Public Ways and/or Public Grounds, if a subsequent relocation or relocations within the same Public Ways or Public Grounds shall be ordered within five (5) years from and after first relocation, City shall reimburse Company for such non-betterment relocation expense.  It is understood and agreed that cost savings to the City is considered a valid reason to require relocation.  The City may, in its discretion, allow the Company to reimburse the City for additional costs incurred by allowing facilities to remain in their current location as an alternative to moving the facilities.  

 

                        B.        The provisions of this franchise shall not be construed to waive or modify any rights obtained by Company for installations within a Company right-of-way acquired by easement or prescriptive right before the applicable Public Way or Public Ground was established, or Company's rights under state or county permit.

 

Subd.  7.         Indemnification

 

                        A.        Company shall indemnify, keep and hold the City free and harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, the issuance of permits, or the operation of the gas facilities located in the Public Ways and Public Grounds.  The City shall not be indemnified for losses or claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or claims arising out of or alleging the City's negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or inspection of, Company's plans or work.  The City shall not be indemnified if the injury or damage results from the performance in a proper manner of acts reasonably deemed hazardous by Company, and such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by City after notice of Company's determination.

 

                        B.        In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances where this agreement to indemnify applies, Company at its sole cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Company within a period wherein Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice.  If Company is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company may not settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City; and Company, in defending any action on behalf of the City shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf.

 

Subd.  8.         Vacation of Public Ways

 

The City shall give Company at least two weeks prior written notice of a proposed vacation of a Public Way.  Except where required solely for a City or City Housing and Redevelopment Authority improvement project, the vacation of any Public Way, after the installation of gas facilities, shall not operate to deprive Company of its rights to operate and maintain such gas facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to Company.  In no case, however, shall the City be liable to pay damages to Company for failure to specifically preserve a right-of-way under Minnesota Statutes, Section 160.29.

 

Subd.  8.         Written Acceptance

 

Company must provide written acknowledgment and acceptance of this Franchise within 30 days of notice to Company of its adoption by the City Council.

 

Subd.  9.         Franchise Fee
 

                        A.        Separate Ordinance.  During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in lieu of any permit or other fees being imposed on the Company for working within Public Ways, the City may impose on the Company a franchise fee.  The franchise fee shall be imposed by a separate ordinance duly adopted by the City.

 

                        B.        Equitable Fee.   The City will use all reasonable efforts to legally collect franchise fees equitably from other providers of energy to the extent the City has the legal authority to do so.

 

Subd.  10.       General Provisions

 

                        A.        Every section, provision, or part of this Ordinance is declared separate from every other section, provision, or part; and if any section, provision, or part shall be held invalid, it shall not affect any other section, provision, or part.  Where a provision of any other City ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail.

 

                        B.        If either party asserts that the other party is in default in the performance of any obligation hereunder, the complaining party shall notify the other party of the default and the desired remedy.  The notification shall be written.  Representatives of the parties must promptly meet and attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute.  If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days of the written notice, the parties may jointly select a mediator to facilitate further discussion.  The parties will equally share the fees and expenses of this mediator.  If a mediator is not used or if the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 days after first meeting with the selected mediator, either party may commence an action in District Court to interpret and enforce this franchise or for such other relief as may be permitted by law or equity for breach of contract, or either party may take any other action permitted by law.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Subdivision shall not apply to questions regarding the City’s ability to require payment of Franchise Fees or the City’s ability to require Company to acknowledge and accept this Franchise.  In the event that the City is required to expend legal fees in enforcing the terms of this Franchise, the City shall be entitled to recoup such fees from Company. 

 

                        C.        This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between the City and Company as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto.

 

                        D.        Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity of this Ordinance.  Any governmental unit succeeding the City shall, without the consent of Company, succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the City provided in this Ordinance.

 

                        E.        Nothing in this Ordinance relieves any person from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging Company's facilities while performing any activity.

 

                        F.         Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent or prohibit the City from adopting other Ordinances generally regulating excavation or other work within Public Ways and/or Public Grounds.  Company shall comply with all such present and future ordinances as if such terms were expressly contained within this Agreement.

 

Subd.  11.       Publication Expense

 

                        The expense of any publication of this franchise Ordinance required by law shall be paid by Company.

City and Cooperative have maintained an existing franchise as articulated in Ordinance No. 604 and look to modify the terms of said franchise and enact a new franchise under this Ordinance. City hereby grants Cooperative, for a period of 10 years from the date passed and approved by the City, the right to transmit and furnish electric energy for light, heat, power and other purposes for public and private use within and through the limits of the City as its boundaries now exist or as they may be extended in the future.

SECTION 3.  LOCATION, OTHER REGULATIONS.

 

            3.1       Location of Facilities.  Electric Facilities shall be located, constructed and maintained so as not to interfere with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel along and over Public Ways and so as not to disrupt normal operation of any City Utility System Electric. Cooperative’s construction, reconstruction, operation, repair, maintenance and location of Electric Facilities shall be subject to permits if required by separate ordinance and to other reasonable regulations of the City to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this franchise agreement.  Cooperative may abandon underground Electric Facilities in place, provided at the City’s request, Cooperative will remove such underground Electric Facilities which interfere with a City improvement project, but only to the extent such Electric Facilities are uncovered by excavation as part of the City improvement project, and restore the Public Way in accordance with Minnesota Rule 7819.1100.

 

            3.2       Field Locations.  Cooperative shall provide field locations for its underground Electric Facilities within City consistent with the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 216D.

 

            3.3       Street Openings.  Cooperative shall not open or disturb any Public Ground or Public Way for any purpose without first having obtained a permit from the City, if required by a separate ordinance, for which the City may impose a reasonable fee.  Permit conditions imposed on Cooperative shall not be more burdensome than those imposed on other utilities for similar facilities or work.  Cooperative may, however, open and disturb any Public Ground or Public Way without permission from the City where an emergency exists requiring the immediate repair of Electric Facilities.  In such event Cooperative shall notify the City by telephone to the office designated by the City as soon as practicable.  Not later than the second working day thereafter, Cooperative shall obtain any required permits and pay any required fees.

 

            3.4       Restoration.  After undertaking any work requiring the opening of any Public Ground or Public Way, Cooperative shall restore the same in accordance with Minnesota Rule 7819.1100, including paving and its foundation, to as good a condition as formerly existed, and shall maintain any paved surface in good condition for two years thereafter.  The work shall be completed as promptly as weather permits.  City hereby waives any requirement for Cooperative to post a construction performance bond, certificate of insurance, letter of credit or any other form of security or assurance that may be required, under a separate existing or future ordinance of the City, of a person or entity obtaining the City’s permission to install, replace or maintain facilities in a Public Way.

 

            3.5       Avoid Damage to Electric Facilities.  Nothing in this Ordinance relieves any person from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid damaging Electric Facilities while performing any activity.

 

            3.6       Notice of Improvements.  No less than four weeks prior to implementation, the City must give Cooperative reasonable notice of plans for improvements to Public Grounds or Public Ways where the City has reason to believe that Electric Facilities may affect or be affected by the improvement.  The notice must contain: (i) the nature and character of the improvements, (ii) the Public Grounds and Public Ways upon which the improvements are to be made, (iii) the extent of the improvements, (iv) the time when the City will start the work, and (v) if more than one Public Ground or Public Way is involved, the order in which the work is to proceed.  The notice must be given to Cooperative within a sufficient length of time in advance of the actual commencement of the work to permit Cooperative to make any necessary additions, alterations or repairs to its Electric Facilities.

 

            3.7       Shared Use of Poles.  Cooperative may have space available on its poles or towers for City fire, water utility, police or other City facilities upon terms and conditions acceptable to Cooperative whenever such use will not interfere with the use of such poles or towers by Cooperative, by another electric utility, by a telephone utility, or by any cable television company or other form of communication company.  In addition, the City shall pay for any added cost incurred by Cooperative because of such use by City.

 

SECTION 4.  RELOCATIONS.

 

            4.1       Relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ways.  If the City determines to vacate a Public Way for a City improvement project, or at City’s cost to grade, regrade, or change the line of any Public Way, or construct or reconstruct any City Utility System in any Public Way, it may order Cooperative to relocate its Electric Facilities located therein if relocation is reasonably necessary to accomplish the City’s proposed public improvement.  Except as provided in Section 4.3, Cooperative shall relocate its Electric Facilities at its own expense.  The City shall give Cooperative reasonable notice of plans to vacate for a City improvement project, or to grade, regrade, or change the line of any Public Way or to construct or reconstruct any City Utility System. If a relocation is ordered within five years of a prior relocation of the same Electric Facilities, which was made at Cooperative expense, the City shall reimburse Cooperative for non-betterment costs on a time and material basis, provided that if a subsequent relocation is required because of the extension of a City Utility System to a previously unserved area, Cooperative may be required to make the subsequent relocation at its expense.  Nothing in this Ordinance requires Cooperative to relocate, remove, replace or reconstruct at its own expense its Electric Facilities where such relocation, removal, replacement or reconstruction is solely for the convenience of the City and is not reasonably necessary for the construction or reconstruction of a Public Way or City Utility System or other City improvement.

 

            4.2       Relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ground.  City, or its Housing and Redevelopment Authority (“HRA”), may require Cooperative, at Cooperative’s expense, to relocate or remove its Electric Facilities from Public Ground upon a finding by City or HRA that the Electric Facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment to the existing or proposed public use of the Public Ground.

 

4.3       Projects with Federal Funding.  City, or its HRA, shall not order Cooperative to remove or relocate its Electric Facilities when a Public Way is vacated, improved or realigned for a right-of-way project or any other project which is financially subsidized in whole or in part by the Federal Government or any agency thereof, unless the reasonable non-betterment costs of such relocation are first paid to Cooperative.  The City is obligated to pay Cooperative only for those portions of its relocation costs for which City has received federal funding specifically allocated for relocation costs in the amount requested by the Cooperative, which allocated funding the City shall specifically request.  Relocation, removal or rearrangement of any Cooperative Electric Facilities made necessary because of a federally-aided highway project shall be governed by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Section 161.46, as supplemented or amended.  It is understood that the rights herein granted to Cooperative are valuable rights. 

 

4.4       No Waiver.   The provisions of this franchise apply only to facilities constructed in reliance on a franchise from the City and shall not be construed to waive or modify any rights obtained by Cooperative for installations within a Cooperative right-of-way acquired by easement or prescriptive right before the applicable Public Ground or Public Way was established, or Cooperative's rights under state or county permit.

 

SECTION 5.  TREE TRIMMING.

 

Cooperative may trim all trees and shrubs in the Public Grounds and Public Ways of City to the extent Cooperative finds necessary to avoid interference with the proper construction, operation, repair and maintenance of any Electric Facilities installed hereunder, provided that Cooperative shall save the City harmless from any liability arising therefrom, and subject to permit or other reasonable regulation by the City.

 

SECTION 6.  INDEMNIFICATION. 

 

            6.1       Indemnity of City.  Cooperative shall indemnify, keep and hold the City free and harmless from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, the issuance of permits, or the operation of the Electric Facilities located in the Public Grounds and Public Ways.  The City shall not be indemnified for losses or claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or claims arising out of or alleging the City's negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or inspection of, Cooperative's plans or work.  The City shall not be indemnified if the injury or damage results from the performance in a proper manner, of acts reasonably deemed hazardous by Cooperative, and such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by City after notice of Cooperative's determination.

 

            6.2       Defense of City.  In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances where this agreement to indemnify applies, Cooperative at its sole cost and expense shall defend the City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Cooperative within a period wherein Cooperative is not prejudiced by lack of such notice.  If Cooperative is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Cooperative may not settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the City and Cooperative, in defending any action on behalf of the City, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf.

 

SECTION 7.  VACATION OF PUBLIC WAYS.

 

The City shall give Cooperative at least two weeks prior written notice of a proposed vacation of a Public Way.  Except where required for a City or HRA improvement project, the vacation of any Public Way, after the installation of Electric Facilities, shall not operate to deprive Cooperative of its rights to operate and maintain such Electric Facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to Cooperative.  In no case, however, shall City be liable to Cooperative for failure to specifically preserve a right-of-way under Minnesota Statutes, Section 160.29. In accordance with Minnesota Rules, Part 7819.3200, if City’s order directing vacation of the Public Way does not require relocation of Cooperative’s Electric Facilities, the vacation proceeding shall not be deemed to deprive Cooperative of its right to continue to use the right-of-way of the former Public Way for its Electric Facilities installed prior to such order of vacation.

 

 

SECTION 8.  CHANGE IN FORM OF GOVERNMENT.

 

Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity of this Ordinance. Any governmental unit succeeding the City shall, without the consent of Cooperative, succeed to all of the rights and obligations of the City provided in this Ordinance. 

 

SECTION 9.  FRANCHISE FEE.

 

9.1       Fee Schedule. City currently imposes a franchise fee articulated in Ordinance No. 604. During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in lieu of any permit or other fees being imposed on Cooperative, the City shall continue to impose on Cooperative a franchise fee by collecting the amounts indicated in a Fee Schedule. Any revision shall be set forth in a separate ordinance with a revised Fee Schedule from each customer in the designated Cooperative Member Class.  The parties have agreed that the franchise fee collected by the Cooperative and paid to the City in accordance with this Section 9 shall not exceed 4% of the Cooperative’s Gross Revenues, as hereinafter defined, by collecting the amounts calculated on a flat fee basis. 

 

9.2       Separate Ordinance.  Any revision to the franchise fee shall be imposed by a separate ordinance duly adopted by the City Council, and that separate ordinance shall dictate the date upon which collection of that revised franchise fee shall commence.  Section 2.5 shall constitute the sole remedy for solving disputes between Cooperative and the City in regard to the interpretation of, or enforcement of, the separate ordinance

 

            9.3       Terms Defined. For the purpose of this Section 9, the following definitions apply:

 

9.3.1 “Member Class” shall refer to the classes listed on the Fee Schedule as defined or determined in Cooperative’s electric rate schedules.

 

9.3.2 “Fee Schedule” refers to the schedule in Section 9.1 setting forth the various member classes from which a franchise fee would be collected if a separate ordinance were implemented immediately after the effective date of this franchise agreement.  The Fee Schedule in the separate ordinance may include new Member Class added by Cooperative to its electric tariffs after the effective date of this franchise agreement, or may be annually amended to reflect changes in the franchise fees imposed by the City.

 

9.3.3  “Gross Revenue” means all sums, excluding any surcharge or similar addition to the Cooperative’s charges to members for the purpose of reimbursing the Cooperative for the cost resulting from the franchise fee, received by the Cooperative from the sale of electricity to its retail members within the corporate limits of the City.

 

                        9.4       Collection of the Fee.  The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly and shall be based on the amount collected by Cooperative during complete billing months during the period for which payment is to be made by imposing a surcharge equal to the designated franchise fee for the applicable member classification in all member billings for electric service in each class.  The payment shall be due the last business day of the month following the period for which the payment is made.  The franchise fee may be changed by ordinance from time to time; however, each change shall meet the same notice requirements and not occur more often than annually and no change shall require a collection from any member for electric service in excess of the amounts specifically permitted by this Section 9.  No franchise fee shall be payable by Cooperative if Cooperative is legally unable to first collect an amount equal to the franchise fee from its members in each applicable class of members by imposing a surcharge in Cooperative’s applicable rates for electric service.  Cooperative may pay the City the fee based upon the surcharge billed subject to subsequent reductions to account for uncollectible, refunds and correction of erroneous billings.  Cooperative agrees to make its records available for inspection by the City at reasonable times provided that the City and its designated representative agree in writing not to disclose any information which would indicate the amount paid by any identifiable member or members or any other information regarding identified members.  In addition, the Cooperative agrees to provide at the time of each payment a statement summarizing how the franchise fee payment was determined, including information showing any adjustments to the total surcharge billed in the period for which the payment is being made to account for any uncollectible, refunds or error corrections.

 

                        9.5       Equivalent Fee Requirement.  The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be effective against Cooperative unless it lawfully imposes and the City quarterly or more often collects a fee or tax of the same or greater equivalent amount on the receipts from sales of energy within the City by any other energy supplier, provided that, as to such a supplier, the City has the authority to require a franchise fee or to impose a tax.  The “same or greater equivalent amount” shall be measured, if practicable, by comparing amounts collected as a franchise fee from each similar customer, or by comparing, as to similar customers the percentage of the annual bill represented by the amount collected for franchise fee purposes.  The franchise fee or tax shall be applicable to energy sales for any energy use related to heating, cooling or lighting, or to run machinery and appliances, but shall not apply to energy sales for the purpose of providing fuel for vehicles.  If the Cooperative specifically consents in writing to a franchise or separate ordinance collecting or failing to collect a fee from another energy supplier in contravention of this Section 9.5, the foregoing conditions will be waived to the extent of such written consent.

SECTION      3.62     MONITORING.

 

Subd.  1.         Monitoring Facilities.  When required by the City's Permit, the Permittee of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control structure, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation sampling, flow measurement, and measurement of the wastes.  Such structure and equipment when required shall be constructed at the owner's expense in accordance with plans approved by the City and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times.  The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the Director may when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed elsewhere.

 

Subd.  2.         Flow Measurement.  A Permittee, when required by Permit, shall install and maintain a flow measurement device for instantaneous rate and/or cumulative flow volume determinations.  Metered water supply may be used in lieu of flow measurement devices if it can be documented that the water usage and waste discharge are the same, or where a measurable adjustment to the metered supply can be made to determine the waste volume.

 

Meters and flow records shall be maintained at the Permittee's expense in good operating condition at all times.  The Permittee shall notify the Director in writing within five (5) days in the event that the Permittee becomes aware that the meter or flow recorder has failed to accurately register the flow.  The Permittee shall also notify the Director of the Permittee's intention to alter the installation of a meter or flow recorder so as to affect the accurate recording of industrial waste entering the POTW.

 

Subd.  3.         Self-Monitoring Analyses.

The rules and regulations and water rates hereinafter named, and all amendments thereof, shall be considered a part of the contract with every person, company, or corporation who is supplied with water through the waterworks system of this municipality and every person, company or corporation by taking water therefrom, shall be considered as expressing his, her, their, or its consent to be bound thereby.

 

Subd.  2.         Water Rates and Billing.  The rates due and payable to the City by each owner within the City for water taken from the water supply system shall be set forth in the City’s Fee Schedule.  Water bills shall be mailed bimonthly.  Bills shall be mailed to the owner of the property or the owner’s duly authorized property manager at the designated billing address and shall specify the water consumed and the charge in accordance with the rates set forth in the City’s Fee Schedule.  Property owners must pay the total amount set forth in the bill on or before the due date listed on the bill.  All charges shall be the obligation of the property owner as shown on records of the County Auditor.  Failure to make payment by the due date listed on the bill will result in a late fee assessment as set forth in the City’s Fee Schedule.

 

Subd.  3.         Delinquent Water Accounts. 

 

(a)    Delinquent Water Accounts.

(b)   Disconnection of Service.  It shall be the duty of the Finance Department to endeavor to promptly collect delinquent accounts, and in all cases where satisfactory arrangements for payment have not been made, the City reserves the right to discontinue service by shutting off the water at the stop box.  However, if the discontinuance of water service would affect the primary heat source for a residential unit , no shut-off may occur, except in the case of an emergency situation or threat to the water supply if:

 

1)      the disconnection would occur during the period between October 15 and April 15; and

 

2)      the owner has declared inability to pay on forms provided by the Finance Department; and

 

3)      the household income of the owner is less than 185 percent of the federal poverty level, as documented by the property owner to the Finance Department; and

 

4)      the account is current for the billing period immediately prior to October 15 or the owner has entered into a payment schedule and is reasonably current with payments under the schedule.

 

(c)    Notice of Disconnection and Opportunity to be Heard.  Before disconnection of service to a residential unit reasonable notice by mail shall be provided to the property owner and any occupant of the property at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of disconnection.  The notice will include:

1)      the telephone number and address of the Finance Department  and that the property owner or resident will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard prior to the intended disconnection;

 

2)      the reason for the intended disconnection;

 

3)      the date on which the intended disconnection is to occur,

 

4)      the amount past due, as well as the amount currently owing on the account, including applicable late fees, service charges and penalties;

 

5)      whether or not any security deposit will be required to maintain uninterrupted service and the amount of that security deposit;

 

6)      that the Finance Department will accept payment at any time during business hours prior to termination;

 

7)      during the period of October 15 and April 15, where the property owner has notified the City that discontinuance of water service would affect the primary heat source for a residential unit on the property, the notice must include a written explanation of the owner’s rights and responsibilities, a list of local energy assistance providers, and any other opportunities to secure continued service.

 

(d)   Discontinuance of Service to Accounts Affecting Tenants.  Where the property owner has rented out the property for residential purposes and the delinquent water account has or will result in a discontinuation of service, the tenant or group of tenants may pay the amount due and owing on the account along with any applicable administrative charge, late fee, penalty and security deposit required to maintain uninterrupted service.  This payment may qualify as a rent payment pursuant to the provisions of Minn. Stat. 504B.215.

 

(e)    Cold Weather Months.  During the period of October 15 and April 15, no disconnection of water service that would affect the primary heat source for a residential unit may occur if all of the criteria set forth in subsection (b) (1-4) are present until at least twenty (20) days after the mailing of the notice of disconnection or fifteen (15) days after the notice has been personally served on the owner.  If there is no response to the notice, the Public Works Department must serve the notice on any residential occupant of the property served or post the notice at the property.  The disconnection must not occur on a Friday or on the day before a holiday.  If prior to the disconnection the owner or occupant appeals to the Finance Department, that appellant must be given ten (10) days to provide documentation and written argument to the Finance Department relevant to the proposed disconnection.  Within ten (10) days of its receipt of these documents, the Finance Department shall make a determination of whether or not to disconnect water service based upon the owner’s ability to pay, effect on the primary heat source for the residential unit, the owner’s payment history on this account and other City accounts, and whether or not a payment plan would constitute a viable alternative to disconnection.  Ten (10) day written notice of the determination must be provided to the owner and occupant of the property prior to any disconnection.

 

(f)    Assessment of Delinquent Accounts.  All delinquent accounts shall become an assessment and shall be certified to the County Auditor in accordance with section 3.80 of the City Code.

 

 

(g)   Re-connection After Disconnection for Non-Payment.  Prior to reconnection of water service following disconnection for non-payment, the total amount due and owing for all City utilities must be paid, as well as all service charges, late fees and penalties associated therewith.

 

(h)   Authority to Establish Guidelines.  The City’s Finance Director, in consultation with the Public Works Director, shall have the authority to adopt, implement, revise and maintain internal policies and procedures consistent with this ordinance for the purpose of specifying the manner of: establishing and maintaining utility accounts; utility billing; handling delinquent utility accounts; and the appropriateness and manner of discontinuing and reconnecting water service.

 

Subd.  4.         More Than One User.  When more than one tenant is supplied through one service pipe the application for supplying such building or tenants shall be made by the owner of the premises; said owner, or his or her successor in interest shall be held liable and responsible to the City for all water supplied through said service pipe notwithstanding any contract between the Lesser  and tenant as to assumption of the water billing, as but one bill will be made, and the rate of each tenant will be the same as for a separate house.

 

Subd.  5.         Resale or Non-Metered Use Prohibited.  No consumer shall supply water to another nor suffer others to take water off his or her premises unless such arrangements are approved in writing by the Public Water Superintendent and separate meters are used.

 

Subd.  6.         Inspection.  Every tenant taking water shall permit the Public Works Superintendent, or his or her duly authorized agent, at all reasonable hours to enter their premises or buildings to examine the pipes and fixtures and the manner in which the water is used, and they must at all times frankly and without concealment answer all questions put to them relative to the consumption of water.

 

Subd.  7.         Responsibility for Freezing, Breakage, or Supply.  It is expressly stipulated that no claim shall be made against this municipality by reason of the breaking or freezing of any service pipe or service cock, nor if from any cause the supply of water shall fail, nor from the damage arising from shutting off water to repair the mains making the connection or extension, nor for any other purpose that may be deemed necessary.  The costs of repair of any service pipe from the corporation stop, through users premises, shall be the responsibility of the service user, in any and all events, and all repairs including restoration shall be made in accordance with this and other applicable regulations of the City the same as if original installation.  Property owners are required, at the property owner’s expense, to replace all service pipe with copper pipe for the entire length of the water line from the structure on the property to the street main at the time any repair or replacement is made to any part of a service water line.

 

Subd.  8.         Reserved Shut-Off Rights.

Subd.  9.         Conditions Before Turning On Water.  Water will not be turned on to any building or private service pipe until the applicant shall have paid for the connection from the street main to the street line and also the water rent for the current term.

 

Subd.  10.       Plumbers Prohibited From Turning On Water.  All plumbers are strictly prohibited from turning water into any service pipe except upon the order or permission of the Public Works Superintendent or his duly authorized agent.  This rule shall not be construed to prevent any licensed plumber from admitting water to test pipes and for that purpose only.

 

Subd.  11.       Sprinkling.  The right is reserved to suspend the use of fountains and hose for sprinkling streets, yards and gardens whenever in the opinion of the Council the public necessity demands it.

The fine shall double with each subsequent offense occurring in the same calendar year to a maximum of $200.00.

 

Subd. 15.        Mandatory Connection to Water Facilities

 

A.                Connections required.  The owner of any building or property located within the

City, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the City, and in which wastewater is

produced or from which wastewater is discharged, shall be required to connect to

the City’s public water service at the property owner’s expense within one year of

the availability of service within the City, except as provided in subdivision

15(B) of this ordinance.  Service is considered “available” to a structure or

property when constructed  adjacent to, including within any utility easement

adjacent to, the property upon which the structure is located.  The City will

provide property owners with written notice that water service is available to the

property.

 

B.                 Extension of Time to Connect.  The City Council may adopt policies by resolution

or enter into agreements with property owners providing for extensions to the one-year mandatory connection requirement of subdivision 15(A), if the property has an existing private well that is in compliance with all applicable standards and regulations.  Nothing in this subdivision shall obligated the City to grant any extension to the mandatory connection requirement of subdivision 15 (A).

 

C.                 Annexed Properties.  In addition to the provisions of subdivision 15(B), existing

structures that are annexed into the City, from which wastewater is produced, or from which wastewater is discharged, shall connect to the public water service within five years of the date of the annexation, so long as service is available to the annexed property on the date of annexation, and so long as any private well providing water to the structure is in compliance with all applicable standards and regulations at the time of annexation.  For properties where public water service is not available on the date of annexation, but is later made available to the property, structures shall connect to the City’s public water service in accordance with subdivision 15(A).

 

D.                New structures and redeveloped properties.  Notwithstanding any other

subdivision of this Ordinance or any other provision of the City Code, all new structures constructed on property within the City to which public water service is available shall be required to connect to the City’s public water service.  In addition, all existing structures on property within the City to which public water service is available shall be required to connect to the City’s public water service.

Subd. 16.        Cross-connection to private water supply prohibited.  No water pipe of the City

                        Water supply system shall be connected with an pump, well or tank that is

                        Connected with any other source of water supply.  When any such connection is

                        Found, the Public Works Department shall notify the owner to sever the

                        Connection and if this is not done immediately, the City shall turn off the water

                        Supply forthwith.  Before any new connection to the City’s public water facilities

                        is permitted, the Public Works Department shall ascertain that no cross-

                        connection will exist when the new connection is made.

 

Subd. 17.        Enforcement.  In the event of a violation or threatened violation of any of the

                        terms of this Ordinance, the City may take appropriate action to enforce this

                        Ordinance, including application for injunctive relief, action to compel

                        performance or other appropriate action to court if necessary to prevent, restrain,

                        correct, or abate such violations or threatened violations.  Upon motion, the court

                        may award costs, disbursements and reasonable attorney’s fees and witness fees,

                        which costs and fees can be assessed against the property.  In addition, if any

                        property fails to connect to the City’s public water facilities as required by this

                        Ordinance, the City may charge a monthly service charge to the property as

                        though the property owner had complied with the connection requirement.  The

                        rights of the City under this subdivision shall be in addition to any other remedial

                        or enforcement provisions provided for by other law or ordinance.

 

Subd. 18         Testing of Private Wells Required.  It shall be the responsibility of all property

                        owners not connected to the City’s public water service and using private water

                        wells to test the water well annually for coliform bacteria and nitrates. 

                        Verification of testing and the testing results shall be provided to the Public

                        Works Director no later than September 30 of each year.  The testing required

                        by this ordinance shall be done by a laboratory certified by the

                        Minnesota Department of Health.

 

 

SECTIONS 3.71 THRU 3.79 RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE

 

 

SECTION         3.80  SEWER AND WATER USE, AVAILABILITY, AND CONNECTION CHARGES.
 

Subd. 1.          Purpose and Policy.  This ordinance sets forth a uniform system for charges and user fees for the procurement, operations, maintenance and replacement of the Sauk Rapids Sanitary Sewer Facilities and Municipal Water Facilities.  The objectives of this ordinance are:

 

a)  To provide a system of charges and/or assessments to existing users of the existing facilities and initial users of the expanded facilities in order to recover capital costs associated with procurement of the facilities and the providing of wastewater and water treatment within the City;

 

b)  To provide a system of user fees or charges in order to pay for the operation and maintenance, debt service, replacement and improvements of the Sauk Rapids Sanitary Sewer Facilities and Municipal Water Facilities, the user charges provided for in this section are hereby levied and assessed upon each parcel of land, building or premises having any connection with, or discharging either directly or indirectly into the sewer system or connection with either directly or indirectly to the water system.  Costs for use of the Sauk Rapids Sanitary Sewer Facility on the basis of Flow, BOD, SS, and any other pollutant taking into consideration the cost of collection and treatment of such sewage, and may increase or decrease such unit cost as often and in such amounts as may reasonably be required to accomplish the purposes of this section.

 

 

c)  To provide a system of charges and/or assessments to future users of both the existing and expanded facilities in order to recover and offset the capital costs of procurement of the facilities and the availability of services; and

 

d)  To provide a system of area or trunk charges to developing areas of the City in order to recover and offset the capital costs of collection and conveyance infrastructure which will ultimately serve the developing areas.

 

Subd. 2.          Sewer Availability and Water Availability Charges.  Prior to the time a connection is made to the Sanitary Sewer Facilities and the Municipal Water Facilities, each user shall either pay or be subject to sewer availability (SAC) and water availability (WAC) charges for the costs of constructing, operating, maintaining and replacing the certain Sewer and Water Facilities, including, but not limited to, water and wastewater treatment facilities, pumps, lift stations, holding tanks and other appurtenances to collect, convey and treat water and wastewater within the City.  The sewer availability and water availability charges shall be established in the City's Fee Schedule.  The sewer availability and water availability charges shall be paid prior to the time a connection is made as established in the City's Fee Schedule, unless converted to a special assessment by the consent of the property owner and the agreement of the City.  For newly platted property within the City, payment of the sewer availability and water availability charges may be made payable at a later date to be determined by the City as part of a development agreement for the property between the City and the Developer. 

 

Subd. 3.          Main Line and Service Line Charges.  Prior to the time a connection is made to the Sanitary Sewer Facilities and the Municipal Water Facilities, each user shall either pay or be subject to charges for the costs of constructing the water and sanitary sewer main lines and water and sanitary sewer service lines serving the property.  The main line and service line charges shall be established in the City's Fee Schedule.  The main line and service line charges shall be paid prior to the time a connection is made, unless converted to a special assessment by the consent of the property owner and the agreement of the City.

 

Subd. 4.          Area Trunk Charges.  Each tract of property within the City which is zoned for residential, commercial or industrial development, or is presented to the City for development as a Planned Unit Development, shall be subject to area trunk charges to pay the proportionate share of the increased costs of the Sanitary Sewer Facilities and Water Facilities, due to the construction of trunk lines or over-capacity constructed into the facilities to allow for future development of property or expansion of service.  The area trunk charges shall be payable at the time any subdivision of the property or at the time of requesting a building permit on the property, whichever occurs sooner, unless converted to a special assessment by the consent of the property owner and the agreement of the City.  For newly platted property within the City, payment of the area trunk charges may be made payable at a later date to be determined by the City as part of a development agreement for the property between the City and the Developer.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ordinance, area trunk charges shall not apply to property located west of State Highway 10 and South of State Highway 15 and which was platted and had an individual parcel identification number as of October 9, 2001.  The intent of this provision is to exclude existing structures and land uses on properties located west of State Highway 10 and South of State Highway 15 from payment of area trunk charges.  Properties located west of State Highway 10 and South of State Highway 15 that are newly platted, re-platted, developed or redeveloped after October 9, 2001 shall, however, be subject to area trunk charges in accordance with subdivision 5 of this ordinance.

 

Subd. 5.          Change in Use of Property.  In the event any property within the City is redeveloped, or any change in the use or in the intensity of the use of the property occurs such that the redevelopment or change in use results in an increase in demand on the use of the City's Sanitary Sewer Facilities and the Municipal Water Facilities, the City, at the time of platting, rezoning or other land use approval, or issuance of a building permit for the redevelopment or change in use, whichever occurs sooner, shall determine the appropriate area trunk charges and sewer availability and water availability charges based on the redevelopment or change in use in accordance with this ordinance and the City's Fee Schedule.  The new area trunk charges and availability charges, as calculated in accordance with this section and after deducting the amount of any area trunk charges or availability charges previously paid for the property, shall be paid at the time of platting, rezoning or other land use approval, or issuance of a building permit for the redevelopment or change in use, whichever occurs sooner. 

 

Subd. 6.          Meter Use and Installation.  As a condition of connecting to City water, all water use shall be metered and said meters shall be set with the stop and waste valve at least twelve (12) inches, but no more than thirty-six (36) inches, above the floor in the room designated for the location of utilities and in which the ceiling is no less than seven (7) feet, six (6) inches in height.  The meter shall also be installed with a circular obstruction-free area with a radius of eighteen (18) inches so that the meter can be examined, serviced, and read and provided with suitable protection so that they are made safe from frost and other damage. A wall or other support for the meter and piping shall not be considered an obstruction. The meter may not be installed in any manner or location differing from the above standards without prior approval of the Public Works Superintendent.  In case of refusal and neglect to set or protect a meter as herein required the Public Works Superintendent or its duly authorized agent shall refuse to turn on water, or if water has been turned on it shall be turned off until the consumer shall have complied with said requirements. Existing meters shall be exempt from obstruction-free area and height requirements, but must be brought into compliance by the owner when plumbing work by the owner requires replacement or relocation of the meter, or if the Public Works Superintendent determines that the meter is a safety issue for City personnel.

 

Subd. 7.          Meter Maintenance/Replacement.  Where repair or replacement is made necessary by act or neglect of the owner or occupant of the premises it serves, any City expense caused thereby shall be charged against and collected from the water consumer, and water service may be discontinued until the cause is corrected and the amount charged is paid.

Subd. 8.          Meter Testing.  When a consumer complains that the bill for any past service is excessive, the City shall have the meter reread on request.  Such adjustment, if any, shall not extend back more than one quarter billing period from the date of the written request.

Subd. 9.          Metered Lawn Sprinkler Systems for Commercial Accounts.  All commercial accounts shall have a sprinkler system tee installed just past the shut off valve inside the building.  This tee will allow the addition of a separate water meter for lawn sprinkler systems.  If the property owner elects to meter their sprinkler system, the separate meter shall be purchased at the property owner’s expense from the City and installed under the supervision of the Superintendent of Public Works.

The REF for Land Uses not listed above shall be determined by the City Engineer based on probable hydrologic response.

 

D.  Unit Rate.  “Unit Rate”, referred to herein as “UR”, is the rate in dollars per acre to be charged per one (1) REF.

 

Subd. 4.  Rates and Charges.

 

A.  Establishing Unit Rates: The City Council shall from time to time, by resolution, establish the Unit Rate for each REF. The Unit Rate so established shall be on file with the City Administrator/Clerk and shall be used to compute the charges for a given parcel of land based on the following formula:

 

Storm Water Charges = (UR) x (REF) x (SA)

 

B.  Standardized Charges.  The following rules shall apply for the purpose of simplifying and equalizing charges:

 

(1)  A standard Surface Area of 0.28 acres shall be used for detached single-family homes and for patio homes.

 

(2)  A standard Surface Area of 0.28 acres for each unit shall be used in computing storm water charges for the following multi-family dwellings: duplexes, twin homes, townhouses, and detached townhouses. (For example, a parcel that contains four townhouse units shall have a Surface Area computed as follows:  4 units x 0.28 acres/unit = 1.12 acres).

 

(3)  Parcels subject to these standardized charges shall not be eligible for Adjustments to Charges or Adjustments to Area as set forth elsewhere herein.

 

            C.  Adjustments (Credits) to charges.   A system of credits, which may reduce the stormwater charge that is imposed, as provided for above, is hereby established.  A credit shall be granted for developed or undeveloped property pursuant to the rules provided for herein.  The city engineer shall, pursuant to the rules provided for herein, grant a credit to those owners or non-owner users of properties, against which stormwater charges are imposed, who employ structural or non-structural BMPs or other stormwater management practices on-site that significantly reduce the quantity or improve the quality of stormwater runoff from their property that enters the system.  The city engineer shall propose rules providing guidelines for the awarding of credits.  The Council shall approve, or approve as modified, these rules for the awarding of credits. The rules shall be consistent with this section.

 

   The City Council may by resolution adopt policies providing for the adjustment of charges for parcels or groups of parcels based upon hydrologic response substantially different from the REF being used for the parcel or parcels.  Such adjustment shall be made only after receiving the recommendation of the City Engineer, and shall not be made effective retroactively.  If the adjustment would have the effect of changing the REF for all or substantially all of the land uses in a particular classification, such adjustment shall be accomplished by amending the REF table in Subdivision 2 of this ordinance.

 

D.  Adjustment to Area.   The total parcel area as shown in the City Assessor’s records will be used to calculate the Surface Area for a given parcel, except that apparent errors in the recorded values may be subject to recalculation by the City. It is the responsibility of the owner or manager of any parcel to provide the City with necessary surveys, and other information as the City may reasonably request, to determine if a parcel, or portion of a parcel, qualifies for an exception or area adjustment.  Requests for exceptions and/or area adjustments will be reviewed after receipt of all requested information.  Exceptions and/or adjustments must be approved by the City Engineer and Public Works Director, and shall become effective the beginning of the next billing cycle following approval.

 

E.  Exceptions. The following land uses are exempt from the Storm Water Utility Fees established herein: 1) public street right-of-way, 2) wetlands and public waters as defined by state law, 3) ponds designated and used exclusively for storm water retention or treatment purposes up to the 100-year flood elevation, 4) undeveloped parcels, 5) publicly-owned park lands, natural areas, and recreational fields, 6) railroad right-of-way, 7) cemeteries, 8) and unsewered parcels situated within the AG (Agricultural) zoning district of the City.

 

F.  Falsification of Information. Willful failure to provide information that the City may reasonably request related to the use, development and area of a premise, or falsification of such information, shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance.

 

G.  Estimated Charges. If, for any reason, precise information related to the use, development or area of a premises is not available, then Storm Water Utility Charges for such premise shall be estimated, and billed, based upon information then available to the City.

 

H.  Billing Method. Storm Water Utility Fees will be computed and collected by the City together with other City utility fees, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.80, Subd. 5, of this Code.

 

I.  Delinquent Accounts. Delinquent and unpaid storm water utility fees may be certified to the County Auditor for collection with real estate taxes during the following year or any year thereafter in the manner prescribed in Section 3.80, Subd. 10, of this Code, pursuant to Minnesota Statute 444.075, Subdivision 3.

 

J.  Appeal:  If a property owner believes that the fee charged a particular property is incorrect, she/he may request review and re-computation of said fee.

                                                A.        This section requires a license to operate a commercial auction house, and requires registration for all auctioneers who function at a commercial auction house.

 

                                                B.        It is the intention of this section that no persons or business shall sell or offer for sale at public auction any property, article or thing within the corporate limits of this municipality, without first obtaining an auction license under and pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter.

 

                                                C.        It is the express purpose of this section to exempt from municipal licensing requirements, auctions conducted by auctioneers when conducted on the premises of a private party for auctioning of merchandise owned by that private party for at least (6) months.

 

                                                D.        It is further provided that sales made by the virtue of legal process, or otherwise exempt by Minnesota Statute, shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.

 

                                                E.        A commercial auction house is hereby defined as one where the auction is held within a commercial structure or other building or site.  Said site may include a parcel of property on which is sold merchandise transported in for sale from a semi-trailer truck or tent or other such appurtenances.  This shall be distinguished from a private party sale, of merchandise owned by private individuals for six (6) months or longer. The reason for the distinction between types of auctions in this section is that commercial auction houses have been demonstrated to be of such a nature that stolen goods may be disposed of in the course of the business operation.  For this reason, this section provides for inspection of the goods, wares, and merchandise on the premises by the Police Department.

 

Subd.              2.         Auctioneers shall provide evidence that they are licensed by the State of Minnesota and in compliance with M.S. Chapter 330.

The Bond so supplied may be the same as that provided to the county under M.S. Chapter 330.

                 

Subd.              4.         Insurance.  The applicant/licensee is required to have in full force and effect, a policy of liability insurance.  The liability insurance policy shall provide that it is noncancellable without twenty (20) days notice to the City of Sauk Rapids, and the coverage shall be for at least the term of the license.  Each license under this Section shall terminate upon termination of the required insurance coverage, or earlier as provided by this Section.  Unless otherwise provided, a required liability insurance policy shall provide for protection in at least the sum of $300,000 for injury and for property damage.

 

Subd.              5.         Fees.  The auction license fee shall be in the sum determined by Council Resolution.  There will be no fee charged for the auctioneer registration.

SECTION      4.07     TOBACCO SALES

 

Subd. 1.          Purpose.  Because the City recognizes that many persons under the age of eighteen (18) years purchase or otherwise obtain, possess, and use tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco related devices, and such sales, possession, and use are violations of both State and Federal laws and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government, this ordinance is intended to regulate the sale, possession, and use of tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco related devices for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products, and tobacco related devices, and to further the official public policy of the State of Minnesota in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in Minn. Stat. §144.391. The City also recognizes similar concerns related to minors and electronic-smoking devices that are only minimally regulated by State and Federal laws, and has determined that the same City regulations that apply to traditional tobacco products should also apply to electronic smoking devices.

The request for a renewal shall be made at least thirty days but no more than sixty days before the expiration of the current license. The issuance of a license issued under this ordinance shall be considered a privilege and not an absolute right of the applicant and shall not entitle the holder to an automatic renewal of the license.

 

Subd. 4.          Fees.  No license shall be issued under this ordinance until the appropriate license fee shall be paid in full.  The fee for a license under this ordinance shall be paid in accordance with Resolution No. 84-4, as amended, which sets the fee for all licenses and permits. 

 

Subd. 5.          Basis for Denial of License.

Subd. 2.          Purpose.  The City Council finds that pawnbrokers, precious metal dealers, and secondhand goods dealers potentially provide an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment because such businesses have the ability to receive and transfer stolen property easily and quickly. The City Council also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers, precious metal dealers, and secondhand goods dealers.  The purpose of this ordinance is to prevent these businesses from being used as facilities for the commission of crimes and to assure that they comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City.

 

Subd.  3.         License Required.

 

            A.        License.  No person shall engage in or carry on the business of a pawnbroker, precious metal dealer, or secondhand goods dealer or portray themselves as such, without a license issued by the City of Sauk Rapids for each and every separate office or place of business operated by such licensee in the City.  Any pawn transaction made without benefit of a license is void.

 

            B.        Single Location.  A license under this section shall authorize the licensee to carry on business only at the permanent place of business designated in the license.

            C.        Additional Licenses.  A pawnbroker may not operate or engage in the business of secondhand goods dealer without having obtained a secondhand goods dealer license in addition to a pawnbroker*s license.  A precious metal dealer may not operate or engage in the business of secondhand goods without having obtained a secondhand goods dealer*s license.

Subd.  4.         Multiple Dealers.  The owners of a business, at which two or more secondhand goods dealers are engaged in business by maintaining separate sales and identifying themselves to the public as individual dealers, may obtain a multiple secondhand goods dealer license for that location. A multiple license may not be issued unless the following requirements are met:

 

            A.        The business must have a single name and address;

 

            B.        The business must operate in a compact and contiguous space as specified in the license;

 

            C.        The business must be under the unified control and supervision of the one person who holds the license;

 

            D.        Sales must be consummated at a central point of register operated by the owner or manager of the business and the owner must maintain a comprehensive account of all sales; and

In computing the tax to be collected as a result of any transaction, any amount of tax less than one-half of one cent may be disregarded and amounts of tax one-half cent or more may be considered an additional cent.

Subd. 4.  Permit Review.  The application will be submitted to the Police Department, Fire Department, and Community Development Director for review and comment regarding the health, welfare and safety of the public before submission to the City Council.  City staff must review the suitability of the proposed Sidewalk Café area in light of the applicable fire, building and life safety codes, zoning ordinances, past performance of the applicant in maintaining order and obeying applicable laws, the adequacy of the proposal to provide for the safety of persons on the proposed premises, impact on the surrounding land, adequacy of lighting, appropriateness of noise level, suitability of ingress and egress arrangements and safety arrangements.  An application may be denied based on the following nonexclusive list of factors:

Subd. 5.  Site Plan.  Each application shall contain a drawing of the proposed Sidewalk Cafe area. The application shall also include the dimensions of the area and a detailed description of the seating and tables and any barriers or equipment proposed for the area, including plant tubs. 

 

Subd. 6.  Restrictions.  The following restrictions shall apply to each permit issued pursuant to this Section 4.26.  The Council may impose additional reasonable restrictions to protect the public health, safety or welfare or to prevent a nuisance from developing or continuing.

 

(a)    Each permit shall specify the area in which such sidewalk café may be operated, provided that no sale or service shall be permitted it any portion of the street designated for vehicular travel.

 

(b)   Issuance of a permit shall not be construed as authorizing any permanent installation to be placed in the public way.

 

(c)    The use of a portion of the public sidewalk as a sidewalk cafe shall not be an exclusive use.  All public improvements and maintenance, including but not limited to, trees, light poles, traffic signals or manholes, or any public-initiated maintenance procedures, shall take the precedence over said use of the public sidewalk at all times.

 

(d)   No sidewalk cafe shall be permitted in any portion of the public sidewalk where normal pedestrian traffic flow is obstructed.  A minimum clearance width of forty-eight inches must be maintained on the public sidewalk at all times.

 

(e)    Tables, chairs and any other furnishings shall be secured during any period when the sidewalk cafe is not open and being operated.  The tables, chairs, and any other furnishings shall be removed from the area used for the sidewalk cafe in the event such cafe is not open and being operated for any period of seven (7) days or more.  While such cafe is in operation, all tables and chairs shall be kept in a clean, sanitary condition.

 

(f)    No alcoholic beverages shall be allowed in the sidewalk cafe except with the appropriate Outdoor Sales license issued pursuant to Section 4.18A of the City Code.  The provisions of Section 4.18A, subd. 17 (F) (2), (3) and (4) shall not apply to a license for Outdoor Sales within a Sidewalk Cafe.  The license holder shall, in addition to all other requirements of law, take reasonable steps to insure that alcoholic beverages are consumed only by patrons of the establishment who are of age, and not by passerby or persons who are not of age or who are obviously intoxicated.  Reasonable steps may include the use of barriers or fences, supervision of the outside area by security or staff personnel, and/or surveillance by electronic monitors.  Failure to take such reasonable steps and use them at all times that alcoholic beverages are consumed in the Sidewalk Cafe is grounds for the imposition by the City Council of a condition on the license to prohibit sale of alcoholic beverages in the sidewalk cafe.  Such condition shall not be deemed to be an adverse action against the license, and does not require notice and hearing procedures.

 

(g)   In order to prevent a public nuisance and to protect the health and welfare of pedestrians, smoking shall be prohibited in any Sidewalk Cafe area.  The proprietor or other person in charge of an establishment with a permitted Sidewalk Cafe shall ensure that ashtrays, lighters and matchbooks are not provided in the Sidewalk Cafe area.  The proprietor or other person in charge shall ask any person who smokes in a Sidewalk Cafe area to refrain from smoking, and if the person does not refrain from smoking after being asked to do so, ask the person to leave and use any other means which may be appropriate to obtain compliance.

 

(h)   It shall be the duty of the proprietor or other person in charge of an establishment with a permitted Sidewalk Cafe to maintain any plant tub at all times in a safe condition at its proper location and to inspect each such tub periodically in order that it may be properly maintained.  Trees or plans and their tubs shall at all times be kept in a neat, clean and presentable condition.  No advertising matter or sign or writing of any kind shall be displayed upon any tree or plant or its tub.

 

(i)     No such permit shall authorize a sidewalk cafe at any location where the same is prohibited by state law, or this Code of Ordinances, except as herein provided.

 

Subd. 7.  Insurance.  No Sidewalk Cafe permit shall be effective unless the permitee has filed with the City and the City has approved a Hold-Harmless Agreement against liability imposed by law arising out of the ownership, maintenance or operation of such Sidewalk Cafe. 

 

Subd. 8.  Permit Suspension and Revocation.  Any permit authorized by this section may be suspended or revoked at any time by the City Council for any violation of the permit or any city ordinance or state law in connection with the ownership, maintenance, or operation of such sidewalk café, or in the event the Council determines, in its discretion, that the operation of the Sidewalk Café is not in harmony with the public’s use of the public way.  In addition, each permit must be deemed experimental and as such, no expectation must be had by the permitee that the Sidewalk Cafe permit will be renewed, even though no misconduct occurred, or in the event the City Council determines to repeal the general authorization for Sidewalk Cafes.

 

Subd. 9. Permit Fee.  The annual fee for a Sidewalk Cafe permit shall be set forth in the City’s Fee Schedule.

 

SECTION 4.27 SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESSES

 

Subdivision 1. Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of the sexually-oriented business regulations set forth in this Ordinance is to serve a substantial government interest by attempting to preserve the quality and vitality of neighborhoods, curtail the depression of property values, restrain increased criminal activity, including prostitution and sex trafficking, and slow the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

 

Sexually-oriented businesses, as defined by this Ordinance, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics that have a deleterious effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas. Prostitution and sex trafficking is often illegally carried out under the guise of sexually-oriented businesses. These secondary effects are especially evident where such uses are concentrated.

 

The secondary effects associated with sexually-oriented businesses include an increased level of criminal activity, increased risk of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases, depression of property values and a significant change in the character of surrounding neighborhoods. However, it is recognized that such regulations cannot on a de facto basis prohibit these businesses. Otherwise, a constitutionally protected form of expression would vanish. The sexually-oriented business regulations set forth herein represent a balancing of competing interests, reduction of objectionable secondary effects through the regulation of sexually-oriented businesses versus the protected rights of the owners, operators, performers and patrons of those businesses.

                                                            Snowmobiles are used primarily for recreational purposes in open areas and on designated trails and pathways where the impact on other persons or property is limited.  The operation of snowmobiles on or adjacent to public streets and sidewalks creates safety risks for pedestrians and other motorists and when operated at inappropriate times, disturbs the peace and tranquility of our neighborhoods.  The intent of this Ordinance is to provide snowmobile access to and from established snowmobile trails by way of a direct route over public roadways.  The operation of snowmobiles within the City for any other purpose, except during a declared snow emergency, is prohibited.

 

                                                            Notwithstanding provisions of this Code to the contrary, this Section shall apply to the control of traffic and the regulation of that certain classification of vehicles falling within the definition of snowmobiles as to matters set forth herein.  All provisions of this Code, not relating to matters herein stated, apply as equally to snowmobiles as to other vehicles.

4.         Gravel and Debris. All areas intended for vehicle and pedestrian traffic shall be free of gravel, sand, leaves and vegetation, or other debris that might harbor pests or present a hazard to pedestrians and individuals, particularly those utilizing mobility assistance devices.

5.         Ponding. All areas intended for vehicle and pedestrian traffic shall be maintained and repaired to prevent grading problems such as ponding of water, unnecessary accumulation of ice, and hazards from raised pavement. This may include the correction of grading defects, repair or removal of ridges caused by frost heaving, or the restoration of settled soil.

 

B.        Waste Removal. The temporary placement of dumpster and roll-off containers shall be done in a manner that avoids impairing parking and accessibility for both the public and emergency services. Unless no reasonable alternative exists, roll off containers shall be placed off public right of way; under no circumstances shall roll-off containers placed on public right of way interfere with or present a hazard to the travelling public. While roll-offs are necessary for construction projects, the extended presence of roll-offs can contribute to unlawful dumping. All roll-off containers shall be removed within 72 hours of reaching capacity. All dumpsters and roll-off operations shall be conducted so as to minimize nuisances to surrounding properties, including, but not limited to: minimizing the generation of litter, picking up litter on a daily basis, controlling rodents and vermin, and providing all necessary utilities and equipment to promptly and effectively control dust, odor, and noise emissions, both on-site and beyond the property boundaries. All roll-off containers shall be tarped when not actively in use.

 

C.        Signage. All sign faces shall be kept in good condition; broken or missing components must be professionally repaired. If signage is illuminated, the lighting must be fully functional. If signage is removed from buildings or monuments, any area that is impacted must be repaired and painted regardless of the provisions of Subd. 5.A.1 of the PMC.

 

D.        Graffiti. The presence and proliferation of graffiti detracts from property values and has an overall negative impact upon the City. Graffiti has been recognized to substantially contribute to the spread of gang activity, violence, crime and deterioration of property values. Unless the City requires the removal of graffiti, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the City. Property owners and tenants may not allow any graffiti to exist on their property. Nothing in this provision precludes property owners from seeking damages or restitution from individuals responsible for graffiti.

 

E.         Litter. The presence of litter encourages additional littering. In order to break the cycle of littering, property owners and occupants are required to pick up all litter on their Property, regardless of the litter’s source. Nothing in this provision precludes property owners from seeking damages or restitution from individuals responsible for litter.

 

F.         Lighting. Unlit commercial areas attract criminal activity. All approved lighting shall be kept functional and in use.

4.         A plan and timetable for returning the building to appropriate occupancy, achieving or maintaining compliance with PMC and zoning ordinance, and any plans for demolition.

SECTION      9.03     HOUSING CODE

 

Subd. 1. Purpose. The City recognizes a need for an organized inspection program of residential rental units within the City in order to establish and enforce minimum standards for rental units to meet City and State safety, health, fire, and zoning codes within the City and to provide a more efficient system to ensure that rental property is properly maintained. The City recognizes that the most efficient system to provide for rental inspections is the creation of a program requiring the registration and license of all residential rental units within the City so that orderly inspections can be undertaken.

Subd. 2. Definitions.

a.            The term “residential rental property” means any building, structure, room, enclosure, or mobile home including the real property upon which it is located and which surrounds it, which is rented or offered for rent as living quarters. Residential rental property does not mean hospital units, nursing home units, or hotels or motels with daily rental units, all of which shall be specifically exempt from registration and license under this Section.

b.            The term “person” includes natural persons as well as business entities, whether one or more.

 Subd. 4. Registration and License Requirements. It is unlawful for any person to hereafter occupy, allow to be occupied, advertise for occupancy, solicit occupants of, or let to another person for occupancy any residential rental property within the City for which an application for license has not been properly made and filed with the City of Sauk Rapids and for which there is not an effective license. Initial application and renewal shall be made upon forms furnished by the city for such purpose and shall specifically require the following minimum information:

a.            Name, address and phone number of the property owner and, if owner is not a natural person, the name, address and phone number of a designated agent for the owner.

b.            The name, phone number, and address of any person authorized to make or order made repairs or services for the property, if in violation of City or State Codes, if the person is different than the owner.

d.            The number and types of units within the rental property (dwelling units or sleeping rooms).

Subd. 5. Fees & Penalties. There shall be a license fee for the initial license, a renewal fee every two years thereafter.  The fee shall be based upon the number of units in the case of multiple unit dwellings. There shall also be a provisional license fee.  All fees shall be established by resolution of the Council.  Penalties for failure to comply with any portion of these rules, standards, statutes, and ordinances will be established by resolution of the Council.

Subd. 6. Manner of Registration, Licensing and Renewal.

a.            Initial application for license of property which is not licensed as residential rental property on the effective date of this Section, or for licensed residential rental property when there is a change in type of occupancy, shall be made by personally filing an application for license with the City of Sauk Rapids before the property is used as residential rental property or before use as a new type of occupancy.

b.             If there is a change in the type of occupancy from the type stated on the registration statement, a new registration statement and license will be required.

Subd. 7. Method and Manner of Certification.  Upon receipt of an initial application, the City shall forward a copy to the Building Official, who shall then, within twenty (20) working days, perform an inspection of the property to determine whether such property complies with the provisions of applicable rules, standards, statutes and ordinances.  The inspector shall make a report thereon. No license shall be issued if the premises and building do not fully comply with all the provisions of the applicable rules, standards, statutes and ordinances which pertain to such dwelling units.

Subd. 8. Method of Correction. Whenever an inspector determines that any residential rental property fails to meet the requirements set forth in the applicable rules, standards, statutes or ordinances; the inspector shall issue a correction notice setting forth the violations and ordering the occupant, owner and/or owner’s designated agent to correct such violations. This notice and order shall:

a.   Be in written form;

b.   Describe the location and nature of the violation;

c.   Establish a reasonable time for the correction of any violation;

(2)  Sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. 

Failure to correct violations within the time period stated in the correction order shall result in an administrative penalty to be set by Council resolution, as well as other sanctions provided by law or this ordinance.  If the correction order relates to actions or omissions of the occupant, and the occupant fails to make the necessary correction, the licensee may be required to remedy the condition by whatever means necessary.  No adverse action shall be taken against a licensee for failure to remedy a condition during the pendency of a bona fide eviction proceeding being pursued diligently by the licensee.

Subd. 9. Transfer of Property. To transfer the license from one property owner to another, the licensee shall give written notice, including the name and address of the transferee, to the City of Sauk Rapids of the proposed transfer, within thirty-days (30) after such transfer.  The transferee must make application with the City for a transfer of the license within thirty-days (30) after the transfer of property.  Failure to make application within the specified time limit shall result in automatic forfeiture of the license.  Relicensing of any property for which the license has been forfeited shall require application for a new license.   Issuance of any license when there is a transfer of property shall require the property to be in compliance with all requirements of the applicable rules, codes, statutes and ordinances

Subd. 10. License Suspensions and Revocation.

a.            Any license may be revoked or suspended at any time during the life of said license for grounds including, but not limited to the following:

Subd. 12. Maintenance of Records.  All records, files, and documents pertaining to the Rental License Program shall be maintained for five years after the license expiration, in the office of the City of Sauk Rapids and made available to the public as allowed or required by the applicable laws, rules, codes, statutes or ordinances.

Subd. 13. Housing Appeals Board. The Housing Appeals Board is hereby designated to act as an advisory body.  The Board shall consist of five (5) members who shall be appointed by the Mayor with the approval of the Council.  The term of each member shall be for three years from the date of his or her appointment or reappointment.  All members shall continue to serve until their successors are properly appointed.  Any vacancy occurring during the expiration term of a member shall be filled for the remainder of the term in the same manner as an original appointment.  No person shall serve more than three full three-year terms.  Upon recommendation of the Mayor, the Council may, by majority vote of all its members, remove any member of the Housing Appeals Board with or without cause.

The Board shall hear appeals arising from a correction order and make recommendations to the Council to affirm, modify or reverse, in whole or in part, such order. This Board shall also review and approve administrative policies and procedures pursuant to this ordinance, and regularly review and make such recommendations, as the Board deems reasonable and necessary to the Council as to the schedules of fees and penalties required under this Section. 

Subd. 14. Appeal Process.  When it is alleged by any person to whom a correction order is directed that such order is based upon erroneous interpretation of the applicable rules, standards, statutes or ordinance or mistake in fact, such person may appeal the correction order to the Housing Appeals Board. 

Such appeal must be in writing, must specify the grounds for the appeal, must be accompanied by any filing fee set by Council resolution, and must be filed within twenty (20) business days after service of the correction order.  Upon receipt of the written appeal, the City shall set a date for a hearing and give the appellant at least five (5) days prior written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing.  By mutual agreement between the appellant and the Building Official, the five (5) day notice may be waived.

The Housing Appeals Board shall hear and consider the matter within thirty-days (20) twenty days from the filing of an appeal.   The filing of an appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the enforcement officer certifies that such a stay would cause imminent peril to life, health, or property. 

The Housing Appeals Board shall issue its recommendation to the Council and the appellant in writing within thirty-days (30) after the hearing.  The Council shall thereafter affirm, modify or reverse the correction order upon such terms as the Council deems necessary to accomplish the purposes of this ordinance.  A copy of the decision shall be mailed to the appellant.

Subd. 15. Authority.  Nothing in this Section shall prevent the City from taking action under any applicable rule, standard, statute or ordinance for violations thereof to seek either injunctive relief or criminal prosecution for such violations as therein provided.  Nothing contained in this Section shall prevent the City from seeking injunctive relief against a property owner or designated agent who fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this Section on registration and licensing including an order prohibiting the occupancy of such rental units until violations of this Section have been remedied by the property owner or designated agent.

Subd. 16. Posting.  Every licensee of residential rental property shall conspicuously post a receipted copy of the current license (in a frame with transparent cover) in a public corridor, hallway, or lobby of the rental property for which it is issued. For other than single family dwellings, the licensee must post the license certificate in a frame with a transparent cover in such a manner so as to be easily viewed and readable at or near the front entrance of the building for which it was issued.

Subd. 16. Inspection Access.  Property owners and their agents shall permit the enforcement officer to inspect all premises governed by this ordinance to determine if the building is operated as a rental property and/or to determine compliance with the provisions of this section, and shall fully cooperate with such inspections.  The property owners or their agents shall make reasonable efforts to notify tenants of planned inspections of their rental units to the extent required by state law. 

If an owner, occupant, or other person in charge of a dwelling, dwelling unit or a multiple dwelling fails or refuses to permit free access and entry to the structure or premises, or any part thereof, for an inspection authorized by this section, the inspector may obtain an order to inspect and/or a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction.  Property owners shall cooperate in the execution of all administrative search warrants and court orders, including providing access and entry to rented premises where directed to do so.  An authorized representative of the property owner shall be present on the premises during inspections; however, failure of a property owner to comply with this requirement shall not deprive the City of the authority to inspect.

Failure of a property owner to obey any of the requirements of this subdivision shall subject the property owner to suspension or revocation of license, in addition to other remedies and/or penalties provided by law.  Any such suspension or revocation shall continue until the inspection sought has been completed, any violations satisfactorily remedied and any outstanding fees or penalties have been paid.

Subd. 18. Applicable Laws.  Licensees shall be subject to all applicable rules, standards, statutes and ordinances; and this Section shall not be construed or interpreted to supersede any other such applicable rules, standards, statutes or ordinances.

Subd. 19. Tenant Identification.   Licensees are required to provide names of tenants occupying rental property when the City of Sauk Rapids, or a Police Officer submits a written request.

Subd. 20.  Tenant Requested Inspection.  A tenant may at any time request an inspection of the rental property in which they currently reside.

Notwithstanding any finding of the Housing Inspector for other violations of this Ordinance, any rental property that receives more than three (3) police calls per unit within a twelve (12) month period, or receives twenty-four (24) police calls or complaints within a twelve (12) month period for the building, whichever number is less, may be subject to license suspension, license termination, license non-renewal, civil penalties, and/or the requirement that property management procedures for the rental property be modified.  The Housing Appeals Board will consider such penalties and/or actions after providing written notice and an opportunity to be heard to the owner of the rental property.

C.        Background Investigations for Prospective Residents.  The Sauk Rapids Police Department may conduct criminal history/background investigations on prospective tenants in rental property in the City of Sauk Rapids upon request by the owner or manager of the rental property.  No such investigations shall be conducted using the State Criminal Justice Data Communications Network (CJDN), and no information obtained from the CJDN shall be disseminated unless the landlord presents an Informed Consent/Waiver form signed by the prospective tenant.  The Informed Consent/Waiver form must meet the requirements of Minnesota Statutes Section 13.05, Subd. 4 (d).

CHAPTER 10

LAND USE (ZONING) REGULATIONS

 

 

SECTION          10.01   PURPOSE

The City wants to guide future land use and development so as to promote a safe, pleasant and economical environment for residential, commercial, industrial and public activities; to preserve certain undeveloped lands, to provide for the wise development of the Mississippi River shorelands, and to promote the public health, safety, order, convenience, and the general welfare; to preserve property values by regulating the use of land, buildings, and structures, including their height, bulk, yard areas and density.  Municipal planning, by providing public guides to future municipal action, enables other public and private agencies to plan their activities in harmony with the municipality=s plans.  Municipal planning will assist in developing lands more wisely, serving citizens more effectively, and making the provision of public services less costly through the achievement of a more secure tax base.

 

Subdivision      1.         Other Regulations.  It is intended by these regulations to be consistent with and compliment other municipal controls that exist such as Building and Fire codes, Subdivision or Flood Plain Regulations, Official Maps, Comprehensive Plans, transportation, utility, storm water, park, capital improvements or other plans.  It is not intended by these regulations to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with existing provisions or other regulations.  Where these regulations impose a greater restriction upon the use of land, buildings or structures than is imposed or required by such other existing provisions by law, contract or deed, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail and control.

 

Subdivision 2.  Purpose and Intent of Adult Use Zoning Regulations.  The purpose and intent of the adult use regulations set forth in this Chapter is to serve a substantial government interest by attempting to preserve the quality and vitality of neighborhoods, protect the City's retail trade, curtail the depression of property values, restrain criminal activity and slow the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.

 

Adult Use Establishments, as defined by these Zoning regulations, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics that have a deleterious effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas.  These secondary effects are especially evident where such uses are concentrated.

 


One of this Chapter's objectives is to disperse the adult uses through separation requirements from another adult use and from other significantly incompatible uses.  These regulations allow adult uses only in I-1, Industrial District.  In this community, those areas are located throughout the city and provide opportunity for sites with good visibility and access to major streets and highways.

 

The secondary effects associated with adult uses include an increased level of criminal activity, increased risk of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases, depression of property values and a detrimental change in the character of surrounding neighborhoods.

 

However, it is recognized that such regulations cannot de facto approach prohibition.  Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish.  The adult use regulations set forth in these Zoning regulations represent a balancing of competing interests:  reduction of objectionable secondary effects through the regulation of adult uses versus the protected rights of the owners, operators, performers and patrons of those adult uses.

 

SECTION          10.02   RULES AND DEFINITIONS.

SECTION  10.03.  NON-CONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.

1.         Purpose.  It is the purpose of this section to accomplish the following:

a)     recognize the existence of uses which were lawful when established but which no longer meet all ordinance requirements;

b)     discourage the enlargement, expansion, intensification or extension of any non-conforming  use or any increase in the impact of a non-conforming use on adjacent properties;

c)     regulate the repair, replacement, restoration, and improvement of non-conforming uses to prevent and abate nuisances and to protect the public health, safety, or welfare; and

d)     encourage the elimination of non-conforming uses or reduce their impact on adjacent properties.

2.         Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms and phrases have the  meanings given to them.

a)     "Legal non-conformity" or "non-conforming use" means any land use, structure, physical form of land development, lot of record or sign legally established before the effective date of this ordinance or subsequent amendment to it that would not be permitted by, or is not in full compliance with, the regulations of this ordinance. A non-conformity or non-conforming use is one of two types: non-conforming land use or non-conforming development.

b)     "Non-conforming land use" means an activity using land, buildings, and/or structures for a purpose that was legally allowed when established but that is not currently allowed as a use in the zoning district in which it is located.

c)     "Non-conforming development" means a legal non-conformity other than a non-conforming land use, that complied with ordinance standards at the time it was established but that does not currently conform to an ordinance standard such as height, setback, or size.

d)     "Expansion," "enlargement," or "intensification" means any increase in a dimension, size, area, volume, or height, any increase in the area of use, any placement of a structure or part thereof where none existed before, any addition of a site feature such as a deck, patio, fence, driveway, parking area, or swimming pool, any improvement that would allow the land to be more intensely developed, any move of operations to a new location on the property, or any increase in intensity of use based on a review of the original nature, function or purpose of the non-conforming use, the hours of operation, traffic, parking, noise, exterior storage, signs, exterior lighting, types of operations, types of goods or services offered, odors, area of operation, number of employees, and other factors deemed relevant by the city.

e)     "Replacement," "reconstruction," or "restoration" means construction that exactly matches pre-existing conditions.

3.         General Standards.  A nonconforming use may be used and continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration, or maintenance, but not including expansion, only in compliance with the provisions of this section. The use must have been in compliance with all land use regulations at the time the non-conformity was created in order to be eligible for the benefits of being a non-conforming use.

a)         There may be no expansion, enlargement, or intensification, of any use or any site element of any non-conforming use except to make it a permitted use.  Normal building maintenance and repair are allowed. Expansion, enlargement or intensification of conforming aspects of a non-conforming development are excepted from this requirement. For example, if a structure has a non-conforming front setback, it may be expanded on the sides that do meet setback requirements as long as the expansion itself meets ordinance requirements.

b)         No non-conforming use may be resumed if normal operation of the use has been discontinued, or if a non-conforming building has been removed and not replaced, for a period of 12 or more months.  Time will be calculated as beginning on the day following the last day in which the use was in normal operation and will run continuously thereafter.  Following the expiration of 12 months, only uses that are permitted by this ordinance are allowed to be established.

c)          Full use of a non-conforming use may not be resumed if the amount of land or floor area dedicated to the use is lessened or if the intensity of the use is in any manner diminished for a period of 12 or more months.  Time will be calculated as beginning on the day following the last day in which the non-conforming use was in full operation and will run continuously thereafter.  Following the expiration of 12 months, the non-conforming use may be used only in the manner or to the extent used during the preceding 12 months.  For the purposes of this section, intensity of use will be determined by a review of the original nature, function or purpose of the non-conforming use, the hours of operation, traffic, parking, noise, exterior storage, signs, exterior lighting, types of operations, types of goods or services offered, odors, area of operation, number of employees, and other factors deemed relevant by the city.

d)         Removal or destruction of a non-conforming use to the extent of more than 50 percent of its estimated market value by fire or other peril, excluding land value and as determined by the city assessor, terminates the right to continue or replace any non-conforming use, except if a valid and complete building permit application has been submitted to the city within 180 days after the property was damaged.

e)          If replacement, reconstruction, or restoration of a legal non-conforming land use is allowed, it may occur without any land use approval from the city if the resulting use does not create any new adverse impacts on adjacent property and matches exactly the conditions that existed before the work was undertaken or before the use was damaged or destroyed. Work that would not meet this requirement and any work that would be an improvement to a non-conforming land use may not be undertaken unless a conditional use permit has been issued for the property. The city may impose conditions in a conditional use permit to protect the public health, safety, or welfare, and to mitigate any newly created impacts on adjacent property.

f)            If replacement, reconstruction, or restoration of a legal non-conforming development is allowed, it may occur without any land use approval from the city if the resulting use does not create any new adverse impacts on adjacent property and matches exactly the conditions that existed before the work was undertaken or before the non conforming development was damaged or destroyed, except for internal improvements and improved materials within buildings used to replace roof surfaces, siding, windows, doors, and similar components. Work that would not meet this requirement or any other improvement to a non-conforming development may not be undertaken unless the appropriate approval required below has been granted for the property. The city may impose conditions in its approval to protect the public health, safety, or welfare, and to mitigate any newly created impacts on adjacent property.

     1)     Work that brings a structure into compliance with building code requirements requires approval from the Community Development Director. The Community Development Director may choose, in his or her sole discretion, to require site plan approval by the City Council, instead of administrative approval.

     2)     All other improvements require site plan approval by the City Council upon recommendation of the Planning Commission notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance to the contrary.

g)          Work that constitutes an expansion of any non-conforming use or development may not be done without first obtaining a variance.  Expansion of a non-conforming land use or development may be approved only by the city council after receiving the recommendation of the planning commission where:

 

1)     The use occupies any space within a non-conforming area that was previously not occupied both vertically and horizontally. For example, a variance would be required if a second floor area is expanded into the non-conforming setback even though the non-conformity of the first floor setback dimension is reduced; or

 2)     The non-conforming aspect of a use is reduced but still does not comply with current ordinance standards.

h)          Notwithstanding the prohibitions contained in the foregoing paragraphs of this subdivision, if approved by the city council a non-conforming use may be changed to another non-conforming land use of less intensity if it is in the public interest.  In all instances the applicant has the burden of proving to the City Council that the proposed land use is less intense than the existing nonconforming land use.

i)             If a non-conforming use is superseded or replaced by a permitted use, the non-conforming status of the premises and any rights which arise under the provisions of this section terminate.

j)             Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs of this subdivision, all non-conforming Adult Use Establishments, as defined in Chapter 10.02, which were made non-conforming by the zoning ordinance or an amendment to it must be discontinued no later than three years after the adoption of the provision creating the non-conformity.

k)           Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, a non-conforming use or structure in a floodplain area may only be repaired, replaced, maintained, improved, or expanded to the extent that it would qualify for eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program, would not increase flood damage potential or increase the degree of obstruction to flood flows in the floodway, and would comply with the provisions in Chapter 11.

4.         Non-Conforming Sign.  A non-conforming sign that is an imminent danger to life or property or that may not be replaced under this ordinance must be removed immediately at the expense of the owner.

5.         Non-Conforming Utility Pole.  For a non-conforming utility pole that exists on the effective date of the ordinance, the pole and wires may be replaced in the event that it is damaged as the result of circumstances beyond the owner's control, but only if the height of the pre-existing pole and its lines are not exceeded and the voltage of the pre- existing wires is not increased. The height and voltage may be exceeded only if this is required by other governmental agencies or by applicable safety codes.  In addition, the height may be exceeded temporarily if the owner does not have a conforming pole available, but only on the condition that a permanent replacement which does not exceed the pre-existing height is installed as soon as practical.

6.         Creation of Non-Conformities By Public Action.  If a taking by a governmental body occurs under eminent domain or negotiated sale which renders a land use, lot of record, sign or development in violation of one or more provisions of this ordinance, such land use, lot of record, sign or development becomes a legal non-conformity with respect to the non-conformity created by the acquisition. It will have the benefits of, but not be subject to the limitations, of this section.

7.         Burden of Proof.  A person who wishes to take advantage of the rights granted to a legal non-conformity has the burden of proving the status as a legal non-conformity by clear and convincing evidence.

Subdivision 8. Parking: Purpose. Regulation of off-street parking and loading space is necessary to alleviate or prevent congestion of the public right-of-way and to promote the safety and general welfare of the public. Regulation is accomplished by establishing minimum requirements for off-street parking of vehicles and loading and unloading operations associated with their use for the uses regulated by this Chapter by analysis of the intensity, duration, time and style of utilization of the land or structures in or from which each use is conducted.

A.    Application of Off-Street Parking Regulations. Application for all occupancy permits shall be accompanied by a site plan drawn to a readable scale, which indicates the location of off-street parking and loading spaces on the site for which the occupancy permit is requested.

B.  General Provisions.

1)      Permits Prior to Effective Date. Structures or uses for which a permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this Chapter which are not completed on its effective date shall be exempt from the parking requirements of this Chapter if the structure is completed within six months after the effective date of this Chapter. In such cases, the parking and loading facilities provided for the structure or use must comply with the Chapter requirements, which were in effect at the time the permit was issued.

2)      Floor Area. Floor area shall mean gross floor area as defined in the Rules and Definition Section. (Section 10.02 Subdivision 2) However, indoor parking and indoor loading spaces shall not be counted as part of the floor area of a structure for the purpose of computing the number of parking or loading spaces which are required.

3)      Design Capacity. When a building's design capacity is used for purposes of calculating requirements for off-street parking spaces, that design capacity shall be determined by Subdivision 8. D. of this Ordinance or as determined by the Occupancy Loading as specified in the Uniform Building Code.   An applicant may have fewer immediate available parking spaces, if the applicant can demonstrate to the Community Development Director that because of the hours, size, and/or mode of operation of the respective uses, there will be an adequate amount of parking available for the use during its primary hours of operation to meet the needs of such use at the time and can prove that the parking requirements in the ordinance are excessive for the particular use at the time of the application.  However, the applicant must be able to accommodate for additional parking if the demand increases by providing the rest of the parking area as green space on the same property as the primary use building and agree to designate it as future parking if needed.

5)      Benches in Places of Public Assembly. In stadium, sports arenas, structures of religious institutions, and other places of public assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews, or other similar seating facilities, each 28 inches of such seating shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirements for off-street parking where the parking requirement is calculated by application of a formula based on the total number of seats.

6)      Calculating Space. When the calculation of the number of off-street parking spaces results in a fraction, each fraction of 1/2 or more shall require another space.

7)      Calculating Space for a Compound Use. Should a structure contain two or more types of uses, the total off-street parking spaces required for each use shall be calculated separately unless requirements for joint parking arrangements can be applied and an agreement is executed in a form acceptable to and approved by the City.

8)      Joint Parking Facilities. Off-street parking facilities may be provided collectively in any District for more than one structure or use, if the following conditions are met.

1. The applicant can demonstrate to the Community Development Director that because of the hours, size, and mode of operation of the respective uses, there will be an adequate amount of parking available to each use during its primary hours of operation to meet the needs of such use.

2. The joint use of the parking facilities shall be protected by covenants that run with the lots housing all the joint users and the lot or lots on which the parking facility, which satisfies the parking requirement of this Chapter, is provided. Those covenants shall grant a perpetual easement for parking to the joint principal use lots. The form, manner of execution, and content of such covenants must be approved by the City Attorney and the document containing the covenants must be recorded with the County Recorder.

3. Total required parking spaces for the joint use shall be based on the combined peak requirement and shall not be fewer than the minimum ordinance requirements for the use which requires the most parking.

9)      Use of Parking Area. Required off-street parking space and the driveways providing access to them shall not be utilized for storage, display, sales, rental, or repair of motor vehicles or any other goods, the storage of inoperable vehicles, or the storage of snow.

Subdivision 9. Exterior Lighting. 
A.    Definitions
 

Direct Light:  Light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminarie.
 
Fixture:  The assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can include all or some of the following parts:  a housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder, a ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a refractor or lens.
 
Flood or Spot light:  Any light fixture or lamp that incorporates a reflector or a refractor to concentrate the light output into a directed beam in a particular direction.
 
Footcandles:  The amount of light reaching the subject.  A unit of illumination produced on a surface, all points of which are one foot from a uniform point source of one-candle.
 
Full Cutoff- Type Luminaire:  A luminaire constructed or shielded to direct all light at a cutoff angle of less than 90 degrees.  Also, referred to as a Horizon Limited Luminaire.  
 
Fully-shielded lights:  outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed so that no light rays are emitted by the installed fixture at angles above the horizontal plane as certified by a photometric test report.  
 
Glare:  Light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce a viewer's ability to see, and in extreme cases causing momentary blindness.
 
Grandfathered luminaires:  Luminaires not conforming to this code that were in place at the time this code was voted into effect.  When an ordinance "grandfathers" a luminaire, it means that such already-existing outdoor lighting does not need to be changed unless a specified period is specified for adherence to the code.
 
Height of Luminaire:  The height of a luminaire shall be the vertical distance from the ground directly below the centerline of the luminaire to the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the luminaire.
 
Indirect Light:  Direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off of other surfaces.
 
Lamp:  The component of a luminaire that produces the actual light.
 
Light Trespass:  The shining of light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located.
 
Lumen:  The amount of light that a bulb produces. One footcandle is one lumen per square foot.  For the purposes of this Ordinance, the lumen-output values shall be the INITIAL lumen output ratings of a lamp.  
 
Luminaire:  This is a complete lighting system, and includes a lamp or lamps and a fixture (including all the necessary mechanical, electrical, and decorative parts).
 
Outdoor Lighting:  The night-time illumination of an outside area or object by any man-made device located outdoors that produces light by any means.
 
Temporary outdoor lighting:  The specific illumination of an outside area of object by any man-made device located outdoors that produces light by any means for a period of less than 7 days, with at least 180 days passing before being used again.
 
Wattage: The amount of electricity consumed by a bulb.

 

B.    Purpose and Scope:  The purpose of this Subdivision is to establish exterior lighting requirements that will 1) permit reasonable uses of lighting for night-time safety, utility, security, productivity, enjoyment, and commerce, 2) minimize glare, obtrusive light and artificial sky glow by limiting outdoor lighting that is misdirected, excessive or unnecessary, 3) conserve energy and resources to the greatest extent possible and 4) help protect the natural environment from the damaging effect of night lighting from man-made sources.

 

C.   Applicability. 

1)    All outdoor lighting fixtures (luminaries) on highway commercial properties shall be installed in conformance with the provisions of this Section as applicable as well as the latest rules, codes and regulations, including but not limited to OSHA, National Fire Codes of Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and National Electrical Code.

SECTION          10.14A   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT, PUD.

 

Subdivision 1. Purpose. It is recognized that this Chapter 10 is structured to regulate land use and development patterns of a conventional or traditional nature; however, there are situations where innovative proposals for the use of land may be submitted which do not relate to ordinance controls and would have to be rejected even though feasible and beneficial to the community. It is to accommodate such innovative proposals, even those that may mix land uses within a development, exceed stipulated densities, or depart from traditional lot sizes, that the Planned Unit Development District is established. The technology of land development is constantly changing and creative. Practical approaches to the use of land should be encouraged. The provisions of this Section are intended to do so in a manner, which is in the best interests of both the developer and the community. It is not the intent of this section of the ordinance to be a means in which to avoid meeting the minimum standards of the underlying zoning district.  More specifically, Planned Unit Development Districts may provide for progressive developments, which may achieve any number of the following:

a.         Provide a maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of housing and building types, permitting increased density per acre, a reduction in lot dimensions, building setbacks, or area requirements;

b.         Allow a more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas;

c.         Provide more convenient access to services, commercial products and workplaces by providing for mixed-use development;

d.         Provide for development, which preserves and/or utilizes existing natural site features and vegetation;

e.         Provide more efficient use of land resulting in lower cost in utilities and city services; or

f.          Provide for development in harmony with transportation facilities or services, community facilities, and the objectives of the comprehensive plan.

 

Subdivision 2.              Overlay District.  A PUD District is an overlay district which may be applied to and superimposed upon any underlying zoning district within the City, but will only be approved in conjunction with a Development Plan for the property.  It being the intent of the City that no provision or regulation of the underlying zoning district(s) may be varied, modified or set aside unless specifically provided for in a Development Plan approved in accord with this Section. 

 

Subdivision 3.              Subdivision Regulations.  The uniqueness of each PUD District may require that specifications and standards for streets, utilities, public facilities and the approval of land subdivisions be altered from the standards set out in City ordinances and policies.  The City Council may, therefore, where it finds that such modifications are not necessary and that such modifications will not adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of the general community, as part of the approval of the Development Plan for a PUD District, approve street, utility, and public facility plans as well as subdivisions which are not in compliance with the specifications or requirements established by City ordinances and policies.  Applicants will, however, continue to be required to obtain approval of plats in accord with the procedural requirements of Minnesota statutes and applicable City ordinances; however, those platting procedures may be accomplished in conjunction with the application process for a PUD District.

 

Subdivision 4.              Permitted Uses within a PUD District.  All permitted uses and accessory uses allowed in an underlying zoning district within a PUD District will be allowed within a PUD District.  Uses requiring a conditional use permit in an underlying zoning district may, in lieu of using the normal conditional use permit proceedings, be approved as Apermitted@ uses as part of an approved Development Plan.  In addition to the uses permitted in the underlying zoning district, all other uses designated as Apermitted@ by the approved Development Plan will be considered permitted uses within a PUD District.  Mixed uses, as specified in the approved Development Plan, will also be permitted within a PUD District.  No use may be designated as Apermitted@ in a Development Plan if that use will have the potential for adversely affecting adjacent property or the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community.

 

Subdivision 5. Area, Height, Frontage, Yard Requirements and other non-use regulations. The area, height, frontage, yard requirements and other performance requirements of the underlying zoning districts will apply within a PUD District except as such are specifically modified in an approved Development Plan. An approved Development Plan may establish area, height, frontage, yard or other performance requirements which vary from the underlying district without having to go through the normal variance procedures, however single family residential districts will have minimum standards as outlined in Subdivision 5. A.   In no event may a Development Plan alter such standards if doing so would violate a fire or safety code requirement. Variances from the requirements of an underlying district will not be implied except to the minimum extent required to comply with an approved Development Plan.

a.         Minimum standards for Single Family Residential (R-1)*

1.         Lot Area. The lot area shall be at least 6,600 square feet.

2.         Lot width. The lot width shall be a minimum of 55 feet at established building line and at least 30 feet wide at the front lot line.

3.         Side yard setback. The side yard setbacks shall be the same as the R-1 side yard setbacks.

4.         Front yard setback. The front yard setback shall be 25’.

5.         Lot depth.  The lot depth shall be at least 120 feet.

*The minimum standards outlined in this section are not intended to apply to patio homes and townhouses. It is intended that these standards be determined on a case by case basis.

 

Subdivision 6.              General Requirements.  The following are the minimum requirements which must be met before the City will approve a Development Plan and the establishment of a PUD District:

A.         Ownership.  The property located within the PUD must be under unified control at the time of application, and be planned and scheduled to be developed as a whole.  The applicant(s) must have acquired actual ownership of or executed a binding sales contract for all of the property comprising such tract. Where more than a single owner is involved, each owner must agree in advance to be bound by the conditions and regulations which will be effective within the PUD and to record with the County Recorder such covenants, easements, and other provisions required by the City.

B.         Financing.  The financing for the development must be proven to be available to the applicant on conditions and in amounts which are sufficient to assure completion of the development.

C.        Council Findings.  The Council must find the following:

1.      Comprehensive Plan.  The development will be planned so that it is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the community.

2.      Harmony.  The planned unit development will be planned and developed to harmonize with any existing or imminent development in the area surrounding the project site.

3.      Not Disturbing.  The development will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or planned neighboring uses, and will not materially adversely affect the values of adjacent properties.

4.      Adequately Served.  The development may be adequately served by essential public or private facilities and services, including streets, police and fire protection, drainage facilities, refuse disposal, water and sewer systems, and schools.

5.      Beneficial.  The distribution of buildings, streets and open space of the development will permit site planning that is superior to that which could be obtained without the PUD District being approved and thus benefit both the residents of the development and community as a whole.

6.      Not Detrimental.  The distribution or location of buildings, streets and open spaces will not unduly increase the bulk of buildings, density of population, or intensity of use(s) to the detriment of areas outside the development by restricting access to light and air, by creating traffic congestion, or by other means.

7.      Community Welfare.  The development will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort convenience or general welfare.

 

Subdivision 7.              Procedure.

1.      Application.  An applicant for a PUD must submit a Preliminary Development Plan, as described below in Subdivision 8, to the City Administrator, together with the application fee as set by the City Council, from time to time, at least 14 days prior to the Planning Commission meeting at which the request will be considered.   The application must be signed by the owner(s) of every property within the boundaries of the proposed PUD.  Depending upon the nature and scope of the application, the City administrator may, in addition to the standard application fee, require that the applicant deposit up to $1,000.00 for planning, engineering, administrative and legal expenses incurred by the City in reviewing and processing the application.  Any funds remaining after the application is processed will be refunded to the applicant.

2.      Review by Planning Commission.  After the City Administrator has received all required application materials, the City Administrator will refer the application to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation to the Council.

3.      Public Hearing.  The City Council will hold at least one public hearing on the rezoning and the Preliminary Development Plan, after notice of the hearing has been published in the official newspaper and mailed to each owner of property within 350 feet of the subject property, at least 10 days prior to the day of the hearing.

4.      Approval or Denial by Council.  The City Council will approve or deny the application after considering the application, the testimony of the applicant and the public, and the recommendation of the Planning Commission.  Since final approval of the Development Plan will involve the rezoning of the subject property, the Council may approve a final Development Plan and rezoning of property to PUD only upon the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the Council.  If the Preliminary Development Plan receives approval of the City Council, the Final Development Plan, with any changes requested by the City Council, must be presented to the City Council.  A public hearing will not be required for approval of the Final Development Plan unless the City Council determines that material changes have been made from the Preliminary Development Plan as approved by the Council.  The City Council must approve the Final Development Plan by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the Council, and the Council will specify any conditions which will be attached to the Final Development Plan if such conditions have not been incorporated therein.  The rezoning of the subject property will be considered complete upon approval of the Final Development Plan and approval of the development agreement required by paragraph 7 below.

5.      Conditions.  The City may impose such conditions and restrictions on the PUD as it deems necessary or advisable as part of its approval of the Preliminary or Final Development Plan. 

6.      Development Agreement and Performance Bond.  In the event the Preliminary Development Plan is approved by the City Council, the applicant will be required to execute a development agreement which states the conditions of the PUD and the phases of the development.  The City may, in its discretion, require that the applicant provide the City with a performance bond or other security deemed sufficient by the City Council to ensure the applicants compliance with the development agreement.

7.      Plan Amendments.  The procedures necessary to amend the Final Development Plan after it has been approved by the City are the same as the procedures required for the original approval.  Nonmaterial changes to the Development Plan may be made upon approval of the Planning Commission without having to hold a public hearing or having the matter considered by the Council.  Matters will be considered nonmaterial only if they will not result in a change in use which is not otherwise permitted in the underlying district or will not require a variance from the regulations of the underlying district.

8.      Lapse of Time.  If  within 1 year of the City Council=s approval of the Final Development Plan no building permits have been obtained or if  within 1 year of the issuance of the first building permit on the property no construction has commenced, the Development Plan will become void.  An applicant may request and receive an extension from the Council in the event the applicant can demonstrate a good faith effort has been made to use the PUD, that there is a reasonable expectation the PUD will be used, and the facts upon which the PUD was approved are essentially the same.

 

Subdivision 8.              Submission Requirements.

1.  Preliminary Development Plan.  10 copies of the following plans and information must accompany the application fee, the entirety of which will be considered the Preliminary Development Plan:

A.  Project information including site size, ownership, developer, development timing, phasing and construction schedule, and such other information as will be helpful in the approval process. 

B.  Existing site information including soils, vegetation, topography, slopes, conditions, water features, drainage, wildlife, and existing land uses.

C.  Proposed covenants or other private legal restrictions, if any.

D.  Written Descriptions of variances from regulations of underlying zoning districts and subdivision regulations.

E.  Preliminary architectural drawings, if any, illustrating schematic floor plans, and exterior construction materials.

F.  Site plan prepared by a qualified and licensed civil engineer illustrating the proposed use(s) of land; proposed densities; buildings, including square footage, height and other dimensions, distances between buildings and the front, side and rear lot lines, and other buildings located on the property and on property adjacent to the property; street and walkway locations; curb cuts and driveways; parking areas and loading areas; open spaces; the locations of easements and utilities (existing and proposed); landscaping (showing size, types and locations); lighting; grading; drainage; project phasing; anticipated variances from setbacks or other regulations of the underlying zone; tabulation of density, land use intensity, lot coverage and acreage; percentages of land devoted to buildings, parking, and open space; and any other information which may be helpful to understanding and evaluating the proposal.

2.  Final Development Plan Approval. The Final Development Plan must include all of the information provided in the Preliminary Plan except it must include any changes required by the City in its approval of the Preliminary Development Plan.

 

Subdivision 9.              Yearly Inspections and Review.  The Building Inspector will review each PUD at least once each year until completed and will make a report (through the Planning Commission) to the Council on the status of the development in each PUD District.  If the development is not progressing according to schedule, the owner will be required to submit to the Building Inspector a written statement setting forth the reasons for the lack of progress.  Within 30 days of such notice, the Council will either revoke the approval of the Development Plan and the PUD, and the land will thereafter be governed by the regulations applicable in the district in which it is located, or the Council will take such steps as it deems necessary to compel compliance with the approved Development Plan.

 

SECTION          10.14B ESO, ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREA OVERLAY DISTRICT

Subdivision 1.  Purpose and Intent.  This Section is the result of a collaborative effort between area stakeholders that has resulted in an alternative method of development that recognizes the ecological, geological, educational, scenic, economic, and aesthetic importance of conserving natural areas in public or private ownership. The provisions of this Section are intended to do so in a manner that benefits both the owner/developer and the community.

 

This Environmentally Sensitive Area Overlay District is created to:

.    Protect open space, green space, and water quality of flowage linked to the Mississippi River.

.    Provide greater subdivision flexibility and possible incentives in exchange for protection of green space, open space, and other resources as identified by the City.

.    Provide for development, which conserves and/or utilizes existing natural site features and vegetation.

.    Allow a more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas;

.    Provide opportunities for a more efficient use of land.

.    Provide for development in harmony with transportation facilities or services, community facilities, and the objectives of the comprehensive plan.

Subdivision 4.  Overlay District.  The ESO District is an overlay district which may be applied to and superimposed upon any underlying zoning district within the City, but will only be approved by agreement of the City and the owner/developer in conjunction with a Development Plan for the property.  No provision or regulation of the underlying zoning district(s) may be varied, modified or set aside unless specifically provided for in a Development Plan approved in accord with this Section. Both the City and the owner/developer must agree to employ the terms of this Section.  If either party declines to use this Section, then the owner/developer shall meet the minimum standards of Chapters 10 and 12.

 

Subdivision 5.  Procedure.

A.     For all subdivisions, Owner/developer shall be required to meet with City Staff to discuss the platting process in Sauk Rapids. After that point, either the owner/developer or the City may choose to not engage this Section but to rather work through the minimum standards of Chapters 10 and 12. If both parties agree to move forward within the parameters of this Section, an on-site visit shall be conducted. The on-site visit shall include the owner/developer and City Staff. Prior to the on-site visit the owner/developer shall be required to provide the City Escrow pursuant to Section 12.05, Subd. 2. C. A concerted effort shall be made to include an independent professional volunteer to attend the on-site visit to offer professional insight to a particular site’s natural features and their function in relation to the proposed development. The professional volunteer shall be encouraged to provide the City and Developer with written findings but this shall not be a requirement. The findings of the professional volunteer shall be taken as a recommendation to the City although the City shall be under no obligation to follow the recommendation.

B.      Discussion will be guided by the City’s Natural Resources Policy (NRP), which is incorporated by reference.

C.     The NRP and its associated Natural Resource Composite Map prioritize the natural features that the City is most interested in conserving/restoring and what requirements within the Zoning and Subdivision Codes the City may consider varying in order to achieve some level of conservation.

D.     At any time prior to approval of a Development Plan under this section, either the City or the developer may decline to proceed with the ESO overlay and may instead choose to use the underlying zoning and subdivision standards. If City Staff does not support moving forward within the parameters of this section, the owner/developer shall be provided with written findings stating the reasons that City Staff does not support moving forward. The owner/developer may appeal City Staff’s decision to the Sauk Rapids Planning Commission within 10 days of the date of the written findings. The appeal shall be on a form provided by the City and shall include an appeal fee as provided in the City’s Fee Schedule.  The Planning Commission shall make their decision within 60 days or may extend the time for consideration as permitted by State law.  The Planning Commission shall consider the criteria provided in Subd. 5(E) below in determining whether to affirm or reverse the decision of City Staff.  If the decision is reversed, the owner/developer and City Staff shall proceed with the review of the application according to this Section.

E.      The City shall at a minimum consider the following factors when determining if an ESO overlay application is appropriate. Because each project will be unique, the below elements shall be weighed/prioritized on a project by project basis:

§ Extent to which the Preliminary Concept Plan is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan goals;

§ Community long-term benefit of the Preliminary Concept Plan;

§ Community cost-benefit of incentive proposal;

§ Level of conservation/restoration of natural features;

§ The condition of existing natural features in their pre and post development state;

§ Extent to which, if any, the proposed design compromises the economic viability and natural resources of the development;

§ Projected level of the Preliminary Concept Plan’s effectiveness and success at the point the end-user takes ownership and assumes stewardship of the site;

§ Extent to which the Preliminary Concept Plan reflects the values indicated within the Natural Resource Composite Map and the Natural Feature Characteristic Priority Lists.

§ Extent to which the natural resources that the developer has offered to conserve/restore can be protected through the use of deed restrictions, conservation easements, or some other manner as approved by the City.

F.   Anyone requesting an Environmentally Sensitive Ordinance Overlay shall enter into an Environmentally Sensitive Ordinance Development Agreement with the City in addition to agreeing to a Development Plan with the City. All Environmentally Sensitive Ordinance Agreements shall set out the terms and conditions of the City’s approval, including language that explains how the sensitive natural resources that owner/developer agrees to protect shall remain under protection after the developer no longer has controlling interest in the property.

 

Subdivision 6.  Application Process

A. The following is the process if both the owner/developer and City Staff choose to participate after following the procedures established in Subd. 5. A-F.

B. Before submitting an ESO application the owner/developer must schedule a pre-application meeting with City Staff, which shall include the City Pre-Application Committee. Prior to this meeting the developer shall provide:

                          1.  A preliminary concept plan. It is the intent of this section that the owner/developer provides the City with drawings that clearly convey the intent of the project and illustrate the various uses and lot layouts that are proposed.  It is also understood that survey level drawings at this early stage may be premature and therefore unnecessary. Regardless, the preliminary concept plan shall include the natural features as identified by the Natural Resource Steering Committee that exist on that site, lot layouts, street and walkway locations, parking areas, open spaces, proposed densities, height of buildings, buffers, and any other items that may be helpful in understanding and evaluating the proposal.

2.  A written description of requested modifications from the underlying zoning district regulations (as guided in the City of Sauk Rapids Comprehensive Plan).

C.  At the pre-application meeting, City Staff shall provide a list of items that the City is requesting of the owner/developer based on the NRP. Both the City Staff list and the owner/developer list of requested modifications shall be provided on a form developed by the City which shall require the signature of both parties. It is the intent of this Section that there is a level of agreement between the owner/developer and City Staff on which item(s) from the underlying zoning district that the owner/developer is requesting to modify and the item(s) that the City would like to have preserved or installed per the NRP.

D. After the Pre-Application meeting, the owner/developer may again choose to forgo the ESO process and proceed with the development approvals through the process outlined in Chapters 10 and/or 12 depending on the application. If the owner/developer wishes to move forward with the ESO proposal, the zoning amendment procedure shall follow Section 10.14A, Subd. 7 of the City Code.  Once approved, subdivision requests for the development shall follow the procedures of Section 12.05 of the City Code, with the exception of Subd. 1.

 

Subdivision 7.  Permitted Uses within an ESO District. 

           The ESO zoning shall be an overlay designation only and the underlying primary zoning district shall be preserved.  All permitted uses and accessory uses allowed in the underlying zoning district will be allowed as part of the ESO overlay, except as otherwise specified in the ESO Development Agreement and/or Development Plan.  In addition to the uses permitted in the underlying zoning district, all other uses designated as permitted uses by the approved Development Plan will be considered permitted uses within an ESO District.  Mixed uses, as specified in the approved Development Plan, will also be permitted within an ESO District.  No use may be designated as permitted in a Development Plan if that use will have the potential for adversely affecting adjacent property or the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community.  Except as specifically and explicitly permitted as part of an approved Development Plan, conditional uses allowed in the underlying zoning district may be permitted only after following the procedures and standards proscribed in the City’s zoning ordinance.

 

Subdivision 8.  Area, Height, Frontage, Yard Requirements and other non-                                     use regulations.

The area, height, frontage, yard requirements and other performance requirements of the underlying zoning districts will apply within a ESO District except as such are specifically modified in an approved Development Plan. An approved Development Plan may establish area, height, frontage, yard or other performance requirements which vary from the underlying district without having to go through the normal variance procedures; however single family residential districts will have minimum standards as outlined in this Subd. 8.A.  In no event may a Development Plan alter such standards if doing so would violate a fire or safety code requirement. Variances from the requirements of an underlying district will not be implied except to the minimum extent required to comply with an approved Development Plan.

                                    A.         Minimum standards for Single Family Residential (R-1)*

1.      Lot Area. The lot area shall be at least 6,600 square feet.

2.      Lot width. The lot width shall be a minimum of 55 feet at established building line and at least 30 feet wide at the front lot line.

3.      Side yard setback. The side yard setbacks shall be the same as the R-1 side yard setbacks.

4.      Front yard setback. The front yard setback shall be 25’.

5.      Lot depth.  The lot depth shall be at least 120 feet.  *The minimum standards outlined in this section are not intended to apply to patio homes and townhouses. These standards shall be determined on a case by case basis. 

 

Subdivision 9.  General Requirements. 

The following are the minimum requirements that must be met before the City will approve a Development Plan and the establishment of an ESO District:

                                    A.         Ownership.  The property located within the ESO must be under unified control at the time of application, and be planned and scheduled to be developed as a whole.  The applicant(s) must have acquired actual ownership of, or executed a binding sales contract for, all of the property comprising such tract. Where more than a single owner is involved, each owner must agree in advance to be bound by the conditions and regulations which will be effective within the ESO and to record with the County Recorder such covenants, easements, and other provisions required by the City.

B.         Financing.  The owner/developer must demonstrate that financing for the development is available to the applicant on conditions and in amounts which are sufficient to assure completion of the development.

                                    C.        Council Findings.  The Council must find the following:

1.      Comprehensive Plan.  The development will be planned so that it is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the community.

2.      Harmony.  The project will be planned and developed to harmonize with any existing or imminent development in the area surrounding the project site.

3.      Not Disturbing.  The development will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or planned neighboring uses, and will not materially adversely affect the values of adjacent properties.

4.      Adequately Served.  The development is or will be adequately served by essential public or private facilities and services, including streets, police and fire protection, drainage facilities, refuse disposal, water and sewer systems, and schools.

5.      Beneficial.  The distribution of buildings, streets and open space of the development will permit site planning that is superior to that which could be obtained without the ESO District being approved and thus benefit both the residents of the development and community as a whole.

6.    Not Detrimental.  The distribution or location of buildings, streets and open spaces will not unduly increase the bulk of buildings, density of population, or intensity of use(s) to the detriment of areas outside the development by restricting access to light and air, by creating traffic congestion, or by other means.

7.    Community Welfare.  The development will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort convenience or general welfare.

 

SECTION 10.14C BENTON DRIVE SOUTH GATEWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT

 

SUBDIVISION 1. PURPOSE AND INTENT

The Benton Drive South Gateway area welcomes visitors into the City of Sauk Rapids coming from the southeast and contains a high concentration of successful commercial and industrial uses.  This ordinance shall provide for the orderly grouping of commercial and industrial operations in an appropriate setting.  It is the further intent of this district to establish regulatory controls that preserve a harmonious relationship between these uses and the community.  New development should relate to other existing or proposed development on adjoining properties to minimize incompatible conditions and to maximize useful interconnections.  The ordinance strives to present an image of high quality and value and is welcoming to travelers and visitors.  The ordinance shall overlap and overlay existing zoning districts and intends to maintain safety along the Benton Drive South corridor while crafting a reception locale at the southeast entry to the City.

SUBDIVISION 2. BENTON DRIVE SOUTH GATEWAY OVERLAY DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.

The Benton Drive South Gateway District shall include property within 200 feet from the center line on either side of Benton Drive South from the intersection of Benton Drive South and the State Trunk Highway 10 to the intersection of Benton Drive South and Lincoln Avenue/Summit Avenue South.

SUBDIVISION 3. APPLICABILITY.

A.    Unless otherwise noted, the requirements of the Benton Drive South Gateway Overlay District apply to all development and are in addition to the requirements of the underlying zoning district.  Where the requirements of the underlying district and the overlay district conflict, the more restrictive will apply.

B.    All development approval and permitting for activities, uses, and structures in the Benton Drive South Overlay District shall follow the same procedures as set forth in Sections 10.06A, 10.17 and 10.17A-D.

SUBDIVISION 4. DESIGN GUIDELINES

A.    Site.  Utility boxes, meters and service areas such as trash enclosures shall not be located on a street facing exposure. If such placement is required, screening shall be provided to the extent practicable.  The City encourages underground cabling and cable bundling or co-location of services and telecommunications infrastructure.

B.    Building Orientation.  In order to maintain an active appearance throughout the Benton Drive South corridor, building walls facing the street should be punctuated with display windows, doors, or other indentations to add visual interest on Benton Drive South.  All sides of a building visible from Benton Drive South should be treated consistently with quality materials and finishes.  No development shall be permitted to organize the placement and orientation of buildings, parking, circulation, and service facilities on a lot in such a way as to treat Benton Drive South as a “rear” lot line. “Rear” shall be defined to mean a portion of the property lacking public access and containing a predominance of service functions that significantly diminish the architectural or landscape quality of the development.  Uses that include auto-oriented uses or non-pedestrian uses, including garage entries, service bays or similar functions shall orient those functions away from primary street frontage, wherever possible placing active, populated functions toward the street.

C.   Architectural Standards.  Building facades facing Benton Drive South shall either be the primary pedestrian entry facade or shall be of comparable quality in terms of architecture, materials and detailing. Primary building pedestrian entries shall be visible from and connected to the street sidewalk by the most direct route practical. Corner buildings need only provide public entry on one street oriented facade.  Building materials must meet the following criteria:

1)    Construction of new structures and additions to existing facilities to have poured concrete or concrete block perimeter foundations and frost footings, and shall consist of the following materials:

a)    Pre-cast or cast tip up concrete walls

b)    Concrete block (painted or decorative)

c)    Wood/Steel stud construction

d)    Structure Insulation Panels (SIP)

e)    Insulated Concrete Form (ICF)

f)     Steel frame pre-engineered buildings

2)    Exterior wall finishes for new facilities, additions and renovation of existing buildings exterior walls shall consist of the following materials:

a)    26 gauge pre-finished architectural metal panels, with a minimum twenty (20) year manufacturer color-fast warranty           

b)    Brick

c)    Stone (natural or artificial)

d)    Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS)

e)    Stucco

f)     Glass

g)    Decorative or textured concrete block (surface to be painted or receive colored texture finish)

h)    Pre-cast concrete (surface to have an exposed aggregate, painted or colored texture finish)

i)      Wood siding

j)     Or any combination thereof, except for trim accessories and the roof

3)    All exterior walls shall have a decorative accent covering (a complementary and distinct material that contrasts from focus finish) using the following materials:

a)    Face brick

b)    Natural stone or cultured rock

c)    Aluminum / Steel / Vinyl lap siding

d)    26 gauge pre-finished architectural metal panels with a minimum twenty (20) year manufacture color-fast  warranty

e)    Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS)

f)     Stucco

g)    Cut Stone

h)    Decorative or textured concrete block (surface to be painted or receive a colored texture finish)

4)    The Council shall be responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning alternate exterior materials.

5)    The Council reserves the right to exercise discretion regarding accent materials during the approval process.  Standards will be consistent with architectural design.

6)    Expansion of existing facilities: For the expansion of existing buildings that do not meet the building exterior requirements of this section it is understood that requiring the addition to strictly adhere to the building exterior requirements of this section may be impractical. Therefore, it is the intent of the City Council to address each expansion on a case by case basis. The City Council desires that the addition(s) match the existing building(s) as much as possible. Although, an attempt shall be made to meet at least some of the building exterior requirements of this Section.

D.    Landscape.  Buffering and screening strategies shall consider building and parking placement, building orientation, walls, fences, and landscaping.  Screening shall be of adequate height to provide complete screening from normal eye level, within applicable zoning allowances, on all sides where access is not needed.  Screening may be accomplished through landscaping of adequate height and density. 

E.     Lighting.  Lighting should be provided at consistent levels with gradual transition to unlit areas. Avoid creating highly contrasting pools of light and dark areas which can be temporarily blinding.  Parking lot light fixtures shall be non-glare and mounted no more than 25 feet above the ground to minimize the impact onto adjacent properties. All fixtures over 15 feet in height shall be fitted with a full cut-off shield.  All building lights shall be directed onto the building itself or the ground immediately adjacent to it. The light emissions should not be visible above the roofline of the building.

F.     Streetscape.  It is the strategy of this ordinance to ensure the provision of high quality streetscapes and a consistent streetscape theme.    Street tree species should be selected to maximize the cohesiveness of each block without creating monocultures that may be susceptible to disease.

SECTION          10.15A  TOWERS

 

Subdivision 1.  Purpose.  In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and business while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community, the City finds that these regulations are necessary in order to:

A.         Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication services to the residents and businesses of the City;

B.         Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design and siting standards;

C.        Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements; and

D.         Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and buildings to accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce the number of towers needed to serve the community.

 

Subdivision 2.  Co-Location Requirements.  All commercial wireless telecommunication towers erected, constructed, or located within the City shall comply with the following requirements:

A.         A proposal for a new commercial wireless telecommunication service tower shall not be approved unless the City Council finds that the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or building within a one mile search radius (one half mile search radius for towers 120 feet or less in height and one quarter mile search radius for towers 80 feet or less in height) of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following reasons:

1.      The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.

2.      The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or building as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.

3.      Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer.

4.      Other unforeseen reasons that make it not feasible to locate the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or building.

B.         Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication service tower shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all other respects, to accommodate both the applicant=s antennas and comparable antennas, for at least 1 additional user if the tower is over 60 feet in height and for at least 2 additional users if the tower is over 100 feet in height.

C.        Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.

 

Subdivision 3.  Tower Construction Requirements.  All towers erected, constructed, or located within the City, and all wiring therefore, shall comply with the requirements of the Building Code.

 

Subdivision 4.  Tower and Antenna Design Requirements.  Proposed or modified towers and antennas shall meet the following design requirements:

A.         Towers and antennas shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment, except in instances where the color is dictated by federal or state authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration.

 

B.         Towers meeting the requirements of Section 10.15A may be allowed with a             Conditional Use Permit however because it is the intent for these properties to revert to Residential zoning after discontinuance of their use, there shall be a heavy burden on the applicant to demonstrate that there are not more suitable locations for the tower and that the proposed tower is appropriate in the location proposed. In any event, the maximum height of towers shall be shall be 65 feet. In determining whether the proposed tower is appropriate on these properties, the City shall consider such things as design, style, proximity to residentially zoned property, view sheds, camouflaging, lighting, and general aesthetics, while placing close attention to the potential for the proposed tower to be a nuisance to neighboring properties.

 

C.        Commercial wireless telecommunication service towers shall be of a monopole design unless the City Council determines that an alternative design would better blend in to the surrounding environment or better accommodate multiple use of the tower.

 

Subdivision 5.  Tower Setbacks.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the regulations applicable to a specific zoning district, towers shall conform to each of the following minimum setback requirements:

A.         Towers shall meet the setbacks of the underlying zoning district; however, in all non-residential zones, at a minimum, a tower shall be setback from residentially zoned property by at least two feet for each foot of height of the tower.

B.         Towers shall be set back from planned public rights of way of the City by a minimum distance equal to one half of the height of the tower including all antennas and attachments.

C.        Towers shall not be located between a principal structure and a public street, with the following exceptions:

1.      In industrial zoning districts, towers may be placed within a side yard abutting an internal industrial street.

2.      On sites adjacent to public streets on all sides, towers may be placed within a side yard abutting a local street.

D.         A tower’s setback may be reduced or its location in relation to a public street varied, at the sole discretion of the City Council, to allow the integration of a tower into an existing or proposed structure such as a church steeple, light standard, power line support device, or similar structure.

 

Subdivision 6.  Tower Height. 

A.         The height of towers shall be determined by measuring the vertical distance from the tower’s point of contact with the ground to the highest point of the tower, including all antennas or other attachments, and if the tower is mounted upon another structure, the height of that structure plus the vertical distance from the tower’s point of contact with the structure must be added together to determine the height of the tower.

B.         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the regulations applicable to a specific zoning district, towers are subject to the following restrictions on height:

1.      In all residential districts, the maximum height of any tower is 35 feet.

2.      In all other districts the maximum height of any tower is one foot for each two feet the tower is setback from residentially zoned property or 150 feet, whichever is less.

 

Subdivision 7.  Tower Lighting.  Towers shall not be illuminated by artificial means and shall not display strobe lights unless such lighting is specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other federal or state authority for a particular tower.  When incorporated into the approved design of the tower, light fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots, or similar areas may be attached to the tower.

 

Subdivision 8.  Signs and Advertising.  The use of any portion of a tower for signs other than warning or equipment information signs is prohibited.

 

Subdivision 9.  Accessory Utility Buildings.  All utility buildings and structures accessory to a tower shall be architecturally designed to blend in with the surrounding environment and shall meet the minimum setback requirements of the underlying zoning district.  Ground mounted equipment shall be screened from view by suitable vegetation, except where a design of non-vegetative screening better reflects and complements the architectural character of the surrounding neighborhood.

 

Subdivision 10.            Abandoned or Unused Towers or Portions of Towers.  Abandoned or unused towers or portions of towers shall be removed as follows:

A.         All abandoned or unused towers and associated facilities shall be removed within 12 months of the cessation of operations at the site unless a time extension is approved by the City Council.  In the event that a tower is not removed within 12 months of the cessation of operations at a site, the tower and associated facilities may be removed by the City and the costs of removal assessed against the property.

B.         Unused portions of towers above a manufactured connection shall be removed within 6 months of the time of antenna relocation.  The replacement of portions of a tower previously removed requires the issuance of a new conditional use permit.

 

Subdivision 11.            Antennas Mounted on Roofs, Walls, and Existing Towers.  The placement of wireless telecommunication antennas on roofs, walls, and existing towers may be approved by the City Council, provided the antennas meet the requirements of this Ordinance, after submittal of 1) a final site and building plan, and 2) a report prepared by a qualified and licensed professional engineer indicating the existing structure or tower=s suitability to accept the antenna and the proposed method of affixing the antenna to the structure.  Complete details of all fixtures and couplings, and the precise point of attachment shall be indicated in such report.

 

Subdivision 12.            Interference with Public Safety Telecommunications.  No new or existing telecommunications service shall interfere with public safety telecommunications.  All applications for new service shall be accompanied by an intermodulation study which provides a technical evaluation of existing and proposed transmissions and indicates all potential interference problems.  Before the introduction of new service or changes in existing service, telecommunication providers shall notify the City at least 10 calendar days in advance of such changes and allow the City to monitor interference levels during the testing process.

 

Subdivision 13.            Additional Submittal Requirements.  In addition to the information required elsewhere in this Ordinance, development applications for towers shall include the following supplemental information:

Subdivision 1.  PURPOSE

            A.        This ordinance is adopted for the purpose balancing a myriad of concerns, including but not limited to the accommodation of new technology; increasing societal demands for additional wireless network capacity; the protection of public investment of aesthetics in key zoning districts; ensure the appropriate use of public right of way; minimize unnecessary encumbrance in public right of way; protection of the health, safety, and welfare of Sauk Rapids’ citizens; and establish permitting processes that minimize administrative burdens for both the City and applicants.    

 

            Subdivision 2.  DEFINITIONS

                                    A.  Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the terms            used in this Section shall have the meanings designated to them as           provided in Minn. Stat. § 237.162 or Minn. R. 7819.0100.

 

            Subdivision 3.  APPROVAL

A.                 In processing and approving a small wireless facility permit, the City may condition its approval on compliance with generally applicable and reasonable health, safety, and welfare regulations consistent with the City’s public right-of-way management and any reasonable replacement, or relocation requirements when a new wireless support structure is placed in a public right-of-way.

 

B.                  The City has 90 days after the date a small wireless facility permit application is filed to issue or deny the permit.  If the City provides a written notice of incompleteness to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application, the 90 day period is tolled and the City shall follow the procedure set forth in Minn. Stat. § 237.163.  Unless a tolling provision applies, a small wireless facility permit may be deemed approved if the City fails to approve or deny the application within 90 days after the permit application has been filed.

 

Subdivision 4.  GENERAL

A.                 The term of a small wireless facility permit shall terminate                                    upon non-use of the small wireless facility unless the permit is                                         revoked sooner under this ordinance or other applicable law.

 

B.                  An applicant for a small wireless facility permit may file a                                   consolidated permit application to collocate up to a maximum of                              fifteen (15) small wireless facilities, provided that all the small wireless                                   facilities in the application: are located within a two-mile radius;                                   consist of substantially similar equipment; and are to be placed on                               similar types of wireless support structures.  In rendering a decision on                   a consolidated permit application, the City may approve a permit                                     for some small wireless facilities and deny a permit for others, but                                  may not use denial of one or more permits as a basis to deny all the                            small wireless facilities in the application.

 

C.                 If the City receives applications within a single seven-day                                  period from one or more applicants seeking approval of permits for                              more than 30 small wireless facilities, the City may extend the 90-day                     period for permit approval by an additional 30 days. If the City                            elects to invoke this extension, it shall inform in writing any applicant                                   to whom the extension will be applied. Minnesota Statutes Section                                     15.99 does not apply to this Section. 

 

Subdivision 5.  EXEMPTION

A.                 All of the following are exempt from small wireless facility permit requirements: routine maintenance of a small wireless facility; replacement of an existing small wireless facility with a new facility that is substantially similar or smaller in size, weight, height, and wind or structural loading than the small wireless facility being replaced; or installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or replacement of Micro Wireless Facilities that are suspended on cables strung between existing utility poles in compliance with national safety codes.

 

B.                  Notwithstanding, any person engaging in any activity described above shall provide the City at least fifteen (15) days advance written notification of such activities if the work will obstruct a public right-of-way.

 

Subdivision 6.  HEIGHT

A.        Each Wireless Support Structure installed in the right-of-way       shall not exceed 50 feet above ground level or more than 10 feet            above an existing Wireless Support Structure in place as of the             effective date of this ordinance, whichever is less.

 

Subdivision 7.  COLLOCATION ON CITY OWNED WIRELESS SUPPORT STRUCTURES 

A.                 A wireless service provider may collocate small wireless               facilities on wireless support structures owned or controlled by the   City and located within the public roads or rights-of-way subject to a            small wireless facility collocation agreement.

 

B.                  All engineering and construction work associated with   collocation must be paid by the wireless service provider.

 

C.                 In addition to other fees or charges allowed under this   chapter, the City shall charge each small wireless facility attached       to a wireless support structure owned by the City the maximum rent,      fees, and charges authorized by state law.          

 

Subdivision 8.  DECORATIVE LIGHT POLES AND STREETSCAPING

A.        In select areas within the City, especially in the D-1 Historic        Downtown Business District, the City has spent significant public      funds to install upgraded standard light poles to decorative light         poles with banners and streetscaping such as benches and sidewalk        furnishings, stone and sculptured elements, decorative trash     receptacles, and ornamental trees and vegetation. Special           assessments on businesses within the D-1 Historic Downtown Business             District have also significantly contributed to financing of decorative    light poles and streetscaping. The purpose of the decorative light poles and streetscaping is to preserve and advance a “Historic Main Street” appearance together with strict building, sign, utility, and landscaping aesthetic requirements in the D-1 Historic Downtown Business District. The location of small wireless facilities on decorative light poles and streetscaping will disrupt the sought after appearance and nullify the significant investments made by the City and business within the D-1 Historic Downtown Business District. Further, decorative light poles are not designed to accommodate small cell wireless facilities and locating small cell wireless facilities on expensive decorative light poles likely voids any warranty. Small cell wireless facilities are therefore prohibited on decorative light poles and streetscaping within the public right of way.

 

Subdivision 9.  CITY-OWNED BUILDINGS AND SIGNS

A.        Nothing in this Section shall be construed to allow the                collocation on city-owned buildings or associated signs, flag poles,       or other site-specific structures located adjacent to public right of             way.

 

SECTION          10.15C  ENERGY PROJECTS

 

Subd. 1.           Purpose.

Subdivision 17.  Dynamic Displays.

A.        Findings.  Studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers. Distraction can lead to traffic accidents. Drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message, but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message. Drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur. Drivers are also distracted by messages that do not tell the full story in one look. People have a natural desire to see the end of the story and will continue to look at the sign in order to wait for the end. Additionally, drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message, such as fade-ins and fade-outs. Finally, drivers are generally more distracted by messages that are too small to be clearly seen or that contain more than a simple message. Time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short, easily absorbed, and become inaccurate without frequent changes.

            Despite these public safety concerns, there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages. Except as prohibited by state or federal law, sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain restrictions. The restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact residential character.

            Local spacing requirements could interfere with the equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included. Without those requirements, however, there is the potential for numerous dynamic displays to exist along any roadway. If more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given location on a road, the minimum display time becomes critical. If the display time is too short, a driver could be subjected to a view that appears to have constant movement. This impact would obviously be compounded in a corridor with multiple signs. If dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each sign's ability to change frequently, drivers may be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload. Therefore, a longer display time is appropriate.

            A constant message is typically needed on a sign so that the public can use it to identify and find an intended destination. Changing messages detract from this way-finding purpose and could adversely affect driving conduct through last-second lane changes, stops, or turns, which could result in traffic accidents. Accordingly, dynamic displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign.

            In conclusion, the city finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential threats to public safety.

B.         Regulations.  Dynamic displays on signs are allowed subject to the following conditions:

1.     Dynamic displays are allowed only on monument signs where otherwise allowed in the C-1, C-2, C-3, D-1 and I-1 Districts. In addition, Dynamic Display Signs are allowed on billboards located within the delineated areas defined in Subdivision 12. A. 1. and that are in all other respects to Subdivision 3. F. of this Section, considered conforming;

Subdivision 18.  Brightness Standards.

A.     All signs must meet the following brightness standards in addition to those in Subdivision 17:

     1.     No sign may be brighter than is necessary for clear and adequate visibility.

     2.     No sign may be of such intensity or brilliance as to impair the vision of a motor vehicle driver with average eyesight or to otherwise interfere with the driver's operation of a motor vehicle.

     3.     No sign may be of such intensity or brilliance that it interferes with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign, device or signal.

B.     The person owning or controlling the sign must adjust the sign to meet the brightness standards in accordance with the city's instructions. The adjustment must be made immediately upon notice of non-compliance from the city.

C.     All signs installed after March 1, 2008 that will have illumination by a means other than natural light must be equipped with a mechanism that automatically adjusts the brightness in response to ambient conditions. These signs must also be equipped with a means to immediately turn off the display or lighting if it malfunctions, and the sign owner or operator must immediately turn off the sign or lighting when notified by the city that it is not complying with the standards in this section.

 

 

 SECTION 10.17           CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS

 

Subdivision 1. Purpose.  The purpose of this Section of the Zoning Ordinance is to provide the City with a reasonable degree of discretion in determining the suitability of certain designated uses upon the general welfare and public safety.  This is accomplished through a Conditional Use Permit, which may be granted by the City Council for uses designated within a district as Permitted Conditional Uses when such uses are in harmony with both the zoning district in which it will be located and the objectives of the comprehensive plan.  In the granting of its approval, the City Council may impose such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building structure or use as it may deem advisable.

Subdivision 6.  Lapse of Variance.

If within one (1) year after granting a variance the work permitted is not started, such variance becomes null and void unless a petition for an extension has been approved by the City Council.

 

SECTION 10.17D.  ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW

 

Subdivision 1.        Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to determine whether certain projects have or may have the potential for significant environmental effects and should undergo the special review procedures of the Minnesota Environmental Review Program.  Procedures for EAWs and EISs are set forth in the Minnesota Environmental Quality Review Board (EQB) regulations for the Environmental Review Program authorized by Minnesota Statute 116D.04 and 116D.04S and specified in Minnesota Rules Parts 4410.0200 to 4410.7800.

 

Subdivision 2.        Cost of Preparation and Review.

A.     Information to be Provided. The applicant for a permit for any action for which environmental documents are required either by State law or by the City Council shall supply in the manner prescribed by the City Administrator, or representative, all unprivileged data or information reasonably requested by the city that the applicant has in their possession or to which the applicant has reasonable access.

B.      Environmental Assessment Worksheets. The applicant for a permit for any action for which an Environmental Assessment Worksheet (EAW) is required either by State law or rules or by the City Council, shall pay all costs of preparation and review of the EAW, and, upon the request of and in the manner prescribed by the City Administrator, or representative, shall prepare a draft EAW and supply all information necessary to adequately complete that document.

C.     Alternative Urban Areawide Review.  The Alternative Urban Areawide Review (AUAR) process substitutes for any EAW, AUAR, or EIS required for specific qualifying projects.  The city may decide that an AUAR be completed instead of an EAW, provided:

1.      It is for a project that complies with the review assumptions and mitigation measures.

2.      If the projected area to be reviewed is covered by the comprehensive plan.

3.      The content and format of the review is similar to that of an EAW, but provide for a level of analysis comparable to that of an EIS for impacts typical of urban residential, commercial warehousing, and light industrial development and associated infrastructure.

4.      It covers the possible impacts through a “worst case scenario” analysis or else prevents the impacts through the provisions of the mitigation plan.  Failure to cover possible impacts by one of these means risks the invalidation of the environmental review exemption for specific development projects.

D.     Environmental Impact Statement.  All projects requiring an EIS must have an EAW on file with the City, which will be used to determine the scope of the EIS. All EISs shall be prepared according to the procedures and requirements of the State Environmental Review Program, Rules 4410.2100-4410.3000, as may be amended.  The costs of preparation of an EIS shall be assessed to the project proposer in accordance with Minnesota Rules Parts 4410.6000 to 4100.6500, as may be amended.

E.      Payment of costs. No permit, for an action for which an EAW or an EIS is required, shall be issued until all costs of preparation and review, which are to be paid by the applicant are paid, and all information required is supplied in adequate detail and until the environmental review process has been completed as provided in this section.  The owner shall deposit with the City a letter of credit in a form acceptable to the City, in an amount as determined by the City Finance Director, necessary to cover the total costs associated with the environmental review. 

 

Subdivision 3.        Administration.

A.     The City Administrator, or representative, shall be the person responsible for the administration of the environmental review program, this chapter, and the rules adopted by reference by this chapter.

B.      The City Community Development Director shall be responsible for determining whether an action for which a permit is required is an action for which an EAW is mandatory under Minnesota Rules 4410.4300, as may be amended.  The City Community Development Director may suggest and/or the City Council may require the preparation of a discretionary EAW if it is determined that an action for which a permit is required may have some significant environmental impact or when there is a perception of such, provided that the project is not specifically exempted by Minnesota Rules 4410.4600, as may be amended.

C.     All EAWs and EISs shall be prepared under the direction of the City Community Development Director and reviewed and approved by the City Council. 

D.     During the thirty (30) day comment period that follows publication of the notice of availability of the EAW in the EQB Monitor, the Planning Commission shall review the EAW. The Commission shall make recommendations to the City Council regarding potential environmental impacts that may warrant further investigation before the project is commenced and the need for an EIS on the proposed project.

E.      When reviewing an EAW, AUAR, or EIS , the City Community Development Director and the Planning Commission may suggest design alterations that would lessen the environmental impact of the action. The City Council may require these design alterations to be made as a condition for issuing the permit when it finds that the design alterations are necessary to lessen the environmental impact on the action.

F.       The Council shall base its decision on the need for an EIS and the proposed scope of an EIS on the information gathered during the EAW process and on the comments received on the EAW.  An EIS shall be prepared for any project that meets or exceeds the thresholds of any of the EIS categories listed in Minnesota Rules 4410.4400, as may be amended.  An EIS shall also be prepared when the City Council determines that, based on the EAW and any comments or additional information received during the EAW comment period, the proposed project has the potential for significant environmental effects, or when the City Council and the proposer of the project agree that an EIS should be prepared.  Pursuant to Minnesota Rules 4410,1700, in deciding whether a project has the potential for significant environmental effects, the following factors shall be considered:

1.   Type, extent and reversibility of environmental effects.

2.   Cumulative potential effects of related or anticipated future projects.

3.   The extent to which the environmental effects are subject to mitigation by ongoing public regulatory authority.

4.   The extent to which environmental effects can be anticipated and controlled as a result of other environmental studies undertaken by public agencies or the project proposer, or of EISs previously prepared on similar projects.

G.    All projects requiring an EIS must have an EAW on file with the City, which will be used to determine the scope of the EIS. All EISs shall be prepared according to the procedures and requirements of the State Environmental Review Program, Rules 4410.2100-4410.3000, as may be amended. The costs of preparation of an EIS shall be assessed to the project proposer in accordance with Minnesota Rules Parts 4410.6000 to 4100.6500, as may be amended.  All EISs shall be prepared according to the procedures and requirements of the State Environmental Review Program,

 

Subdivision 4.  Enforcement and Penalty.

A.     No permit shall be issued for a project for which environmental documents are required until the entire environmental review procedures established by this chapter have been completed.

B.      Any person who violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisonment for ninety (90) days or both. Each day that the violation is permitted to exist constitutes a separate offense.

C.     No work shall commence, and any work in progress on any project for which environmental documents are required shall cease, until the environmental review procedures established by this chapter are fully complied with.

 

SECTION 10.17E: WETLAND MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE

 

Subd 1.      Purpose

The purpose of these regulations is to achieve the policies described in the City’s Comprehensive Wetland Protection and Management Plan (Plan) relating to the protection and management of wetlands and to adopt the Wetland Conservation Act.

 

Subd 2.      Administration, Applicability, and Effective Date

The City Council hereby designates the City Administrator as the Administrator of these regulations.  Upon approval of the City of Sauk Rapids Comprehensive Wetland Protection and Management Plan, the City of Sauk Rapids assumes the responsibility as Local Government Unit (LGU) for the Wetland Conservation Act (WCA), as defined and required in Minnesota Rule 8420, as amended.

 

                  A. This ordinance shall take effect after the City publishes it in the official newspaper.

 

                  B. Except as specified elsewhere in this ordinance, this ordinance shall apply to all real property which is located in a wetland, or any person or use that would            impact a wetland after adoption of this ordinance

 

                  C. The City adopts the wetland management classification map and Plan          dated March 26, 2012, which is based on wetland classifications from the            MnRAM assessment. 

 

                        a.         The City Council may adopt changes to the City Wetland Protection              and Management Plan Map which are based on MnRAM assessments.

                 

                        b.         Any wetland not currently assigned a classification based on the                                      MnRAM assessment as of the date of the adoption of this ordinance will                           need to be assessed using MnRAM 3.3 (or most current version) and                                           submitted to the City for review and classification. Based on the                                         assessment, the City Staff will place the wetland into a management                                  category.

 

Subd 3.      Definitions

 

City Wetland Protection and Management Plan Map:  This map was developed as part of the Wetland Protection and Management Plan and shows the general locations of wetlands within the City.  While an attempt was made to locate all wetlands within the City, omission of a wetland from this map does not exclude that wetland from this regulation.

 

Growing Season:  As defined in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (January 1987), including subsequent updates and supplements.

 

Impact: As defined in the Wetland Conservation Act, Minnesota Rule 8420, as amended.

 

Minnesota Routine Assessment Method (MnRAM):  A scientific methodology to assess the quality of wetlands.

 

Sequencing: A five-step process outlined in the Wetland Conservation Act that evaluates the necessity of a project’s impact on a wetland.

 

Shoreland Protection Zone: As defined under Minnesota Rule 8420, as amended

 

Storm water pond:  A pond that has been created to capture and treat storm water runoff.  Storm water is often piped into storm water ponds but may also enter through sheet runoff.

 

Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP):  As defined in Minnesota Rule 8420.0240, Subpt. A, as amended. This panel provides technical guidance and recommendations to the Local Government Unit. 

 

Wetland: Wetlands means those areas of the city inundated or saturated by groundwater or surface water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions; or as defined under Minnesota Rule 8420, as amended.

 

Subd 4.      Wetland Management

                  A.  Boundaries.   This regulation shall apply to those areas which are defined        and delineated as jurisdictional wetland as per the U.S. Army Corps of    Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (January 1987), including subsequent            updates and supplements. These areas are shown in general on the City’s                   Wetland Protection and Management Plan map.  This map also shows the          management classifications for each wetland that was assessed as part of the           Plan and that pertain to this regulation. 

 

                  These areas shall be field reviewed by the applicant’s trained wetland     professional and reviewed for accuracy by City Staff if work is proposed within    or         adjacent to the wetland.  The presence or absence of a wetland on the            City’s Wetland Protection and Management Plan map does not represent a             definitive determination as to whether a wetland covered by this regulation is                   present or not.  It is the responsibility of the applicant to determine whether a      wetland exists on a subject property.

 

B. Application.  The applicant shall submit the Minnesota Local/State/Federal Application Forms for Water/Wetland Projects to the Administrator for approval prior to any work that will impact wetlands.  The Administrator shall follow the review timelines and notice requirements as outlined in the Wetland Conservation Act as set forth in Minnesota Rules Chapter 8420, as amended. 

 

C. Wetland Regulations.  The Wetland Conservation Act, as amended, and the rules implementing the Wetland Conservation Act as set forth in Minnesota Rules Chapter 8420, as amended, are incorporated as part of these regulations and shall govern draining, filling, and dredging in wetlands.  Where the City’s Comprehensive Wetland Protection and Management Plan deviates from the Wetland Conservation Act, the Comprehensive Wetland Protection and Management Plan shall apply.

 

                  D. Wetland Management.  Wetlands within the City shall be managed as outlined below:

 

                        1.         Wetland Mitigation and Sequencing.   Mitigation ratios and                                                   Sequencing for the different management classifications will be as follows:

 

                        Preserve:        Wetlands in this category shall receive the maximum amount                           of protection under this CWPMP.  Avoidance is strongly recommended and                   impacts will be allowed only under extreme hardship. Applications will be                                   reviewed and decided upon on a case by case basis. Extreme hardship                                will be determined by the City which shall rely on its variance standards as                                  defined in Section 10 of the City Code to determine extreme hardship.                    Mitigation of permitted impacts to wetlands in this category will vary                                             depending on the weighted average wetland rating for vegetative                                                    diversity/integrity as        calculated by the MnRAM analysis and provided in                                     Appendix D. Sequencing is required as per Minnesota Rule 8420.

 

Ø     Exceptional    = 6:1

Ø     High/Mod/Low          = 3:1

 

                  Manage 1: Wetlands in this category will be managed under this CWPMP to                     maintain their existing functions and values. Therefore, mitigation of permitted   impacts to wetlands in this category will be at a 2.5:1 ratio. Sequencing is         required as per Minnesota Rule 8420.

 

                  Manage 2: Wetlands in this category will be managed under this CWPMP to         maintain and improve, through restoration where applicable, their existing     functions and values. Therefore, mitigation of permitted impacts to wetlands in   this category will be at a 2:1 ratio. Sequencing is required as per Minnesota      Rule 8420.

 

                  Manage 3: Wetlands in this category may be utilized in the City’s stormwater       management system and will be restored wherever possible. Therefore,            mitigation of permitted impacts to wetlands in this category will be at a 1:1        ratio. Sequencing flexibility may be applied for impacts proposed to these         wetlands. 

 

Subd. 5      Exemptions. 

                  Those exemptions outlined in the Wetland Conservation Act as set forth in            Minnesota Rules 8420, as amended, are exempt from this Section. 

 

Subd. 6      Performance Bond Required.

                  If an approved application includes wetland impacts, the Applicant must          provide financial assurance with the Administrator as per Minnesota Rule             8420.0522, Subp. 9, or as amended.

 

Subd. 7      Administrative Procedures

                  A.  The City of Sauk Rapids is authorized by Minnesota Rules Part 8420.0200,         Subpart 2, to delegate certain Local Government Unit functions with regard to        implementation of the Wetland Conservation Act to City Staff.

 

                  B.  City of Sauk Rapids Staff is defined by the City and as required by        Minnesota Rule 8420.

 

                  C.  The City Council of the City of Sauk Rapids places decision authority for          exemption, no loss, and wetland boundary and type determinations with City            of Sauk Rapids staff.

 

                  D.  Decision authority for replacement plan and wetland banking             determinations are placed with the City Council of the City of Sauk Rapids.

 

                  E.  City of Sauk Rapids staff may request that decisions for exemption, no loss,      and wetland boundary and type determinations be made by the City          Council.

 

Subd. 8      Appeals and Enforcement

                  A.  Enforcement:  Enforcement of the Wetland Conservation Act shall be in          accordance with Minnesota Rules 8420, as amended. City enforcement   procedures shall be followed where this Comprehensive Wetland Protection           and Management Plan is more restrictive than the Wetland Conservation Act.

 

B. Appeals of Management Classification: The management classification of a wetland         can be appealed by the landowner or project proposer.  This appeal must be           submitted to the Administrator in writing and include documentation      supporting the reasons for placing a wetland into a different management            class.  This written appeal must be submitted to the Administrator prior to or   along with the wetland impact permit application.  A fee will be required for       each wetland being appealed.  The appeal will be reviewed by City Staff.  A   decision on the appeal will be made in accordance with Minnesota Rule          8420, as amended. The appellant will be notified in writing of the TEP’s                   recommendation, if applicable, and the City’s decision on the appeal.

 

C. Appeals of Wetland Conservation Act Decisions:  Appeals of exemption, no-loss,    wetland boundary, wetland type, sequencing, replacement plan, or banking        plan decisions made by the City will follow the appeal process in accordance            with Minnesota Rules 8420, as amended.

 

Subd. 9      Recovery of Wetland Enforcement Costs

                  Necessary costs, including but not limited to consulting fees, incurred by the        City as a result of wetland violations will be billed directly to the responsible         party. If the responsible party is different from the property owner, the City will     notify the property owner of the charges. If the responsible party or property   owner does not pay the applicable charges, the City may assess any unpaid     fees to the respective property or recover the unpaid fees by any other legal       means.

SAUK RAPIDS FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE

THREE DISTRICT - ONE-MAP FORMAT1

1A Flood Insurance Rate Map has been published for the community and the Regulatory Floodway boundary is   shown on this map.  A separate Flood Boundary and Floodway Map has not been published.

 

 
SECTION  1.0   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT AND PURPOSE
 

1.1 Statutory Authorization:  The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minnesota Statutes, Chapters 103F and 462, delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.  Therefore, the City Council of the City of Sauk Rapids, Minnesota does ordain as follows:

 

1.2 Findings of Fact:

 

1.21   The flood hazard areas of Sauk Rapids, Minnesota, are subject to periodic inundation which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures or flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

 

1.22   Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards.  This Ordinance is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

 

        1.23  National Flood Insurance Program Compliance.  This Ordinance is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59 -78, as amended, so as to maintain the community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.                 

           

1.3 Statement of Purpose:  It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section 1.21 by provisions contained herein.

 

 

SECTION  2.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS
 

2.1 Lands to Which Ordinance Applies:  This Ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of   the City of Sauk Rapids within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe and General Floodplain Districts.

 

2.2 Adoption of Flood Insurance Study and Flood Insurance Rate Map. The following materials are attached to this Ordinance by reference: 1)  the Flood Insurance Study, Benton County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas, the Flood Insurance Rate Map Index for Benton County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas with map number 27009CIND0B, and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map panels for Benton County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas with map numbers 27009C0252E,  27009C0256E, 27009C0257E,  27009C0258E, 27009C0259E, 27009C0276E and 27009C0278E; all of these documents being  dated August 16, 2011 and prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 2) the Letter of Map Revision for the City of Sauk Rapids issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Map Number 2700230002D) with an effective date of January 23, 2008, and including all revised flood insurance rate map panels, flood profiles, tables and floodway data tables therein.  The Official Zoning Map shall be on file at Sauk Rapids City Hall.

 

2.3 Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation:  The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a floodway.

 

2.4 Interpretation:

 

2.41     In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.

 

2.42   The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the Official Zoning Map.  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the Official Zoning Map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment shall make the necessary interpretation.  All decisions will be based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the Community adopted its initial floodplain ordinance or on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the 100-year floodplain if earlier, and other available technical data.  Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the Board of Adjustment and to submit technical evidence.

 

2.5 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions:  It is not intended by this Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.  However, where this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail.  All other ordinances inconsistent with this Ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.

 

2.6 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability:  This Ordinance does not imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages.  This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Sauk Rapids or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

 

2.7 Severability:  If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this Ordinance is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Ordinance shall not be affected thereby.

 

2.8 Definitions:  Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the same meaning as they have in common usage and so as to give this Ordinance its most reasonable application.

 

2.811 Accessory Use or Structure - a use or structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal use or structure.

 

2.812 Basement - means any area of a structure, including crawl spaces, having its floor or base subgrade (below ground level) on all four sides, regardless of the depth of excavation below ground level.

 

2.813 Conditional Use - means a specific type of structure or land use listed in the official control that may be allowed but only after an in-depth review procedure and with appropriate conditions or restrictions as provided in the official zoning controls or building codes and upon a finding that:

(a)    Certain conditions as detailed in the zoning ordinance exist.

(b)   The structure and/or land use conform to the comprehensive land use plan if one exists and are compatible with the existing neighborhood.

 

2.814 Equal Degree of Encroachment - a method of determining the location of floodway boundaries so that flood plain lands on both sides of a stream are capable of conveying a proportionate share of flood flows.

 

2.815 Flood - a temporary increase in the flow or stage of a stream or in the stage of a wetland or lake that results in the inundation of normally dry areas.

 

2.816 Flood Frequency - the frequency for which it is expected that a specific flood stage or discharge may be equaled or exceeded.

 

2.817 Flood Fringe - that portion of the flood plain outside of the floodway.  Flood fringe is synonymous with the term "floodway fringe" used in the Flood Insurance Study, Benton County, Minnesota And Incorporated Areas.

2.821 Lowest Floor - the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement).  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor.

 

2.822 Manufactured Home - a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities.  The term “manufactured home” does not include the term “recreational vehicle.” 

 

2.823 Obstruction - any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, projection, excavation, channel modification, culvert, building, wire, fence, stockpile, refuse, fill, structure, or matter in, along, across, or projecting into any channel, watercourse, or regulatory flood plain which may impede, retard, or change the direction of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris carried by such water.

 

2.824 Principal Use or Structure - means all uses or structures that are not accessory uses or structures.

 

2.825 Reach - a hydraulic engineering term to describe a longitudinal segment of a stream or river influenced by a natural or man-made obstruction.  In an urban area, the segment of a stream or river between two consecutive bridge crossings would most typically constitute a reach.

For the purposes of this Ordinance, the term recreational vehicle shall be synonymous with the term travel trailer/travel vehicle.

 

2.827 Regional Flood - a flood which is representative of large floods known to have occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 100-year recurrence interval.  Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood" used in a flood insurance study.

 

2.828 Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation - The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the flood plain that result from designation of a floodway.

 

2.829 Structure - anything constructed or erected on the ground or attached to the ground or on-site utilities, including, but not limited to, buildings, factories, sheds, detached garages, cabins, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles not meeting the exemption criteria specified in Section 9.31 of this Ordinance and other similar items.

 

2.830 Substantial Damage - means damage of any origin sustained by a structure where the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

 

2.831 Substantial Improvement - within any consecutive 365-day period, any reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement.  This term includes structures that have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed.  The term does not, however, include either:

 

(a)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.

 

(b)   Any alteration of an “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an “historic structure.”  For the purpose of this Ordinance, “historic structure” shall be as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 59.1.

 

 2.832 Variance - means a modification of a specific permitted development standard required in an official control including this Ordinance to allow an alternative development standard not stated as acceptable in the official control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as defined and elaborated upon in a community's respective planning and zoning enabling legislation.

 

2.9   Annexations:  The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into Section 2.2 above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the City of Sauk Rapids at the time of adoption of this ordinance.  If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the City of Sauk Rapids after the date of adoption of this ordinance, the newly annexed floodplain lands shall be subject to the provisions of this ordinance immediately upon the date of annexation into the City of Sauk Rapids.

4.37           Recreational vehicles either on individual lots of record or in existing or new subdivisions or commercial or condominium type campgrounds, subject to the exemptions and provisions of Section 9.3 of this Ordinance.

 

4.38           Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes and floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the 10-year frequency flood event.

 

4.4 Standards for Floodway Conditional Uses:

 

4.41           All Uses.  No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected.

 

4.42           All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained in Section 10.4 of this Ordinance.

 

4.43           The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district if one exists.

 

4.44           Fill:

(a)    Fill, dredge spoil, and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the flood plain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method.

(b)    Dredge spoil sites and sand and gravel operations shall not be allowed in the floodway unless a long-term site development plan is submitted which includes an erosion/sedimentation prevention element to the plan.

(c)    As an alternative, and consistent with Subsection (b) immediately above, dredge spoil disposal and sand and gravel operations may allow temporary, on-site storage of fill or other materials which would have caused an increase to the stage of the 100-year or regional flood but only after the Governing Body has received an appropriate plan which assures the removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available.  The conditional use permit must be title registered with the property in the Office of the County Recorder.

 

4.45           Accessory Structures:

(a)  Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation.

(b)    Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood waters:

(1)    Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and

(2)    So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.

(c)    Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classifications in the State Building Code.  As an alternative, an accessory structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage.  All flood proofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards:

(1)    The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls;

(2)    Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly flood proofed; and

(3)    To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two

“automatic” openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding.  There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure.  Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.

 

4.46           Storage of Materials and Equipment:

(a)    The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.

(b)    Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the Governing Body.

 

4.47           Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters shall be subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statute, Chapter 103G.  Community-wide structural works for flood control intended to remove areas from the regulatory flood plain shall not be allowed in the floodway.

 

4.48           A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway shall not cause an increase to the 100-year or regional flood and the technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream.

 

 

SECTION  5.0 FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF)

 

5.1 Permitted Uses:  Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s).  If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential or non residential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted use in the Flood Fringe District provided such use does not constitute a public nuisance.  All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for Flood Fringe District “Permitted Uses” listed in Section 5.2 and the "Standards for all Flood Fringe Uses" listed in Section 5.5.

 

5.2 Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:

 

5.21           All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation.  The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one (1) foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least fifteen (15) feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.

 

5.22           As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its largest projection may be internally flood proofed in accordance with Section 4.45 (c).

 

5.23           This section reserved for future use.

 

5.24           The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation.

 

5.25           The provisions of Section 5.5 of this Ordinance shall apply.

 

5.3 Conditional Uses:  Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood proofed in accordance with Section 5.21 - 5.22 and or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in Section 5.23 - 5.24 shall only be allowable as a conditional use.  An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in Sections 5.4-5.5 and 10.4 of this Ordinance.

 

5.4 Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses:

 

5.41           Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation.  These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages.  The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if:  1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage.  The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards:

(a)    Design and Certification - The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the State Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding.

(b)    Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas - Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:

(1)    A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique.  There shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade.  The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice.  The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and

(2)    That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.

 

5.42           Basements, as defined by Section 2.812 of this Ordinance, shall be subject to the following:

(a)    Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation.

(b)    Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood proofed in accordance with Section 5.43 of this Ordinance.

 

5.43           All areas of non residential structures including basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood proofed in accordance with the structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the State Building Code.  Structurally dry flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classification in the State Building Code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.  Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted.

 

5.44           This section reserved for future use.

 

5.45           Storage of Materials and Equipment:

(a)    The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.

(b)    Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the Governing Body.

 

5.46           The provisions of Section 5.5 of this Ordinance shall also apply.

 

5.5 Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses:

 

5.51   This section reserved for future use.

 

5.52           Commercial Uses - accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation.  However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four (4) upon occurrence of the regional flood.

 

5.53           Manufacturing and Industrial Uses - measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations.  Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in Section 5.52 above.  In considering permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in flood plain areas.

 

5.54           Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation - FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments.  These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.

 

5.55           Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the Official Zoning Map.

 

5.56           Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in Section 9.3.

 

5.57           All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement.  Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.  This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

 

 

SECTION  6.0 GENERAL FLOOD PLAIN DISTRICT
 

6.1 Permissible Uses: 

 

6.11  The uses listed in Section 4.1 of this Ordinance shall be permitted uses.

 

6.12           All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria pursuant to Section 6.2 below.  Section 4.0 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Floodway District and Section 5.0 shall apply if the proposed use is in the Flood Fringe District.

 

6.2  Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations Within the General Flood Plain District.

 

6.21   Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the General Flood Plain District, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use is within the Floodway or Flood Fringe District.

(a)  A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water information.

(b)  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground, pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, and the location and elevations of streets.

(c)  Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and downstream,  and soil     types.

(d)    Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development.

 

6.22 The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District and to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation.  Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000 - 6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation.  The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective Department of Natural Resources' Area Hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis.  The designated engineer or expert shall:

(a)    Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood.

(b)    Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.

(c)    Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot.  A lesser stage increase than .5' shall be required if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increased flood damages would result.  An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries.

 

6.23 The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and findings of the designated engineer or expert to the Governing Body.  The Governing Body must formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the permit application.  The Governing Body, prior to official action, may submit the application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Natural Resources or the Planning Commission for review and comment.  Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District Boundaries have been determined, the Governing Body shall refer the matter back to the Zoning Administrator who shall process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of Section 4.0 and 5.0 of this Ordinance.

 

 

SECTION  7.0 SUBDIVISIONS2 

 

 

7.1 Review Criteria:  No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities.  All lots within the flood plain districts shall be able to contain a building site outside of the Floodway District at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation.  All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this Ordinance and have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation.  For all subdivisions in the flood plain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting documents

 

7.2 Floodway/Flood Fringe Determinations in the General Flood Plain District:  In the General Flood Plain District, applicants shall provide the information required in Section 6.2 of this Ordinance to determine the 100-year flood elevation, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site.

 

 

 

SECTION  8.0 PUBLIC UTILITIES, RAILROADS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES
 

8.1 Public Utilities.  All public utilities and facilities such as gas, electrical, sewer, and water supply systems to be located in the flood plain shall be flood proofed in accordance with the State Building Code or elevated to above the regulatory flood protection elevation.

 

8.2 Public Transportation Facilities.  Railroad tracks, roads, and bridges to be located within the flood plain shall comply with Sections 4.0 and 5.0 of this Ordinance.  Elevation to the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be provided where failure or interruption of these transportation facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area.  Minor or auxiliary roads or railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety.

 

8.3 On-site Sewage Treatment and Water Supply Systems:  Where public utilities are not provided:  1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) New or replacement on-site sewage treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they shall not be subject to impairment or contamination during times of flooding.  Any sewage treatment system designed in accordance with the State's current statewide standards for on-site sewage treatment systems shall be determined to be in compliance with this Section.

 

 

SECTION  9.0 MANUFACTURED HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS AND PLACEMENT OF RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.

 

9.1 New manufactured home parks and expansions to existing manufactured home parks shall be subject to the provisions placed on subdivisions by Section 7.0 of this Ordinance.

 

9.2 The placement of new or replacement manufactured homes in existing manufactured home parks or on individual lots of record that are located in flood plain districts will be treated as a new structure and may be placed only if elevated in compliance with Section 5.0 of this Ordinance.  If vehicular road access for pre-existing manufactured home parks is not provided in accordance with Section 5.51, then replacement manufactured homes will not be allowed until the property owner(s) develops a flood warning emergency plan acceptable to the Governing Body.

 

9.21           All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement.  Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.  This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

 

9.3 Recreational vehicles that do not meet the exemption criteria specified in Section 9.31 below shall be subject to the provisions of this Ordinance and as specifically spelled out in Sections 9.33-9.34 below.

 

9.31           Exemption - Recreational vehicles are exempt from the provisions of this Ordinance if they are placed in any of the areas listed in Section 9.32 below and further they meet the following criteria:

(a)    Have current licenses required for highway use.

(b)    Are highway ready meaning on wheels or the internal jacking system, are attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities commonly used in campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks and the recreational vehicle has no permanent structural type additions attached to it.

(c)    The recreational vehicle and associated use must be permissible in any pre-existing, underlying zoning use district.

 

9.32           Areas Exempted For Placement of Recreational Vehicles:

The Zoning Administrator shall also maintain a record of the elevation to which structures or alterations and additions to structures are flood proofed.

 

10.28 Notifications for Watercourse Alterations.  The Zoning Administrator shall notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources prior to the community authorizing any alteration or relocation of a watercourse.  If the applicant has applied for a permit to work in the beds of public waters pursuant to Minnesota Statute, Chapter 103G, this shall suffice as adequate notice to the Commissioner of Natural Resources.  A copy of said notification shall also be submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

 

10.29 Notification to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase or Decrease the 100-year Flood Elevation.  As soon as is practicable, but not later than six (6) months after the date such supporting information becomes available, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy of said technical or scientific data.

 

10.3   Board of Adjustment:

 

10.31         Rules.  The Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules for the conduct of business and may exercise all of the powers conferred on such Boards by State law.

 

10.32         Administrative Review.  The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement or administration of this Ordinance.

 

10.33         Variances.  The Board of Adjustment may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such relief or variance from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest and only for those circumstances such as hardship, practical difficulties or circumstances unique to the property under consideration, as provided for in the respective enabling legislation for planning and zoning for cities or counties as appropriate.  In the granting of such variance, the Board of Adjustment shall clearly identify in writing the specific conditions that existed consistent with the criteria specified in this Ordinance, any other zoning regulations in the Community, and in the respective enabling legislation that justified the granting of the variance.  No variance shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state law.  The following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:

        

(a)  Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(b)  Variances shall only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(c)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

 

10.34         Hearings.  Upon filing with the Board of Adjustment of an appeal from a decision of the Zoning Administrator, or an application for a variance, the Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for a hearing and give due notice to the parties in interest as specified by law.  The Board of Adjustment shall submit by mail to the Commissioner of Natural Resources a copy of the application for proposed variances sufficiently in advance so that the Commissioner will receive at least ten days notice of the hearing.

 

10.35         Decisions.  The Board of Adjustment shall arrive at a decision on such appeal or variance within 60 days.  If the Board of Adjustment needs additional time to arrive at a decision, this can be extended one time for an additional 60 days. In passing upon an appeal, the Board of Adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning Administrator or other public official.

A.              The Planning Commission in its review of a preliminary plat will take into consideration the requirements of the community and the best use of the land being subdivided.  Particular attention will be given to the arrangement, location and widths of streets; storm water drainage or ponding, lot sizes and arrangements, as well as requirements for parks.  Developers are encouraged to offer a variety of lot sizes rather than minimums.

 

B.              The preliminary plat must cover all of the subdivider's contiguous land, but the final plat may cover only a portion of the preliminary plat, provided it is in conformance with an approved preliminary plat and other requirements herein.

 

C.              Where the parcel is subdivided into outlots, such parcels shall be divided so as to allow for the opening of major streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor streets.

 

D.              Unplatted strips or private streets controlling access to public ways are prohibited.

 

E.              As part of the review process, the City Engineer may prepare an Engineering Study indicating the proposed design of required utilities and improvements, including drainage considerations.  The cost for these studies shall become part of the assessable cost of improvements.  Where a project is not completed, for whatever reason, the developer shall be responsible for these engineering costs.

Drainage and utility easements at least ten feet (10') wide on front lot lines, except on cul de sacs where they shall be fifteen feet (15') wide, and at least five feet (5') wide on side and rear lines, shall be provided.  They shall have continuity of alignment from block to block and at deflection points.  Except where the engineering study concludes otherwise, all side and rear yard easements shall be for drainage purposes only.  For purposes of this Section, the term drainage shall include all above and below ground structures, including pipes, manholes, catch basins and culverts, as well as surface grading.  Easements for pole line anchors may be required in Industrial/Commercial areas where aerial utilities still exist.

 

B.              Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainageway, channel, or stream, a drainage or storm water easement  shall be provided conforming substantially with the lines of such water courses.

 

Subd.  7.         Block Standards.

 

A.              The maximum length of blocks shall be eighteen hundred feet (1800').  Blocks over three hundred feet (300') long may require dedicated pedestrian ways at least ten feet (10') wide.  The use of additional pedestrian access ways to schools, parks and other destinations may be required.

 

B.              Blocks or lots intended for commercial and industrial use must show adequate off street areas to provide for parking, loading and such other facilities as per Chapter 10 Zoning Regulation requirements.

 

Subd.  8.         Sidewalks/Trails/Boulevards

 

A.              Improvements along Urban Collector and Urban Arterial Streets.  The following improvements shall be installed at the time new urban collector and arterial streets are constructed and as existing urban arterial and collector streets are reconstructed.

 

1.   Minimum 5 foot wide bicycle routes or lanes, as determined by the City, on both sides of collector and arterial roads;

 

2.   Minimum 5 foot wide sidewalk and, unless absolutely impossible to accomplish, minimum 6 foot wide boulevards which shall be landscaped to provide for visibility and snow storage on both sides of collector and arterial roads.

 


B.              Improvements along Rural Collector and Rural Arterial Streets.  The following improvements shall be installed at the time rural collector and arterial streets are constructed or reconstructed.

 

1.   Minimum 5' wide bicycle routes or lanes, as determined by the City, on both sides of the street;

 

2.   Minimum 5' wide sidewalk or minimum 8' to 12' wide trails.

 

C.              Reconstruction of Streets.  When local streets are reconstructed, consideration shall be given to the construction/installation of pedestrian and bicycle facilities, as shown on the designated plan attached as Appendix A, and especially in locations where there are missing links in these systems.

 

D.              Sidewalk / Trail Network.  A system of 5' wide sidewalks and/or 8' to 12' wide trails shall be planned (see Appendix A) and constructed in all City growth areas east of U.S. Highway 10 to connect all new subdivisions.  In addition, such a sidewalk/trail network shall connect new subdivisions with existing subdivisions west of U.S. Highway 10, including reconstructed urban streets that are identified in Appendix A within the existing subdivisions west of Highway 10.  Said sidewalk/trails network may be adjacent to collector and arterial streets, or alongside local streets within a residential, commercial or industrial development, or a combination thereof.

 

Said sidewalk/trail network will be planned by the Sidewalk/Trail Committee, and approved by the Advisory Park Board and the Planning Commission before they are recommended to the City Council.  The Sidewalk /Trail Committee shall consist of representatives of the City Council, Advisory Park Board, Planning Commission, City Staff and other appropriate citizens.  The Committee shall meet at least annually to review and update the City=s Sidewalk, Trail and Boulevard Plan (Appendix A).

 

The cost of sidewalks/trails installed by the City may be special assessed back to the areas that will benefit, including residential, commercial and industrial lands, when platted and developed.

 

 


E.              Interior Street Sidewalks.  Sidewalks on all interior streets of new subdivisions shall be installed on at least one side of permanently constructed roads when new residential, commercial, or industrial subdivisions are developed, except cul-de-sac streets less than 500 feet in length.  The sidewalks shall be a part of a system which connects to other sidewalks, trails, or major activity areas.  The cost of the sidewalks will be assessed to lots within the subdivision.

 

F.               Boulevards.  When sidewalks are constructed, boulevards shall be sodded or planted with landscape type vegetation or other ground cover (e.g. grass, sod, clover) that is water permeable as approved by the City.  Ornamental rock and similar surfaces are strictly prohibited to avoid displacement of materials on road and sidewalk areas and to preserve water percolation opportunities.  The City may require that trees be planted on boulevards where utilities will not be adversely affected, in conjunction with Development Agreements in new subdivisions.

 

G.              Construction of Lesser Improvements.  When the City determines it is not feasible or advisable to require these improvements, the City may require the construction or installation of lesser facilities, after a recommendation by the Planning Commission, which promote convenient pedestrian and bicycle transportation routes.  Examples of circumstances which may make such improvements unfeasible or unadvisable include: Topographical features, structures such as a major retaining wall or buildings.

 

H.              Variances.  When a developer or a property owner believes that the installation of these improvements is not feasible or advisable, he or she may request a variance, following the established standards and procedures set forth in City Code Section 10.15 Subd. 4 and Subd. 5; City Code Section 12.16, Subdivision 1; City Code Section 12.18, Subdivision 1; City Code Section 12.19 and City Code Section 12.20.

 

 

Subd.  9.         Lot Standards.  Minimum lot size and dimensions shall be those required by Chapter 10, Zoning Regulations.

 

Subd.  10.       Park Land Dedication.

 


A.        Purpose and Intent:  Minnesota Statute 462.358 provides cities with the authority to require that a reasonable portion of any proposed subdivision be dedicated to the public or preserved for conservation purposes or for public use as parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space.  Chapter 462 also provides cities with the authority to choose to accept an equivalent amount in cash from the applicant for all or part of the portion of the property required to be dedicated to such public uses or purposes.  The City has determined that new development increases the demand for and use of park property in the City.  The City has also determined that the demands on City parks and need for additional park space increases as the density of development increases.  As a general principle, larger lots and lower density provide for greater use of private property and place less demands on the City’s parks.  The City’s purpose in this Ordinance is to provide a park land dedication system for new development which provides for a larger dedication where density is higher and open spaces are more sporadic.  In addition, it is the City’s intent to provide that the amount of park land required to be dedicated by this Ordinance be “roughly proportional” to the impact on the demand for park use in the City as a result of the new development.  For residential development where the impact is based more upon the number of people in the new development, rather than set a standard percentage of the total development to be dedicated, the City intends on providing a system generally based upon the number of lots and potential units in a development; however, the City desires to retain the ability to make individualized determinations to ensure that required dedications are related in both nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development on the demand for such property in the City.  For commercial and industrial developments, since the impact is primarily based upon the loss of open and green space, and the loss of natural areas the City will use a standard percentage as its starting point in establishing a dedication; however, as with residential developments, the City will review each individual project to ensure that the proposed dedication is roughly proportional to the impacts of that development.

 

B.        Dedication Required.  In every plat, re-plat, or subdivision (including minor subdivisions) of land allowing for development for residential purposes and in every rezoning a reasonable portion of the property shall be dedicated to the public or preserved for conservation purposes or for public use as parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space as determined by resolution of the City Council.  The City Council will initially examine each plat, re-plat, subdivision or rezoning in terms of the following formula which will then be adjusted if the unique characteristics and uses of the land dictate such adjustment.

 

1,350   square feet per single family residential lot

 

700                  square feet per unit possible for multiple family developments

 

5%                   of land area for commercial and industrial lots (not including streets or other public dedications)

 

                        C.        Individual Analysis of Development.  The above formula will serve as the starting point for the Planning Commission, Advisory Park Board and the City Council in determining the amount of property required to be dedicated by each individual applicant.  The City Council will, if requested by the applicant, or may upon a recommendation of either the Advisory Park Board or Planning Commission, complete an analysis of the dedication requirements as they pertain to an individual development, and the City may increase or decrease the amount of the property required to be dedicated or set aside based upon such analysis.  Any reasonable expenses incurred by the City, whether as a result of the request of the applicant or the City’s own initiative, in studying the proposed development’s impact on the City’s parks and open space will be passed through as an expense of the development to the applicant. 

 

The expenses to be passed through to the applicant will only be those associated with the affects of the applicant’s proposed project and not costs arising from the study of other development within the City.

 

                        D.        Council Decision as to Dedication Type.  The City Council will, after reviewing the recommendation of the Planning Commission and Advisory Park Board, decide the form of the dedication, the location, and the type of use, whether for conservation purposes or for public use as parks, recreation facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands, or open space.  The land to be dedicated or set aside shall be suitable for public uses as parks, playgrounds or such other purposes as determined by the City Council, and the City will not be required to accept property which is not usable for such purposes as determined by the City or which would require significant expenditures to make them usable for such purposes.  The City Council may take into consideration, size, shape, topography, hydrology, geology, tree cover, access and location, among other factors, when determining whether property is acceptable for dedication.  It is the intent of the City that park land or set aside land not be selected based solely on its non-usability to the applicant because of wetland classification or other impediments to development.

 

E.        Cash in Lieu of property.  (a) The City Council may, after reviewing the recommendation of the Planning Commission and Advisory Park Board, require that the applicant provide for a cash payment in lieu of property dedication.  The City Council, in making this decision, may take the following factors into consideration: (1) whether the land to be dedicated is of sufficient size to provide adequate park facilities; (2) whether the land to be dedicated is needed in the immediate location; (3) whether pre-existing facilities would be better served with additional improvements; (4) whether the cash payment would be more beneficial to the overall park system which will be impacted by development; (5) maintenance considerations; (6) suitability of the land for the intended use; and/or (7) the location of the property.

 

(b) The City Council may decide to accept all or a portion of the property required to be dedicated.  If the City decides to accept only a portion of the property required to be dedicated the applicant will be required to make a cash payment in lieu of dedication for the amount of land not accepted for dedication by the City. 

 

                        F.         Credit for Private Open Space.  Where a private open space for park or recreation purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, the City Council will give consideration to allowing partial credit for such space toward the dedication required by this Section.  All of the following minimum factors will be required to be satisfied before such credit will be considered:

 

(1) The land area must be available for the use, without preference, of all of the residents of the proposed subdivision;

 


(2) The required setbacks must not be included in the computation of such land area;

 

(3) The use of the private open space must be restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants or declarations which run with the land in favor of the owners of the property within the subdivision and cannot be eliminated without the prior approval of the City Council after review and recommendation by the Park Board;

 

(4) The proposed private open space must be of sufficient size, shape, location, and topography for park and recreational purposes or must contain unique natural features that are important to be preserved; and

 

(c) If the City elects to receive a cash payment in lieu of property dedication, the applicant must pay the City the amount as determined by resolution of the City.  The amount will be based upon the fair market value of the property which would otherwise be required to be dedicated or set aside.  The fair market value of the land is defined as that amount which a willing buyer would pay and a willing seller would accept for the property as of the date of the final approval of the plat.  A determination of the fair market value of the property shall be initially made by the City Assessor who shall make a recommendation to the City Council for final determination.  The City Council will, by resolution, set annual base values for vacant property in the City from which the City would make adjustments for individual developments depending on the unique characteristics of the property.

 

(d) Cash payments made to the City in lieu of dedication or set aside shall be placed in a special fund and used, throughout the City, only for the purposes for which the money was obtained.

 


G.        Re-platted and Later Development at a Higher Density.  Where formerly platted property is either re-platted or developed at a higher density than was anticipated by the City at the time of the original platting, the developer will provide the additional dedication amount at the time of the re-plat or site plan approval, and the value of the land shall be determined as of the final approval of the re-plat or site plan less the value of improvements.  Such developer shall receive a credit in the amount of the pre-existing dedication or cash received by the City for such property.

 

                        H.        In Addition to Other Dedication Requirements.  The dedications required by this Section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, dedications required for public use as streets, roads, sewers, electric, gas and water facilities, storm water drainage and holding areas or ponds and similar utilities and improvements.

 

(5) The proposed open space must reduce the demand for public recreational facilities to serve the development.

 

                        I.          Payment.  If cash in lieu of dedication is called for by the City, the applicant may either pay such amount upon final approval of the plat or subdivision, or may sign an agreement and waiver providing for such amount to become part of the total assessments levied against the property platted or subdivided and be paid in accord with the terms of such assessment as determined by resolution of the City Council and in accord with Minnesota Statutes Chapter 429.

 

J.                              Dedication not used in Calculating Density.  Land dedicated or set aside for public use or private land accepted by the City as an alternative to public dedication or set aside will not be used in calculating density for requirements of the City’s Zoning Ordinance.

 

Subd. 11.           Storm Drainage Area Dedication Required.

 

A.              In every plat, re-plat, or subdivision of land whether for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes, a reasonable portion of the property platted or subdivided shall be dedicated to the public or preserved for public use for storm water drainage improvements, storm water holding areas and ponds, and other similar improvements.  The portion and location of the property to be so dedicated or preserved for public use shall be determined by the City Council prior to the final approval of any plat, re-plat or subdivision of land.

CHAPTER 14

 

STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION

 

SECTION      14.01   PURPOSE.

 

The purpose of this Chapter is to:

A.                Control or eliminate stormwater pollution along with soil erosion and sedimentation within the City by adopting requirements that are at least as stringent as those required by Minnesota’s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) permit, and

B.                  Limit surface runoff volumes and reduce pollutant loading, and

C.                  Establish surface water management requirements to protect and safeguard the general health, safety and welfare of the public.  It establishes standards and specifications for conservation practices and planning activities, which minimize stormwater pollution, soil erosion, and sedimentation. 

1)                  This Chapter establishes an Erosion Control Permit, which requires the Applicant to develop and implement a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan containing BMPs, which shall be calculated to prevent stormwater pollution from the beginning of site activity to final stabilization.

2)                  The Chapter’s plan review process and requirements will include post-construction management.  It requires the permit Applicant to plan for, implement, and maintain all new development and redevelopment post-construction stormwater management activities.

D.                Reserve the right for the City to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to improve water quality and control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff of hydrologic or topographic conditions that warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements.

E.                 Require all site designs establish stormwater management practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater and stormwater pollution thereby utilizing pervious areas for stormwater treatment and infiltrating stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces and landscaped areas.

F.                  Require that all stormwater runoff generated from new development and redevelopment shall not be discharged without adequate treatment.       

                                                           

SECTION      14.02   SCOPE.

 

Any person, firm, sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, state agency, or political subdivision proposing a land disturbance activity regulated by this Chapter within the City shall apply to the City for an Erosion Control Permit.  The application must include, amongst other things, a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan.  No land shall be disturbed until the plan is approved by the City as it conforms to the standards set forth herein.

Subd. 2.             Exempt land disturbance activities.  The following activities do not require an Erosion Control Permit unless the City determines that there is a high risk of soil erosion or water pollution, or that there may be a significant impact on waters of the state:

A.                Minor land disturbance activities such as home gardens and an individual’s home landscaping, repairs, and maintenance work disturbing less than 5,000 square feet;

B.                 Construction, installation, and maintenance of fences, signs, posts, poles, and electric, telephone, cable television, utility lines or individual service connections to these utilities, which result in creating under 5,000 square feet of exposed soil;

C.                 Tilling, planting and harvesting of agricultural, horticultural, or silvicultural crops more than 100 feet from a public water as defined in Minnesota Statute Section 103G.005, Subd. 15 ; and

D.                Emergency work to protect life, limb, or property and emergency repairs, unless the land disturbing activity would have otherwise required an approved erosion and sediment control plan, except for the emergency.  If such a plan would have been required, then the disturbed land area shall be shaped and stabilized in accordance with the City’s requirements as soon as possible.

 

SECTION 14.05  THE EROSION CONTROL PERMIT AND THE SWPPP

 

Subd. 1.           Application.  Every Applicant, prior to engaging in any land disturbing activity regulated by this Chapter, must apply to, and obtain from the City an Erosion Control Permit. In all cases, the application must contain the required information, the application fee, and if applicable a SWPPP, which shall identify BMPs to be used to prevent stormwater pollution.  No land disturbing activity regulated by this Section may begin until the Applicant has received an Erosion Control Permit from the City.  No permit will be issued or given until the SWPPP has been reviewed and approved by City staff.  The City Engineer may be required to review and approve a SWPPP in the event the City staff determines, in their sole discretion, that the conditions of the site so warrant.  The City Engineer must review and approve all SWPPPs for projects subject to the MPCA Permit.  The Applicant may appeal the interpretations of this Section made by City staff to the City Council.

 

Subd. 2.           Inspections.  To the extent practicable, the City’s designated representative will inspect the site subject to the SWPPP for compliance and to ensure that erosion and sediment control measures are properly installed and maintained.  However, this does not in any way remove the Applicant’s and contractor’s responsibility under the SWPPP for inspecting the site for compliance on a weekly basis and after every storm or snowmelt event large enough to result in runoff from the site.  A record of each inspection must be made and kept available for review by the City.  At all times the Applicant shall be responsible for implementing and maintaining the BMP’s as provided in the approved SWPPP.

 

Subd. 3.           Requirements of the SWPPP.   The SWPPP must, at a minimum, and to the extent applicable, contain the items in this Subdivision.  Nevertheless, due to the diversity of sites, each site will be individually evaluated and, where additional information or BMPs are needed, they will be specified at the discretion of the City in a manner at least as stringent as the MPCA Permit.

 

A.                The name, phone number, and address of the Applicant and the location of the activity;

B.                 A brief, general description of the project containing the nature and purpose of the land disturbing activity and the amount of grading, utilities, and building construction involved;

C.                 Time frames and schedules for the project’s various aspects and an estimated completion date;

D.                 The BMPs that will be used to control erosion and sedimentation, control volumes and rates, and treat stormwater on the site, both during and after the construction process and a plan for their implementation, maintenance, and inspection;

E.                 A description of how the site will be stabilized after the land disturbing activity is completed, including specifications, time frames or schedules;

F.                  If applicable, calculations that were made for the design of such items as sediment basins, wet detention basins, diversions, waterways, infiltration zones and other applicable practices; and

G.                A map or site plan of the existing site conditions showing:

1)      Existing topography,

2)      Steep slopes,

3)      Existing drainage systems/patterns, 

4)      Waterways (e.g., neighboring streams, lakes, wetlands, etc.),

5)      Vegetative cover,

6)      The location of the proposed land disturbing activities,

7)      Stockpile locations,

8)      Residential areas, roads, etc., which might be affected by the land disturbing activity,

9)      Areas that have the potential for serious erosion problems, and

10)  The location of the BMPs and the plan for the implementation, maintenance, and inspections.

 

Subd. 4.           Minimum Standards for the SWPPP.  To the extent applicable, the following are the minimum standards for guiding the design, implementation, and regulation of the SWPPP.  

 

A.                All grading plans and building plans must be reviewed by the City for the effectiveness of erosion control measures in the context of site topography and drainage;

B.                 If the SWPPP involves redirecting some or all of the site’s runoff, the Applicant or his designated representative shall obtain from adjacent property owners any necessary easements or other property interests concerning the flowing of such water;

C.                 The land disturbing activities shall be scheduled to lessen their impact on erosion and sediment creation, and to minimize the amount of exposed soil;

D.                All sand, gravel or other mining operations taking place on any site within the City shall have a NPDES Permit for Nonmetallic Mining and Associated Activities and all required Minnesota Department of Natural Resources permits;

E.                 The SWPPP must provide for final stabilization of the site within an appropriate amount of time.

 

Subd. 5.             Minimum Control Measures.  These minimum control measures are required where greater than 5000 square feet of bare soil is exposed.  Due to the diversity of individual construction sites, each site will be individually evaluated and, where additional control measures are needed, they will be specified at the discretion of the city

A.                Measures. Appropriate sediment control measures must be properly installed by the Applicant before construction activity begins. Such structures may be adjusted during dry weather to accommodate short-term activities, such as those that require the passage of vehicles. As soon as this activity is finished or before rainfall, but within a 24-hour time period, the erosion and sediment control structures must be returned to the configuration specified by the city.

B.                 Acceptable Treatment and Site Design Technique Options.  The Applicant will provide the City with a SWPPP clearly applying performance standards in accordance with Section 14.06 of this Ordinance.  This requirement is in addition to any required BMPs.    Any BMP or design in conflict with a City Ordinance or Policy must be considered by the Planning Commission and approved by the City Council. This item applies only to projects disturbing more than 5,000 square fee of land.

C.                 Channeled Runoff.  Diversion of channeled runoff around disturbed areas, if practical, or the protection of the channel.

D.                The scheduling of activities to lessen their impact on erosion and sediment creation, so as to minimize the amount of exposed soil.

E.                 Generally, sufficient silt fence or other BMPs shall be required to hold all sheet flow runoff generated at an individual site, until it can either infiltrate or seep through BMPs.

F.                  For soil stockpiles greater than 10 cubic yards the toe of the pile must be more than 25 feet from a road, river, wetland, drainage channel, or stormwater inlet.  If such stockpiles will be left for more than 7 days, they must be stabilized with mulch, vegetation, tarps, or other means. If left for less than 7 days, erosion from stockpiles must be controlled with silt fences,rock check dams, or other appropriate BMPs.

G.                If for any reason a soil stockpile of any size is located closer than 25 feet from a road, river, wetland, drainage channel, or stormwater inlet, and will be left for more than 7 days, written permission must be obtained from the City of Sauk Rapids Public Works Director.   In obtaining such permission, the Applicant shall submit a plan detailing how the stockpile will be stabilized to the satisfaction of the City of Sauk Rapids Public Works Director. 

I.                   Temporary construction entrances are required wherever vehicles enter and exit a site.  Construction entrances may be made of rock, woodchips, or other material acceptable to City Staff.

J.                   Parking on bare lots will be permitted with the proper BMPs; however, no lot shall have more than one construction entrance/exit. The entrance/exit shall meet the standard of Subdivision 5. I. of this section.  All traffic moving on and off site shall use designated construction entrances and exits.  

K.                Streets must be cleaned and swept as part of a regular sweeping schedule, whenever tracking of sediments occurs, and before sites are left idle for weekends and holidays.

L.                 Water that is impacted by the construction activity and removed from the site by    pumping must be treated by temporary sedimentation basins, geotextile filters, grit chambers, sand filters, up-flow chambers, hydro-cyclones, swirl concentrators or other appropriate controls.  Such water shall not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion or flooding of the site, receiving channels, adjacent property or a wetland.

M.               Storm drain inlets immediately down-gradient from a storm water discharge point must have appropriate inlet protection before work may commence.  Newly constructed inlets must be protected according to the MPCA Permit.

N.                Catch basins. The final catch basin or manhole in line before a storm system outlet, in new and re-construction, shall be provided with a sump area for collecting coarse-grained material.

O.                Roof drain leaders. Whenever possible, all newly constructed and reconstructed buildings must route roof drain leaders to pervious areas (not natural wetlands) where the runoff can infiltrate.  The discharge rate shall be controlled so that no erosion occurs in the pervious areas.

P.                  Follow-up inspections may be performed by the city on a regular basis to ensure that erosion and sediment control measures and stormwater treatment measures are properly installed and maintained. In all cases the inspectors will attempt to work with the Applicant or on-site agents to maintain proper erosion and sediment control at all sites; in cases where cooperation is withheld, construction stop work orders may be issued by the City, until erosion and sediment control measures meet specifications.  A second erosion and sediment control/grading inspection must then be scheduled and passed before the final inspection will be done.

Q.                Inspection and maintenance. All construction and post-construction stormwater pollution control management facilities must be designed to minimize the need of maintenance, to provide easy vehicle and personnel access for maintenance purposes and be structurally sound. These facilities must have a plan of operation and maintenance that ensures continued effective removal of the pollutants carried in stormwater runoff.  The operation and maintenance plan shall be in writing and signed by the Applicant. A copy of the signed agreement shall be filed at City Hall and with the project files. 

R.         Inspection and maintenance easements.  It shall be the responsibility of the Applicant to obtain any necessary easements or other property interests to allow access to the stormwater management facilities for inspection and maintenance purpose.

 

Subd. 6.             Minimum Protection for Natural Wetlands.  Runoff must not be discharged directly into wetlands without appropriate quality and quantity runoff control, as determined based on the individual wetland’s vegetation sensitivity, and in accordance with any local, state, and federal requirements or permits.   

 

SECTION 14.06 MINIMIUM IMPACT DESIGN STANDARDS (MIDS)

 

Subd. 1.           Statutory Authorization and Purpose.  The MIDS performance standards are authorized under Minnesota Statutes enacted in 2009, Chapter 115 Water Pollution Control Act, 115.03 Powers and Duties.

 

Subd. 2.           Stormwater Volume Reduction Performance Goals.  Any application for a permit resulting in site disturbance that creates 1 or more acres of new impervious surface or fully reconstructs 1 or more acre of impervious surface must meet all of the following stormwater performance goals:

A.                New Development Volume Control.  For new, nonlinear developments that create more than 1 acre of new impervious surface on sites without restrictions, stormwater runoff volumes will be controlled and the post-construction runoff volume shall be retained onsite for 1.1 inches of runoff from all impervious surfaces on the site.

B.                 Redevelopment Volume Control.  Nonlinear redevelopment projects on sites without restrictions that create one or more acres of new or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces shall capture and retain onsite 1.1 inches of runoff from the new or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces.

C.                 Linear Development Volume Control.  Linear projects on sites without restrictions that create one acre or greater of new or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces, shall capture and retain the larger of the following:

·                     0.55 inches of runoff from the new and fully reconstructed impervious surfaces on the site.

·                     1.1 inches of runoff from the net increase in impervious area on the site

Mill and overlay and other resurfacing activities are not considered fully   reconstructed.

D.                Flexible Treatment Options for Sites with Restrictions as found in the MIDS Design Sequence Flowchart.  Applicant shall fully attempt to comply with the appropriate performance goals described above.  Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of relocating project elements to address, varying soil conditions and other constraints across the site. If full compliance is not possible due to any of the factors listed below, the Applicant must document the reason.  If site constraints or restrictions limit the full treatment goal, the following flexible treatment options shall be used:

 

Applicant shall document the flexible treatment options sequence starting with Alternative #1.  If Alternative #1 cannot be met, then Alternative #2 shall be analyzed.  Applicants must document the specific reasons why Alternative #1 cannot be met based on the factors listed below. If Alternative #2 cannot be met, then Alternative #3 shall be met. Applicants must document the specific reasons why Alternative #2 cannot be met based on the factors listed below.  When all of the conditions are fulfilled within an alternative, this sequence is completed.

 

Volume reduction techniques considered shall include infiltration, reuse and rainwater harvesting, canopy interception and evapotranspiration, or additional techniques included in the MIDS calculator and the Minnesota Stormwater Manual.

 

Higher priority shall be given to BMPs that include volume reduction. Secondary preference is to employ filtration techniques, followed by rate control BMPs.

 

 

Factors to be considered for each alternative will include:

i.                    Karst geology;

ii.                  Shallow bedrock;

iii.                High groundwater;

iv.                Hotspots or contaminated soils;

v.                  Drinking water source management areas or within 200 feet of drinking water well;

vi.                Zoning, setbacks or other land use requirements;

vii.              Excessive cost; and

viii.            Poor soils (infiltration rates that are too low or too high, problematic urban soils).

Alternative #1:  Applicant attempts to comply with the following conditions:

i.                    Achieve at least 0.55” volume reduction from all impervious surfaces if the site is new development or from the new or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site.

ii.                  Remove 75% of the annual TP load from all impervious surfaces if the site is new development or from the new or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site.

iii.                Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of relocating project elements to address, varying soil conditions and other constraints across the site.

Alternative #2:  Applicant attempts to comply with the following conditions:

i.                    Achieve volume reduction to the maximum extent practicable.

ii.                  Remove 60% of the annual TP load from all impervious surfaces if the site is new development or from the new or fully reconstructed impervious surfaces for a redevelopment site.

iii.                Options considered and presented shall examine the merits of relocating project elements to address, varying soil conditions and other constraints across the site.

Alternative #3:  Off-site Treatment. Mitigation equivalent to the performance of 1.1 inches of volume reduction for new development or redevelopment as described above in this section can be performed off-site to protect the receiving water body.  Off-site treatment shall be achieved in areas selected in the following order of preference:

i.                    Locations that yield benefits to the same receiving water that receives runoff from the original construction activity.

ii.                  Locations within the same Department of Natural Resources  catchment areas (Hydrologic Unit 08) as the original construction activity.

iii.                Locations within the next adjacent DNR catchment area upstream.

iv.                Locations anywhere within the City’s jurisdiction.

Subd. 5.  Operation, Inspections, and Maintenance.

A.                Applicant’s Responsibility.  The Applicant is responsible for operation, inspections, and maintenance during and after construction for all privately-owned practices on the site.  Operation, inspections, and maintenance shall conform to the Minnesota Stormwater Manual.

B.                 City Inspections.  The City reserves the right to conduct inspections on a regular basis to ensure that both stormwater and erosion and sediment control measures are properly installed and maintained prior to construction, during construction, and at the completion of the project.

C.                 Right of Entry.  The application for and subsequent issuance of a permit under the ordinance shall constitute a right-of-entry for the City or its agent to enter the construction site during active construction and when construction is complete.

 

 

 

SECTION 14.07        APPLICATION REVIEW

 

Subd. 1.           Review.  City staff and, when the situation requires, the City Engineer shall be responsible for reviewing the application and the SWPPP.

 

Subd. 2.           Fee.  A fee will be charged for the review of the application, the issuance of the permit, and inspections.  The fee will be in an amount established in the city’s fee schedule.  This fee shall not include the cost of the City Engineer’s review.  If the site for which the application has been submitted requires the City Engineer’s review and approval, the City Engineer’s cost shall be billed separately and must be paid in full before the permit will be issued.  Fee amounts are determined in the City’s fee schedule.

 

Subd. 3.             Completeness of Application.  Only applications that are complete will be reviewed by City staff.  In order for a plan to be complete, it must contain the necessary information, the SWPPP, and the required fee.  All incomplete plans will be returned to the Applicant with a written explanation of the application’s deficiencies.  The Applicant will have the opportunity to correct the deficiencies and resubmit the application.

 

Subd. 4.           Permit.  If the City’s staff and, when applicable the City Engineer, determine that the SWPPP meets the requirements of this Ordinance, the City shall issue a permit that authorizes the land disturbance activity contingent on the implementation of the BMPs contained in the plan; which shall include actions necessary to achieve final stabilization of the site upon completion of the land disturbance activity.

 

Subd. 5.             Permit Conditions.  The BMPs contained in the approved SWPPP must be implemented prior to the start of any land disturbing activity and shall be maintained in accordance with the approved plan and the requirements of this Chapter.  Additional conditions may be imposed by the City.

 

Subd. 6.             Costs.  The Applicant shall be liable at all times for the costs incurred, including costs and fines resulting from noncompliance with an approved plan.

 

Subd. 7.           Denial of Permit and Appeal.  If City staff determines that the SWPPP does not meet the requirements of this Chapter, the City shall not issue a permit for the land disturbance activity.  The Applicant may appeal the adverse decision within 10 days of receiving written notice by requesting in writing to City staff that the City Council reviews the decision.  The person making the appeal must apply for a hearing before the City Council on forms provided by the City.  This hearing does not require a newspaper publication.  The City Council will make their decision within 30 days of the hearing or may extend the time for consideration as permitted by state law.  All decisions by the City Council shall be final.

 

Subd. 8.           Permit Termination.  The permit holder shall notify the City when a project ceases and final stabilization is reached.  When a MPCA Permit exists, the state termination form will suffice.

 

SECTION 14.08  MODIFICATION OF PLAN

 

            An approved SWPPP pertaining to less than one acre may be modified without prior approval from the City in case of emergency.  Those modifications must be submitted to the City within 10 days of the modification.  Projects of 1 acre or more may be modified on submission of a written application for modification to the City, and only after written approval by City staff and, when applicable, the City Engineer.  In reviewing such an application, the City may require additional information.  No approval of any modification will be given that is not consistent with this Chapter.

 

SECTION 14.09   FINANCIAL SECURITY

 

Subd. 1.     Financial Security Required.  For each Erosion Control Permit issued in connection with a project for which there is a corresponding development agreement with the City, the Applicant shall furnish to the City an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount approved by the City Finance Director.  The purpose of the letter of credit shall is to guarantee compliance with the terms of the Erosion Control Permit.  The letter of credit shall be in a form that automatically renews and shall be issued by a banking institution acceptable to the City.  The letter of credit shall be provided to the City prior to the Erosion Control Permit being issued.  If the Applicant has already provided a letter of credit to the City on the same project for other purposes, the letter of credit shall satisfy the requirement for the financial security required as part of the SWPPP, so long as the existing letter of credit is amended to include the work authorized by the Erosion Control Permit and is in an amount acceptable to the City Finance Director. Even if there is not a corresponding development agreement, the City may require an irrevocable letter of credit, or other financial security acteptbale to the City in its sole discretion, from the Applicant in an amount sufficient to cover the estimated costs of permitted and remedial work as determined by the City.  Financial securities shall not be released until all permitted and remedial work is completed. Financial securities may be used by the City to complete work not completed by the Applicant.

 

Subd. 2.        Maintenance Agreement. The City, in its sole discretion as a condition of an Erosion Control Permit, may require the Applicant to enter into a maintenance agreement that addresses that financial security and long term maintenance of the permitted work. All maintenance agreements shall be recorded with the Benton County recorded and shall bind all successors and assigns.

 

Subd. 3.     Action Against the Financial Security.  In the event any of the conditions listed below exist, or if the Applicant is not otherwise in compliance with the Erosion Control Permit or this Ordinance, the City may draw on the Applicant’s letter of credit in order to take corrective or remedial action as may be necessary, as determined by the City, based on the Applicant’s noncompliance.  The Applicant shall reimburse the City for costs incurred in the enforcement of the Erosion Control Permit, including reasonable engineering and reasonable attorneys’ fees when:

 

A.                The Applicant ceases land disturbing activities or filling and abandons the work site prior to completion of the grading plan;

B.                 The Applicant fails to conform to any City approved grading plan or the SWPPP;

C.                 The BMPs implemented under the SWPPP, in sole discretion of the City, fail; and

D.                The Applicant fails to reimburse the City for any corrective action taken or costs incurred, including any reasonable engineering and attorney fees.

 

Subd. 4.     Notification by the City.  The City shall make reasonable efforts to notify the Applicant in writing prior to taking any corrective or remedial action and prior to drawing on the security as provided in this Section.  Except during an emergency action under this Section, the City will not begin corrective work until 48 hours after notification by the City or 72 hours after the failure of erosion control measures, whichever is less.  The failure to provide notification shall not invalidate any action by the City under this Ordinance.

 

Subd. 5.     Emergency Action.  If circumstances exist such that noncompliance with this ordinance or an Erosion Control Permit issued pursuant to this ordinance poses an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare, as determined by the City, the City may take emergency preventative action.  The City shall make reasonable efforts to contact and direct the Applicant to take any necessary action before the City undertakes such emergency preventative action.  The Applicant shall reimburse the City for costs incurred in undertaking any emergency preventative action, including reasonable engineering and reasonable attorneys’ fees, pursuant to Section 14.08, subdivision 2. 

 

SECTION 14.10  PLAN AND PERMIT TRANSFER

 

Subd. 1.             Notice to Transferee.  When ownership, possession, or control of any site subject to an incomplete, approved SWPPP is transferred, the seller shall notify the buyer as to the current status of compliance and provide a copy of the approved SWPPP.  A copy of this notice shall be submitted to the City. A copy of the ‘Modification/Transfer’, ‘Subdivision Registration’, or ‘Homeowner Transfer’ forms required by the MPCA for transfers under the State required SWPPP shall suffice for this notice to the City.

 

Subd. 2.            Successor Liability. 

 

A.                The successor in interest to any portion of a site subject to an incomplete, approved SWPPP shall be responsible for implementing the BMPs contained in the plan.

B.                 The successor shall be responsible for the implementation of the SWPPP for the portion of the site transferred.

C.        The successor shall be bound by the terms of an maintenance agreement required by the City.

D.                The successor will be subject to all regulations under this Chapter.

 

Subd. 3.           Penalty.  In the event a seller fails to comply with the provisions of this Section, seller shall remain liable for the completion of the SWPPP as to transferee’s property.
