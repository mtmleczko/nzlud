Sec. 2-104. - Disposal of foreclosed tax title property. 
(a)  [Methods.] The city treasurer shall dispose of foreclosed tax title property through the abutter lots program, or through public auctions, to be held on a semiannual basis, or in accordance with the provisions of M.G.L.A., c. 30B, or through transferring to the city property committee those parcels, which are to be maintained by the city for municipal purposes and for which the treasurer has received notice. 
(b)  Definitions. [The following terms, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection:] 
    Abutter lots program means a program developed to provide an abutting landowner with the first opportunity to acquire an abutting parcel foreclosed for tax title. Regulations for the program shall be promulgated and periodically published by the city treasurer. 
    Decrees of foreclosure means a decree issued by the Land Court Department of the Trial Court of Massachusetts, which forever bars all rights of redemption (M.G.L.A. c. 60, § 69). 
    Foreclosed tax title property means property for which the city has obtained a decree of foreclosure from the Land Court Department of the Trial Court of Massachusetts. 
    Parcel eligible for abutter lots program means a parcel for which a decree of foreclosure has been obtained by the treasurer, which contains less than the minimum square footage requirement for a buildable lot, is located adjacent to a privately owned building on at least one side, is not needed for public open space or other public use, and is not part of a larger vacant parcel which will be developed. Abutter lots may be used only for a garden, side yard, landscaped open space, off-street parking, garage, or addition to abutter's existing structure. 
(c)  Property eligible for abutter lots program. The city treasurer shall dispose of foreclosed tax title property eligible for the abutter lots program in the following manner: 
(1)  Within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the treasurer receives the decree of foreclosure, the treasurer shall send a letter notifying the mayor, city council and all city departments that the city has foreclosed on a parcel of property. The letter shall specify the approximate square footage and location of the property and shall further state that the parcel will be placed into the abutter lots program unless the treasurer receives written notification, within thirty (30) days from the date the treasurer's communication appears on the city council agenda, that the mayor, city council or city department has a need for the parcel. Control of all parcels needed for a municipal purpose, which are to be maintained in the possession of the city as municipal property, shall be turned over to the city property committee. 
(2)  After the thirty-day period has expired, the treasurer shall send a notice to the owner of record immediately prior to the acquisition by the city of the title to such property. Such notice shall contain a description of the property to be sold sufficient to identify it, shall state that the property has been placed in the abutter lots program, and shall state the date, time and place appointed for the sale thereof and the terms and conditions of such sale, and shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of such owner, as appearing upon the records of the assessors of the city, at least fourteen (14) days before the sale. The treasurer shall also, not less than fourteen (14) days before such sale date, post a similar notice in two (2) or more convenient and public places in the city. The treasurer may reject any and all bids at such sale or any adjournment thereof if, in his opinion, no bid qualifies under the request for proposal. After any such sale and upon payment by the purchaser to the city of the amount of a bid accepted by the treasurer, the treasurer on behalf of the city, shall execute and deliver any instrument necessary to transfer the title of the city to any such property sold under this section. The deed shall contain a covenant, running with the land, limiting future use of the property to those uses permitted under the abutter lots program. The treasurer shall not execute any deeds for tax title property until the purchaser submits to the treasurer a statement signed under the pains and penalties of perjury that neither he nor any person who would gain equity in the property as a result of such conveyance has ever been convicted of a crime involving the willful and malicious setting of a fire or of a crime involving the aiding, counseling or procuring of a willful and malicious setting of a fire, or of a crime involving the fraudulent filing of a claim of fire insurance; or is delinquent in the payment of real estate taxes to the city, or, if delinquent, that a pending application for abatement of such tax, or a pending petition before the appellate tax board or the county commissioners has been filed in good faith. If there is more than one grantee of such deed, each grantee must file such statement, and no such deed shall be valid unless it contains a recitation that the treasurer has received such statement. Said deed shall further contain a covenant, running with the land, requiring the purchaser to complete the clean up and reuse of the property proposed in their abutter's lot program application within one year of the date of transfer. Said one year time period may be extended for an additional six (6) months provided the purchaser has applied for any and all permits necessary to complete their proposed work. The city shall have the option in the deed, pursuant to the preceding covenants, to take the property back or to bring an action in equity to enforce the terms of the covenants. 
(3)  All parcels included in the abutter lots program shall be offered for sale to qualified abutters, in accordance with the regulations governing the abutter lots program. 
(4)  All parcels for which a decree of foreclosure has been received by the treasurer between January 1 and June 30 shall be auctioned in the following September. All parcels for which a decree of foreclosure has been received by the treasurer between July 1 and December 31 shall be auctioned in the following March. 
(5)  If a parcel has not been disposed of after having been for the first time offered for sale through the abutter lots program, it shall then be disposed of in the same manner as tax title property which is not eligible for the abutter lots program. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the parcel has still not been disposed of, it may then be offered again through the abutter lots program, or any other method for disposition of such parcels contained in these ordinances. 
(6)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), a lot acquired through the abutter's lots program may be combined with an adjacent lot also acquired through the abutter lots program to form a "combined lot." Such combined lot shall not be subject to the restrictions set forth in the restrictive covenant and may then be developed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the city Code of Ordinances, provided that the combined lot satisfies then existing zoning, subdivision and building requirements without relief from the City Code sections regarding front yard, side yard, rear yard, floor-to-area ratios, lot size, density, or frontage. No other property may be considered as part of the combined lot in determining whether such combined lot satisfies the relevant sections of the City Code. 
(d)  Property not eligible for abutter lot program. The city treasurer shall dispose of foreclosed tax title property, which is ineligible for the abutter lots program or which previously has been submitted for auction one time through the abutter lots program, and which the treasurer will not be transferring to the city property committee only in either of the following two (2) ways, at the option of the treasurer: 
(1)  Auction. 
a.  With exception of property which has previously been submitted for auction through the abutter lots program, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the treasurer receives the decree of foreclosure, the treasurer shall send a letter notifying the mayor, city council and all city departments that the city has foreclosed on a parcel of property. The letter shall specify the approximate square footage and location of the property and shall further state that the parcel will be auctioned by the city treasurer unless the treasurer receives written notification, within thirty (30) days of said notice, that the mayor, city council or city department has a need for the parcel. 
b.  The treasurer shall send a notice to the owner of record prior to the auction by the city of such property. Such notice shall contain a description of the property to be sold sufficient to identify it; shall state the date, time, and place appointed for the sale thereof and the terms and conditions of such sale; and shall be sent by registered mail to the address of such owner as appearing upon the records of the assessors of the city, at least fourteen (14) days before the auction date. 
c.  In addition to the notice provisions of subsection (b) above, the treasurer shall also, not less than fourteen (14) days before such appointed date, post a notice of all property to be auctioned, in two (2) or more convenient and public places in the city, as well as in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
d.  The treasurer may reject any and all bids at such sale or any adjournment thereof if, in his opinion, no bid is made which approximates the fair market value of the property. 
e.  After any such sale and upon payment by the purchaser to the city of the amount of a bid accepted by the treasurer, the treasurer, on behalf of the city, shall execute and deliver any instrument necessary to transfer the title of the city to any such property sold under this section. The treasurer shall not execute any deeds for tax title property until the purchaser submits to the treasurer a statement signed under the pains and penalties of perjury that neither he nor any person who would gain equity in the property as a result of such conveyance has ever been convicted of a crime involving the willful and malicious setting of a fire or of a crime involving the aiding, counseling or procuring of a willful and malicious setting of a fire, or of a crime involving the fraudulent filing of a claim of fire insurance; or is delinquent in the payment of real estate taxes to the city, or, if delinquent, that a pending application for abatement of such tax, or a pending petition before the appellate tax board or the county commissioner has been filed in good faith. If there is more than one grantee of such deed, each grantee must file such statement, and no such deed shall be valid unless it contains a recitation that the treasurer has received such statement. 
f.  In the case of parcels to be offered at auction, parcels for which a decree of foreclosure has been received by the treasurer between January 1 and June 30, and all parcels remaining from the September abutter lots auction, shall be auctioned in the following October. All parcels for which a decree of foreclosure has been received by the treasurer between July 1 and December 31, and all parcels remaining from the March abutter lots auction shall be auctioned in the following April. Properties remaining after an auction would be re-advertised for successive auctions or offered under subsection 2-104(d)(2) until sold. 
(2)  Procedures for selling or renting real property or any interest therein - M.G.L.A. c. 30B. 
a.  The city treasurer may determine to sell or rent real property or any interest therein other than under the abutter lots program or at auction and shall do so only in accordance with the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 30B. 
b.  Within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the treasurer receives the decree of foreclosure, the treasurer shall send a letter notifying the mayor, city council and all city departments that the city has foreclosed on a parcel of property. The letter shall specify the approximate square footage and location of the property and shall further state that the city will solicit proposals for selling or renting such property or any interests therein unless the treasurer receives written notification, within thirty (30) days of said notice, that the mayor, city council or city department has a need for the parcel. 
c.  The treasurer shall send a notice to the parcel's owner of record at the same time as there is the first newspaper advertisement inviting the submission of proposals by the city. Such notice shall contain a description of the property to be sold sufficient to identify it, and shall specify the geographical area, terms and requirements of the proposed transaction and the time and place for the submission of proposals. 
d.  The city treasurer shall sell or rent such property by soliciting proposals in accordance with the applicable provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 30B, § 16, as amended and the purchasing agent as the city's chief procurement officer shall be responsible for compliance with the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 30B. 
e.  The purchasing agent, as chief procurement officer, may pursuant to the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 30B, § 9, cancel an invitation for bids and request for proposals or may reject in whole or in part any and all bids or proposals when the purchasing agent determines that cancellation or rejection serves the best interests of the city. 
f.  After any such sale and upon payment by the purchaser to the city of the amount of a bid accepted by the city, the treasurer, on behalf of the city, shall execute and deliver any instrument necessary to transfer the title of the city to any such property sold under this section. The treasurer shall not execute any deeds or leases for tax title property until the purchaser submits to the treasurer a statement signed under the pains and penalties of perjury that neither he nor any person who would gain equity or any interests in the property as a result of such conveyance or lease has ever been convicted of a crime involving the willful and malicious setting of a fire or of a crime involving the aiding, counseling or procuring of a willful and malicious setting of a fire, or of a crime involving the fraudulent filing of a claim of fire insurance; or is delinquent in the payment of real estate taxes to the city, or, if delinquent, that a pending application for abatement of such tax, or a pending petition before the appellate tax board or the county commissioner has been filed in good faith. If there is more than one grantee of such deed or lessee of such lease, each grantee and lessee must file such statement, and no such deed or lease shall be valid unless it contains a recitation that the treasurer has received such statement.

Sec. 2-105. - Municipal tax repayment agreements. 
(a)  Authority. This section is adopted pursuant to the authority of M.G.L.A. c. 60, § 62A, as amended, which authorizes municipalities to enact ordinances to authorize payment agreements between the city treasurer/collector and persons entitled to redeem parcels in tax title. 
(b)  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to foster the collection of unpaid taxes and assessments, promote residential stability and community reinvestment. The city finds and determines that such a program will mitigate the social cost and consequences of property seizures and will help delinquent taxpayers meet their obligations to the city while avoiding the legal expenses and time delays of taking the property to land court. During the term of any municipal tax repayment agreement the treasurer/collector may not bring an action to foreclose the tax title account unless the taxpayers fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the municipal tax repayment agreement. The forgiveness contained herein shall not be used in addition to any other forgiveness or deferral authorized by law. 
(c)  Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall be applicable: 
    Commercial taxpayer means the owner of record of an industrial or commercial use property or rental property of greater than three (3) rental units. 
    Residential taxpayer means the owner of record of an residential property containing less than four (4) units. 
    Tax repayment agreement means a payment agreement between the treasurer and the persons entitled to redeem parcels in tax title which tax title parcel(s) is (are) the subject of the agreement and which provides for payment in full, and includes residential tax repayment agreements and commercial tax repayment agreements. 
    All agreements under this section shall be in writing, signed by the taxpayer and the treasurer, and shall include the amount due upon execution of the agreement and a schedule of remaining payments. 
(d)  Residential tax repayment agreements. 
(1)  Delinquent residential taxpayers may enter into a residential tax repayment agreement and, upon execution of such agreement with the city treasurer/collector, shall make a minimum payment of twenty-five (25) percent of the total amount necessary to redeem the parcel from tax title. 
(2)  The term of a residential tax repayment agreement shall not exceed five (5) years for residential taxpayers. During the term of the residential tax repayment agreement the taxpayer shall make timely payments in accordance with a written payment schedule and must remain current on all other amounts due the city (that are a lien on the same parcel or parcels). 
(e)  Commercial tax repayment agreements. 
(1)  Delinquent commercial taxpayers may enter into a commercial tax repayment agreement and, upon execution of such agreement with the city treasurer/collector, shall make a minimum payment of twenty-five (25) percent of the total amount necessary to redeem the parcel from tax title. 
(2)  The term of a commercial tax repayment agreement shall not exceed five (5) years for commercial taxpayers. During the term of the commercial tax repayment agreement, the taxpayer shall make timely payments in accordance with a written payment schedule and shall remain current on all other amounts due the city (that are a lien on the same parcel or parcels). 
(f)  Tax repayment agreements, generally. 
(1)  A taxpayer who enters into a tax repayment agreement in accordance with this section shall be granted a fifty (50) percent waiver of the interest that has accrued on the amount of the tax title account. 
(2)  If the balance of the tax title account exceeds that parcel's assessed value as determined by the assessor's office as of the date of the agreement, then such parcel shall be granted a fifty (50) percent waiver of the interest that has accrued on the amount of the tax title account, regardless of the number of years such parcel has been in tax title. This waiver cannot reduce the total amount outstanding in the tax title account below one hundred ten (110) percent of the parcel's assessed value as determined by the assessor's office. 
(3)  Partial payments or partial payment agreements are not eligible for interest waivers of any kind. 
(4)  Calculation of the waiver of interest shall be made only after at least twenty-five (25) percent of the amount needed to redeem that parcel or parcel(s) from tax title is first paid to the treasurer. 
(5)  For so long as such payment agreements are in effect with all payments having been made in the amounts and at the times provided by the schedule in said agreement, and for so long as the current assessed taxes and other charges are paid when due and in full, then the treasurer shall not bring an action to foreclose the tax title on such parcel. 
(6)  Should the taxpayer default by failing to make payments under the agreement as provided in the schedule of remaining payments or should charges that are liens on the parcel(s) which is the subject of the agreement become delinquent, then the treasurer shall bring an action to foreclose the tax title on such parcel(s) and such agreement shall be null and void. 
(7)  Interest waivers shall be granted only if and when the delinquent taxpayer has paid off the delinquency in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Taxes or collection costs may not be waived.

    The limitations prescribed in this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to these regulations as of the effective date thereof or otherwise interfere with the continuance on any such nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to permit any such nonconforming structure or tree to be substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow or replanted so as to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on such effective date.

ARTICLE VIII. - REGULATION OF VACANT BUILDINGS 

Sec. 6-140. - Purpose.

2400. - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES. 
2410. Applicability. This Zoning Ordinance shall not apply to structures or uses lawfully in existence or lawfully begun, or to a building or special permit issued before the first publication of notice of the public hearing required by M.G.L.A. c. 40A, § 5, at which this Zoning Ordinance, or any relevant part thereof, was adopted. Such prior, lawfully existing nonconforming uses and structures may continue, provided that no modification of the use or structure is accomplished, unless authorized hereunder. 
(Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1) 
2420. Nonconforming Uses. The Board of Appeals may award a special permit to change a nonconforming use in accordance with this Section only if it determines that such change or extension shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the neighborhood. The following types of changes to nonconforming uses may be considered by the Board of Appeals: 
2421. Change or substantial extension of the use; 
2422. Change from one nonconforming use to another, less detrimental, nonconforming use. 
(Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1)

The Board of Appeals may award a special permit to reconstruct, extend, alter, or change a nonconforming structure in accordance with this Section only if it determines that such reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure to the neighborhood. The following types of changes to nonconforming structures may be considered by the Board of Appeals: 
2431. Reconstructed, extended or structurally changed; 
2432. Altered to provide for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent; 
The reconstruction, extension or structural change of such nonconforming structures so as to increase an existing nonconformity, or create a new nonconformity, including the extension of an exterior wall at or along the same nonconforming distance within a required yard, shall require the issuance of a variance from the Board of Appeals. 
(Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1) 
2440. Nonconforming Single- and Two-Family Structures. Nonconforming single- and two-family residential structures may be reconstructed, extended, altered, or structurally changed upon a determination by the Inspector of Buildings that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure, and the issuance of a building permit, where applicable. In the event that the Inspector of Buildings determines that the nonconforming nature of such structure would be increased by the proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change, the Board of Appeals may, by finding (which shall not require a super majority), allow such reconstruction, extension, alteration, or change where it determines that the proposed modification will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming structure to the neighborhood. 
(Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1) 
2450. Abandonment or Non-Use. A nonconforming use or structure which has been abandoned, or not used for a period of two (2) years, shall lose its protected status and be subject to all of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.

2700. - DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS. 
2710. General. No structure shall be erected or used, premises used, or lot changed in size or shape except in conformity with the requirements of this Section, unless exempted by this Ordinance or by statute. 
2711. Lot change. No existing conforming or nonconforming lot shall be changed in size or shape except through a public land taking or donation for road widening, drainage, utility improvements or except where otherwise permitted herein, so as to violate the provisions of this Ordinance with respect to the size of lots or yards or to create a nonconformity or increase the degree of nonconformity that presently exists. 
2712. Merger of lots. Adjacent lots held in common ownership on or after the effective date of this Section shall be treated as a single lot for zoning purposes so as to minimize nonconformities with the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, adjacent lots in common ownership may be treated as separate lots for zoning purposes upon a finding by the zoning enforcement officer that the owner of said lots has expressly exhibited the intent to maintain the lots as separate. In making said finding the zoning enforcement officer shall rely on the following factors: 
2712.a. The existence and maintenance of walls or fences along the original lot lines; 
2712.b. The fact that the lots are separately assessed for tax purposes; 
2712.c. The placement of structures on the various lots. 
The manner in which said lots were acquired or the fact that said lots were separately described on a deed shall not be considered by the zoning enforcement officer in making said finding. 
2713. Recorded Lots. A lot or parcel of land having an area or frontage of lesser amounts than required in the following schedule of dimensional requirements may be considered as satisfying the area and frontage requirements of this Section provided such lot or parcel of land was shown on a plan or described in a duly recorded deed or registered at the time of adoption of this Ordinance and did not at the time of adoptions of adjoin other land of the same owner available for use in connection with such lot or parcel. 
(Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1) 
2720. Table of Dimensional Requirements. See Appendix B. 
(Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1) 
2730. Dimensional Variation. The Board of Appeals may vary otherwise applicable dimensional requirements pertaining to frontage, lot area, building height and sidelines upon finding that owing to circumstances relating to the soil conditions, shape, or topography of such land or structures and especially affecting such land or structures but not affecting generally the zoning district in which it is located, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance or by-law would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner or appellant, and that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of such ordinance or by-law. 
(Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1) 
2740. Vision Clearance on Corner Lots in Residence Districts. On a corner lot no fence, wall or structure more than three and one-half (31/2) feet high above the plane of the established grades of the streets shall be erected on a front or side yard herein established which is included within the street lines of the intersecting streets and a straight line connecting said street lines at points which are twenty (20) feet distant from their point of intersection, measured along said street line, and no trees or hedges which will materially obstruct the view of a driver of a vehicle approaching the street intersection shall be placed or maintained within such area.

2751. Front Yards. No story or part of any building except projecting eaves or uncovered steps shall be erected nearer to the street line of any street on which it fronts than the average alignment of the corresponding stories or parts of existing buildings within two hundred (200) feet on each side of the lot and within the same block and district. Where there is a building on one or both of the adjoining lots, the front yard for a building shall have a depth equal to the average of the front yard depths of the two (2) adjoining lots. A lot without a building shall be counted as having a front yard of the depth required by this Ordinance. If there are no existing buildings on the same side of the street, the average setback alignment of corresponding stories within two hundred (200) feet on each side of and directly opposite the lot shall govern. Nothing in this Ordinance shall require any story or part of a building to set back more than fifteen (15) feet from any street line. One street frontage of a corner lot shall be exempt from these provisions as provided in subsection 2752. The front yard of a lot shall remain clear of debris and junk. 
2752. Where the alignment of a building is not controlled by subsection 2751, between every building and the line of the street upon which it fronts there shall be a front yard of a clear depth of fifteen (15) feet, except that on one side of a corner lot a yard of a clear depth of not less than ten (10) feet shall be provided, in which case this distance shall not be considered in determining the front yard depths on such street.

In such case the storage shed may extend to eighteen (18) inches of the fence or fence post whichever is closest. Unless referenced in this Code, nothing may be placed or constructed in or upon the ground within six (6) feet of a rear lot line. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a fence may be constructed near or along a rear lot line and vegetation may also be planted within six (6) feet of a rear lot line. 
2754. Where a lot is more than one hundred (100) feet deep, one-half (1/2) of the additional depth of the lot in excess of one hundred (100) feet shall be added to said rear yard depth; but in no case shall a rear yard depth in excess of forty (40) feet be required. The setbacks referenced in the previous section shall also apply to this Section. 
2755. Side Yards. There shall be a side yard on every lot and it shall be at least ten (10) feet on one side and twelve (12) feet on the other side. The side yard shall be unobstructed from the line of the street to the rear lot line except that open porches, decks, steps, patios and pools (including any projections therefrom), which are located behind the dwelling within the rear yard, may extend to six (6) feet of a side lot line, driveways may extend to four (4) feet of a side lot line and storage sheds, which are located behind the dwelling within the rear yard may extend to eighteen (18) inches of a side yard unless a fence is erected on the property along the side yard line.

2756. Special Driveway Side Yard Requirements. For existing dwellings on lot sizes of less than five thousand (5,000) square feet, driveways shall not extend to the side lot line closer than ten (10) percent of the distance between the side lot line and the principle dwelling. For any driveway in excess of thirteen (13) feet in width, the provisions of Section 2755 regulating driveway setbacks shall apply and this section shall not apply.

3111. In the event of the enlargement of a structure existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this Section is derived, or the construction or relocation of additional structures on a lot, after such effective date, the regulations of this Section shall apply only to the enlargement, construction or relocation thereof, except that any off-street parking and off-street loading facilities established to serve any buildings and any uses prior to such effective date shall not be reduced below the required number. 
3112. For a building or premises used for combined purposes, the number of off-street parking spaces and off-street loading spaces shall be determined as the sum of the required number of spaces in each component of the combined use. 
3113. Where the computation of required parking spaces and loading spaces result in a fractional number, the required parking spaces shall be the next whole number. 
(Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1) 
3120. Special Permit. Any parking or loading requirement set forth herein may be reduced upon the issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board if the Board finds that the reduction is not inconsistent with public health and safety, or that the reduction promotes a public benefit. Such cases might include: 
3121. Use of a common parking lot for separate uses having peak demands occurring at different times; 
3122. Age or other characteristics of occupants of the facility requiring parking which reduces auto usage; 
3123. Peculiarities of the use which make usual measures of demand invalid; 
3124. Availability of on-street parking or parking at nearby municipally owned facilities. 
3125. Where a special permit is granted, a reserve area, to be maintained indefinitely as landscaped open space, may be required sufficient to accommodate the difference between the spaces otherwise required and the spaces reduced by special permit. The parking/site plan shall show (in dotted outline) how the reserve area would be laid out in to provide the otherwise required number of spaces.

3148. No off-street loading areas or berths shall be laid out in such a manner as will result in loading or unloading being carried on within a street right-of-way or other public property. Each area or berth shall be sufficient size as to accommodate the largest expected truck or tractor trailer common to the building use. 
3149. Special Permit for Commercial Parking in Residential Districts. Commercial parking may be allowed on residentially zoned property, held in common ownership and located immediately adjacent to the commercial business to which it is to serve, upon the issuance of a special permit by the Zoning Board of Appeals, if the Board finds that said parking is not detrimental to public health and safety, and that said parking promotes a public benefit.

4400. - FLOOD HAZARD OVERLAY DISTRICT (FHOD). 
4410. Statement of Purpose. The purposes of the Floodplain District are to: 
(1)  Ensure public safety through reducing the threats to life and personal injury; 
(2)  Eliminate new hazards to emergency response officials; 
(3)  Prevent the occurrence of public emergencies resulting from water quality, contamination, and pollution due to flooding; 
(4)  Avoid the loss of utility services which if damaged by flooding would disrupt or shut down the utility network and impact regions of the community beyond the site of flooding; 
(5)  Eliminate costs associated with the response and cleanup of flooding conditions; 
(6)  Reduce damage to public and private property resulting from flooding waters. 
(Ord. of 9-17-09, § 1) 
4420. Definitions. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A, AO, AH, Al-30, AE, A99, Vl-30, VE, or V. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Coastal high hazard area means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. The area is designated on a FIRM as Zone V, Vl-30, VE. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to building or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations. 
    District means Floodplain District. 
    Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers the National Flood Insurance Program. FEMA provides a Nationwide flood hazard area mapping study program for communities as well as regulatory standards for development in the flood hazard areas. 
    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study means an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards, and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement or cellar). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of NFIP Regulations 60.3. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designated for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    New construction means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community. For the purpose of determining insurance rates, new construction means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31,1974, whichever is later. 
    One-hundred-year flood - see Base flood. 
    Regulatory Floodway - see Floodway. 
    Special flood hazard area means an area having special flood and/or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, Al-30, AE, A99, AH, V, Vl-30, VE. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. Structure, for insurance coverage purposes, means a walled and roofed building other than a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home on foundation. For the latter purpose, the term includes a building while in the course of construction, alteration, or repair, but does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in such construction, alteration, or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure either (a) before the improvement or repair is started, or (b) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
    Zone A means the one-hundred-year floodplain area where the base flood elevation (BFE) has not been determined. To determine the BFE, use the best available Federal, State, local, or other data. 
    Zone A1-30 and Zone AE (for new and revised maps) means the one-hundred-year floodplain where the base flood elevation has been determined. 
    Zone AH and Zone AO means the one-hundred-year floodplain with flood depths of one to three (3) feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where the velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Zone A99 means areas to be protected from the one-hundred-year flood by federal flood protection system under construction. Base flood elevations have not been determined. 
    Zones B, C, and X are areas identified in the community flood insurance study as areas of moderate or minimal flood hazard. Zone X replaces Zones B and C on new and revised maps. 
    Zone V means a special flood hazard area along a coast subject to inundation by the one-hundred-year flood with the additional hazards associated with storm waves. Base flood elevations have not been determined. 
    Zone V1-30 and Zone VE (for new and revised maps) means a special flood hazard area along a coast subject to inundation by the one-hundred-year flood with additional hazards due to velocity (wave action). Base flood elevations have been determined.

4600. - WORKING WATERFRONT OVERLAY DISTRICT. 
There shall be a Working Waterfront Overlay District, comprising the waterfront area between Gifford Street and Interstate Route I-195. A fish fillet or fish processing plant shall only be allowed in Industrial "B" Zones that are located within the Working Waterfront Overlay District. 
(Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1) 
4610. - HICKS-LOGAN-SAWYER DISTRICT INTERIM PLANNING OVERLAY DISTRICT (HLS IPOD). 
4620. Statement of Purpose. An Interim Planning Overlay District (IPOD) is established to regulate development in the Hicks-Logan-Sawyer District to permit the City of New Bedford adequate time to implement new permanent zoning regulations consistent with Hicks-Logan-Sawyer District Master Plan, which was adopted by the Planning Board on April 30, 2008. 
    These changes will assist the City in generating economic revitalization by retaining existing, and attracting new, sustainable businesses into the District, maintaining the historic character of the District, creating a Mixed-Use District as a new destination within the City, utilizing and enhancing the District's current and proposed multi-modal transportation options, removing blighted buildings to improve the appearance of the Project Area, better utilization of the waterfront and public access to the Acushnet River, improvement of internal circulation and connections to surrounding neighborhoods, and expansion of public open spaces and community resources within the Project Area. 
4630. HLS IPOD Boundaries. The boundary of the HLS IPOD is shown on the City of New Bedford Zoning Map, which map is hereby incorporated and made part of this Ordinance. 
4640. Relationship to Existing Zoning. 
4641. Generally. The HLS IPOD zoning regulations supersede all underlying zoning regulations. Development proposed in the area designated as the HLS IPOD shall be regulated by the procedures and criteria established by the HLS IPOD as described herein; and by the goals and objectives of the HLS District Master Plan as adopted by the Planning Board. 
4642. Exceptions. Development shall be permitted to occur consistent with the regulations of the underlying zoning districts if said development does not exceed 500 square feet and the purpose of the expansion is to improve the economic viability of existing uses, or to meet current health, safety and building codes. Further, if sites within the Hick-Logan-Sawyer District are currently subject to an existing Overlay District, and said District was adopted prior to the adoption of this section, the zoning regulations of said Overlay District shall apply and the HLS IPOD regulations shall not apply. Further, projects for which Building Permit Applications have been filed prior to enactment or effective date of the HLS IPOD must be consistent with Ch.40A, Sec. 6. 
4650. HLS IPOD Review Procedure and Criteria. 
4651. Staff Review. All development proposals subject to HLS IPOD regulations shall be submitted to the City of New Bedford Planning Department for review and comment. The Planning Department may solicit comments from any City agency as part of its administrative review. The Planning Department may prepare written comments and recommendations within 30 days, and submit said comments and recommendations to the Planning Board. If no comments are submitted within 30 days of the initial submission to the City Planning Department, the Planning Board shall proceed without said comments. Upon receipt of the Planning Department's comments the Planning Board shall commence the Special Permit application review process. If no comments are received from the Planning Department, the Planning Board shall commence the Special Permit application process 30 days from the applicant's submission of materials to the New Bedford Planning Department. 
4660. Special Permit and Site Plan Guidelines. All development proposals within the HLS IPOD that are not exempt consistent with Sub-section 4642 above, shall require a Special Permit from the New Bedford Planning Board consistent with the procedures of this Ordinance and the guidelines noted below. Further, a Special Permit for development in the HLS IPOD shall be subject to the site design criteria of Section 5400 Site Plan Review, but shall not require a separate Site Plan Review filing. The HLS IPOD shall be construed as a combined Special Permit and Site Plan Procedure subject to the following additional guidelines. In order for any Special Permit to be approved, the New Bedford Planning Board shall make a written finding that the proposed development is consistent with the objectives of the HLS District Master Plan as adopted by the New Bedford Planning Board. 
4661. Design and Development Guidelines. The Planning Board shall make written findings that the proposed development is consistent with the following design policies, principles and goals, which are intended to provide policy guidance to property owners and the general public about the form and character desirable for development in the HLS District. Because the Master Plan for the HLS District provides for diverse types and mixtures of land uses, the appropriate management of transitions among private uses and between private and public spaces is critical. 
The application of these principles can vary within the context of specific building proposals in ways that still fully respect the policies' intent. It is intended that project proponents, City staff, the Planning Board and the general public will be open to creative variations from the guidance presented here as long as the core values expressed are being served. A project need not meet all the goals of this section to receive a Special Permit, but the permit granting authority shall find that, on balance, the City's objectives are being served while more detailed planning for the District is being completed. 
Project proponents shall indicate in narrative and graphic formats how their projects conform to the following design policies, principles and goals set forth in the HLS District Master Plan. 
(A) Relationship to Public Spaces. "Public Spaces" shall include streets, sidewalks, squares, parks, pedestrian and bicycle paths and facilities. Development should enhance public spaces, and where possible, make physical improvements on site, or on abutting public ways to enhance consistency of design, access and safety of public spaces consistent with the HLS District Master Plan. 
 Buildings and landscape elements should define and frame public spaces. Property lines should be defined by buildings, street walls, or fences. New development and adaptive reuse shall create a street edge at the sidewalk either by the building itself or by a fence or continuous landscaped edge. 
 Buildings should be oriented toward public spaces with entrances and windows on the street. Blank walls parallel to the street are discouraged. 
 New developments should follow and retain the existing block system, where feasible. New blocks should be sized proportionately to existing blocks. 
 Buildings entrances should be located to facilitate pedestrian movement between private and public spaces and to promote strong physical connections to public spaces. 
 New development and adaptive reuse should promote active ground floor uses with the potential to animate the street. 
 Awnings, facade treatments and window displays for ground floor uses, which are compatible with surrounding uses, are encouraged. 
 All street right-of-ways and pedestrian precincts should have new or repaired sidewalks, street trees, and pedestrian-scale streetlights. 
 Curb cuts should be limited in size and number. Shared driveways between adjoining uses are encouraged. 
 Off-street parking, service entrances, trash management, and mechanical equipment should be located away from streets and other public spaces. Surface parking in front of or underneath raised buildings is discouraged. Shared parking between adjoining uses is encouraged. 
 Spaces that provide opportunities for public events programming, including public art and open market areas should be fostered and/or incorporated into development concepts. 
 Connections to the proposed Commuter Rail Station should be provided for pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles. 
 New roads should follow the HLS District Master Plan framework and connect with existing roads within the District, creating a regular grid network where feasible. Roads that end in cul-de-sacs are discouraged. 
(B) Historic Context. The HLS District contains mill buildings dating from the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries, when the District was a center of textile and metals manufacturing. Some of these buildings may be "Brownfields" containing toxic contaminants. The City wishes both to encourage adaptive reuse of existing mill buildings and to encourage redevelopment of Brownfield Sites. 
 Where relevant and feasible, the adaptive reuse of some or all of existing historic buildings should be considered, especially in the case of buildings deemed preferably preserved by the New Bedford Historical Commission. The HLS District Master Plan recommends the preservation of the following mills: 
 Mills within the proposed Wamsutta Mill National Register Historic District 
 Ice House within the Former Revere Copper Site 
 #26 North Front Street within the Former Revere Copper Site 
 #122-124 North Front Street 
 Fairhaven Mills 
 A portion of the Kilburn Mill 
 Infill development near historic structures and new construction attached to historic structures should be compatible with the historic context. However, new construction should not attempt to be a copy of existing structures. 
(C) Relationship to the Waterfront. The City wishes to enhance public access to the Acushnet River waterfront outside of the Designated Port District. 
 Provide for a publicly accessible waterfront, regardless of whether the land is publicly or privately owned. 
 Preserve views down streets to the water and waterfront activities. 
 Provide active and passive recreation uses along the waterfront as part of the site plan. 
 Activate the waterfront using active ground level uses such as restaurants and retail destinations. 
(D) Environmental Goals. Buildings should be designed to use natural resources and energy resources efficiently in construction, maintenance, and long-term operation of the building. 
 Compliance with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification Standards and other evolving environmental efficiency standards is encouraged. 
(E) Economic Development Goals. The City encourages developments that will promote economic development by retaining existing jobs and creating new jobs in the HLS District. 
 Projects should have a mix of compatible land uses, such as residential, commercial and light industrial uses. 
 New developments should support land uses that will utilize and encourage the usage of the proposed Commuter Rail Station south of the HLS District. 
(F) Master Plan Approach. All applications for development should be presented using a Master Plan approach. Projects should address both the various development phases of the proposed project and the phasing of other known building and infrastructure improvements within the HSL District in order to coordinate and maximize the benefits of redevelopment and infrastructure improvements, as much as possible. 
4670. Dimensional Regulations. Building height, building-to-lot coverage, total lot coverage by impervious surfaces, building-to-lot setbacks, and all other dimensional regulations such as the sign regulations of this Ordinance shall not apply to Special Permit Applications in the area designated as the HLS IPOD. Said dimensional regulations shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure consistency with the Hicks-Logan-Sawyer District Master Plan. 
4671. Parking Regulations. The Planning Board, in considering any development proposal within the HLS IPOD shall consider the off-street parking requirements of this Ordinance as maximum allowable off-street parking requirements. Further, the Planning Board may request and require that the proposed development provide off-street parking at a rate less than is required by this Ordinance or in a shared parking arrangement in order to further the objectives of the HLS District Master Plan.

No vegetation in this buffer area will be disturbed, destroyed or removed, except for normal maintenance. The Planning Board may waive the buffer requirement (i) where the land abutting the site is the subject of a permanent restriction for conservation or recreation so long as a buffer is established of at least ten (10) feet in depth which may include such restricted land area within such buffer area calculation; or (ii) where the land abutting the site is held by the City for conservation or recreation purposes; or (iii) the Planning Board determines that a smaller buffer will suffice to accomplish the objectives set forth herein. 
4753. Removal and Replacement of Vegetation. With the site, no clear cutting shall be permitted, except incidental to construction of buildings, roads, trails and parking areas. 
4754. Roadways. The principal roadway(s) serving the site shall be designed to conform with the standards of the City where the roadway is or may be ultimately intended for dedication and acceptance by the City of New Bedford. Private ways shall be adequate for the intended use and vehicular traffic and shall be maintained by an association of unit owners or by the Applicant. 
4755. Parking. The applicant shall provide adequate parking to serve all anticipated uses on the property, with information detailing the method of computation of parking spaces.

5700. - PLANNING MORATORIUM. 
5710. Moratorium on used car sales permits. To provide the licensing board with the opportunity to review criteria for granting licenses for used car sales, there is hereby imposed a moratorium on Class II used car sales permits, other than renewals, for a period of one year. During the term of this moratorium (unless earlier terminated by ordinance) the City will not accept any permit applications for Class II used car sales. The moratorium imposed by this Section shall be in effect for one year commencing on the date of passage. 
5720.  Temporary Moratorium on Recreational Marijuana Establishments . 
5721.  Purpose . On November 8, 2016 the voters of the Commonwealth approved a law regulating the cultivation, processing, distribution, possession and use of marijuana for recreational purposes (new M.G.L.A. c. 94G, Regulation of the Use and Distribution of Marijuana Not Medically Prescribed). The law, which allows certain personal use and possession of marijuana, took effect on December 15, 2016 and was amended on December 30, 2016 by Chapter 351 of the Acts of 2016 and thereafter, on July 28, 2017 by Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2017. The law requires the Cannabis Control Commission ("CCC") to issue regulations regarding the licensing of commercial activities by March 15, 2018 and to begin accepting applications for licenses no later than April 1, 2018. Currently, the zoning ordinances do not specifically address marijuana establishments as that term is defined in M.G.L.A. c. 94G, §1. The final CCC regulations may provide guidance on certain aspects of local regulation of marijuana establishments. The regulation of non-medical marijuana raises novel legal, planning, and public safety issues, and the City needs time to study and consider these issues, as well as to address the potential impact of the CCC regulations on local zoning and, in connection therewith, to undertake a planning process to consider amending the zoning ordinances to regulate marijuana establishments. The City intends to adopt a temporary moratorium on the use of land and structures for recreational marijuana establishments so as to allow sufficient time to address the effects of such structures and uses in the City and to enact ordinances in a consistent manner. 
5722.  Definition . "Marijuana Establishment" shall mean a marijuana cultivator, independent testing laboratory, marijuana product manufacturer, marijuana retailer or any other type of licensed marijuana-related business, all as defined for purposes of M.G.L.A. c. 94G, §1. 
5723.  Temporary Moratorium . For the reasons set forth above and notwithstanding any other provision of the zoning ordinances to the contrary, the City hereby adopts a temporary moratorium on the use of land or structures for a marijuana establishment and other uses related to non-medical marijuana. The moratorium shall be in effect through September 30, 2018 or until such time as the City adopts a zoning ordinance relating to marijuana establishments, whichever occurs first. During the moratorium period the City shall undertake a planning process to address the potential impacts of marijuana establishments and shall consider adopting zoning ordinances in response to these new issues or take any action relative thereto. 
(Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1; Ord. of 5-1-18, § 1) 
5800-8999. - RESERVED. 
(Ord. of 12-23-03, § 1) 
9000. - SEPARABILITY. 
The invalidity of any section or provision of this Ordinance shall not invalidate any other section or provision herein.

Sec. 13-5. - Condominium conversion; removal of rental units from the market; definitions; notice; eviction; purchase; benefits; assistance and punishment; condominium review board. 
(a)  Preamble. 
Whereas, a serious public emergency exists with respect to the housing of a substantial number of citizens of New Bedford; and 
Whereas, the deterioration and demolition of existing housing and an insufficient supply of new rental housing have resulted in a substantial and critical shortage of safe, decent, and reasonable priced rental housing accommodations; and 
Whereas, the prolonged increases in housing costs at a rate substantially exceeding increases in personal income, the increased costs of new housing construction and the conversion of multiple unit rental housing accommodations occupied by tenants to condominium units and cooperatives has resulted in a substantial and critical shortage of safe, decent, and reasonably priced housing accommodations; and 
Whereas, home ownership creates an interest in real estate which tends to contribute to the maintenance and preservation of housing and to an increase in real estate taxes which has a salutary effect on the city and its people, and the city council should, therefore, encourage an increase in such ownership or at least should avoid discouraging it; and 
Whereas, at present in the city there is a great interest in and a significant amount of conversions of multiple unit rental housing occupied by tenants to condominium units or cooperatives occupied by individual owners thereof; and 
Whereas, notwithstanding the general good accomplished by such increase in home ownership, many people of limited means, particularly the elderly, the handicapped, and persons and families of low and moderate income, are suffering thereby in that they have difficulty in obtaining alternative rental housing at prices which they can afford when evicted for condominium conversion; and 
Whereas, the untoward effects of condominium conversion evictions on tenants can be adequately dealt with by providing potentially displaced tenants with sufficient time to examine the housing market, evaluate available housing alternatives, formulate future housing plans, secure any necessary financing and decide whether to purchase the condominium unit or relocate; and 
Whereas, this emergency cannot be dealt with solely by the operation of the private rental housing market, and unless evictions for condominium conversions and cooperatives are regulated and controlled, such emergency and the inflationary pressures and displacement resulting therefrom will produce serious threats to the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of New Bedford; 
Now, therefore, pursuant to the authority vested in it by law, including without limitation, Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983, as amended by Chapter 170 of the Acts of 1984, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of New Bedford as follows: 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following words shall, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, have the following meanings: 
    Condominium unit. A unit in a housing condominium as that term is defined in M.G.L.A. c. 183A. 
    Condominium or cooperative conversion eviction. An eviction of a tenant for the purpose of removing such tenant from a housing accommodation in order to facilitate the initial sale and transfer of legal title to that housing accommodation as a condominium or cooperative unit to a prospective purchaser or an eviction of a tenant by any other person who has purchased a housing accommodation as a condominium or cooperative unit when the tenant whose eviction is sought was a resident of the housing accommodation at the time the notice of intent to convert is given to convert the building or buildings to the condominium or cooperative form of ownership pursuant to this section provided, however, that the eviction of a tenant for nonpayment of rent or other violation of a rental agreement shall in no event be deemed a condominium or cooperation conversion eviction. 
    Elderly tenant. A tenant who is a person or group of persons residing in the same housing accommodation any of whom has reached the age of fifty-nine (59) years or over as of the date of receipt of the notice provided for hereunder.

(3)  Buildings containing fewer than three (3) housing accommodations; 
(4)  Housing accommodation in hotels, motels, inns, tourist homes, and rooming and boarding houses which are occupied by transient guests staying for a period of fewer than fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days. 
    Interest subsidy. Any payment made by the federal or state government to reduce the effective interest rate payable by the mortgagor. 
    Low or moderate income tenant. A tenant who is a person or group of persons residing in the same housing accommodation so long as the total income for all such tenants for the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the date of notice provided for hereunder is less than the income eligibility levels as set forth in regulations promulgated from time to time by the department of housing and urban development regulating the Section 8 Rental Subsidy Program, and calculated pursuant to said regulations. 
    Tenant. A person or group of persons collectively entitled to occupy a housing accommodation pursuant to a rental agreement written or implied. 
    Tenant subsidy. Any payment made by the federal or state government for or on behalf of any tenant to be applied toward the reduction of the tenant's rental payment. 
(c)  Conversion, notice, eviction, purchase, benefits and assistance. 
(1)  If a building submitted to the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 183A, c. 156B, c. 157, c. 157B or any provisions of the Massachusetts General laws governing the cooperative form of ownership has been used in whole or in part for residential purposes within one year prior to the recording of a master deed creating a condominium or the filing of the articles of organization creating a housing cooperative, the owner thereof shall give each tenant of all housing accommodations in such building or buildings notice of intent to convert the building or buildings to the condominium or cooperative form of ownership. Such notice shall state in clear and conspicuous language the following in English, Spanish, and Portuguese: 
a.  That the owner has filed or intends to file a master deed at the registry of deeds whose location is stated in the notice or has filed or intends to file articles of organization with the secretary of the commonwealth; 
b.  That any tenant residing on the date the notice of intent is given in the building or buildings converted or to be converted to the condominium or cooperative forms of ownership shall have a period of time which shall be stated in the notice, from the date of receipt of such notice, as authorized by this act, before the tenant shall be required to vacate the housing accommodation occupied on the date the notice is received; 
c.  That any tenant residing on the date the notice of intent was given in the building or buildings to be converted shall have a period of time, which shall be stated in the notice, from the date of receipt of such notice, as authorized by this section, to purchase the unit occupied by the tenant on the date the notice is received on terms and conditions which are substantially the same as or more favorable than those which the owner extends to the public generally for the ninety (90) days following the expiration of said tenants right to purchase as may be required by paragraph (2). 
All notices required under this section shall be deemed to have been given when a written notice is delivered in person or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the party to whom the notice is being given. 
Whenever an owner is required to give notice of intent provided for in this section the period of notice shall not be less than the expiration of any written agreement between the owner and the tenant of the housing accommodation which governs the use and occupancy of said housing accommodation or one year from the date the tenant of such housing accommodation is given said notice of intent, whichever is greater; provided, however, that in the case of a housing accommodation occupied in whole or in part by a handicapped tenant or occupied by an elderly or low or moderate income tenant the period of notice shall not be less than two (2) years from the date the tenant of such housing accommodation received said notice of intent. 
No person shall bring any action seeking a condominium or cooperative eviction until the expiration of the periods of time for notice to tenants specified in this section. 
The burden of proving qualifications with respect to age, handicap, and income shall rest with the tenant. 
(2)  Any owner of residential property who converts such property to the condominium or cooperative form of ownership shall give to any tenant who is entitled to receive notice pursuant to this section the right to purchase the housing accommodation occupied by such tenant at the time such notice is delivered on terms and conditions which are substantially the same as or more favorable than those which the owner extends to the public generally for the ninety (90) days following the expiration of said tenant's right to purchase. Such tenant may exercise a right to purchase such housing accommodations by executing a purchase and sale agreement prior to the expiration of ninety (90) days after the date of receiving a copy of the purchase and sale agreement properly executed by the person offering the housing accommodation for sale. 
(3)  The owner of residential property converted to the condominium or cooperative form of ownership shall pay to any tenant who is entitled to receive a notice pursuant to this section and who does not purchase the housing accommodation which he occupies or another housing accommodation in the same building or buildings relocation benefits for the actual, documented costs of moving, not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per housing accommodation; provided, that if such housing accommodation is occupied in whole or in part by a handicapped tenant or is occupied by an elderly or low or moderate income tenant the maximum relocation benefit shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per housing accommodation. Such relocation benefits shall be payable within ten (10) days after the date on which the tenant vacates the housing accommodation occupied by him; provided, however, that no tenant shall be eligible for such relocation benefits unless all rent due and payable for said unit under the rental agreement or extension of such agreement, if any, has been paid by the tenant prior to the date on which the housing accommodation is vacated and only as long as the tenant voluntarily vacates the housing accommodation for which recovery of possession is sought on or before the expiration of the notice period. 
(4)  Any owner of residential property converted to the condominium or cooperative form of ownership shall assist elderly, handicapped and low or moderate income tenants who qualified as such as of the date of receipt of the notice authorized pursuant to this section locating, within the period of the notice to such tenants, comparable rental housing within the same city or town in which such tenant resides which rents for a sum which is equal to or less than the sum which such tenant had been paying for the housing accommodation occupied at the time of receipt of the notice authorized by this section. The failure of the owner of such residential property to find such substitute housing accommodation shall extend the period of notice for up to an additional two (2) years. 
(5)  Any owner of residential property converted to the condominium or cooperative form of ownership shall give to any tenant who is entitled to receive a notice pursuant to this section an extension of the rental agreement at the expiration thereof. Such extension, where required, shall be for such period or periods of one year or such fraction thereof as shall equal the period of notice to which such tenant is entitled pursuant to the provisions of this section. The provisions of such rental agreement may not otherwise be modified by the property owner except with respect to the amount of annual rent, any increase in which shall not exceed an amount equal to the sum which would result by multiplying said rent by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, during the calendar year immediately preceding the date upon which such rental agreement is commenced, or ten (10) percent, whichever is less; provided, however, nothing herein shall limit the right of a property owner to any amounts which may be due under a valid tax escalation clause. 
(d)  Punishment, enforcement. In accordance with the Acts of 1983, Chapter 527, Section 5, any owner who converts residential property in violation of any provisions of the ordinance, adopted pursuant to the Acts of 1983, Chapter 527, shall be punished by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or by imprisonment of not less than sixty (60) days. Each unit covered in violation of this section constitutes a separate offense. 
    Any violation of this section adopted pursuant to the Acts of 1983, Chapter 527, by an owner of residential property shall not affect the validity of a conveyance of a condominium unit or an interest in a housing cooperative to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation. 
    The district and superior courts, in the City of New Bedford and Bristol County, shall have jurisdiction over any action arising from any violation of this section adopted pursuant to the Acts of 1983, Chapter 527, and shall have jurisdiction in equity to restrain any such violation. 
(e)  Condominium review board. 
(1)  There is hereby established a condominium review board, hereinafter called the "board," which shall consist of five (5) members, each of whom shall be residents of the City of New Bedford as a condition of their appointment and continued service as a member of the board. Board members shall serve without compensation and shall be appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council, except that one member shall be a member of the city council appointed annually in January by the president of the city council, and one member shall be familiar with the housing needs and issues of the City of New Bedford.

The manhole and equipment shall be installed by the owner at said owner's expense, and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe, accessible and in good working condition at all times. 
(17)  Measurements, tests and analyses. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136 and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole(s) has/have been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136 to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples. The commissioner may use a grab sample to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards at any time. 
(18)  Special agreements and arrangements. No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern, provided such agreements do not violate the provisions of Federal Pretreatment Standards (40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403). 
(e)  Upon the promulgation of national categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the pretreatment standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed in this document, shall immediately supersede any limit imposed by this article. 
(f)  No person shall discharge wastewater containing any pollutant specified in Appendix A, annexed hereto, and incorporated herein by reference, in excess of the limitations for each of said pollutants as specified in said Appendix A. Compliance with the provisions of this section shall be assessed on the basis of samples of the person's wastewater discharge collected at each point of connection between the person's building, structure, facility or installation and the facility's sewage system. If a national categorical pretreatment standard establishes limitations for industrial users in a particular industrial subcategory which are more stringent than the limitations specified in Appendix A, those more stringent limitations shall immediately apply to those users subject to that national categorical pretreatment standard. Compliance with national categorical pretreatment standards shall be assessed in accordance with the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 403.12

(2)  In-ground grease interceptors and grease traps shall be inspected monthly by the owner/operator and shall be cleaned by a licensed septage hauler whenever the level of grease is twenty-five (25) percent of the effective depth of the trap in accordance with MA DEP 310 CMR 15.351. If this is not met, an increased pumping frequency shall be required. 
(3)  The commissioner may require that, at the food service facility's expense, appropriate monitoring facilities, such as a control manhole, or a sampling port downstream of all interceptors be installed. 
(4)  Grease interceptor cleaning and maintenance shall include pumping the grease interceptor until empty, and cleaning the side walls, baffle walls, cross-pipes and inlet and outlet pipes. Internal piping shall be immediately restored to their original design configuration should any damage occur. If multiple grease interceptors are installed, all traps in the series must be pumped according to the maintenance schedule. 
(5)  No emulsifiers, enzymes, grease cutters or other chemicals, which could cause grease to pass through the grease interceptor, may be used in the maintenance of a grease interceptor or its drain lines. A live bacterial product, which does not contain any enzymes, surfactants, emulsifiers, or substances that act as solvents for fat and does not affect the publically owned treatment works may be used in the cleaning and maintenance, upon approval by the commissioner and based on formulation and operational criteria such as material safety data sheets. 
(6)  No garbage disposals or in-drain food grinders which could allow food substances to pass through the grease interceptor and/or cause damage to the collection system, may be used. 
(7)  Grease interceptors must be pumped out completely and left empty. Decanting or pump and return of FOG are prohibited. 
(8)  In-ground grease interceptors shall be pumped in accordance with MA DEP 310 CMR 15.351 The measurement point for determination of the grease and solids layer shall be adjacent to the outlet pipe.

(10)  The food service facility shall be responsible for opening access covers or manhole covers to the grease interceptor for inspection by the commissioner. 
(11)  The grease interceptor area and monitoring facilities shall be maintained in a condition that is safe, clear of debris, and accessible at all times for observation, inspection, sample collection and flow measurement of the food service facility's discharge to the publically owned treatment works. 
(12)  Manholes shall be maintained at least to finish grade and will be maintained to prevent inflow. 
(13)  Upon discovery of a problem or damaged interceptor, the food service facility manager shall notify the commissioner within seventy-two (72) hours of the discovery. A maintenance response by the food service facility is required within five (5) days and a report of corrections performed submitted to the commissioner upon completion of repairs. 
(e)  Food service facility identification . 
(1)  It is unlawful for any food service facility that generates FOG or produces FOG to discharge same into the city's publically owned treatment works without authorization from the commissioner. 
i.  Authorization shall be given in the form of a grease registration certificate. Application for a grease registration certificate shall be made to the commissioner, along with a registration fee, in an amount established by the commissioner. If, after examining the information contained in the application, the commissioner determines that the proposed food service facility does comply with the provisions of this section, a grease registration certificate shall be issued allowing the discharge from a grease interceptor into the city's publically owned treatment works. If the commissioner denies a food service facility's application for a grease registration certificate, the commissioner shall notify the owner of the food service facility, in writing, of his decision. The owner of the food service facility may request a hearing before the commissioner, by submitting a written request to the commissioner within twenty (20) days of receipt of the notice of denial. The commissioner shall conduct a hearing with sixty (60) days and, upon the completion of the hearing, shall issue a written decision to the owner of the food service facility.

ARTICLE VIII. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 16-131. - Purpose and intent. 
(a)  Purpose . The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff, nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment, and erosion and sedimentation associated with construction. Utilizing better site design and proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, protect water and aquatic resources, and promote groundwater recharge to protect surface and groundwater drinking supplies. This ordinance seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land alteration activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development, redevelopment and all land alteration activities maintain or, to the maximum extent technically feasible, restore the natural hydrologic characteristics of the land to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, siltation, nonpoint source pollution, property damage, and to improve the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria to control stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish minimum design criteria for the protection of properties and aquatic and groundwater resources downstream from land development and land alteration activities and to minimize nonpoint source pollution from stormwater runoff, which would otherwise degrade water quality; 
(5)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards, as established by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and by Site Plan Review Requirements of the City of New Bedford Planning Department; 
(6)  Encourage the use of low impact development (LID) practices that reduce runoff volume, such as reducing impervious cover and the preservation of green space and other natural areas; 
(7)  Prohibit illicit connections and illicit discharges to the municipal storm drain systems and require the removal of all such illicit connections; 
(8)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and non-structural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; 
(9)  Establish provisions to ensure there is an adequate funding mechanism, including surety, for the proper review, inspection and long-term maintenance of stormwater facilities implemented as part of this ordinance; 
(10)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval or disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved active projects and long-term follow up; 
(11)  Establish certain administrative procedures and fees for the submission, review, approval, or disapproval of stormwater plans, and the inspection of approved projects; 
(12)  Establish enforcement mechanisms for failure to comply with provisions of this ordinance; and 
(13)  Establish a mechanism by which the city can meet requirements of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s). 
(b)  Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements . This ordinance is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this ordinance shall be considered minimum requirements and where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.

    In the case of the city clerk and clerk of committees, the performance evaluation shall be completed by the city council president. Upon issuing a "Not Met" overall performance evaluation for the city clerk or clerk of committees, the city council president shall make recommendation to the city council in writing with reasons therefore and with a copy to the city clerk or clerk of committees who received an overall performance rating of "Not Met" and a step rate increase is not warranted or justified upon review of the employee's performance. The city clerk or clerk of committees shall have ten (10) days from receipt of said reasons to submit supplemental information to the city council that shall then decide to grant or disapprove the step rate increase and said decision shall be final. In the case of the legislative counsel, the annual re-appointment shall be sufficient approval of the next step rate increase. 
(c)  The mayor may authorize payment of initial compensation above the minimum (but not exceeding the maximum of the salary grade for such position) with the approval of the city council.

CITY OF NEW BEDFORD 
SUBDIVISION CONTROL REGULATIONS 
PURPOSE 
    The Subdivision Control Law has been accepted by the City of New Bedford for the purpose of protecting the safety, convenience and welfare of the inhabitants of the City by regulating the laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions providing access to the several lots therein, but which have not become public ways, and ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions and in proper cases, parks and open areas. The powers of the Board of Survey and Board of Appeals under the Subdivision Control Law will be exercised with due regard for the provision of adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be safe and convenient for travel; for lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent public ways; for reducing danger to life and limb in the operation of motor vehicles; for securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic and other emergencies; for ensuring compliance with applicable zoning and airport approach regulations; for securing adequate provision for water, sewerage, drainage and other requirements where necessary in a subdivision; and for coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other and with the public ways in the City and with the ways in neighboring subdivisions. 
Article I. Authority. 
These regulations are promulgated by the City of New Bedford Board of Survey under the Massachusetts Subdivision Control Law (M.G.L.A. c. 41, as amended). Under Section 22-30 of the New Bedford City Code, the Mayor and City Council act as Board of Survey. 
Article II. Application of regulations. 
(A)  Definitions. 
(1)  "Subdivision" shall mean the division of a tract of land into two (2) or more lots and shall include re-subdivision, and when appropriate to the context, shall relate to the process of subdivision of the land or territory subdivided; provided, however, that the division of a tract of land into two (2) or more lots shall not be deemed to constitute a subdivision within the meaning of the Subdivision Control Law if, at the time when it is made, every lot within the tract so divided has frontage on (a) a public way, or (b) a way shown on a plan therefor approved in accordance with the Subdivision Control Law, or (c) a way in existence when the Subdivision Control Law became effective in the city or town in which the land lies, having, in the opinion of the Board of Survey, sufficient width, suitable grades and adequate construction to provide for the needs of vehicular traffic in relation to the proposed use of the land abutting thereon or served thereby, and for the installation of municipal services to serve such land and the buildings erected or to be erected thereon. Such frontage shall be at least such distance as is then required by zoning or other ordinance or by-law, if any, of the City of New Bedford for erection of building on such lot. Conveyances or other instruments adding to, taking away from, or changing the size and shape of lots in such a manner as not to leave any lot so affected without the frontage above set forth, or the division of a tract of land on which two (2) or more buildings were standing when the Subdivision Control Law went into effect in the City into separate lots on each of which, one of such buildings remains standing, shall not constitute a subdivision. 
(2)  "Board" shall mean the Board of Survey of the City of New Bedford. 
(3)  "Developer" shall mean any individual, group of individual, or partnership or corporation, public or private, seeking to build upon, subdivide, or alter land or buildings in any fashion in the City of New Bedford. 
(4)  "Lot" shall mean the area of and defined by fixed metes, bounds, or boundary lines, and used or set aside and available for use as the site of one or more buildings or for any other definite purpose. 
(5)  "Arterial Street" shall mean a major street in the City's street system that serves as an avenue of the circulation of traffic into, out, or around the City and carries high volumes of traffic. The width of the right-of-way and other layout features of arterial streets shall be determined on a case by case basis by the City or by the City in cooperation with other government agencies. 
(6)  "Collector Street" shall mean a street whose principal function is to carry traffic between minor, local and arterial streets but that may also provide direct access to abutting properties. The width of the right-of-way and other layout features shall be determined by the City on an individual case basis. 
(7)  "Local Street" shall mean a street whose sole function is to provide access to abutting properties, and is designed in accordance with the City's approved fifty-foot specifications. 
(8)  "Dead End Street" shall mean a street subject to local street specifications that terminates in a vehicular turnaround. The minimum radius of said turnaround shall not be less than fifty (50) feet. Said street shall not be more than four hundred (400) feet in length, and the length of the dead end street shall be measured from a point at the rear of the turnaround to the start of the center line of the dead end street. Further, in the center of the turnaround there shall be a circular island of a diameter width of fifteen (15) feet. Said island will be edged with granite curbing and shall be planted with one tree measuring three (3) inches in diameter at a point six (6) inches from ground level or shrubs subject to the approval of the Planning Department. Hammerhead and T-type dead end streets may be permitted on approval of the Board of Survey, and subject to department regulations for such layouts. 
(B)  Subdivision Plan Approval Required. No person shall make a subdivision of any land within the City of New Bedford unless such person has first submitted to the Board of Survey for its approval a plan of such proposed subdivision showing the lots into which such land is to be divided and the ways already existing or which are to be provided by him for furnishing access to such lots, and the Board of Survey has approved such plan in the manner hereinafter provided. After the approval of a plan the location and width of ways shown thereon shall not be changed unless the plan is amended accordingly, as provided in M.G.L.A. c. 41. § 81W, but the number, shape and size of the lots shown on a plan so approved may be changed without action by the Board, provided every lot so changed still has frontage on a public way or way shown on a plan approved in accordance with the Subdivision Control Law of at least such distance, if any, as is then required by ordinance or by-law of the City of New Bedford for erection of a building on such lot. 
(C)  Plan Not Requiring Approval. Any person who wishes to cause to be recorded in the Registry of Deeds or to be filed with the Land Court a plan of land and who believes that such person's plan does not require approval under the Subdivision Control Law, may submit such person's plan and application to the Board of Survey accompanied by necessary evidence to show that the plan does not require approval. Said person shall file such person's plan by delivery or registered mail to the Board of Survey, care of the City Clerk. If so mailed, the date of mailing shall be the date of submission of the plan. The Board of Survey hereby designates the city Planner as its agent to determine whether or not a plan requires approval. The City Clerk shall forward to the City Planner all subdivision plans received for such determination. If the City Planner determines that the plan does not require approval, such Planner shall, without a public hearing and within twenty-one (21) days of submission, endorse on the plan, or cause to be endorsed thereon by a person authorized by the Planner, the words "Board of Survey approval under Subdivision Control Law not required." Said plan shall be returned to the applicant and the City Planner shall notify the City Clerk of such Planner's action. Said endorsement shall not be withheld unless the plan shows a subdivision. If the City Planner determines that the plan does require approval under the Subdivision Control Law, such planner shall within twenty-one (21) days of the submission of said plan to inform the applicant and return the plan. The Planner shall also notify the City Clerk of such planner's determination. The applicant may then submit applicant's plan for approval as a subdivision, or may appeal as provided (M.G.L.A. c. 41 § 81BB). The City Planner shall then make such endorsement on said plan, and on the Planner's failure to do so forthwith, the City Clerk shall issue a certificate to the same effect. In case of failure by the City Planner to act as stated above, it shall be deemed that approval under the Subdivision Control Law is not required. 
(D)  Board of Appeals. As provided by statute, an appeal to the Board of Appeals or to the Superior Court may be taken by parties at interest from any decision by the Board of Survey. 
Article III. Procedure. 
For each subdivision proposed, there shall be prepared and submitted to the Board of Survey both a preliminary plan for study and modification and a final plan. 
(A)  Submission of Preliminary Plan. It is required that any person, before submitting his definitive plan for approval, submit to the Board of Survey, to the Board of Health, the Department of Public Works, the Water Board, the City Planning Department, the Conservation Commission, the Wire Department and the Building Department a preliminary plan and shall give written notice to the City Clerk by delivery or by registered mail, postage prepaid, that such person has submitted such plan. If the notice is given by delivery, the City Clerk shall, if requested, give a written receipt therefor. Before approval, modification or disapproval is given by the Board of Survey to a preliminary plan, a public hearing shall be held by said Board, notice of the time and place of which and of the subject matter, sufficient for identification, shall be given by mailing notice thereof to all owners of land abutting upon the land included in such plan as they appear upon the most recent tax list. 
Within forty-five (45) days after submission of a preliminary plan, each board or department shall approve such a preliminary plan with or without modifications suggested by it or agreed upon by the person submitting the plan or shall disapprove such preliminary plan, and in the case of disapproval, shall state its reason therefor. The Board of Survey shall notify the City Clerk of its approval or disapproval as the case may be. 
The Board shall not act on any preliminary plan within thirty (30) days after submission unless it has received the recommendations of said departments and a clearance from the Conservation Commission. Within forty-five (45) days after submission, the Board shall approve a preliminary plan with or without modifications, suggested by it, or agreed upon by the person submitting the plan, or shall disapprove such preliminary plan, and in the case of disapproval, shall state its reasons therefor. The Board of Survey shall notify the City Clerk of its approval or disapproval, as the case may be. 
Approval of the preliminary plan shall indicate that the proposed plan for subdivision, if consistently followed throughout, will be adequate and sufficient to obtain final approval, provided that all requirements of Article VI, Section C, Final Plan, Contents, of these regulations are met. 
(B)  Submission of a Definitive Plan. 
1)  Notice to Clerk. Every person submitting a definitive plan of land to the Board of Survey for its approval shall give written notice to the City Clerk by delivery or by registered mail, postage prepaid, that such person has submitted such a plan. Such notice shall describe the land to which the plan relates, sufficient detail for identification and shall state the date when such plan was submitted and the name and address of the owner of such land. No plan shall be deemed properly filed under this section without having met all requirements listed in Article VI of these regulations. 
2)  Fee. Fees for submission of preliminary and/or definitive plans and for plans not requiring approval under the Subdivision Control Law shall be set from time to time by order of the Board of Survey. Costs of the hearing shall be borne by the applicant. 
3)  Public hearing. Before approval, modification and approval or disapproval of the definitive plan is given, a public hearing shall be held by the Board of Survey, notice of the time and place of which and of the subject matter sufficient for identification, shall be given by the Board of Survey at the expense of the applicant by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the City once in each of two (2) successive weeks, the first publication being not less than fourteen (14) days before the day of such hearing; and by mailing copy of such advertisement to all owners of land abutting upon the land included in such plan as appearing upon the most recent tax list. 
4)  Distribution. The City Clerk shall distribute copies of the definitive plan to the Board of Health, City Planning Department, Building Department, Department of Public Works, Water Board, Wire Department, and the Conservation Commission.

Failure of the Board to act or to file a certificate of its action with the City Clerk within ninety (90) days after submission of a definitive plan, or such further time as may be agreed upon at the written request of the applicant shall be deemed to be an approval thereof. Notice of such extension of time shall be filed forthwith by the Board with the City Clerk. 
Article IV. Performance Guarantees. 
(A)  Methods. Before approval of a plan, the Board of Survey shall require provision for the construction of ways and the installation of municipal services in accordance with the detailed requirements of the agencies listed under Article IV, Section B, of these regulations, such construction and installation to be secured by one or in part by one and in part by the other of the following methods, which methods may be selected and from time to time varied by the applicant. 
(1)  Bond or Securities. By a proper bond or a deposit of money or letter of credit or negotiable securities, sufficient in the opinion of the Board to secure performance of the construction of ways and the installation of municipal services required for lots in the subdivision shown on the plan. Any such bond may be enforced and any such deposit may be applied by the Board for the benefit of the City of New Bedford upon failure of the performance for which such bond or deposit was given to the extent of the reasonable cost to the City of completing such construction or installation. Penal sum may be reduced upon partial approval of the plan. 
Any original security instrument selected by the applicant shall be valid for one year, if work is not satisfactorily completed on the construction of ways and the installation of principal services within this time period the Board of Survey may upon written request permit the applicant to extend the original security agreements in order to complete the necessary ways and municipal services. No extension shall exceed a six-month period; and the Board of Survey, at its discretion, may grant additional extensions. 
(2)  Covenant (Conditional Approval). By a covenant, whereby such ways and services shall be provided to serve any lot before such lot may be built upon or conveyed, other than mortgage deed or other methods of conveyance as provided in M.G.L.A. c. 41 § 81U. If conditional approval is requested by the applicant, the applicant shall execute and deliver to the Board before final approval a conditional approval contract in a form approved by the Board to perform the required work. Such contract shall be recorded at the Bristol County Registry of Deeds, and shall be binding upon the land within the subdivision. Upon completion, to the satisfaction of the Board, of the work on the ground necessary to adequately serve all lots within the subdivision, or if so requested by the subdivider, any particular lot or group of lots, the Board will issue and deliver to the subdivider a certificate of such performance, and thereafter the conditions applicable to the lots described shall terminate. 
(3)  By delivery to the Board of Survey of an agreement executed after the recording of a first mortgage covering the premises shown on the plan or a portion thereof given as security for advances to be made to the applicant by the lender, which agreement shall be executed by the applicant and the lender and shall provide for the retention by the lender of funds sufficient in the opinion of the Board of Survey and otherwise due the applicant, to secure the construction of ways and the installation of municipal services. Said agreement shall also provide for a schedule of disbursements which may be made to the applicant upon completion of various stages of the work, and shall further provide that in the event the work is not completed within the time set forth by the applicant, any funds remaining un-disbursed shall be available for completion. 
(B)  Release of Performance Guarantee. After or during subdivision construction, and before the Board of Survey votes to release the subdivider, the surety or the guarantor from all or part of the required guarantee, the Board of Survey shall determine that the subdivision requirements have been fulfilled. Such determination shall be written certifications which the subdivider shall assemble as follows: 
(1)  By the Department of Public Works, stating that the streets and storm drainage have been constructed and completed in conformance with the final plan diagram and all applicable requirements; that the City has taken clear and unencumbered title to the required public utility easement as defined in Article V. Item 22; and that as-built plans, on reproductable material, stamped by a professional engineer and professional land surveyor, have been received by the Engineering Department. Said plans shall be at a scale of one inch to forty feet and separate sheets shall be provided for each public utility installed. Further, the plans shall be accompanied with sufficient legal documentation to allow for the recording of an accepted street. 
(2)  By the Water Board, stating that the water mains and hydrants have been installed and are in place in conformance with the final plan diagram and all applicable requirements.

(C)  Enforcement. 
(1)  By prohibition of public improvements. No public way shall be laid out, accepted or constructed, and no municipal service or improvement shall be constructed in a way within a subdivision, to serve the land therein, unless such way appears on a plan of such subdivision approved under the Subdivision Control Law, except by or in accordance with the affirmative vote of two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of those present and voting at a meeting of the City Council. 
(2)  By denial of building permits. The Building Commissioner shall not issue permits for the erection of a building until first satisfied: 
a)  That the lot on which the building is to be erected is not within a subdivision, or that a way furnishing the access to such lot as required by the Subdivision Control Law is shown on a plan recorded or entitled to be recorded under M.G.L.A. c. 41 § 81X; and 
b)  That any condition endorsed thereon limiting the right to erect or maintain buildings on such lots have been satisfied, or waived by the Board; and 
c)  That consent has been obtained from the Board if the plan provides for more than one building for dwelling purposes to be erected, placed or converted to use as such on any lot; and 
d)  That for construction on lots for which a common sewer is not available, a "disposal works construction permit" has been obtained from the Board of Health. 
If enforcement of the provisions aforementioned would entail practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, and if the circumstances of the case do not require that the building be related to a way shown on such plan, the Board of Appeals shall have power, by vote of a majority of its members, to issue a permit for the erection of such building, subject to the provisions of M.G.L.A c. 41 §§ 81, 81AA and 81BB.

CITY OF NEW BEDFORD
SUBDIVISION CONTROL REGULATIONS
PURPOSE
The Subdivision Control Law has been accepted by the City of New Bedford for the purpose of
protecting the safety, convenience and welfare of the inhabitants of the City by regulating the
laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions providing access to the several lots therein,
but which have not become public ways, and ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions and in
proper cases, parks and open areas. The powers of the Board of Survey and Board of Appeals
under the Subdivision Control Law will be exercised with due regard for the provision of adequate
access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be safe and convenient for travel; for
lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent public ways; for reducing danger to life and
limb in the operation of motor vehicles; for securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic and
other emergencies; for ensuring compliance with applicable zoning and airport approach
regulations; for securing adequate provision for water, sewerage, drainage and other
requirements where necessary in a subdivision; and for coordinating the ways in a subdivision
with each other and with the public ways in te City and with the ways in neighboring subdivisions.
Article I. Authority
These regulations are promulgated by the City of New Bedford Board of Survey under the
Massachusetts Subdivision Control Law (Ch. 41, G.L., as amended). Under \ Section 22-30 of the
New Bedford City Code, the Mayor and City Council act as Board of Survey.
Article II. Application of Regulations.
(A) Definitions.
(1) Subdivision shall mean the division of a tract of land into two (2) or more lots and
shall include re-subdivision, and when appropriate to the context, shall relate to the
process of subdivision of the land or territory subdivided; provided, however, that
the division of a tract of land into two (2) or more lots shall not be deemed to
constitute a subdivision within the meaning of the Subdivision Control Law if, at the
time when it is made, every lot within the tract so divided has frontage on (a) a
public way, or (b) a way shown on a plan therefore approved in accordance with
the Subdivision Control Law, or (c) a way in existence when the Subdivision Control
Law became effective in the city or town in which the land lies, having, in the
opinion of the Board of Survey, sufficient width, suitable grades and adequate
construction to provide for the needs of vehicular traffic in relation to the proposed
use of the land abutting thereon or served thereby, and for the installation of
municipal services to serve such land and the buildings erected or to be erected
thereon. Such frontage shall be at least such distance as is then required by zoning
or other ordinance or by-law, if any, of the City of New Bedford for erection of
building on such lot. Conveyances or other instruments adding to, taking away
from , or changing the size and shape of lots in such a manner as not to leave any
lot so affected without the frontage above set forth, or the division of a tract of land
on which two (2) or more buildings were standing when the Subdivision Control
Law went into effect in the City into separate lots on each of which, one of such
buildings remains standing, shall not constitute a subdivision.
(2) Board shall mean the Board of Survey of the City of New Bedford.
(3) Developer shall mean any individual, group of individual, or partnership or
corporation, public or private, seeking to build upon, subdivide, or alter land or

516
NEW BEDFORD CODE
(4) Lot shall mean the area of and defined by fixed metes, bounds, or boundary
lines, and used or set aside and available for use as the site of one or more
buildings or for any other definite purpose.
(5) Arterial Street shall mean a major street in the Citys street system that serves as
an avenue of the circulation of traffic into, out, or around the City and carries high
volumes of traffic. The width of the right-of-way and other layout features of
arterial streets shall be determined on a case by case basis by the City or by the
City in cooperation with other government agencies.
(6) Collector Street shall mean a street whose principal function is to carry traffic
between minor, local and arterial streets but that may also provide direct access to
abutting properties. The width of the right-of-way and other layout features shall
be determined by the City on an individual case basis.
(7) Local Street shall mean a street whose sole function is to provide access to
abutting properties, and is designed in accordance with the Citys approved fifty
(50) foot specifications.
(8) Dead End Street shall mean a street subject to local street specifications that
terminates in a vehicular turnaround. The minimum radius of said turnaround shall
not be less than 50 feet. Said street shall not be more than four hundred (400)
feet in length, and the length of the dead end street shall be measured from a point
at the rear of the turnaround to the start of the center line of the dead end street.
Further, in the center of the turnaround there shall be a circular island of a
diameter width of fifteen (15) feet. Said island will be edged with granite curbing
and shall be planted with one tree measuring three (3) inches in diameter at a
point six inches from ground level or shrubs subject to the approval of the Planning
Department. Hammerhead and T-type dead end streets may be permitted on
approval of the Board of Survey, and subject to department regulations for such
layouts.
(B) Subdivision Plan Approval Required. No person shall make a subdivision of any land within
the City of New Bedford unless such person has first submitted to the Board of Survey for
its approval a plan of such proposed subdivision showing the lots into which such land is to
be divided and the ways already existing or which are to be provided by him for furnishing
access to such lots, and the Board of Survey has approved such plan in the manner
hereinafter provided. After the approval of a plan the location and width of ways shown
thereon shall not be changed unless the plan is amended accordingly, as provided in
Section 81W (Ch. 41. G. L.), but the number, shape and size of the lots shown on a plan
so approved may be changed without action by the Board, provided every lot so changed
still has frontage on a public way or way shown on a plan approved in accordance with the
Subdivision Control Law of at least such distance, if any, as is then required by ordinance
or by-law of the City of New Bedford for erection of a building on such lot.
(C) Plan Not Requiring Approval. Any person who wishes to cause to be recorded in the
Registry of Deeds or to be filed with the Land Court a plan of land and who believes that
such persons plan does not require approval under the Subdivision Control Law, may
submit such persons plan and application to the Board of Survey accompanied by
necessary evidence to show that the plan does not require approval. Said person shall file
such persons plan by delivery or registered mail to the Board of Survey, care of the City
Clerk. If so mailed, the date of mailing shall be the date of submission of the plan. The
Board of Survey hereby designates the city Planner as its agent to determine whether or
not a plan requires approval. The City Clerk shall forward to the City Planner all
subdivision plans received for such determination. If the City Planner determines that the
plan does not require approval, such Planner shall, without a public hearing and within
twenty-one (21) days of submission, endorse on the plan, or cause to be endorsed thereon
by a person authorized by the Planner, the words Board of Survey approval under
517
NEW BEDFORD CODE
Subdivision Control Law not required. Said plan shall be returned to the applicant and
the City Planner shall notify the City Clerk of the such Planners action. Said endorsement
shall not be withheld unless the plan shows a subdivision. If the City Planner determines
that the plan does require approval under the Subdivision Control Law, such planner shall
within twenty-one (21) days of the submission of said plan to inform the applicant and
return the plan. The Planner shall also notify the City Clerk of such planners
determination. The applicant may then submit applicants plan for approval as a
subdivision, or may appeal as provided (Ch. 41, Section 81BB, G. L.). The City Planner
shall then make such endorsement on said plan, and on the Planners failure to do so
forthwith, the City Clerk shall issue a certificate to the same effect. In case of failure by
the City Planner to act as stated above, it shall be deemed that approval under the
Subdivision Control Law is not required.
(D) Board of Appeals. As provided by statute, an appeal to the Board of Appeals or to the
Superior Court may be taken by parties at interest from any decision by the Board of
Survey.
Article III. Procedure.
For each subdivision proposed, there shall be prepared and submitted to the Board of Survey both
a preliminary plan for study and modification and a final plan.
(A) Submission of Preliminary Plan. It is required that any person, before submitting his
definitive plan for approval, submit to the Board of Survey, to the Board of Health, the
Department of Public Works, the Water Board, the City Planning Department, the
Conservation Commission, the Wire Department and the Building Department a
preliminary plan and shall give written notice to the City Clerk by delivery or by registered
mail, postage prepaid, that such person has submitted such plan. If the notice is given by
delivery , the City Clerk shall, if requested, give a written receipt therefore. Before
approval, modification or disapproval is given by the Board of Survey to a preliminary
plan, a public hearing shall be held by said Board, notice of the time and place of which
and of the subject matter, sufficient for identification, shall be given by mailing notice
thereof to all owners of land abutting upon the land included in such plan as they appear
upon the most recent tax list.
Within forty-five (45) days after submission of a preliminary plan, each board or
department shall approve such a preliminary plan with or without modifications suggested
by it or agreed upon by the person submitting the plan or shall disapprove such
preliminary plan, and in the case of disapproval, shall state its reason therefore. The
Board of Survey shall notify the City Clerk of its approval or disapproval as the case may
be.
The Board shall not act on any preliminary plan within thirty (30) days after submission
unless it has received the recommendations of said departments and a clearance from the
Conservation Commission. Within forty-five (45) days after submission, the Board shall
approve a preliminary plan with or without modifications, suggested by it, or agreed upon
by the person submitting the plan, or shall disapprove such preliminary plan, and in the
case of disapproval, shall state its reasons therefore. The Board of Survey shall notify the
City Clerk of its approval or disapproval, as the case may be.
Approval of the preliminary plan shall indicate that the proposed plan for subdivision, if
consistently followed throughout, will be adequate and sufficient to obtain final approval,
provided that all requirements of Article VI, Section C, Final Plan, Contents, of these
regulations are met.
(B) Submission of a Definitive Plan.
518
NEW BEDFORD CODE
1) Notice to Clerk. Every person submitting a definitive plan of land to the Board of
Survey for its approval shall give written notice to the City Clerk by delivery or by
registered mail, postage prepaid, that such person has submitted such a plan. Such
notice shall describe the land to which the plan relates, sufficient detail for
identification and shall state the date when such plan was submitted and the name and
address of the owner of such land. No plan shall be deemed properly filed under this
section without having met all requirements listed in Article VI of these regulations.
2) Fee. Fees for submission of preliminary and/or definitive plans and for plans not
requiring approval under the Subdivision Control Law shall be set from time to time by
order of the Board of Survey. Costs of the hearing shall be borne by the applicant.
3) Public hearing. Before approval, modification and approval or disapproval of the
definitive plan is given, a public hearing shall be held by the Board of Survey, notice of
the time and place of which and of the subject matter sufficient for identification, shall
be given by the Board of Survey at the expense of the applicant by advertisement in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City once in each of two (2) successive weeks,
the first publication being not less than fourteen (14) days before the day of such
hearing; and by mailing copy of such advertisement to all owners of land abutting upon
the land included in such plan as appearing upon the most recent tax list.
4) Distribution. The City Clerk shall distribute copies of the definitive plan to the Board of
Health, City Planning Department, Building Department, Department of Public Works,
Water Board, Wire Department, and the Conservation Commission. When a definitive
plan of a subdivision is submitted to the Board of Survey, a copy thereof shall also be
filed with the Board of Health, the Department of Public Works, Water Board, the City
Planning Department, Conservation Commission, Wire Department and Building
Department, which agencies shall within forty-five (45) days after the plan is so filed,
report to the Board of Survey in writing, approval or disapproval of said plan, and in
the event of disapproval, shall make specific findings as to which, if any, of the lots
shown on such plan cannot be used for building sites without injury to the public
health, and include such specific findings and the reasons therefore in such report, and
where possible, shall make recommendations for the adjustment thereof. Failure to so
report shall be deemed approval by said departments. At the time of filing of the final
plan, the Board of Health, the Department of Public Works, and the Water Board shall
prepare estimates of the cost of the improvements subject to their approval which
estimates shall be given to the subdivider to provide the basis for setting up the
required performance guarantees, or in the case of the Water Board, the assessable
extension agreement.
5) Approval. After the hearing and after the report of said departments or the lapse of
forty-five (45) days without such report, the Board of Survey shall approve, or, if such
plan does not comply with the Subdivision Control Law or the rules and regulations of
the Board or the recommendations of the Board of Health, shall modify and approve or
shall disapprove such plan. In the event of approval of the definitive plan as
submitted or approved with modifications, it shall be construed that all Board of Survey
streets shown within the boundary of the submitted definitive plan shall be
discontinued. In the event of disapproval, the Board shall state in detail wherein the
plan does not conform to the rules and regulations of the Board or to the
recommendations of said departments and shall revoke its disapproval and approve a
plan which as amended, conforms to such rules and regulations or recommendations.
6) Notice to Applicant. The Board of Survey shall file a certificate of its action with the
City Clerk, a copy of which shall be recorded by the City Clerk in a book kept for the
purpose, and shall send notice of such action by registered mail, postage prepaid, to
the applicant at applicants address stated on the application. Failure of the Board to
act or to file a certificate of its action with the City Clerk within ninety (90) days after
submission of a definitive plan, or such further time as may be agreed upon at the
519
NEW BEDFORD CODE
written request of the applicant shall be deemed to be an approval thereof. Notice of
such extension of time shall be filed forthwith by the Board with the City Clerk.
Article IV. Performance Guarantees.
(A) Methods. Before approval of a plan, the Board of Survey shall require provision for the
construction of ways and the installation of municipal services in accordance with the
detailed requirements of the agencies listed under Article IV, Section B, of these
regulations, such construction and installation to be secured by one or in part by one and
in part by the other of the following methods, which methods may be selected and from
time to time varied by the applicant.
(1) Bond or Securities. By a proper bond or a deposit of money or letter of credit or
negotiable securities, sufficient in the opinion of the Board to secure performance of
the construction of ways and the installation of municipal services required for lots in
the subdivision shown on the plan. Any such bond may be enforced and any such
deposit may be applied by the Board for the benefit of the City of New Bedford upon
failure of the performance for which such bond or deposit was given to the extent of
the reasonable cost to the City of completing such construction or installation. Penal
sum may be reduced upon partial approval of the plan.
Any original security instrument selected by the applicant shall be valid for one year, if
work is not satisfactorily completed on the construction of ways and the installation of
principal services within this time period the Board of Survey may upon written
request permit the applicant to extend the original security agreements in order to
complete the necessary ways and municipal services. No extension shall exceed a six
month period; and the Board of Survey, at its discretion, may grant additional
extensions.
(2) Covenant (Conditional Approval). By a covenant, whereby such ways and services
shall be provided to serve any lot before such lot may be built upon or conveyed,
other than mortgage deed or other methods of conveyance as provided in Section
81U, Ch. 41 of the Massachusetts General Laws. If conditional approval is requested
by the applicant, the applicant shall execute and deliver to the Board before final
approval a conditional approval contract in a form approved by the Board to perform
the required work. Such contract shall be recorded at the Bristol County Registry of
Deeds, and shall be binding upon the land within the subdivision. Upon completion, to
the satisfaction of the Board, of the work on the ground necessary to adequately serve
all lots within the subdivision, or if so requested by the subdivider, any particular lot or
group of lots, the Board will issue and deliver to the subdivider a certificate of such
performance, and thereafter the conditions applicable to the lots described shall
terminate.
(3) By delivery to the Board of Survey of an agreement executed after the recording of a
first mortgage covering the premises shown on the plan or a portion thereof given as
security for advances to be made to the applicant by the lender, which agreement
shall be executed by the applicant and the lender and shall provide for the retention
by the lender of funds sufficient in the opinion of the Board of Survey and otherwise
due the applicant, to secure the construction of ways and the installation of municipal
services. Said agreement shall also provide for a schedule of disbursements which
may be made to the applicant upon completion of various stages of the work, and
shall further provide that in the event the work is not completed within the time set
forth by the applicant, any funds remaining un-disbursed shall be available for
completion.
(B) Release of Performance Guarantee. After or during subdivision construction, and before
the Board of Survey votes to release the subdivider, the surety or the guarantor from all
or part of the required guarantee, the Board of Survey shall determine that the subdivision 520
NEW BEDFORD CODE
requirements have been fulfilled. Such determination shall be written certifications which
the subdivider shall assemble as follows:
(1) By the Department of Public Works, stating that the streets and storm drainage have
been constructed and completed in conformance with the final plan diagram and all
applicable requirements; that the City has taken clear and unencumbered title to the
required public utility easement as defined in Article V. Item 22; and that as-built
plans, on reproductable material, stamped by a professional engineer and professional
land surveyor, have been received by the Engineering Department. Said plans shall
be at a scale of one inch to forty feet and separate sheets shall be provided for each
public utility installed. Further, the plans shall be accompanied with sufficient legal
documentation to allow for the recording of an accepted street.
(2) By the Water Board, stating that the water mains and hydrants have been installed
and are in place in conformance with the final plan diagram and all applicable
requirements.
(3) By the Board of Health and Department of Public Works, stating that the sewerage or
means of waste disposal have been constructed and are in place in conformance with
the final plan diagram and all applicable requirements.
(4) By the City Planning Department stating that the final plan is in conformance with the
Master Plan.
(5) By a registered civil engineer or registered land surveyor, acceptable to the Board of
Survey and the subdivider, and paid for by the subdivider, that all permanent granite
bounds or monuments on street lines and lot lines (if necessary) have been installed
and are accurately in place in the locations designated on the final plan.
(C) Enforcement.
(1) By prohibition of public improvements. No public way shall be laid out, accepted or
constructed, and no municipal service or improvement shall be constructed in a way
within a subdivision, to serve the land therein, unless such way appears on a plan of
such subdivision approved under the Subdivision Control Law, except by or in
accordance with the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of those present and voting at
a meeting of the City Council.
(2) By denial of building permits. The Building Commissioner shall not issue permits for
the erection of a building until first satisfied:
a) That the lot on which the building is to be erected is not within a subdivision, or
that a way furnishing the access to such lot as required by the Subdivision Control
Law is shown on a plan recorded or entitled to be recorded under section 81X (Ch.
41, G. L.); and
b) That any condition endorsed thereon limiting the right to erect or maintain
buildings on such lots have been satisfied, or waived by the Board; and
c) That consent has been obtained from the Board if the plan provides for more than
one building for dwelling purposes to be erected, placed or converted to use as
such on any lot; and
d) That for construction on lots for which a common sewer is not available, a
disposal works construction permit has been obtained from the Board of Health.
If enforcement of the provisions aforementioned would entail practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship, and if the circumstances of the case do not require that the building 521
NEW BEDFORD CODE
be related to a way shown on such plan, the Board of Appeals shall have power, by vote of
a majority of its members, to issue a permit for the erection of such building, subject to the
provisions of Section 81 and Sections 81AA and 81BB (Ch41, G. L.).
Article V General Requirements for the Subdivision of Land.
The subdivider shall observe the following general requirements and principles of land
subdivisions:
(1) Zoning Ordinance, Master Plan conformance. In general the proposed subdivision shall
conform to the Zoning Ordinance and the Master Plan.
(2) Street arrangement. The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the

of such existing connection streets.
(3) Width of streets. In general, primary and secondary arterials or highways shall not be
less than the width shown on the Master Plan. Parkways and boulevards shall be such
width as may be designated by the Board. As a general rule, the width of minor streets

length shall be linked to existing public streets or private streets built to City standards at
two locations; the distance between the two locations shall not be less than three hundred
feet or as otherwise approved by the Board of Survey.
(5) Block length. Block lengths generally shall not exceed one thousand two hundred (1,200)
feet in length.
(6) Block divisions. Each normal block shall be planned to provide two (2) rows of lots, but
irregularly shaped blocks indented by dead-end streets or containing interior parks will be
acceptable when properly designed and covered by agreements as to maintenance of
interior parks.
(7) Curb radii. Curb radii at intersection shall not be less than twenty-eight (28) feet and
property lines shall be adjusted accordingly.
(8) Side lot lines. Side lines of lots, so far as practicable, shall be at right angles or radial to
street lines.
(9) Vision clearance at intersections. Care shall be exercised in the layout of corner lots
allowing sufficient area to permit location of buildings without interfering with vision at
intersections.
(10) Corner lot size. Corner lots shall be increased in size whenever necessary so as to
provide that any structure to be placed thereon shall conform to the building line of each
street.
(11) Street grades. Grades of all streets shall conform in general to the terrain and shall be
the reasonable minimum, but shall not be less than five-tenths (0.5) percent nor more
than five (5) percent for main thoroughfares nor more than ten (10) percent for minor
streets.
522
NEW BEDFORD CODE
(12) Service streets, loading areas. Paved rear service streets of not less than twenty (20)
feet in width, or in lieu thereof, adequate off-street loading space, suitably surfaced shall
be provided in connection with all lots designed for commercial use.
(13) Commercial street width. In front of areas designed and zoned or where a petition for a
change in zoning is contemplated for commercial use, to permit such use, the street width
shall be increased by such amount on each side as may be deemed necessary by the
Board to assure the free flow of through traffic without interference by parked or parking
vehicles and to provide adequate and safe parking space for such commercial or business
district.
(14) Flooding. Land subject to flooding and land deemed by the Board to be uninhabitable
shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other uses as may increase
danger to health, life or property or aggravate the flood hazard, but such uses as shall not
be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation.
(15) Future streets. In case a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building
lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow the opening of future streets and logical
further re-subdivision.
(16) Reserve strips. In general, no reserve strips controlling access to abutting property or to
land dedicated or to be dedicated to public use shall be permitted.
