PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Gladstone, Missouri. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1974 Code, as supplemented through December 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1974 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The titles of the Code have been arranged in the manner specified by the city, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of James S. Vaught, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Marilyn Ahnefeld, retired City Clerk, and David A. Ramsay, City Counselor, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    The provisions of every section, paragraph, sentence, clause and phrase of this Code and every ordinance enacted by the city council shall be severable. If any such provision is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, the remaining provisions are valid unless the court finds the valid provisions are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so dependent upon, the invalid provision that it cannot be presumed the council would have enacted the valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds that the valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed in accordance with the council's intent.

Sec. 1.130.241. - Purpose. 
    This division is adopted for the purpose of providing a framework within which sworn law enforcement personnel employed by the City of Gladstone can exercise their right under Article 1, Section 29 of the Constitution of the State of Missouri to bargain collectively with the city, through representatives of their own choosing. 
(Ord. No. 4.333, § 1(1.130.300), 1-11-2016) 
Sec. 1.130.242. - Coverage. 
(a)  This division shall apply to all sworn, full-time personnel employed in the law enforcement divisions of the department of public safety. 
(b)  It is the city's determination that sworn, non-supervisory employees employed within the law enforcement divisions of the department of public safety constitute the most appropriate unit for the purpose of collective bargaining. Any election conducted for the purpose of allowing employees to designate an exclusive bargaining representative, as provided below, shall take place within this unit subject to the following exclusions: 
(1)  To avoid the division of loyalties and conflicts of interest, supervisory personnel shall not be included within the same bargaining unit as employees they supervise. However, the same labor organization may represent both non-supervisory and supervisory employees in separate bargaining units. 
(2)  Command level employees shall not be part of any bargaining unit. 
(3)  Confidential employees shall not be included within the same bargaining unit as non-supervisory employees. For the purposes of this subsection, the departmental administrative assistant shall be considered a confidential employee. 
(4)  Police officers on introductory status are not regular employees and shall not be included within the bargaining unit until they successfully complete their introductory status period. 
(Ord. No. 4.333, § 1(1.130.310), 1-11-2016) 
Sec. 1.130.243. - Designation of exclusive bargaining representative. 
(a)  Any labor organization wishing to represent employees employed in the city's law enforcement divisions of the department of public safety, in either a supervisory or non-supervisory bargaining unit, shall present to the city manager or his/her designee cards containing the signatures of at least 50 percent of the employees in the unit, indicating that they wish to select the labor organization in question as their exclusive bargaining representative for the purpose of collective bargaining. 
(b)  Upon receiving such cards, the city manager or his/her designee shall validate the signatures on the cards, and confirm that at least 50 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit have signed cards. If the city manager or his/her designee determines that at least 50 percent of the employees in the unit have signed valid cards, the city manager or his/her designee shall consult with the director of public safety and the representative of the labor organization that has presented the cards, and together they shall select a mutually agreeable neutral third party who shall serve as election overseer for the purposes of conducting a secret ballot on a date mutually agreeable to the city, the labor organization, and the election overseer. The election shall be held at City Hall, and shall be set for a date falling no less than four and no more than six weeks after the day upon which the city manager or his/her designee first receives the cards from the labor organization's representative, unless the city manager or his/her designee, the director of public safety, and the representative of the labor organization all agree upon some other date. 
(c)  Once an election overseer has been selected, he or she shall issue a notice informing all eligible voters of the date, time, and place of the election. Such notice shall be distributed to all sworn employees and shall be posted within the department. 
(d)  From the time the election notice is first posted until the date of the election, all employees of the city shall have the right to freely express their opinions about whether or not the labor organization should be selected as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees in the bargaining unit. However, no employee of the city and no representative of the labor organization shall attempt to threaten, intimidate, coerce, or otherwise restrain any eligible voter in the free exercise of his or her individual choice to support or oppose the selection of the labor organization in question as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees in the bargaining unit. 
(e)  The election shall be conducted by secret ballot, using such procedures as the election overseer shall determine are appropriate for ensuring the privacy and security of each employee's vote. Once the poll is closed, the election overseer shall oversee the counting of the ballots. One representative of the city and one representative of the labor organization shall have the right to be present during the counting of the ballots. The election overseer may permit additional interested individuals to attend the vote count, at his or her discretion. 
(1)  The ballots shall read "Do you wish to select (labor organization) as the exclusive bargaining representative for (description of bargaining unit) employed within the City of Gladstone Law Enforcement Divisions of the Department of Public Safety?" The ballot will include check boxes for marking "yes" or "no" in response to this question. 
(2)  In the event that more than one labor organization seeks to represent employees in the unit, and in the event both labor organizations have obtained signatures from at least 50 percent of the employees in the unit stating that they wish to designate the labor organization as their exclusive bargaining representative, then the ballot shall read "Do you wish to select (labor organization A) (labor organization B), or no labor organization as the exclusive bargaining representative for (description of bargaining unit) employed within the City of Gladstone Law Enforcement Divisions of the Department of Public Safety?" The ballot will then include check boxes for marking "I wish to select (labor organization A) as my exclusive bargaining representative.", "I wish to select (labor organization B) as my exclusive bargaining representative.", and "I do not wish to select any labor organization as my exclusive bargaining representative." 
(3)  Any labor organization receiving more than 50 percent of the votes of all eligible voters shall be designated and recognized by the city as the exclusive bargaining representative for all employees in the bargaining unit. 
(f)  Employees within the bargaining unit shall have the right to seek to decertify the labor organization as their exclusive bargaining representative at any time. If any employee within the bargaining unit presents to the city manager or his/her designee cards bearing the signatures of at least 30 percent of the employees within the bargaining unit stating that those employees no longer wish to be represented by the labor organization in question, the city manager or his/her designee shall first validate the signatures on the cards. 
(1)  If the city manager or his/her designee confirms that at least 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit have signed decertification cards, the city manager or his/her designee shall consult with the director of public safety and the designated representative of the labor organization to select a mutually acceptable election overseer, who will conduct an election pursuant to the procedures set out above. Such election shall take place at least four weeks after the city manager or his/her designee receives the decertification cards and no later than six weeks after the city manager or his/her designee receives the decertification cards. Notice of such election shall be distributed to all employees within the bargaining unit and posted within the law enforcement divisions of the department of public safety. 
(2)  If more than 50 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit cast votes to terminate the labor organization's representation of the employees in the bargaining unit, the labor organization shall immediately cease to represent the employees in the bargaining unit. 
(3)  In the event of the decertification of the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees in any bargaining unit within the law enforcement divisions of the department of public safety, all terms and conditions of employment existing at the time of decertification shall remain in place until such time as those terms or conditions of employment are altered by the city council. 
(g)  No more than one election shall take place in any bargaining unit within the same 12-month period. Once an election takes place, the city manager or his/her designee shall not accept cards from labor organizations or employees within the bargaining unit seeking another election for one full calendar year after the date of the election. 
(Ord. No. 4.333, § 1(1.130.320), 1-11-2016) 
Sec. 1.130.244. - Collective bargaining process. 
(a)  Within four weeks after a labor organization is certified as the exclusive bargaining representative for the employees in a bargaining unit as set out above, representatives of the city, designated by the city manager, and representatives of the labor organization, selected by the labor organization, shall meet and begin bargaining for an agreement covering the wages, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment for the employees within the bargaining unit. 
(b)  Both sides shall bargain in good faith, and make an earnest effort to reach a mutually acceptable agreement, but neither side shall be required to offer any particular concession or withdraw any particular proposal. 
(c)  The city shall not pay any union representative for time spent participating in collective bargaining or preparing for collective bargaining, except to the extent the person in question is an employee of the city and elects to use accrued paid time off to cover the time so spent. 
(d)  If the parties reach an agreement, management shall present the agreement to the city council for approval or rejection. 
(e)  After the first agreement between the city and the labor organization is adopted, bargaining for renewal agreements shall take place annually. Such bargaining must be completed to allow sufficient time for submission and approval of a city budget by the city council. The parties may elect to bargain non-economic terms for longer periods (e.g. three years or five years), but all economic provisions of the agreement shall be adopted on a year-to-year basis only. 
(Ord. No. 4.333, § 1(1.130.330), 1-11-2016) 
Sec. 1.130.245. - Content of labor agreements. 
(a)  Labor agreements negotiated between the parties may cover wages, benefits, and all other terms and conditions of employment for employees within the bargaining unit, subject to the following limitations. 
(1)  No labor agreement shall provide any outside person or entity with authority to interpret the labor agreement, resolve grievances, award damages, or otherwise determine personnel matters within the city. 
(2)  No labor agreement shall require any employee of the city, who does not wish to become a member of the labor organization, to pay any dues or fee of any kind to the labor organization in question. It is understood that, in the event an employee elects not to join and pay regular dues to a labor organization that represents the employee, the labor organization will continue to represent the employee as a member of the bargaining unit, but the employee will not enjoy any of the rights or benefits that arise from membership in the labor organization itself. 
(3)  Every labor agreement shall include a provision reserving to management the right to hire, promote, assign, direct, transfer, schedule, discipline, and discharge employees, so long as those rights are not exercised in a way that conflicts with any express provision of the labor agreement. Every labor agreement shall also include a provision reserving to management the right to make, amend, and rescind reasonable work rules and standard operating procedures, so long as such work rules and standard operating procedures do not conflict with any express provision of the labor agreement. 
(4)  Every labor agreement shall expressly prohibit all strikes and picketing of any kind. Every labor agreement shall include a provision acknowledging that any employee who engages in any strike or concerted refusal to work, or who pickets over any personnel matter shall be subject to immediate termination of employment. 
(5)  Any labor agreement may include a provision stating that city employees who are representatives of a labor organization that has been designated as the exclusive bargaining representative of a unit of employees within the city that includes the employee in question, will be paid for on-duty time spent meeting with management to conduct union business, so long as such meeting does not prevent the employee from performing his or her regular duties. Every labor agreement must provide that, aside from such meetings between union representatives and members of management, city employees who serve as representatives of a labor organization must refrain from conducting the business of the labor organization while they are on duty. 
(Ord. No. 4.333, § 1(1.130.340), 1-11-2016) 
Sec. 1.130.246. - Effect of labor agreement. 
(a)  In the event of a budget shortfall, the city council shall have the right to require the modification of the economic terms of any labor agreement. 
(b)  Should the city council deem it necessary to modify the economic terms of any labor agreement, it shall so notify the relevant labor organization, and shall provide a period of 30 days during which the city and the labor organization shall bargain in good faith over any necessary adjustments to the economic terms of the agreement. 
(c)  If, at the end of the 30-day period, the parties have been unable to agree upon modifications that meet the city council's requirements, the city council shall have the right to make necessary adjustments on its own authority. 
(Ord. No. 4.333, § 1(1.130.350), 1-11-2016) 
Sec. 1.130.247. - Validity and enforcement. 
(a)  If the state passes any law governing collective bargaining for law enforcement personnel, then to the extent this division is inconsistent with the Missouri statute, this division shall be superseded in whole or in part by such statute. 
(b)  If any court of competent jurisdiction shall declare any provision of this division to be unenforceable under any state of federal statute, regulation, or other authority, that portion shall be stricken from the division, but all other portions of the division shall remain in effect.

(c)  In the event any charge for emergency medical services performed in unincorporated areas of the county remain unpaid for 90 days after the first day of the month following the month in which the service was performed, the accounts receivable therefor shall be assigned to the county and payment thereof shall be requested as provided in the agreement of July 19, 1974.

(d)  City's right of recovery. In the event that payment is made by the city as authorized in this article for outside ambulance services, the city shall have the right of subrogation to the person for whom such services were provided for any claim or cause of action which such person may have to recover the cost of such ambulance services.

Upon receipt of the complaint, the animal control officer shall hold a hearing, 30 days after notice is given, and shall hear evidence as to the disposition of the subject animal. If after the hearing the animal control officer determines that the animal is a dangerous animal, the animal control office shall: 
(1)  Issue an order declaring the animal to be dangerous and; 
(2)  Issue an order to appropriate city personnel requiring that the animal be captured and impounded if reasonable pending resolution of the matter in municipal court, or killed if capture is unreasonable, if such animal is found not kept as required by subsection (a) of this section, after the date of the order, except that, if the animal is found securely fastened to a leash in a manner in violation of the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, the animal shall be captured or impounded, but not killed; or 
(3)  If the animal control officer shall determine that the subject animal should be immediately destroyed, the animal control officer shall order the animal impounded and shall petition an appropriate court for an order directing the animal control officer to cause the animal to be destroyed; and 
(4)  Any animal declared dangerous shall be prevented from reproducing by spaying or neutering of the animal. The owner of such animal shall provide proof of such sterilization of the animal to the animal control officer within 30 days of the notification date of the need for this sterilization. 
(f)  Any animal owner aggrieved by an order of the animal control officer or the animal control officer's designee may request a conference with the director of public safety or his or her designee to discuss the appropriateness or terms or conditions of the order. This official shall have the authority, through the exercise of his or her reasonable discretion, to withdraw the order or to modify its terms and conditions, based on information presented by the animal control supervisor and the owner.

(h)  Upon second conviction under this chapter, or upon a first conviction where the court finds aggravating circumstances that threatened the wellbeing of a person, in addition to fines or jail sentence, the municipal judge shall order the destruction of the subject animal. If the owner of the subject animal shall refuse, the municipal judge shall hold the owner in contempt of court.

ARTICLE 4. - APARTMENTS 

Sec. 2.110.160. - Purpose or findings. 
    The city council hereby finds as follows: 
(1)  The repeated commission of criminal offenses and violations of the city's Municipal Code substantially annoys and injures the health, comfort, repose and safety of the public. 
(2)  The failure of owners of certain real property to control the activity occurring on their property causes repeated and substantial expenditures of public funds in order to enforce state, federal and city laws upon or near their property. Among the property management practices that contribute to the existence of activities which disturb neighborhoods are the failure of owners or managers of real property to require tenants to obey laws as a condition of leases, the failure to enforce existing provisions of leases, the failure of owners or managers to respond to or take affirmative steps to address complaints by adjoining owners and the overall tolerance by owners or managers of criminal activity on property by tenants or their guests, all of which substantially annoys and injures the health, comfort, repose and safety of the public. 
(3)  The decline in or possible depression of surrounding property values and the expenditures of public funds results in part from the fact that certain property owners or managers fail to adequately manage and control their property. 
(4)  The provisions of this article will assist the city in the long term to renew certain neighborhoods by lessening the expenditures of public funds, increasing property values, preserving the tranquility of neighborhoods, and deterring property owners and managers from adopting inadequate management practices.

Section 300.145. Automated Enforcement of Traffic Control Signals. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms mean: 
(1)  Automated traffic control signal enforcement system: A system that: 
a.  Consists of cameras and vehicle sensor or sensors installed to work in conjunction with an electrically operated traffic control signal; and 
b.  Is capable of producing not less than two high resolution color digital recorded images that show: 
1.  The traffic control signal while it is emitting a steady red signal; 
2.  The offending vehicle in a position on the roadway that constitutes a violation of a traffic control signal; and 
3.  The license plate of the offending vehicle. 
c.  To establish a violation of a traffic control signal, One of the images must be of sufficient resolution to clearly show all elements in either the first image captured immediately prior to the violation, or in the subsequent images captured sequentially after the first image, and while the vehicle is in the intersection while the traffic signal is emitting a steady red signal. The sequence of images must also clearly show the license plate of the vehicle sufficiently to identify the license number and state of issuance of the license. 
(2)  Operator: Any individual driving and/or in possession of a vehicle. 
(3)  Owner: The owner of a motor vehicle as shown as established by the motor vehicle registration records of the Missouri Department of Revenue or the analogous department of another state or country. The term "owner" includes: 
a.  A lessee of a motor vehicle under a lease of six months or more; or 
b.  The lessee of a motor vehicle rented or leased from a motor vehicle rental or leasing company, but does not include the motor vehicle rental or leasing company itself. 
(4)  Recorded image: Photographs, microphotographs, micrographs, videotape, computerized digital images, or other recorded images of motor vehicles entering an intersection in violation of red traffic signal indications or otherwise violating the city traffic code. 
(5)  System location: The approach to an intersection toward which an automated red light enforcement system is directed and in operation. 
(6)  Traffic control signal: A traffic control device that displays alternating red, yellow and green lights as intended to direct traffic when to stop at or proceed through an intersection. 
(b)  Any automated red light enforcement system, or any device which is part thereof, that is installed or deployed on a street or highway in the City of Gladstone shall meet any applicable requirements established by the State of Missouri. 
(c)  The installation of an automated red light enforcement system in the city by or under the supervision of the director of public works is hereby authorized. Devices which are part of the automated red light enforcement system may be installed at intersections or other locations identified by the public safety department as dangerous. Such installation is authorized where any contract for installation of, and operational and administrative tasks associated with the use of, one or more automated red light enforcement systems exist with the city. 
(d)  Probable cause. An officer employed by the police division of the Gladstone Public Safety Department shall examine each recorded image to determine if a violation of the city traffic code has occurred. If the recorded image, or sequence of images, shows a violation, contains a date and time of the alleged violation, shows the vehicle's license plate number, as well as the state in which the license was issued, and the traffic control signal while it is emitting a steady red signal, the officer may use any lawful means to identify the vehicle's owner. 
(e)  Upon the filing of information in the Gladstone Municipal Court, a summons shall be issued, with a court date, pursuant to the Missouri Supreme Court Rules governing traffic violations. Not later than 60 days after the date the violation is alleged to have occurred, the summons shall be served on the owner by mailing it, together with: 
(1)  A copy of the violation notice; and 
(2)  A copy of the recorded image(s) of the alleged violation, which forms the basis of the information; and 
(3)  A copy of the supplemental violation notice as described in subparagraph a. of this subsection, to the owner's last known address by first class mail. If, however, the vehicle is registered in more than one person's name, the summons shall be issued to the first named registrant as reflected in the motor vehicle registration records of the Missouri Department of Revenue. The supplemental violation notice shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: 
a.  A statement that the recorded image will be submitted as evidence in the municipal court proceeding for prosecution of the violation of the applicable section of the city traffic code; and 
b.  That a violation notice and summons mailed under this section is presumed to have been received by the owner on the fifth day after the date the violation notice is mailed. 
(f)  Violations detected with the use of the automated traffic control signal enforcement system will be prosecuted in the Gladstone Municipal Court under the same procedures, as other violations prosecuted in municipal court. 
(g)  The images from the automated traffic control signal enforcement system and the records obtained from the Missouri Department of Revenue, shall be admissible before the municipal court and shall establish a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of the motor vehicle is responsible for violation depicted in the images presented in court. 
(h)  An owner of a motor vehicle may avoid responsibility for the violation depicted in the images from the automated traffic control signal enforcement system by executing an affidavit, under oath, stating the name and current address of the person actually operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. An owner executing such an affidavit shall be subject to subpoena to testify before the municipal court against the person identified in the affidavit as the operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation. 
(i)  Every person convicted of a violation by failing to heed a traffic control signal as established by the automated traffic control signal enforcement system, shall be punished by a fine of up to $100.00. Such a conviction is not intended to result in assessment of points or other penalties against the person's driving record, and such convictions will not be reported to the Missouri Department of Revenue as assessable violations or convictions. 
(j)  Any automated traffic control signal enforcement system on a street or highway must be identified by appropriate advance warning signs conspicuously posted either at the major roadways entering the city or not more than 300 feet from the location of the automated traffic control system location. All advance warning signs must be approved by the director of public works. 
Section 300.155. Traffic control signal legend-Right turn on red light. 
    Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and said lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows: 
(1)  Green indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)  Steady yellow indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection. 
b.  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Steady red indication: 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except as provided in subsection (3)b of this section. 
b.  The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience to a red signal, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the state highways and transportation commission with reference to an intersection involving a state highway, and local authorities with reference to an intersection involving other highways under their jurisdiction, may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any intersection where safety conditions so require, said prohibition shall be effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(4)  In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or making the stop shall be made at the signal. 
State Law reference- Similar provisions, RSMo 300.155.

(1)  Right turns. Both the approach for a right turn and a right turn shall be made as close as practicable to the righthand curb or edge of the roadway, except where multiple turn lanes have been established. 
(2)  Left turns on two-way roadways. At any intersection where traffic is permitted to move in both directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the centerline thereof and by passing to the right of such centerline where it enters the intersection and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the centerline of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be made in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection. 
(3)  Left turns on other than two-road roadways. At any intersection where traffic is restricted to one direction on one or more of the roadways, the driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at any such intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme lefthand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such vehicle and, after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection, as nearly as practicable, in the lefthand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in such direction upon the roadway being entered, except where multiple turn lanes have been established. 
(4)  Designated two-way left turn lanes. Where a special lane for making left turns by drivers proceeding in opposite directions has been indicated by official traffic control devices: 
a.  A left turn shall not be made from any other lane. 
b.  A vehicle shall not be driven in the lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or when preparing for or making a U-turn when otherwise permitted by law. 
c.  A vehicle shall not be driven in the lane for a distance more than 500 feet.

Section 300.217. Turning and stopping signals. 
(a)  No person shall stop or suddenly decrease the speed of or turn a vehicle from a direct course or move right or left upon a roadway unless and until such movement can be made with reasonable safety and then only after the giving of an appropriate signal in the manner provided in this section. 
(1)  An operator or driver when stopping, or when checking the speed of the operator's vehicle, if the movement of other vehicles may reasonably be affected by such checking of speed, shall extend such operator's arm at an angle below horizontal so that the operator's arm may be seen in the rear of the vehicle; 
(2)  An operator or driver intending to turn the operator's vehicle to the right shall extend such operator's arm at an angle above horizontal so that the operator's arm may be seen in front of and in the rear of the vehicle, and shall slow down and approach the intersecting highway as near as practicable to the right side of the highway along which such operator is proceeding before turning; 
(3)  An operator or driver intending to turn the operator's vehicle to the left shall extend such operator's arm in a horizontal position so that the operator's arm may be seen in the rear of the vehicle, and shall slow down and approach the intersecting highway so that the left side of the vehicle shall be as near as practicable to the centerline of the highway along which the operator is proceeding before turning; 
(4)  The signals required in this section shall be given either by means of the hand and arm or by a signal light or signal device in good mechanical condition of a type approved by the state highway patrol; however, when a vehicle is so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle then such signals shall be given by such light or device. A vehicle shall be considered as so constructed or loaded that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to the left outside limit of the body, cab or load exceeds 24 inches, or when the distance from the center of the top of the steering post to the rear limit of the body or load thereon exceeds 14 feet, which limit of 14 feet shall apply to single vehicles or combinations of vehicles. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any trailer which does not interfere with a clear view of the hand signals of the operator or of the signaling device upon the vehicle pulling such trailer; provided further that the provisions of this section as far as mechanical devices on vehicles so constructed that a hand and arm signal would not be visible both to the front and rear of such vehicle as above provided shall only be applicable to new vehicles registered within this state after January 1, 1954. 
(b)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the making of an emergency stop or turn in order to attempt to avoid a collision where there is not sufficient time to give such signal. 
(c)  If such turn is to be made from a stopped position, then such signal must be given prior to proceeding for such duration as to be a warning to other traffic.

(e)  Investigation by city manager. The city manager shall investigate the facts contained in an application for a license, and may request the assistance of the director of public safety and any other person having knowledge of the facts contained in the application, or who is able to investigate those matters.

The annual fee for the issuance of a renewal license is $500.00. No investigation fee shall be required for a renewal license. 
(h)  Suspension or revocation of license. 
(1)  If the city manager believes that conditions have changed such that the holder of a license would not still be eligible to receive a pawnbroker's license, or that the holder of the license is in violation of this chapter or state law pertaining to pawnshops the city manager may suspend the license. 
(2)  If the city manager believes that conditions have changed but that the holder of a license may remedy the situation, the city manager may suspend the license for a reasonable period of time to allow remediation, provided the licensee has not previously been in violation of this chapter or state law pertaining to pawnshops. If the city manager believes that the changed conditions are such that, if true, the licensee would not be able to remedy the situation in a reasonable time, or if the holder of the license has previously been in violation of this chapter or state law pertaining to pawnshops, then the city manager may revoke the license. 
(3)  If the city manager believes that the safety, morals, or peace of residents of the city is immediately affected by the change in conditions, the city manager may suspend or revoke the license prior to a hearing, but the licensee shall be allowed a hearing within five days of the suspension or revocation if so desired, and the city manager shall provide timely written notice to the licensee of such right. If the city manager believes that the changed condition is not of such imminent hazard to the safety, morals or peace of the residents of the city, the city manager shall hold a hearing prior to taking any action against the license and shall give the licensee at least ten days' written notice of the hearing. 
(4)  If the city manager determines after issuance of a license that the application contained false or misleading information, the license may be revoked or suspended prior to a hearing, but the licensee shall be entitled to request a hearing within five days.

(i)  Display of license. The license provided for in this chapter shall designate the licensed location and shall be posted conspicuously on the premises. 
(j)  Validity of existing licenses. No person who is lawfully and actively operating a pawnshop on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be required to obtain a license under this section in order to continue operating such pawnshop, so long as such person does not violate any of the provisions of this chapter. Such person may continue to operate such pawnshop then in existence, but thereafter must receive an annual renewal license even though the operation of such pawnshop might cause the number of pawnbrokers in the city to exceed the number determined by operation of subsection (k) of this section. Such owner shall be required to pay the $500.00 annual fee prescribed, but shall not be required to pay an investigation fee. 
(k)  Limitation on number of pawnbrokers in the city. Subject to the provisions of subsection (j) of this section, no license for engaging in the business of pawnbrokers shall be issued when the issuance thereof would increase the number of such licenses outstanding and in force at the time to more than one per 20,000 inhabitants.

ARTICLE 2. - AGGRESSIVE SOLICITATION[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Cross reference- Streets and sidewalks, § 8.120.010 et seq. 

Sec. 5.160.200. - Legislative findings. 
(a)  The city council finds that the increase in aggressive solicitation throughout the metropolitan area has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses, and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder. 
(b)  The city council finds that aggressive solicitation usually includes approaching or following pedestrians, repetitive soliciting despite refusals, the use of abusive or profane language to cause fear and intimidation, unwanted physical contact, or the intentional or unintentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The council further finds that the presence of individuals who solicit money from persons at or near banks automated teller machines, or in public transportation vehicles is especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of crime in those confined environments. Motorists also find themselves confronted by persons seeking money who, without permission, wash their automobile windows at traffic intersections, despite explicit indications by drivers not to do so. Such activity carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property. Persons soliciting money or services from people driving on the public streets obstruct traffic and create a dangerous situation where the threat of bodily injury to themselves or others is increased. 
(c)  The law is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to solicit funds, picket, protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activity. Rather, its goal is to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation and the risk to the motoring public accompanying certain kinds of solicitation that have become an unwelcome presence in the city and to allow for adequate means of communication of such constitutionally protected activity.

Such application shall be accompanied by a site plan indicating the area to be served, location of all existing utilities, right-of-way and easements, proposed location and alignment of new mains, point of connection to existing system, and any new easements required for construction of new mains. The applicant shall also submit for approval a set of construction plans containing the designer's seal, the alignment, a profile, elevations, city standard details and notes. The applicant shall submit the following: 
(1)  The applicant shall furnish the city with a performance bond in the amount of the contract as required by section 8.105.030 and a maintenance bond covering the year immediately after completion of construction, commencing on the day the city accepts the mains for substantial completion; 
(2)  The applicant shall provide proof of public liability and property damage insurance in the minimum amounts listed: 
Bodily Injury Property 
Damage Each Person $250,000.00 Each Accident $500,000.00 $250,000.00  
(3)  The completion date of the contract; 
(4)  The applicant's agreement to construct the mains in accordance with the plans, specifications as submitted and the technical specifications and design criteria manual of the city; 
(5)  The prohibition of the construction of mains on private property unless adequate easements are provided to the city from each property owner: 
(6)  Submission of lien wavers to the city by applicant; 
(7)  The agreement of applicant to deed the mains to the city by means of a bill of sale; and 
(8)  Any upsizing required by the city to be in accordance with section 6.110.050.

(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.600.010), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 6.110.050. - Water main extensions; specifications. 
    All water main extensions shall be no smaller than eight-inch pipe in size, shall be installed and made available to adjacent properties served by the main and shall have hydrants located on all intersections and spaced no further than 500 feet apart; provided, however, that the planning official may require the use of a main larger than eight inches, in which case the city shall pay the difference between the cost of eight-inch main materials and the cost of the larger main materials. If the main extends into a cul-de-sac, the size may be reduced to four-inch pipe, provided that all other conditions are met. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.600.020), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 6.110.060. - Cost of installation or reimbursement of applicant; amount, refunds. 
    No property or lot in the vicinity of any water main built pursuant to this article, which is not owned by an "applicant" (any person causing a water main to be installed for the benefit of lots or property owned by such person) either when the main is constructed or when a water connection is sought for such property or lot, shall be directly supplied with water from the main until the sum of one-half over the average cost per foot multiplied by the frontage length of the property to be served is paid to the city. This shall be in addition to other connection charges imposed by the city. Such amount shall be paid before any water is supplied from the main constructed. If, at any time before payment by the property owner of such charge, it shall reasonably appear to the planning official that a lesser amount may be required (based on the probability that there will be sufficient use of the main by nonowners to adequately reimburse the applicant or person installing the main), then the amount may be reduced by the planning official subject to approval by the city manager. If an existing main is replaced by another larger main by either the city or any other party, those persons who receive water service through the existing main shall not be liable for any charge as a result of subsequently connecting to the larger main. In no event is the applicant or person installing the main to receive more than the actual cost of installing that portion of the line adjacent to nonowned property; and, further, as to any portion of the line which also adjoins or adjoined (when built) applicant's land, applicant shall receive no more than 50 percent of the cost of such adjoining portion of the line. Applicant shall be entitled to amounts equal to monies collected (payable to such person as collected) until the agreed-on reimbursement figure, calculated by the planning official in accordance with this section, or cost of installation (whichever is less) is paid in full. There shall be no independent liability on the part of the city beyond that amount actually and legally collected pursuant to this article from persons who connect to the main in question. Collections by the city shall be continued even after the applicant has been reimbursed for the applicant's actual cost and such monies shall be paid into the general water fund. The provisions of this section, as far as refunds are concerned, do not apply in any instance other than the connection of a single service directly to the existing main (it being intended that all transmission lines or mains be attached without any refund earned or accrued). No refunds can be earned or accrued for more than five years after the date of the original contract.

(2)  The BOD component of the formula shall equal the factor of 0.00838 for converting milligrams per liter to pounds per 1,000 gallons, multiplied by the volume of sewage in 1,000 gallons multiplied by $0.079, the estimated cost for treatment of one pound of BOD in the raw sewage, multiplied by the concentration of BOD in milligrams per liter minus 300, the strength for the normal sewage. 
(3)  The suspended solids component of the formula shall equal the factor of 0.00838 as defined in the BOD component, multiplied by the volume of sewage in 1,000 gallons, multiplied by $0.045, the estimated cost of treatment of one pound of suspended solids in the raw sewage, multiplied by the concentration of suspended solids in milligrams per liter minus 360, the strength for normal sewage. 
(4)  The extra strength control charge shall be the actual cost to the city for each individual user, related to obtaining, measuring and analyzing sewage samples to determine sewage strengths for billing purposes. The director of community services shall determine the method and frequency of testing as may be reasonable for each customer in accordance with recognized engineering practices; provided, however, that a user shall be entitled to additional sampling at its request upon payment of additional costs therefor. In lieu of sampling and analysis by the city, the director of community services, at the director's discretion, may permit a user to collect and analyze samples of its own sewage at its own expense, providing samples are taken at least annually, collected and analyzed in accordance with provisions of the latest editions of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, and the results are certified by a professional engineer registered in the state. The city reserves the right to verify submitted data. 
(5)  The symbols, letters or figures employed in the formula signify the following: 
S = Extra strength surcharge in dollars Vs = Sewage volume in 1,000 gallons 0.00838 = Conversion factor for milligrams per liter to pounds per 1,000 gallons $0.079 = Unit O&M charge for BOD in dollars per pound BOD = BOD strength in milligrams per liter $0.045 = Unit O&M charge for suspended solids in dollars per pound SS = Suspended solids strength in milligrams per liter ESC = Extra strength control charge  
(c)  Treatment to reduce concentrations. The owner of any commercial or industrial establishment may, if so desired, treat the wastes from such establishment so as to reduce either the excess suspended solids or BOD, or both, to normal levels before discharging such wastes into the public sewers. In cases where it is believed such wastes may be deleterious to the sewerage receiving stream, the director of community services may require treatment to reduce either or both the suspended solids and BOD to levels more closely approaching those of normal sewage before discharging such wastes into the city sewers.

CHAPTER 161. - MXD PLANNED MIXED USE DISTRICT 

Sec. 7.161.010. - General purpose and description. 
    The zoning of property to MXD planned mixed use district is intended to encourage sustainable neighborhoods with a mixture of land uses, independently or when combined with adjacent mixed use zoned areas, which create a distinctive and unique sense of place. This district is expected to have a pedestrian orientation with a mixture of residential, office and retail uses in closer proximity to one another than would be possible in conventional zoning districts. The district may be appropriate in locations the comprehensive plan recommends higher densities in mixed-use developments and to implement policies for reuse and development of vacant or underutilized commercial parcels and corridors. Proposals for MXD may be eligible for rezoning if they incorporate design principles, including an interconnected street network to disperse traffic and provide convenient routes for pedestrians and bicycles, high-quality civic spaces, compact development resulting in a walkable urban environment and diversity in building types and land uses. 
(Ord. No. 4.179, 2-28-2011) 
Sec. 7.161.020. - Use of this district. 
    The MXD differs from other districts within the city in that it is a development district intended to guide the physical form of buildings, provide a mix of uses in close proximity to each other in a higher density urban environment. To accomplish the purpose and objectives of this district the following components shall be provided by an applicant seeking this zoning classification or development within this district which will supplement the standards and guidelines provided in this chapter. 
(a)  Regulating plan. A tract of land may be zoned MXD only upon approval of a regulating plan, which shall be included as part of the zoning application. The plan shall identify various zones, mix of uses, and the character of each zone typically specific to each block or lot in the district. This may include an illustrative plan showing buildings and preliminary designs for streets and civic spaces for each block or lot. The regulating plan dictates where additional standards may apply as part of the next two sections. 
(b)  Development standards and guidelines. The MXD provides common development standards and guidelines applicable to all areas zoned MXD. In addition, the MXD regulating plan may include additional requirements and guidelines specific to a particular area and/or use. The development standards and guidelines may include but shall not be limited to: building design and character, thoroughfare standards, open space and civic space, parking, lighting, signage, landscaping, among others. 
(c)  Building envelope standards. The building envelope standards establish parameters for the desired building envelope within each zone. The standards address the relationship of buildings to streets, public spaces, and adjacent development by establishing building heights, setbacks, required transitions, and other requirements based on the character area. 
(Ord. No. 4.179, 2-28-2011) 
Sec. 7.161.030. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings associated to them: 
    Accessory dwelling means an apartment not greater than 600 square feet sharing ownership and utility connections with the principal building. The dwelling may or may not be within an outbuilding. 
    Building envelope means the three-dimensional area enclosed by the front, side and rear building lines and the maximum height and bulk regulations. 
    Civic space means an outdoor area dedicated for public use. 
    Liner building means a building specifically designed to mask a parking lot or a parking garage from a frontage. 
    Live-work means a dwelling unit that contains, to a limited extent, a commercial component. A live-work unit is a unit on its own lot with the commercial component limited to the ground level. 
(Ord. No. 4.179, 2-28-2011) 
Sec. 7.161.040. - Permitted/prohibited uses and intensity of use. 
    Mixed use districts are expected to include a mix of residential, office and commercial uses, either within an individual property zoned MXD or as part of a larger area of similarly zoned properties. A mix of uses is encouraged within each zone of the regulating plan and may be required in some locations, as specified in this section. Allowed uses are subject to the standards in section 7.161.050, general development standards and guidelines, and other standards established with zoning approval. 
    The size, location, appearance and method of operation may be specified to the extent necessary to insure compliance with the purpose of this district. After approval of the MXD, uses may be added, changed or deleted by amendment. The procedure for considering an amendment shall be the same as for the original adoption. Permitted uses include the following, unless otherwise modified or prohibited by the ordinance granting an MXD planned mixed use district: 
(a)  Permitted uses.

(c)  Outdoor eating and drinking. Outdoor areas for eating and drinking shall be permitted and are encouraged as part of the development design. Any such outdoor areas shall be designated on a final development plan. When located on public right-of-way such areas may be subject to a right-of-way maintenance agreement. 
(Ord. No. 4.179, 2-28-2011) 
Sec. 7.161.050. - General development standards and guidelines. 
    Unless otherwise approved by the city council, development within the MXD zoning district shall comply with the following common development standards and guidelines provided in this section. Additional regulations for each separate MXD shall be set forth in the ordinance granting the MXD. The regulating plan may include other requirements as the city council may deem appropriate. The MXD shall conform to all other sections of this title unless specifically exempted in the ordinance granting the MXD. 
(a)  Sustainable design and construction. The design and construction of new buildings and site improvements are expected to incorporate low impact development practices that increase pedestrian and bicycle accommodations, reduce storm water runoff and pollution, reduce wastewater and increase water reuse, reduce light pollution, increase building water and energy efficiency, and similar sustainable best practices. The design approach to achieve such practices shall be detailed with plans and components submitted with the MXD zoning application and site plan approvals. 
(b)  Building height. No maximum height, provided that the height of buildings shall be as established by the MXD building envelope standards. At least 50 percent of the total floor area (excluding structured parking) shall be located above the ground floor, with the exception of auditoriums, conference facilities, theaters, and other similar uses. 
(c)  Setbacks. The requirements regulating setbacks shall conform to the following, unless otherwise approved by the city council as a part of the building envelope standards. Additionally, during the rezoning approval process the city council may require additional setbacks if it is determined that such setback is necessary to provide adequate open space, access to light and air, a healthful living environment, prevent visual obstruction of adjoining properties, or to ensure compatibility with existing adjacent development. 
(1)  Front yard setback. No minimum requirement. The front yard setback shall be established as shown on the approved MXD plans. 
(2)  Side yard setback. No setback required except that where a lot line abuts the lot line of a residentially zoned property, a setback shall be required which is at least equal to the minimum setback required in the district which the MXD abuts. 
(3)  Rear yard setback. No setback required except that where a lot line abuts the lot line of a residentially zoned property, a setback shall be required which is at least equal to the minimum setback required in the district which the MXD abuts. 
(d)  Public open space/civic space. Formal and informal areas of usable outdoor open spaces are required. These serve as areas for community gatherings, landmarks, and as organizing elements for the neighborhood. Usable open space includes squares, plazas, greens, preserves, parks, and greenbelts.

The design of streets shall include adequate right-of-way to create safe and well-furnished pedestrian and bicycle corridors in the public streetscape. The following shall also apply: 
(1)  An interconnected network of streets shall be required. Dead-end streets, including cul-de-sac streets, are prohibited unless determined with the MXD plan approval that the most desirable plan requires laying out a dead-end street. 
(2)  The roadway designs used within the different areas of an MXD may vary depending on the proposed function of the roadway, the anticipated adjacent land uses, the anticipated traffic load, and appropriate accommodations for pedestrian and bicycle facilities as directed by the city engineer. Streets in an MXD may be narrower than in conventional development, as well as more varied in size and form to control automobile traffic and give character to the district or neighborhood. A variety of unique and innovative roadway designs that lend character to the neighborhood and provide safe pedestrian and bicycle facilities are required. 
(3)  The streetscape design shall be consistent with city standards for mixed-use districts, and include sidewalks, landscaping and street trees, pedestrian lighting, and other pedestrian amenities and furnishings such as benches, trash receptacles, bicycle racks, and similar elements contributing to the character of the area. 
(4)  Residential driveway access from a lot to an alley or lane in an MXD is permitted and preferred. Driveway access from a lot to a street is permitted, subject to architectural design and setback requirements detailed with development plan approvals. Where garage access is from the street, special architectural and setbacks are required to ensure the garage is not the dominant building feature. 
(f)  Reserved. 
(g)  Vehicular and bicycle parking. Off-street parking and loading requirements for each separate MXD planned mixed use district shall be as set forth in chapter 180 and chapter 195 unless otherwise modified by the ordinance granting the MXD. 
(1)  Required parking-Reductions. The city council may reduce the parking and loading requirements set forth by chapter 180 after considering documentation and/or study provided by the applicant, staff's recommendation, and giving decisive weight to all relevant facts including, but not limited to the following factors: availability and accessibility of alternative parking; the availability of existing or planned transit services; the availability of bicycle parking; impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods; existing or potential shared parking arrangements; the characteristics of the use, including hours of operation and peak parking demand times; design and maintenance of off-street parking that will be provided; and whether the proposed use is new or a small addition to an existing use. 
(2)  Shared parking. Shared or community parking areas shall be required. Off-street parking areas shall be small in scale and divided into surface parking lots not to exceed 50 parking spaces, unless otherwise approved by the city council. 
(3)  On-street parking. On-street parking spaces on public and private streets may be counted towards the required off-street parking, provided the on-street spaces are located on an adjacent or internal street that allows on-street parking. Such on-street parking spaces must be identified on plans at the time of submittal to the city. 
(4)  Maximum parking. Grade level parking allowed per use or per project shall not exceed the minimum parking required for such use. Any new parking facility with a capacity exceeding 200 spaces shall accommodate no more than 50 percent of the total parking at grade level. 
(5)  Parking location. Surface parking shall be located behind and/or to the side of buildings. No parking areas shall be located between the front of a building and the street toward which the building faces. Unless otherwise approved by the city council, no open parking areas shall be located closer than 15 feet to a street right-of-way, or no closer than ten feet to a property line other than a street line. Parking areas within the building, or within a parking structure extending more than six feet above the finished grade, shall comply with the setback regulations of the main building. 
(6)  Parking lot screening. All surface parking areas visible from the street right-of-way shall be screened with landscaping in combination with a low masonry wall or ornamental fence, and maintained to at least the average level of maintenance of the other developed property within the immediate neighborhood. Landscaping shall be located between the wall or fence and the public right-of-way, sidewalk, or boundary. Walls, fences, and landscaping shall not exceed 3.5 feet in height to adequately screen most vehicle headlights while maintaining clear visibility into and out of the parking area. 
(7)  Parking structures. No parking structures shall have any façade on any public street, unless providing a liner building of retail, office, or residential use at the street level along the entire street frontage. All visible sides of parking structures shall be constructed with similar materials as the main building.

(Code 1974, § 32-39) 
CHAPTER 166. - COMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAS AND SUPPORT STRUCTURES 

Sec. 7.166.010. - Purpose. 
    The general purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement, construction and modification of telecommunications towers, support structures, and antennae in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace within the corporate boundaries of Gladstone. Specifically, this chapter is intended to: 
(1)  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of Gladstone; 
(2)  Minimize adverse visual impacts of communications antennae and support structures through the use of careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
(3)  Maximize the use of existing and new support structures so as to minimize the need to construct new or additional facilities; 
(4)  Maximize the co-location of facilities on any new support structures and facilitate the fewest and least visible new structures capable of achieving these objectives; 
(5)  Ensure that any new telecommunications tower or structure is located in an area compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible; 
(6)  Ensuring that regulation of telecommunications towers and structures does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service. 
(Ord. No. 4.093, § 1, 1-26-2009) 
Sec. 7.166.020. - General requirements. 
    The requirements set forth in this section shall be applicable to all telecommunications towers, antennae and other support structures installed, built or modified after the effective date of ordinance from which this chapter is derived to the full extent permitted by law. 
(1)  Principal or incidental use. Antennae and support structures may be either a principal use in all zoning districts or an incidental use to institutional or nonresidential uses, subject to any applicable district requirement relating to yard or setback. An incidental use subject to a leasehold interest of a person other then the lot owner may be approved for a tower only if the leasehold area separately meets all requirements of access, parking, and lot size applicable to the primary use in the district in which the use is proposed. 
(2)  Building codes, safety standards, and zoning compliance. To ensure the structural integrity of antenna support structures, the owner shall assure that it is constructed and maintained in compliance with all standards contained in applicable state and local building codes and the applicable standards published by the current Electronics Industries Association, as amended from time to time. In addition to any other approvals required by this section, no antenna, tower, or support structure shall be erected prior to receipt of a certificate of zoning compliance and the issuance of a building permit. 
(3)  Regulatory compliance. All antennae and support structures shall meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC and any other state or federal agency with the authority to regulate communications antennae and support structures. Should such standards or regulations be amended, then the owner shall bring such devices and structure into compliance with the revised standards or regulations within the time period mandated by the controlling agency. No approval for any placement, construction or modification of any antenna or structure permitted by this section shall be granted for any applicant having an uncured violation of this section, any zoning regulation regarding the lot on which the structure is proposed, or any other governmental regulatory requirement applicable to such antenna or structures within the city. 
(4)  Security. All antennae and support structures shall be protected from unauthorized access by appropriate security measures. A description of proposed security measures shall be provided as part of any application to install, build or modify antennae or support structures. Additional measures may be required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit or administrative permit as deemed necessary by the director and city council in the case of a special use permit. 
(5)  Lighting. Antennae and support structures shall not be lighted unless required by the FAA or other state or federal agency with authority to regulate, in which case a description of the required lighting scheme will be made a part of the application to install, build or modify the antennae or support structure. Equipment cabinets and shelters may have lighting only as approved by the director or city council on the approved site development plan. 
(6)  Advertising. Except for a disguised antenna support structure in the form of an otherwise lawfully permitted sign, the placement of advertising on structures regulated by this section is prohibited. 
(7)  Design. 
a.  Subject to the requirements of the FAA or any applicable state or federal agency, towers shall be galvanized steel, or if painted, a neutral color consistent with the natural or built environment of the site. 
b.  Equipment shelters or cabinets shall have an exterior finish compatible with the natural or built environment of the site and shall also comply with any design guidelines as may be applicable to the particular zoning district in which the facility is located. All equipment shall be either placed underground, contained in a single shelter or cabinet, or wholly concealed within a building. 
c.  Support structures shall not exceed the height limitation of any airport overlay zone as may be adopted by the city or other regulatory agency, but may exceed underlying district height restrictions for buildings and structures, where shown to be necessary, provided that such height restrictions shall be considered by the city in determining the appropriateness of the design and location of the proposed structure under the standards for approval. 
d.  Antennae attached to a building or part of a disguised antenna support structure shall be of a color identical to or closely compatible with the surface to which they are mounted. All other antennae shall be designed to be disguised, or if otherwise permitted, maximally concealed on or within the support structure. Exposed antennae on "crows nest" or other visible platforms are prohibited. 
e.  All towers shall be surrounded by a minimum six-foot high decorative wall constructed of brick, stone or comparable masonry materials and a landscape strip of not less than ten feet in width and planted with materials, which will provide a visual barrier to a minimum height of six feet. The landscape strip shall be exterior to any security wall. In lieu of the required wall and landscape strip, an alternative means of screening may be approved by the director, or by the city council in the case of a special use permit, upon demonstration by the applicant that an equivalent degree of visual screening will be achieved. Landscaping shall be required for disguised support structures if needed to implement an approved disguise. 
f.  All towers, disguised support structures, and related structures, fences and walls shall be separated from the property line of any adjacent property zoned for a residential use at least a distance equal to the height of the tower, and shall be separated from all other adjacent property lines at least a distance equal to one-half of the height of the tower or structure. 
g.  Vehicle or outdoor storage on any support structure site is prohibited, unless otherwise permitted by the zoning. 
h.  On-site parking for periodic maintenance and service shall be provided at all antenna or tower locations consistent with the underlying zoning district and the type of antenna or support structure approval granted. 
(8)  Shared use. 
a.  Existing support structures . Prior to the issuance of any permit to alter or modify any tower existing on the effective date of this Chapter, the owner shall provide to the city a written agreement committing to make said tower available for use by others subject to reasonable technical limitations and reasonable financial terms. Technical limitations regarding disguised support structures shall include limitations as are necessary to maintain the requirements of a disguised support structure. The willful and knowing failure of a structure owner to agree to shared use or to negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be unlawful and shall, among other remedies of the city, be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same owner to install, build, or modify antennae or support structures within the city. 
b.  Support structure inventories . Prior to the issuance of any permit to install, build or modify any support structure, such applicant shall furnish the director an inventory of (1) all of that applicant's and the proposed antenna user's (if the proposed antenna user is different from the applicant) support structures, and (2) all towers owned by any person, located within 11/2 miles of the proposed structure. The inventory shall include the structure or antenna reference name or number, the street location, latitude and longitude, structure type, height, type and mounting height of existing antennas and an assessment of available ground space for the placement of additional equipment shelters. Upon being modified, any disguised support structure designed for additional antennas and any tower, shall be placed on the multi-use interest area map for required collocation. 
c.  Shared use required-New support structures. Any new support structure approved at a height of 60 feet AGL (above ground level) or higher shall be designed and constructed to accommodate at least one additional user unless a larger number is indicated by the response to the notification provisions herein. A written agreement committing to shared use as required by subsection one shall be submitted by the structure applicant. The willful and knowing failure of the owner of a structure built for shared use to negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be unlawful and shall be a violation of this chapter and, among other remedies of the city, shall be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same owner or applicant to install, build or modify antennae or support structures within the city. The director may waive this requirement for disguised support structures if the applicant submits a written request demonstrating that compliance cannot be achieved without violating one or more of the definitional requirements of a disguised support structure. 
d.  Communications tower multi-use area map . Any new tower approved within a communication tower multi-use interest area as designated by the map of the same title, shall be designed and constructed to accommodate the number of users indicated by the plan to the extent feasible. The willful and knowing failure of the owner of a tower built for shared use to negotiate in good faith with potential users shall be a violation of this chapter and, among other remedies of the city, shall be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same owner to install, build or modify antennae or towers within the city. 
e.  Notice of tower applications. Prior to any application for the construction of a new tower or disguised support structure, a copy of the application or a summary containing the height, design, location and type and frequency of antennae shall be delivered by certified mail to all known potential tower users within the city, including but not limited to all companies providing mobile wireless service in the city, and such other persons as may be identified on a schedule prepared and maintained by the director. Proof of such delivery shall be documented with the application to the city. The director may establish a form required to be used for such notifications and establish other procedures consistent with and as may facilitate compliance with this chapter. The director shall, before deciding on the application or forwarding it to the planning commission or council for review, allow all persons receiving notice at least 15 calendar days to respond to the city and the applicant that the party receiving notice be permitted to share the proposed tower or locate within one mile of such area. Where two or more parties seek to locate within one mile of each other, or such other distance as is demonstrated to the director to be reasonable pursuant to the objectives of this chapter, the director shall designate such area as a multi-use interest area on the map. The failure of the receiving party to use this process or respond to any such notice shall be considered cause for denying requests by such party for new towers or structures. 
f.  Appeal of shared use violations. Any party seeking shared use of a support structure subject to this provision shall after responding to notice of an application, negotiate with the applicant for such use. The applicant may on a legitimate and reasonable business basis choose between multiple requests for shared use on the same tower or structure, and may reject any request where legitimate technical obstacles cannot be reasonably overcome or where the party requesting shared use will not agree to reasonable financial terms. Any party believing that the applicant has breached its duty to negotiate in good faith for shared use shall immediately notify the applicant and the director in writing. The director may reject the application upon a finding that shared use has been improperly denied. A notice of breach of duty shall explain the precise basis for the claim and shall be accompanied by payment of an administrative review fee deposit of $1,000.00 to the city to be used to offset the cost of review. After the applicant's receipt of the notice, the applicant shall have ten calendar days to provide a written submission to the director responding to the alleged violation of the shared use requirement. If deemed necessary by the director, he/she may engage, at the cost of the party alleging the violation, a neutral, qualified technical consultant to provide an opinion on feasibility or costs of the shared use request. If the director receives a notice alleging a violation of the shared use requirement, the time for a decision on an administrative permit is automatically extended for up to 30 days until the director has determined that the applicant has complied. An application for a new support structure shall not be deemed complete for acceptance until all information necessary for a decision on compliance has been provided by the applicant.

    All proposals to install, build or modify an antenna or support structure not permitted by section 7.166.030 (permitted uses) or section 7.166.040 (administrative permit), shall require the approval of special use permit following a duly advertised public hearing by the planning commission and city council, subject to the following limitations. 
(1)  Applications. Applications for special use permits shall be filed and processed subject to the requirements of and in the manner and time frame as otherwise established in the zoning code. A decision shall be accompanied by substantial evidence supporting the decision, which shall be made a part of the written record of the meeting at which a final decision on the application is rendered. Evidence shall be under oath and may be submitted with the application or thereafter presented during the public hearing by the applicant or others. 
(2)  Additional minimum requirements. No special use permit shall be issued unless the applicant has clearly demonstrated by substantial evidence that placement of an antenna or support structure pursuant to section 7.166.030 (permitted uses) or section 7.166.040 (administrative permits) is not technologically or economically feasible. The city may consider current or emerging industry standards and practices, among other information, in determining feasibility. 
(3)  Findings required. In addition to the determinations or limitations specified herein and by section 7.165.010 of the zoning code for the consideration of special use permits, no special use shall be approved by the city council unless findings in the affirmative are made that the following conditions exist: 
a.  That the proposed tower is not and cannot be located within a communications tower multi-use interest area as designated by such map, or if so located, meets the co-location requirements of this section. 
b.  No existing towers, structures or buildings within the necessary geographic area for the applicant's tower meet the applicant's necessary engineering requirements considering (1) height, (2) structural strength, (3) resulting signal interference, (4) feasibility of retrofitting, (5) feasibility of redesigning the applicant's tower network, or (6) other limiting conditions that render towers, structures or buildings within the applicant's required geographic area unsuitable. 
c.  That the design of the tower or structure, including the antennae, shelter and ground layout maximally reduces visual degradation and otherwise complies with the provisions and intent of this section. New towers shall be of a monopole design, unless it is shown that an alternative design would equally or better satisfy this provision. 
d.  That the proposal minimizes the number and/or size of towers or structures that will be required in the area. Where alternate technology or design exists or is reasonably available that would satisfy the general need for the proposal, this factor is ordinarily not satisfied. 
e.  That the applicant has not previously failed to take advantage of reasonably available shared use opportunities or procedures provided by this chapter or otherwise. 
f.  That no land owned by any agency of the federal or state government, or by any political subdivision of the state, is available for locating the structure or tower. 
g.  The city may require, at the expense of the petitioner, any additional studies or the hiring of an external consultant, including technical and legal services, to review exhibits and/or other requirements in accordance with this section. 
Provided, that if one, but not more than one, of the first six determinations is not satisfied, approval may be granted only on a finding of unique circumstances otherwise necessitating approval to satisfy the purposes of this section. 
(4)  RF engineer certification required. Applications for a new tower structure shall be considered only after a letter, certified by a radio frequency engineer under oath, stating that the planned telecommunication equipment cannot be accommodated on an existing or already approved transmission tower and providing facts (including (1) all alternatives considered and (2) precise cost estimates where cost is a basis for the determination) clearly demonstrating one or more of the following conditions: 
a.  Planned telecommunications equipment would exceed the structural capacity of an existing or approved transmission tower, and the transmission tower cannot be reinforced to accommodate planned telecommunication equipment at a reasonable cost; 
b.  Planned telecommunications equipment will cause radio frequency interference with other existing or planned telecommunications equipment for that transmission tower and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost; 
c.  Existing or approved towers do not have space on which the planned telecommunications equipment can be placed so it can function effectively and at least in parity with other similar telecommunications equipment in place or approved by the City and Kansas City, Missouri or other area jurisdictions; or 
d.  Other reasons that make it impractical and not feasible to place the telecommunications equipment planned by the applicant on an existing and approved transmission tower. 
(5)  Additional height limitations. No tower shall be approved at a height exceeding 150 feet AGL unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that such height is required for the proper function of the applicant's system or that of a public safety communications system of a governmental entity sharing the tower. Such showing must also be supported by the opinion of a telecommunications consultant hired by the city at the expense of the applicant. The opinion of the consultant shall include a statement that no available alternatives exist to exceeding the height limit or the reason why such alternatives are not viable.

    Automatic timing device means a device that automatically controls the operation of a light fixture or fixtures, circuit or circuits. Photocells and light and or motion sensors shall be considered automatic-timing devices. 
    Average footcandle means the level of light measured at an average point of illumination between the brightest and darkest areas. The measurement can be made at the ground surface or at four to five feet above the ground. 
    Bulb means the source of electric light. To be distinguished from the whole assembly (see luminaire). 
    Candela (cd) means unit of luminous intensity. 
    Eighty-five degree full cut-off type fixtures means fixtures that do not allow light to escape above an 85-degree angle measured from a vertical line from the center of the lamp extended to the ground. 
    Exterior lighting means temporary or permanent lighting that is installed, located or used in such a manner to cause light rays to shine outside. Fixtures that are installed indoors that are intended to light something outside are considered exterior lighting for the intent of this chapter. 
    Fixture means the assembly that holds the lamp in a lighting system. It includes the elements designed to give light output control, such as a reflector (mirror) or refractor (lens), the ballast, housing, and the attachment parts. 
    Flood light means light that produces up to 1,800 lumens (See Addendum 1 for Light Output of Various Lamps) and is designed to "flood" a well-defined area with light. Generally, floodlights produce from 1,000 to 1,800 lumens. 
    Footcandle means illuminance produced on a surface one foot from a uniform point source of one candela. Measured by a light meter. 
    Full cutoff fixture means a fixture which, as installed, gives no emission of light above a horizontal plane. 
    Glare means intense light that results in discomfort and/or a reduction of visual performance and visibility. 
    Holiday lighting means festoon type lights, limited to small individual bulbs on a string, where the output per bulb is no greater than 15 lumens. 
    IESNA, Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IES or IESNA) means the professional society of lighting engineers, including those from manufacturing companies, and others professionally involved in lighting. 
    Illuminance means density of luminous flux incident on a surface. Unit is footcandle or lux. 
    Illuminating devices means: 
(1)  Light fixture types. 
a.  Full cutoff fixture types. A fixture which, as installed, gives no emission of light above a horizontal plane. 
b.  Floodlights and spotlights. Fixtures defined as having a full beam width or beam spread of less then 110 degrees.

c.  High intensity discharge lamps. Lamps, which produce visible light directly by the electrical heating or excitation of a gas. Examples of such lighting include, but are not limited to, metal halide, high pressure sodium, low pressure sodium and mercury vapor. For purposes of this chapter, fluorescent lights are not considered HID lighting. 
d.  Light-emitting diode (LED). An electronic light source used instead of light bulbs, for greater illumination and longevity. 
e.  Induction lighting. Light generation that is similar to fluorescent light energy and requires less maintenance than conventional fluorescent lamps. 
    Lamp or bulb means the light-producing source installed in the socket portion of a luminaire. 
    Light pollution means any adverse effect of manmade light including, but not limited to, light trespass, uplighting, the uncomfortable distraction to the eye, or any manmade light that diminishes the ability to view the night sky. Often used to denote urban sky glow. 
    Light trespass means light emitted by a luminaire falls where it is not wanted or needed or shines beyond the property on which the luminaire is installed. 
    Lighting means any or all parts of a luminaire that function to produce light. 
    Lumen means unit of luminous flux; the flux emitted within a unit solid angle by a point source with a uniform luminous intensity of one candela. One footcandle is one lumen per square foot. One lux is one lumen per square meter. 
    Luminaire means the complete lighting unit, including the lamp, the fixture, and other parts. 
    Luminance means At a point and in a given direction, the luminous intensity in the given direction produced by an element of the surface surrounding the point divided by the area of the projection of the element on a plane perpendicular to the given direction. Units means candelas per unit area. The luminance is the perceived brightness that we see, the visual effect of the illuminance, reflected, emitted or transmitted from a surface. 
    Measurement means: 
(1)  Lamp output. 
a.  Total output. Measurement of total output is in lumens. This should be understood to be the initial lumen value for the lamp. 
b.  Illuminance. Measurements of illuminance are expressed in initial lumens per square foot. (A desktop illuminance of 20 initial lumens per square foot is adequate for most purposes.) 
In measuring illuminance, the light detector should be pointed directly at the light source or sources. The intervening light path should be free of obstruction. 
    Outdoor light fixture means an outdoor illuminating device, outdoor lighting or reflective surface, luminous tube, lamp or similar device, permanently installed or portable, used for illumination, decoration, or advertisement.

    Recessed means when a light is built into a structure or portion of a structure such that the light is fully cut-off and no part of the light extends or protrudes beyond the underside of a structure or portion of a structure. 
    Shielded means when the light emitted from the fixture is projected below a horizontal plane running through the lowest point of the fixture where light is emitted. The bulb is not visible with a shielded light fixture, and no light is emitted from the sides of the fixture. Also considered a full cut-off fixture. 
    Spotlight or floodlight means any lamp that incorporates a reflector or a refractor to concentrate the light output into a directed beam in a particular direction (see definition for floodlight). 
    Temporary lighting means lighting that is intended to be used for a special event for seven days or less. 
    Uplighting means lighting that is directed in such a manner as to shine light rays above the horizontal plane.

When review and approval of engineering drawings is made by other agencies, the public improvement official shall be provided written confirmation from those agencies that the requisite reviews have been completed and approvals have been granted. 
(b)  Changes to approved engineering drawings. The construction of all public improvements, with respect to which engineering drawings are required by this title, or any other provision of this Code, especially chapter 115 of this title and title VII of this Code, shall conform to the approved engineering drawings. If the developer determines that it is necessary or desirable to construct a public improvement, with respect to which engineering drawings have been approved, in a manner that is a substantive change to the approved engineering drawings, the developer shall submit revised engineering drawings to the public improvement official for consideration and approval in accordance with the procedures set forth in chapter 115 of this title and title VII of this Code. For purposes of this section, a substantive change is a change that: 
(1)  Alters terrain or drainage patterns or flows. 
(2)  Causes a relocation either vertically or horizontally of any facility. 
(c)  Modifications during construction. If the developer chooses to make nonsubstantive changes during construction, the developer shall make such changes only with the prior written approval of the public improvement official. The developer need not submit revised engineering drawings for changes to the approved engineering drawings that are nonsubstantive. However, nonsubstantive changes shall be approved by the public improvement official in writing before commencement of construction on any public improvement to which such nonsubstantive change relates. The public improvement official may require that the developer submit such documentation as the public improvement official shall deem necessary to make the determination whether or not to approve the requested nonsubstantive change. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to notify the public improvement official of proposed changes to the approved engineering drawings. 
(d)  Development done in phases. If a development is constructed in phases over a period of time, the engineering drawings shall be considered as provided for in chapter 115 of this title and title VII of this Code, in the same sequence as the designated stages of the development. Engineering drawings shall only be submitted for review for portions of the development for which the developer seeks to immediately commence construction unless otherwise requested by the city to determine future effects or impacts of the development. Construction shall not commence until engineering drawings are approved by the city and applicable state and federal agencies. 
(e)  Developer to contact utility companies. It is the responsibility of the developer to contact and coordinate the planning and design of development with all utility companies that may be affected by the development at any point in time. Specifically, the developer shall provide a letter from electric, gas, and phone utilities stating that services will be provided to the development and that planning for such services will commence. 
(f)  Submission of schedule for construction. Prior to the commencement of construction of public improvements, the developer shall submit to the public improvement official, and all public utility companies affected by the construction and all other agencies that have jurisdiction over the development, a general schedule of the timing and sequence for construction of all public improvements for which engineering drawings are required by chapter 115 of this title and title VII of this Code. 
(g)  Escrow. Upon approval of the city, a developer may provide an escrow in the amount equal to the cost of required public improvements. The escrow amount shall be calculated by the project engineer, reviewed by the public improvement official and approved by the planning official and escrow funds submitted by the developer prior to obtaining any portion of a public improvement permit. In the event that a developer chooses to request an escrow in lieu of completing the required public improvements, such request must be submitted to the city in writing together with all necessary rights-of-way and permanent and temporary easements required to complete the public improvement.

The performance bond shall be based on the written bid provided to the developer by the contractor for such improvements. A copy of all such bids shall be provided to the city. Upon completion and approval of constructed public improvements by the inspection of the public improvement official, the developer shall request in writing that the public improvements be accepted by the city council and shall provide: a bill of sale for such public improvements; lien waivers from all contractors or subcontractors associated with the construction and/or installation of public improvements; as-built reproducible mylars and a digital file of the as-built improvements in the .dwg or .dxf file format; and a maintenance bond or other financial guarantee approved by the city. (See section 8.105.070 and section 8.105.100.) 
(b)  Surety company. The performance bond and maintenance bond shall be with a surety company authorized to do business in the state. The performance bond shall be undated and be in full force and effect until all covered public improvements are completed and accepted by the city council. 
(c)  Escrow funds. In lieu of a performance bond, the developer shall deposit with the city clerk, or an escrow agent mutually agreed upon by the city manager and the developer, subject to city council approval and audit, cash, a certified check, an irrevocable bank letter of credit, a commitment from a lending institution, or other readily negotiable instruments, the type of which has been approved by the city council and endorsed to the escrow agent. 
(d)  Accrual. The performance bond or escrow funds shall accrue to the city to be used to administer the construction, operation, and the maintenance of the public improvement in the event that the public improvements have commenced and are not completed by the developer within the period of time required by the conditions of the guarantee for the public improvements. The maintenance bond or escrow funds shall accrue to the city upon the developer's refusal to repair, to the city's satisfaction, any public improvement which has failed or requires maintenance. The city shall not refund any funds received through accrual. 
(e)  Escrow calculation. The estimated cost for completing construction of the public improvements including cost increases over the anticipated construction period and contingencies as estimated by the developer's engineer, verified by the public improvement official, and approved by the planning official and the cost of site cleanup and restoration as required by section 8.105.090, shall be the amount the developer submits to the city in lieu of a bond when so authorized. 
(f)  Terms. The term of the performance bonds shall be until all required public improvements have been completed and accepted by the city. The term of an escrow shall not exceed 15 years from the date of submission.

In order to accomplish this, the city council shall pay for the cost and expense thereof by appropriating the escrow amount or other financial security which developer may have deposited in lieu of a surety bond, or may take such steps necessary to require performance by the bonding or surety company, and as may be included in any written agreement between the city council and the developer. If sidewalks are not completed by the developer, the developer shall certify to the city council that each lot or parcel shall contain a covenant that requires the purchaser to construct sidewalks in conformance with all provisions of this title (see section 8.120.040). 
(b)  Site cleanup and restoration. In the event that the developer fails to complete public improvements, the developer shall be responsible for removal of all equipment, material, and general construction debris from the development and from any lot, street, or public way or property therein or adjacent thereto. At a minimum, the developer shall restore the site of the work and adjacent disturbed areas to the condition existing before the work began. All yards and lawn areas established with grass prior to construction shall be sodded to match the prior and/or existing grass. No established areas may be seeded. Any costs incurred by the city due to the failure by the developer to clean up the site to the city's satisfaction will be charged to the account of the developer or the developer's surety. Dumping of such debris into sewers, adjacent property or other land or burning of waste material in the city is prohibited. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.300.090), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 8.105.100. - Issuance of building permits. 
    Generally, no building permit will be issued for any structure before acceptance by the city of all required public improvements, when required, in accordance with section 8.105.080. Upon written request by the developer and for good cause shown, the planning official may, with approval of the city manager, issue a building permit limited to the construction of a noncombustible foundation prior to the final acceptance of public improvements by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.300.100), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 8.105.110. - Construction in the right-of-way. 
(a)  Permit required. No person shall engage in any activity that results in, or is intended to result in, an opening or excavation, or any damage incident thereto, in the public right-of-way or in the streets or alleys within the city without first obtaining from the city a permit for permission to engage in such activity. 
(b)  Permit fee. Unless covered by another permit, each application for such permit shall be accompanied by a fee as established by the schedule of fees and charges, as amended. 
(c)  Bond required. Each applicant for a public improvement permit which contemplates the opening or excavation of public right-of-way shall post with the city a bond plus a fee amount per square foot, such amount being in cash and as specified by the schedule of fees and charges, as amended. This bond will be held by the city until a written release is given, signed by the public improvement official certifying that the right-of-way has been properly and satisfactorily repaired by the applicant and has been returned to a condition that is at least equal to the condition of the right-of-way prior to initiation of the activity that gave rise to the need for a permit. 
(d)  Failure to make repairs. If the permittee shall fail to repair the right-of-way so disturbed within seven working days after notification by the public improvement official to do so, the bond and cash deposited with the city shall be deemed forfeited and the city shall use the monies to make the necessary repairs. The city reserves the right, in emergency situations, to complete the work without notice to the permittee and redeem the bond to cover the expenses to make the necessary repairs. 
(e)  Permittee's duty to supervise construction. The permittee, at all times during construction and in the operation of any work incidental to the granting of a public improvement permit, or any portion thereof and until such time as construction of the public improvement is completed, and the public improvement has been approved by the city, shall have the responsibility and the duty to erect and maintain all necessary barricades and flares and to supervise such construction. In the event that permittee fails to adequately maintain barricades and flares, the city may cause the erection and maintenance of such safety devices and permittee shall reimburse the city for the actual cost thereof. 
(f)  Conformance to manual specifications. All street cuts shall conform to the specifications set forth in the technical specifications and design criteria manual. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.300.110), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 8.105.120. - Utility company operations in city right-of-way. 
(a)  Utility companies, including all electric, gas, telephone, water and cable television companies, shall notify the public improvement official prior to any development on city right-of-way. 
(b)  All utilities shall be buried a minimum depth of 24 inches below the top of any pavement and a minimum depth of 19 inches at all other locations. Utility trenches shall not be closer than 12 inches to the back of the curb. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.300.120), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 8.105.130. - Staging. 
(a)  Where the development is to be constructed in stages, the provisions of this title shall apply to each and every stage. However, public improvements and financial guarantees may be required to extend beyond the boundaries of a stage if such extension is necessary to ensure the relative self-sufficiency of the stage pending completion of the entire development. Such extensions, schedules, and similar arrangements shall be set forth in a written agreement between the developer and the city council prior to the approval of the final plat, if plat approval is required, and if plat approval is not required, prior to issuance of a public improvements permit, or any component thereof. 
(b)  The staging of any development must be based on an overall phasing scheme. Any deviation from the overall plan or a change to any single phase of the plan must be requested in writing and approved by the public improvement official with notification to the planning official. The developer is responsible for the completion of the overall development and for compliance with the intent of this title as it relates to the development. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.300.130), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 8.105.140. - Facility upsizing. 
(a)  City financial assistance may be made available to upsize facilities to serve the development needs of the city. The amount of upsizing assistance shall be based upon city infrastructure planning requirements versus the minimum requirements needed to serve the development. 
(b)  Areas of possible upsizing may be either identified by the city or the developer at the time of submission of the engineering drawings. The developer shall provide information to include a cover letter stating the specifics of the upsizing proposal along with three bids that illustrate the cost of the minimum public improvements required to serve the development versus the cost of the public improvements that the city believes are appropriate, based on city infrastructure planning. Following the evaluation of the proposal by the public improvement official, the planning official and the city manager, an upsizing agreement may be negotiated by the city manager and the developer. After the developer has executed the agreement and returned the originals to the city, the proposal will then be presented to the city council for approval of the city's estimated share of the cost of the upsized facilities and the agreement. Following approval of the agreements by the city council, the engineering drawings shall be reviewed as required by this title, and if approved, the application for a public improvements permit shall be considered. If the public improvement permit is approved by the public improvement official, the required public improvements shall be constructed by the developer. Following acceptance of the improvements by the city, the developer shall submit along with such other documentation as may be required by the city a written request for the final dollar amount of the city's share of the cost of such upsizing. Upon approval of the request, payment shall be made by the city to the developer and shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.300.140), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 8.105.150. - Traffic control during construction. 
    During construction of public improvements, the developer shall maintain the reasonable flow of traffic in streets and access to affected private property at all times. Reasonable notice shall be given to owners of private drives 24 hours before initiation of any construction that might affect private property. The developer shall provide a safe roadway, and shall erect and maintain warning signs, barricades and sufficient safeguards around all excavations, embankments and obstructions. The developer shall provide suitable warning lights or flares and keep them lighted from one-half hour prior to sunset to one-half hour after sunrise and at all other times when visibility is limited. The developer shall further provide such flagman and watchman as required by the city to ensure the protection of the public. The design, placement and maintenance of traffic control devices shall correlate with and so far as possible conform to the system set forth in the most recent edition of the manual on uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways. The developer shall coordinate development with the planning official in order that suitable arrangements are made for detours, parking, access to private property and that all such other necessary arrangements are made. Whenever a street is to be closed or partially closed, the developer shall notify the department and public safety department of the closing and an estimated time when normal service will be resumed. In the event it is determined that the developer is not maintaining a safe roadway, the city may improve the roadway conditions and traffic safety devices at the expense of the developer. In the event that such cost is not reimbursed by the developer to the city, the city may draw such funds from the performance bond submitted by the developer. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.300.150), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 8.105.160. - Indemnity against damages. 
    The developer shall, in conjunction with the issuance of a public improvement permit, or any component thereof, execute an agreement with the city, in a form acceptable to the city counselor, whereby the developer expressly agrees to indemnify and save harmless the city, and its officers and employees against all suit, actions, claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorney's fees) of every kind and nature brought or arising out of or which may be brought or arises out of, or is sustained by any person, firm, or corporation, or persons, firms, or corporations, in connection with or on account of the developer's work or work done for or on behalf of the developer or the property owner with respect to the development for which a public improvement permit or any component thereof has been issued or in consequence of any negligence in connection with the work, or on account of any poor workmanship, or on account of any act of commission or omission of the contractor/developer or their agent or employees, or for any cause arising out of and during the course of construction. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.300.160), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 8.105.170. - Easements and dedications. 
    Approval of the engineering drawings for development that requires that easements and right-of-way be dedicated or conveyed with respect to land outside the project area shall not be granted until such easements and right-of-way dedications have been recorded in the land records of the county and verification of easements and right-of-way dedications have been provided to the city. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.300.170), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 8.105.180. - Improvements to existing facilities. 
    All public improvements required by this title that involve the improvement to or replacement of any existing public improvements, which do not conform to the standards of this title, shall be constructed in accordance with the building and construction ordinance, chapter 115 of this title, and title VII of this Code, technical specifications and design criteria manual, and other applicable provisions of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.300.180), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 8.105.190. - Protest. 
    If a developer considers any work demanded of the developer to be outside the requirements of this title, the developer may, within 48 hours of the determination requiring that such work be done, file a written protest with the public improvement official, stating the objections and reasons therefor. The public improvement official shall respond in writing to the developer's protest within two working days. Unless protests are made in the manner specified and within the time limit stated in this section, the developer waives all rights for protest. A protest shall not entitle the developer to proceed with work pending the resolution of any conflict under this section. 
(Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.300.190), 7-28-1997) 
Sec. 8.105.200. - Violation and penalty. 
(a)  Violation. In case any construction work is performed or land is used in violation of this title, the proper local authorities of the city, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate actions or proceedings to prevent such unlawful construction or land use as may be required to restrain, correct, or abate such violation: to prevent the occupancy of any building, structure, or land; or to prevent any illegal act, business conduct, or use in or about such premises. Failure to obtain the required permit prior to making such improvement shall constitute a violation of this title. Each day of such noncompliance shall constitute a separate violation. 
(b)  Penalty. The owner, contractor, developer or general agent or representative of the owner of any premises where a violation of any provision of this title has been committed or shall exist, or any other person who commits, takes part in, or assists in any such violation or who maintains any premises on which any such violation exists, shall be guilty of a violation of this title, which violation shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $500.00 or not more than 90 days imprisonment, or by both such fine and imprisonment for each and every day the violation shall occur, at the discretion of the court.

CHAPTER 110. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[2] 
Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4.316, adopted July 27, 2015, repealed the former ch. 110 and enacted a new chapter as set out herein. The former ch. 110, §§ 8.110.010-8.110.140, pertained to flood control regulations and derived from Ord. No. 3.621, § 1(33.400.010, 33.400.020, 33.400.040-33.400.150), adopted July 28, 1997. 
Cross reference- Utilities, § 6.100.010 et seq.; zoning and planning, title VII. 

ARTICLE 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSES 

Sec. 8.110.010. - Statutory authorization. 
    The State of Missouri has authorized Cities of Third Class to enact ordinances they deem expedient to preserve the peace and good order and to protect the health of inhabitants in accordance with RSMo 77.260. Floodplain management is deemed necessary in this regard. Therefore, the city council ordains as follows in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
Sec. 8.110.020. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of Gladstone, Missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by: 
(1)  The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and 
(2)  The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
(1)  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Clay County dated August 3, 2015 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
(2)  Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
(3)  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point. 
(4)  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
(5)  Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
Sec. 8.110.030. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in section 8.110.020(a); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 CFR 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this chapter to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
ARTICLE 2. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 8.110.040. - Lands to which chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Gladstone, Missouri identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones, on the flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) for Clay County on map panels 29047C0202E, 29047C0204E, 29047C0206E, 29047C0207E, 29047C0208E, 29047C0209E, and 29047C0212E, dated August 3, 2015 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this chapter, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in article 4. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
Sec. 8.110.050. - Floodplain administrator. 
    The city engineer is hereby designated as the floodplain administrator under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
Sec. 8.110.060. - Compliance. 
    No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
Sec. 8.110.070. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
Sec. 8.110.080. - Interpretation. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
Sec. 8.110.090. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create a liability on the part of the City of Gladstone, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
Sec. 8.110.100. - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
ARTICLE 3. - ADMINISTRATIONS 

Sec. 8.110.110. - Floodplain development permit (required). 
    A floodplain development permit shall be required for all proposed construction or other development, including the placement of manufactured homes, in the areas described in article 2, section 8.110.040.

(1)  The storage or processing of materials within the special flood hazard area that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
(2)  Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods, if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
Sec. 8.110.160. - Specific standards. 
(a)  In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones, where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in article 4, section 8.110.150(b), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial-improvement of any residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above base flood elevation. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial-improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in article 3, section 8.110.130(i). 
(3)  Require, for all new construction and substantial-improvements that fully enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and 
b.  The bottom of all opening shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
Sec. 8.110.230. - Floodplain management variance criteria. 
    In passing upon such applications for variances, the uniform codes board of appeals shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following criteria: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to flood damage; 
(2)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets; and bridges. 
(Ord. No. 4.316, § 2, 7-27-2015) 
Sec. 8.110.240. - Conditions for approving floodplain management variances. 
(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial-improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (b) through (f) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(f)  The city engineer shall notify the applicant in writing that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance and such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this chapter.

(3)  Any improvement to a building. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of reconstruction, alteration, or improvement to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds 50 percent of the current market value of the building. For the purposes of this definition, an improvement occurs when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. This term includes structures, which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work done. 
The term does not apply to: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure;" or 
(3)  Any building that has been damaged from any source or is categorized as repetitive loss. 
(4)  Recommend development of written and adopted policy and procedure.

The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the official map and master plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of land to be served by such streets. Where not shown on the official map or master plan, the arrangement and other design standards of streets shall conform to the provisions found in this article. 
(b)  Relation to adjoining street systems. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provisions or the continuation of the existing streets in adjoining areas. 
(c)  Projection of streets. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the proper projection of streets. 
(d)  Streets to be carried to property lines. When a new subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land susceptible being divided, the new streets shall be carried to the boundaries of the tract proposed to be subdivided. 
(e)  Dead-end streets; culs-de-sac. Dead-end streets or culs-de-sac, designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer than 600 feet and shall be provided with a turnaround at the closed end, such turnaround to have an outside road radius of at least 30 feet and a street property line radius of at least 50 feet. 
(f)  Marginal access streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing arterial street, the commission may require marginal access streets or other such treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(g)  Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
(h)  Street widths. Street widths shall be not less than as follows: 
Street Type Right-Of-Way Width Paving Width Arterial 80 feet 48-63 feet back to back Collector 60 feet 36 feet back to back Minor 50 feet 30 feet back to back Marginal access 50 feet 30 feet back to back  
In front of areas designed and zoned, or where a petition for a change in zoning is contemplated for commercial use, to permit such use, the street width shall be increased by such amount on each side as may be deemed necessary by the commission to ensure the free flow of through traffic without interference by parked vehicles and to provide safe parking space for such commercial or business district. 
(i)  Intersections. The intersection of more than two streets at one point shall be avoided, except where it is impracticable to secure a proper street system otherwise. Streets shall intersect one another at an angle as near a right angle as possible, and no intersections of streets at angles less than 60 degrees shall be approved. Street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of 15 feet measured at the back of curbs when such intersection occurs at right angles. If an intersection occurs at an angle other than a right angle, it shall be rounded with a curve of a radius acceptable to the commission. In business districts, the commission may permit comparable cutoffs or chords. 
(j)  Street deflections. When connecting street lines are deflected from each other at any one point by more than 15 degrees, the street lines shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 100 feet for minor and collector streets and of such greater radii as the commission shall determine for special cases. 
(k)  Reverse curves. A tangent sufficiently long to promote the safe and smooth flow of traffic, generally at least 100 feet, shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
(l)  Subdivision into tracts larger than ordinary building lots. Where a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow the opening of future streets and logical further subdivision. 
(m)  Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited, except under conditions approved by the planning commission.

Where a subdivision borders on a limited access highway right-of-way, the commission may require such subdivision to have a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(p)  Half street prohibited. Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations and where the commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. 
(q)  Street names and numbers. Names of new streets shall not duplicate existing or platted street names, unless a new street is a continuation of, or in alignment with, the existing or platted street. House numbers shall be assigned in accordance with the house numbering system now in effect in the city. 
(r)  Vacation of streets. The planning commission shall not recommend the vacation of any street or part of a street dedicated for public use, if such vacation interferes with the uniformity of the existing street pattern or any future plans prepared for the area. 
(s)  Private streets. Private streets shall not be approved, nor shall public improvements be approved for any private street. 
(t)  Hardship to owners of adjoining property avoided. The street arrangements shall not be such as to cause hardship to the owner so adjoining property in platting such owner's own land and providing convenient access to it.

Sec. 8.115.260. - Public sites and open spaces. 
(a)  Generally. A subdivider shall dedicate reasonably adequate open spaces necessary or public uses indicated on the city plan. Such spaces shall be determined initially by the planning commission, following a conference or hearing at which the subdivider shall be present; shall be consistent with the public health, safety, morals and welfare; and shall not be required to exceed 71/2 percent of the overall area proposed for subdividing; provided that a preliminary proposal may be made by the subdivider (or applicant for a plat) to the planning commission, which shall demonstrate, generally, what land the subdivider proposes to dedicate, or, in lieu thereof, the subdivider may indicate the subdivider's agreement to paying the sum prescribed by subsection (c) of this section, without recourse or right of recovery. Final determination as to dedication of land, including selection thereof or acceptance of money, if offered (which acceptance shall not be mandatory, the city having the right to require land) shall be by the council. 
(b)  Dedication. Any dedication shall be by deed or plat and subject to council approval. Such land shall be reasonably located within the subdivision and shall be a single tract. The city may, in a proper case, agree (on terms acceptable to the council) to reimburse the subdivider for improvements abutting on dedicated land on a cost basis. 
(c)  Special park and playground fund. In those instances in which the subdivider elects to contribute money and no dedication is required, the subdivider shall pay to the city the sum of $50.00 per lot or $200.00 per acre, whichever is the lesser, for each lot or acre in the subdivision. A subdivider shall elect to pay, either on a lot or acreage basis, for the entire subdivision, and fractional acres shall be prorated if payment on an acre basis is elected. Sums so received shall be placed in a special fund to be known as the "special park and playground fund" and shall be used by the city for the purchase of or in connection with maintaining or improving city parks or playgrounds (so as to benefit such subdivisions). The subdivider shall pay such sums before the final plat is approved, or the city may agree to an installment method of payment based on the sale of lots; provided that the city building inspector shall not issue a building permit for any lot in a new subdivision until the $50.00 per lot or $200.00 per acre upon which the lot in question is located has been paid. 
(d)  Drainage easements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided utility easements and drainage rights-of-way, conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourses or drainage rights-of-way, including future expansion reasonably anticipated.

If the members representing school districts and other taxing districts are appointed for a term coinciding with the length of time a redevelopment project, plan or area is approved, such term shall terminate upon final approval of the project, plan or designation of the area by the city council. Thereafter the commission shall consist of the six members appointed by the city, except that members representing school boards and other taxing districts shall be appointed as provided in this section prior to any amendments to any redevelopment plans, redevelopment projects or designation of a redevelopment area. If any school district or other taxing jurisdiction fails to appoint members of the commission within 30 days of receipt of written notice of a proposed redevelopment plan, redevelopment project or designation of a redevelopment area, the remaining members may proceed to exercise the power of the commission. Of the members first appointed by the city, two shall be designated to serve for terms of two years, two shall be designated to serve for a term of three years, and two shall be designated to serve for a term of four years from the date of such initial appointments.

The city may, in the ordinance or resolution, pledge all or any part of the funds in and to be deposited in the special allocation fund created pursuant to sections 8.125.070 and 8.125.080 to the payment of the redevelopment costs and obligations. Any pledge of funds in the special allocation fund may provide for distribution to the taxing districts of moneys not required for payment of redevelopment costs or obligations and such excess funds shall be deemed to be surplus funds. In the event the city only pledges a portion of the funds in the special allocation fund for the payment of redevelopment costs or obligations, any such funds remaining in the special allocation fund after complying with the requirements of the pledge, including the retention of funds for the payment of future redevelopment costs, if so required, shall also be deemed surplus funds.

(b)  Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the city may, in addition to obligations secured by the special allocation fund, pledge any part or any combination of net new revenues of any redevelopment project, or a mortgage on part or all of the redevelopment project to secure its obligations or other redevelopment costs.

No referendum approval of the electors shall be required as a condition to the issuance of obligations pursuant to this chapter. 
(d)  The ordinance authorizing the issuance of obligations may provide that the obligations shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to RSMo 99.800-99.865, which recital shall be conclusive evidence of their validity and of the regularity of their issuance. 
(e)  Neither the city, its city council, its duly authorized commission, the commissioners or the officers of the city nor any person executing any obligation shall be personally liable for such obligation by reason of the issuance thereof. The obligations issued pursuant to this chapter shall not be a general obligation of the city, county, state, or any political subdivision thereof, nor in any event shall such obligation be payable out of any funds or properties other than those specifically pledged as security therefor. The obligations shall not constitute indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional, statutory or charter debt limitation or restriction.

(a)  The city, at the time a redevelopment project is approved may adopt tax increment allocation financing by passing an ordinance providing that after the total equalized assessed valuation of the taxable real property in a redevelopment project exceeds the certified total initial equalized assessed valuation of the taxable real property in the redevelopment project, the ad valorem taxes, and payments in lieu of taxes, if any, arising from the levies upon taxable real property in such redevelopment project by taxing districts and tax rates determined in the manner provided in subsection 8.125.090(b) each year after the effective date of the ordinance until redevelopment costs have been paid shall be divided as follows: 
(1)  That portion of taxes, penalties and interest levied upon each taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property which is attributable to the initial equalized assessed value of each such taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property in the area selected for the redevelopment project shall be allocated to and, when collected, shall be paid by the county collector to the respective affected taxing districts in the manner required by law in the absence of the adoption of tax increment allocation financing; 
(2)  a.  Payments in lieu of taxes attributable to the increase in the current equalized assessed valuation of each taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property in the area selected for the redevelopment project and any applicable penalty and interest over and above the initial equalized assessed value of each such unit of property in the area selected for the redevelopment project shall be allocated to and, when collected, shall be paid to the city treasurer who shall deposit such payment in lieu of taxes into a special fund called the "special allocation fund" of the city for the purpose of paying redevelopment costs and obligations incurred in the payment thereof. Payments in lieu of taxes which are due and owing shall constitute a lien against the real estate of the redevelopment project from which they are derived and shall be collected in the same manner as the real property tax, including the assessment of penalties and interest where applicable. The city may, in the ordinance, pledge the funds in the special allocation fund for the payment of such costs and obligations and provide for the collection of payments in lieu of taxes, the lien of which may be foreclosed in the same manner as a special assessment lien as provided in RSMo 88.861. No part of the current equalized assessed valuation of each lot, block, tract, or parcel of property in the area selected for the redevelopment project attributable to any increase above the total initial equalized assessed value of such properties shall be used in calculating the general state school aid formula provided for in RSMo 163.031 until such time as all redevelopment costs have been paid as provided for in this section and section 8.125.080;

No. 4.364 , § 5, 8-22-2016, amended § 9.200.060 of ch. 200. 

Secs. 9.200.010-9.200.090. - Reserved. 
CHAPTER 300. - CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL 

Sec. 9.300.010. - General provisions. 
(a)  Scope. The provisions of this chapter are to protect the public water supply from introduction of contaminants or pollutants, by containing within the consumer's internal distribution system contaminants which could backflow into the public water supply system. 
(b)  Intent. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of the public water system. 
(Ord. No. 3.947, § 2(34.300.010), 2-14-2005) 
Sec. 9.300.020. - Applicability. 
(a)  This chapter shall apply to all buildings or premises served by the public water system of the city. 
(b)  Exceptions: 
(1)  This chapter does not apply to buildings or premises used solely for residential purposes unless a cross connection is specifically identified or this chapter indicates otherwise. 
(2)  The state department of natural resources (DNR) may issue an exemption from the requirements of this chapter if the customer can demonstrate to DNR and the city that the activities taking place at the customer's facility and the materials used in connection with these activities or stored on the premises cannot endanger the health of customers or degrade the water quality of the public water system should backflow occur, or that any potential risk posed by these materials or activities is isolated from the public water system. Those customers granted an exemption in accordance with this subsection (2) shall report to the city any proposed changes in process, plumbing or materials used or stored at the exempted facility at least 14 days prior to making the change. Any exemption granted under this subsection (2) shall be void if DNR or the city determines that the customer facility has become an actual or potential backflow hazard, or if the customer fails to provide notice at least 14 days prior to making changes in process, plumbing or materials used or stored at the facility. 
(Ord. No. 3.947, § 2(34.300.020), 2-14-2005) 
Sec. 9.300.030. - Policy. 
    This chapter shall apply to all matters affecting or relating to backflow. Where, in any specific case, different sections of this chapter specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where this chapter conflicts with adopted codes of the city, this chapter and its sections shall govern. This chapter will be reasonably interpreted by the city manager. It is the city manager's intent to recognize the varying degrees of hazards and to apply the principle that the degree of protection shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard. The city manager shall be primarily responsible for the containment of contaminants or pollutants that may backflow into the public water distribution system. The cooperation of the consumers is required to implement and maintain the program to control cross connections. The city manager and consumers are jointly responsible for preventing contamination of the public water system. If, in the judgment of the city manager, cross connection protection is required through either piping modification or installation of an approved backflow assembly, due notice shall be given to the consumer. The consumer shall, within 60 days of written notice by the city, comply by providing the required protection at the consumer's own expense; failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the consumer to provide such protection shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the building and/or premises until such protection has been provided.

(Ord. No. 3.947, § 2(34.1600.130), 2-14-2005) 
Sec. 9.1600.140. - Political signs. 
(a)  Generally. Political signs may be erected and maintained in the city in accordance with the provisions contained in this chapter. 
(b)  Location. Political ground signs not exceeding 26 inches (660 mm) by 26 inches (660 mm) on each side may be erected on public property designated by the election authority as a polling place for an election during the 12 hours prior to the opening of the polls, during the time the polls are open, and during the 15 hours after the polls have closed. 
(c)  Restriction of political signs within residential zones. Political signs located in an area zoned for residential use shall not exceed 26 inches (660 mm) by 26 inches (660 mm) on each side. In residential areas, the exposed political sign face shall not exceed an aggregate gross surface area of 64 square feet (5.95 m 2 ) per lot. 
(d)  Restriction of political signs within commercial and industrial zones. Political signs located in an area zoned for commercial or industrial use shall not exceed 32 square feet (2.97 m 2 ) in total and shall not have any side greater than eight linear feet (2,438 mm). In commercial and industrial zoned areas, the exposed political sign face shall not exceed an aggregate gross surface area of 512 square feet (47.56 m 2 ) per lot. 
(e)  Responsibility for removal. The owner or occupier of the property upon which any political sign is erected, placed, or located shall be responsible for the removal of such sign within the time required by this chapter. 
(f)  Exceptions. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to notices posted by order of any court or to notices to the public required by law to be posted in public places. 
(g)  Legislative purpose and intent. The city council makes the following findings of legislative purposes and intent: 
(1)  That the expression of political speech is an important and constitutionally protected right. 
(2)  That, under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to restrict or regulate the time, place and manner of the expression of such speech in order to advance and protect other significant legitimate interests of local government. 
(3)  That political signs have certain characteristics that distinguish them from many of the other types of signs permitted and regulated by the city. These characteristics include the fact that many of such signs, intended to be temporary in nature, do not meet the regular structural and installation requirements necessary to prevent them from being affected by weather and other natural forces and presenting a potential hazard to persons and property. Severe weather conditions, including, without limitation, thunderstorms with accompanying high winds, tornados, ice accumulation and flooding, are characteristic of local weather conditions. With respect to the temporary nature of such signs, the durational and illumination regulations provide a channel of communication on an election candidate or issue balancing the aesthetic and public health and safety concerns surrounding temporary structures. 
(4)  That the primary purpose of political signs placed along a roadway is to attract the attention of drivers and distract them from their primary responsibility of constant attention to traffic and road conditions. This concern is especially acute in residential areas where young children present a significant potential hazard for drivers. With respect to residential areas, with their lower speed limits, it is concluded that political signs not exceeding 26 inches (660 mm) by 26 inches (660 mm) on each side with no more than an aggregate sign surface area of 64 square feet (5.95 m 2 ) per lot is adequate to convey most political messages. Although it is recognized that certain individuals may wish to express political thoughts that require a larger area to adequately convey them, a greater number of or larger and more complex messages would further distract drivers' attention, presenting an unacceptable safety risk, and there exists in the community adequate other means for conveying such message. In nonresidential areas, motorists frequently see and reasonably expect to see larger signs, so their attention is not as easily distracted, and higher speed limits, larger lot areas, and a larger size sign can be allowed consistent with safety requirements. Further, since permitted signage in residential areas is minimal, the aesthetic impact of signs in residential areas is much greater than in nonresidential areas. 
(5)  That in addition to the safety and traffic interests affected by political signs, the city council concludes that the unrestricted proliferation of political signs would create visual clutter, have an adverse effect on the aesthetic quality of the city, with accompanying adverse economic effects, and detract from the desirable visual environment that the city has made a strong effort to create through its land use regulations. 
(6)  That the city council concludes that the interests to be protected by this regulation are sufficiently substantial to justify the content-neutral regulation of political speech represented by this section, and that this section represents a reasonable accommodation of the city's interest with First Amendment rights.

b.  External lighting, such as floodlights, thin line and gooseneck reflectors, are permitted, provided the light source is directed upon the face of the billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device and is effectively shielded so as to prevent beams or rays of light from being directed into any portion of the main traveled way on interstate or federal-aid primary highway and the lights are not of such intensity so as to cause glare, impair the vision of the driver of a motor vehicle, or otherwise interfere with a driver's operation of a motor vehicle. 
c.  No billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall be so illuminated that it interferes with the effectiveness of, or obscures, an official traffic sign, device, or signal. 
d.  No billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall be so illuminated that the illumination is directed toward any residential area. 
e.  The maximum average lighting intensity level for such billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall be 20 footcandles (220 lux) at the light source. 
(2)  Size, height, and area of billboards. 
a.  The maximum area for any one billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall be 600 square feet (55.74 m 2 ) with a maximum width of 30 feet (9,144 mm) and a maximum length of 60 feet (18,288 mm), inclusive of border and trim but excluding the base or apron, supports, and other structural members. 
b.  The maximum size limitations shall apply to each side of a billboard or other structure, and billboards may be placed back to back, double faced, or in V-type construction with not more than two displays to each facing, but sign structure shall be considered as one billboard.

b.  No billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall be erected within 500 feet (152,400 mm) of an existing billboard on the same side of the highway on any highway in the primary systems as defined herein. 
c.  No billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall be located in such a manner as to obstruct or otherwise physically interfere with the effectiveness of any official traffic sign, signal, or device or obstruct or physically interfere with a motor vehicle operator's view of approaching, merging, or intersecting traffic. 
d.  The measurement in this section shall be minimum distances between billboard or other outdoor advertising structures measured along the nearest edge of the pavement between points directly opposite the billboard or structure along each side of the highway and shall apply only to billboards or structures located on the same side of the highway involved. Directional and official signs shall not be counted nor shall measurements be made from such signs for the purpose of determining compliance with these spacing requirements. 
e.  Billboards or other off-premises outdoor advertising devices shall be oriented toward traffic on the interstate or primary highway. 
(4)  Setbacks, safety clearances and height. 
a.  In order to provide a safety zone to prevent injury or property damage from collapse of a billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device caused by act of God or other causes, each billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall have minimum setbacks of the following: 
1.  At least 90 feet (27,432 mm) from the nearest edge to the right-of-way of any federal or state-designated routes; and 
2.  At least 90 feet (27,432 mm) from all property lines and from all roofed structures, from all points of the billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device. 
b.  In order to further provide a safety zone to prevent injury or property damage from collapse of a billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device caused by acts of God or other causes, each billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall have a maximum height, measured from the ground to the bottom of sign face of such structure, of 35 feet (10,668 mm). In addition, the applicant for permit shall present documentation to the reasonable satisfaction of the building official that the applicant has secured the legally enforceable right to prevent the erection of other structures within the setback zones. No city building permit shall be issued for construction of any building within the setback/clearance zone for any billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device. 
c.  No billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall be located adjacent to or within 500 feet (152,400 mm) of any interchange, intersection at grade, safety rest area, or bridge approach.

d.  No billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall be located within 500 feet (152,400 mm) of land zoned for residential or utilized for public activity purposes. No billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall be located within 500 feet (152,400 mm) from any residential structure, church, school, park, or historical site or historical district designated by the federal, state, or city government. 
e.  No billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device shall be located within 100 feet (30,480 mm) from any on-premises freestanding sign. 
(b)  Landscaping, lighting, and fencing. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall receive approval for a plan for landscaping, lighting and fencing around the proposed billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device to ensure that the structure will be aesthetically compatible with its surroundings and aesthetic standards of the community and neighboring property, insofar as may be practicable, as well as safe and secure from trespassers or vandals. Such plans shall be reviewed and approved by the building official. In determining whether the landscaping plan is reasonably suitable, the building official shall take into consideration the nature of the location, the impact on the surrounding properties, the safety and security of the proposed structure, and the relative cost of the landscaping, lighting and fencing to the applicant in relationship to the overall impact upon the property values in the immediate area which would be caused by a lack of such landscaping, lighting and fencing for the proposed structure. 
(c)  Nuisances. Any billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device which, because of lack of maintenance, upkeep, vandalism, accumulation of litter, refuse or debris, or the deterioration of landscaping, lighting, or fencing, becomes unsightly or unsafe is hereby declared to be a nuisance and shall be subject to abatement by the city in the same manner as all other nuisances on private property. 
(d)  Service drives. Direct access to a billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device from curb cuts along a state highway or service road shall be prohibited. Direct access shall be gained through paved roads and drives which are private and internal to a lot or parcel. All vehicles, equipment, and people used to build, service, maintain and repair such signs must confine their activity so as not to interfere with pedestrian or vehicular traffic on public roads. 
(e)  Legal nonconforming billboards. Any billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device which was lawfully erected or affixed prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and which complied with all regulations in force at the time it was erected or affixed, but which fails to conform to all applicable regulations and restrictions of this chapter, shall be considered a legal nonconforming billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device. A legal nonconforming billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device may be continued and shall be maintained in good condition, but shall not be: 
(1)  Structurally altered so as to prolong the life of the sign; 
(2)  Altered so as to increase the degree of nonconformity of the sign; 
(3)  Expanded; or 
(4)  Reestablished after damage or destruction if the estimated cost of reconstruction exceeds 50 percent of the appraised replacement costs at the time of such damage occurred. 
(f)  Abandoned billboards. Where a billboard structure or other off-premises outdoor advertising device does not include advertising information other than for the use of the billboard for a period of 180 continuous days, such billboard structure shall be deemed abandoned and shall be removed. 
(g)  Permits. The city shall not issue a permit for any new billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device unless the following conditions have been met: 
(1)  Issued a permit from the state department of transportation; 
(2)  The applicant shall submit the following surveys: 
a.  A certified boundary survey of the site showing location of the billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device and its setback/clearance zone; and 
b.  A survey to indicate the relative vertical and horizontal distances between the proposed structure and all other pole-mounted signs within 750 feet (228,600 mm). If, by reason of height, size, or spacing, the proposed structure creates a significant disharmony with pole-mounted signs within 750 feet (228,600 mm), or unreasonably detracts from the visibility of other neighboring signs or properties, the building official may require reasonable modification of the dimensions of the billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device to cure such deficiencies as a condition to granting a permit; and 
(3)  The city shall charge a sign permit fee, in accordance with the "Schedule of Fees and Charges" as amended, to ensure compliance with the city's wind load and electrical requirements when the billboard or other off-premises outdoor advertising device is first erected, but shall not charge any subsequent permit or inspection fee for such structure.

(g)  Those that have wracked, warped, buckled, or settled to such an extent that walls or other structural portions have materially less resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in the case of similar new construction. 
(h)  Those that, because of dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; faulty construction; the removal, movement or instability of any portion of the ground necessary for the purpose of supporting such building; the deterioration, decay or inadequacy of its foundation; or any other cause, are likely to partially or completely collapse. 
(i)  Those that are, for any reason, so unsafe, unsanitary, or dangerous so that they threaten the health, safety, or general welfare of the occupants or the general public.

(k)  Those that, exclusive of the foundation, show 33 percent or more damage or deterioration of the supporting member(s), or 50 percent damage or deterioration of the non-supporting members, enclosing or outside walls or coverings. 
(l)  Those that have been so damaged by fire, wind, earthquake, or flood, or which have become so dilapidated or deteriorated as to become an attractive nuisance to children; a harbor for vagrants, criminals, or immoral persons; or as to enable persons to resort thereto for the purpose of committing unlawful or immoral acts. 
(m)  Those that have been constructed, or which exist or are maintained in violation of any specific requirement or prohibition applicable thereto provided by the building regulations of this jurisdiction, as specified in the building code, or any law or ordinance of this state of jurisdiction relating to the condition, location, or structure of buildings.

(o)  Those that because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, air or sanitation facilities, or otherwise, are unsanitary, unfit for human habitation, or in such a condition that is likely to cause sickness or disease, so as to threaten the health, safety, or welfare of those occupying (or who may occupy) such building or structure. 
(p)  Those that, because of obsolescence, dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of sufficient fire-resistive construction, faulty electrical wiring, gas connections to heating apparatus, or other cause, are determined by the fire marshal to be a fire hazard. 
(q)  Those that are in such a condition as to constitute a public nuisance known to the common law or in equity jurisprudence. 
(r)  Those where any portion thereof remains on a site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or whenever any building structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six months so as to constitute such building or portion thereof an attractive nuisance or hazard to the public. 
(2)  The above listed conditions are hereby deemed detrimental to the health, safety, and/or welfare of the city's residents, the existence of which constitutes a nuisance. However, for purposes of this code, the requirements of those housing, fire, building, or other codes, or ordinances, which are adopted by the city, together with state and/or federal requirements, shall be deemed to be competent evidence of compliance [or] noncompliance with the provisions of this code.

Such search warrant may be executed and returned only within ten days after the date of its issuance. The person authorized to conduct the search under the warrant shall make a return promptly after concluding the search, and such return shall contain an itemization of all violations of this chapter discovered pursuant to such search. Refusal to allow entry upon presentation of a search warrant shall be an ordinance violation. Forcible entry may be permitted when authorized by the search warrant.

Provided that any person so notified, shall have the privilege of either vacating and repairing said building or structure (if such repair will comply with the ordinances of the city) or may vacate and demolish said dangerous building, at his own risk to prevent the city from acquiring a lien against the land where the dangerous building stands. If the evidence does not support a finding that the building or structure is a dangerous building, no order shall be issued. 
(5)  The written order of abatement from the building commission shall be delivered, by person or mail, to each party of the hearing, or the attorney of record. The order shall state a reasonable time, to be no less than 30 days from the date of issuance, within which to comply with the order, and shall further provide that if the work is not substantially completed within 30 days of the issuance of the order, the city may, by its own employees or by contractor, perform the work necessary to bring the building into compliance with the order of abatement, with cost levied to the property owner, or by a lien placed upon the property. 
(6)  If the city performs or contracts for abatement pursuant to subsection (5), the cost of such abatement and other associated costs shall be certified to the city clerk, who shall cause a special tax bill or special assessment against the property to be prepared and collected by the city collector or other official collecting taxes, unless the building or structure is demolished, secured or repaired by a contractor pursuant to an order issued by the city and such contractor files a mechanic's lien against the property where the dangerous building is located. The contractor may enforce this lien as provided in RSMo 429.010 to 429.360. At the request of the taxpayer, the tax bill may be paid in installments over a period of not more than ten years. The tax bill from its issuance shall be deemed a personal debt against the property owner and shall also be a lien on the property until paid.
