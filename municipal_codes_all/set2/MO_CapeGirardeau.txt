PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Cape Girardeau. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1967 Code, as supplemented through June 15, 1987, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1967 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Ronald McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Warren L. Wells, City Attorney, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
PREAMBLE FOR THE CITY CHARTER 
    The citizens of Cape Girardeau expect public officials and city employees to exhibit the ideals of ethical behavior through adherence to the highest possible standards of ethical conduct. The appropriate behavior toward ethics includes a positive, optimistic, and enthusiastic attitude toward public service and the characteristics of fairness, objectivity and equality shown to the people. Public service has its grounding in the moral background and education of its public officials and employees. Ethical behavior includes a deep commitment to the ideals of honesty and integrity. Furthermore, public officials are expected to avoid conflicts of interest and the potential of conflicts between self-interest and the public interest. The primary function of this government is to serve the best interest of its citizens.

(1)  No person shall dispose of refuse by open burning, or cause, suffer, allow or permit open burning of refuse. 
(2)  In areas where no public or commercial refuse collection service is available on the effective date of this chapter, the open burning of refuse on residential premises, of refuse originating in dwelling units on the same premises, shall not be in violation of this chapter until such refuse collection service becomes available or until three (3) years from the effective date of this chapter, whichever is sooner. 
(3)  Regardless of provisions of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, open burning on residential premises of refuse originating in dwelling units on the same premises shall not be a violation of this section in areas of low population density. The fire chief or his designee, after consultation with public agencies concerned with refuse collection and disposal, shall select and publish the specific boundaries of areas in which such open burning of refuse will not be in violation of this section. In selecting such areas, he shall use a density of one hundred (100) dwelling units or less per square mile as an approximate definition of areas of low population density and he shall give due consideration to the desirability of having restrictive air pollution control regulations within the conterminous area comprising the city area air pollution basin. The fire chief or his designee shall select and publish revised boundaries, as described above, from time to time as population density changes. 
(4)  Any open burning of refuse permitted by subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section shall be permitted only between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. 
(b)  Prohibition of salvage operations by open burning. No person shall conduct or cause or permit the conduct of a salvage operation by open burning. 
(c)  Designation of "no burn" days. The fire chief or his designee is hereby authorized to designate individual days as "no burn" days for all open burning within the city. On days designated as "no burn" days, all open burning is prohibited, except cooking fires and any fires specifically permitted by the fire chief or his designee. On all other days, open burning shall be allowed, subject to any applicable restrictions contained in the City Code. The designation of "no burn" days shall be subject to the discretion of the fire chief or his designee, but shall be based upon one (1) or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  Atmospheric conditions that prevent smoke from rising freely; 
(2)  When excessively dry conditions exist; 
(3)  Sustained winds greater than fifteen (15) miles per hour; or 
(4)  Frequent wind gusts greater than twenty-five (25) miles per hour. 
(d)  Restriction on open burning of tree leaves and yard waste. The open burning of leaves and yard waste, as defined in section 22-26 of the City Code, shall be allowed, but only between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., unless otherwise authorized by the fire chief or his designee.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSES 

Sec. 12-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in RSMo § 82.010 and RSMo § 82.020 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the city council of the City of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, ordains as follows. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by: 
(1)  The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and 
(2)  The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(c)  Methods used to analyze flood hazards. The flood insurance study (FIS) that is the basis of this ordinance use standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps. 
(1)  Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one-percent chance of occurrence in any one (1) year as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's FIS, and illustrative materials for Cape Girardeau County dated January 20, 2016 as amended, and any future revisions thereto. 
(2)  Calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood. 
(3)  Computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one (1) foot at any point. 
(4)  Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height. 
(5)  Delineation of flood fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11; Ord. No. 4772, art. 1, 10-5-15) 
Sec. 12-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in article I, section 12-2(1); to establish or maintain the city's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(d) by applying the provisions of this chapter to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
ARTICLE II. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 12-4. - Lands to which chapter applies. 
    This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Cape Girardeau, Missouri identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones, on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) for Cape Girardeau County on map panels 29031C0163E, 29031C0175E, 29031C0251E, 29031C0252E, 29031C0253E, 29031C0254E, 29031C0256E, 29031C0258E, 29031C0261E, 29031C0262E, 29031C0263E, 29031C0264E, 29031C0266E, 29031C0268E, 29031C0269E, 29031C0278E, 29031C0352E, 29031C0355E, 29031C0356E, dated September 29, 2011 and on map panels 29031C0259F and 29031C0267F, dated January 20, 2016, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this ordinance, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in article IV. 
(Ord. No. 4772, art. 2, 10-5-15) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4772, art. 2, adopted Oct. 5, 2015, repealed the former § 12-4, and enacted a new section as set out herein. The former § 12-4 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 4254, art. 7, adopted Aug. 15, 2011. 
Sec. 12-5. - Floodplain administrator. 
    The city manager or his designee is hereby designated as the floodplain administrator under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-6. - Compliance. 
    No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this city shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-7. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-8. - Interpretation. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-9. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create a liability on the part of the City of Cape Girardeau, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-10. - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
ARTICLE IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 12-15. - General standards. 
(1)  No permit for floodplain development shall be granted for new construction, substantial improvements, and other improvements, including the placement of manufactured homes, within any numbered or unnumbered A zones and AE zones, unless the conditions of this section are satisfied. 
(2)  All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation of the 100-year flood; however, the base flood elevation is not provided. Development within unnumbered A zones is subject to all provisions of this chapter. If flood insurance study data is not available, the city shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources. 
(3)  Until a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, including fill, shall be permitted within any numbered A zone or AE zone on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the city. 
(4)  All new construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvements, prefabricated structures, placement of manufactured homes, and other developments shall require: 
(a)  Design or adequate anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;

(5)  Storage, material, and equipment. 
(a)  The storage or processing of materials within the special flood hazard area that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
(b)  Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods, if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning. 
(6)  Agricultural structures. Structures used solely for agricultural purposes in connection with the production, harvesting, storage, drying, or raising of agricultural commodities, including the raising of livestock, may be constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed provided there is no human habitation or occupancy of the structure; the structure is of single-wall design; there is no permanent retail, wholesale, or manufacturing use included in the structure; a variance has been granted from the floodplain management requirements of this chapter; and a floodplain development permit has been issued. 
(7)  Accessory structures. Structures used solely for parking and limited storage purposes, not attached to any other structure on the site, of limited investment value, and not larger than four hundred (400) square feet, may be constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed provided there is no human habitation or occupancy of the structure; the structure is of single-wall design; a variance has been granted from the standard floodplain management requirements of this chapter; and a floodplain development permit has been issued. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-16. - Specific standards. 
(1)  In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A zones and AE zones, where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in article IV, section 12-15(2), the following provisions are required: 
(a)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial-improvement of any residential structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above base flood elevation. 
(b)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in article III, section 12-13(9). 
(c)  Require, for all new construction and substantial-improvements, that fully enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
1.  A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

Sec. 12-18. - Floodway. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in article II, section 12-4 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  The city shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point. 
(2)  The city shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the city during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  If article IV, section 12-18(2) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV. 
(4)  In unnumbered A zones, the city shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources as set forth in article IV, section 12-15(2).

(c)  Meet the permitting, elevation, and the anchoring requirements for manufactured homes of this chapter. 
*  A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
ARTICLE V. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT VARIANCE PROCEDURES 

Sec. 12-20. - Establishment of appeal board. 
    The board of adjustment as established by the City of Cape Girardeau shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the floodplain management requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-21. - Responsibility of appeal board. 
    Where an application for a floodplain development permit or request for a variance from the floodplain management regulations is denied by the city manager or his designee, the applicant may apply for such floodplain development permit or variance directly to the board of adjustment, as defined in article V, section 12-20. 
    The board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the city manager or his designee in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-22. - Further appeals. 
    Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the circuit court of Cape Girardeau County as provided in RSMo § 89.110. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-23. - Floodplain management variance criteria. 
    In passing upon such applications for variances, the board of adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following criteria: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to flood damage; 
(2)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the city; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets; and bridges. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-24. - Conditions for approving floodplain management variances. 
(1)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial-improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (2) through (6) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half-acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(2)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the state inventory of historic places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
(3)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(5)  Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(6)  The city shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a city official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4254, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 12-25. - Conditions for approving variances for agricultural structures. 
    Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in article V, sections 12-23 and 12-24 of this chapter. 
    In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.

Furthermore, the order will require that if the property is ordered closed, the property owner shall submit a plan of action intended to prevent the property from being a criminal nuisance property after the period of closure expires, as further described in section (e)(1) below. The order shall also state that any costs incurred by the city in order to uphold and enforce this order, including closure of the property, will be specially assessed and shall be deemed both a personal debt against the owner as well as a lien on the property until paid. 
(5)  The order shall be mailed to the property owner, occupants known to the city, and mortgagees of record of the property. The order shall be posted on the property after the issuance of the decision.

It shall be unlawful for a landlord or any person acting as an agent for the landlord, to intimidate or actively discourage a tenant and/or persons associated with a premises. It shall be presumed that any attempt to increase charges, reduce services, or to otherwise harass or retaliate against the tenant during the twelve-month period following receipt of the complaint by the city constitutes unlawful retaliation under this subsection. Such presumption shall be rebutted by the preponderance of evidence that the actions taken by the landlord were based upon good cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tenant's lease agreement or periodic tenancy may be terminated for a failure to pay rent; committing an activity defined under subsection (b) of this section; for the commission of waste upon the premises; or for violating the terms and conditions of the lease agreement or periodic tenancy. A landlord's failure to renew a lease agreement or periodic tenancy upon expiration of such lease agreement or periodic tenancy shall not be deemed a violation of this subsection.

(1)  A stormwater management system shall be provided for protecting lots, roads, streets and buildings in the project area from the potential adverse impacts of stormwater runoff. Streets, blocks, depths of lots, parks and other public grounds, and ultimate land usage shall be determined, located and laid out in such a manner as to reduce the velocity of overland flow and allow the maximum opportunity for infiltration of stormwaters into the ground, and to preserve and utilize natural streams, channels and detention basins, and wherever possible, to include streams and floodplains within parks or other public grounds. The elements of the stormwater management plan should protect area waterways from pollutants carried by the stormwater runoff. 
(2)  The maximum allowable release rate of stormwater after development shall be as follows: 
(a)  The rate shall not exceed the before-development rate for a ten-year frequency storm of 30-minute duration. 
(b)  The twenty-five-year storm shall have the release rate of a ten-year frequency storm of 30-minute duration. 
(c)  The total drainage area must be used in calculating the allowable release rate. The required storage volume will be based on the project area only, with extraneous flows from upland areas being pass-through flow or discharged via overflow spillway or other devices. 
(d)  The runoff from a one-inch rain event shall be managed for water quality improvement by means of filtration and flow control. Details for this stormwater management element are located in the City of Cape Girardeau's Standard Specifications and Drawings. 
(3)  The increased stormwater runoff resulting from the proposed development shall be detained on-site by appropriate detention basins or by other acceptable techniques. The minimum volume of storage shall be sufficient to store the volume of the difference between ten-year 30-minute storm under undeveloped conditions and the twenty-five-year 30-minute storm under developed conditions. Control devices shall limit the discharge from storage to a rate no greater than that prescribed by this chapter. Downstream property, watercourses, channels or conduits shall not receive stormwater runoff from proposed development at a higher peak flow rate than that which existed prior to the development. Detention/retention areas should at a minimum filter the stormwater runoff. When possible, filtration and/or infiltration practices should be incorporated into the site design. 
(a)  Where a development site has more than one (1) watershed, the runoff water shall be controlled within each watershed. Exemption from this requirement must be approved by the city manager or his designee. With a request for this exemption, the developer will be required to present information and/or documentation establishing conclusively that no adverse impacts would occur to adjoining or downstream properties from uncontrolled runoff in a particular watershed area of the development site. 
(4)  Generally acceptable locations of the stormwater runoff channels in the design of the project area may include the following: 
(a)  In a depressed median of a double roadway, street or parkway, provided the median is wide enough to permit required roadway shoulders. 
(b)  Centered on the rear lot lines in a block, or entirely within the rear yards of a single row of lots or parcels, provided that in either case the lots are deep enough to permit side slopes in the runoff channel and a building site of the elevation required by other sections of this chapter. 
(c)  In a depressed area along roadway, street or parkway, provided the area is wide enough to permit side slopes as required in other sections of this chapter. 
(d)  Landscaped areas may be designed for use as part of the stormwater management system. 
(e)  Alternative systems such as curb and gutter and storm sewers that discharge into an appropriate detention basin may be incorporated into the stormwater management plan. 
(f)  The smaller, uppermost reaches of drainage channels and swales forming the natural drainage system near a watershed divide may be relocated or eliminated and incorporated into the planned system of storm sewers and open channels designed consistent with the requirements of this chapter. 
(5)  A continuous easement may be provided abutting rear lot lines as shown in the stormwater management plan within which utility lines and open drainage facilities may be located and maintained, but on which no accessory buildings may be constructed. The utility drainage easement shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide. Within the area so designed for the passage or storage of waters, no structure may be erected, no fences, shrubbery or trees planted, or changes made to the prescribed grades and contours of the specified floodwater or stormwater runoff channels. 
(6)  All storm sewer outfalls shall be so designed, by reason of elevation of the invert, by a flap gate or by other features, that when the receiving stream is in full flood, the storm sewers will continue to drain the areas they are designed to serve unless the provision is made for sewer backups into planned storage locations. 
(7)  All sanitary sewer manholes constructed in a floodplain, in a street designed for detention, or in an area designed for the storage or passage of floodwater or stormwater, shall be provided with either a watertight bolted manhole cover, a watertight concealed pick-hole cover, or be constructed with a rim elevation at or above the high water elevation of the 100-year flood or the high water elevation of the design storm, whichever is applicable to the specific area. 
(8)  Projects that are to be developed in phases will normally require the submission of a master plan of the applicant's contiguous land holdings. Applications for individual project phases may be considered only when the phases are totally independent of, or make sufficient provisions for, adjacent lands. 
(9)  All excavations, grading or filling shall have a finished grade not to exceed a 3:1 (three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical) slope. Steeper grades may be approved by the city engineer if the excavation is through rock or the excavation or fill is protected (a designed head wall or toe wall may be required). 
(10)  Grading plans for sites that exceed one (1) acre shall provide for erosion control and for sediment controls, or debris basins, silt traps or filters, staked straw bales, a combination of these measures or other measures approved by the city engineer to remove sediment from runoff waters. Temporary sediment control measures (structural) shall be maintained until vegetative cover is established at a sufficient density to provide erosion control on the site. 
(11)  Where natural vegetation is removed during grading, vegetation shall be reestablished in such a density as to prevent erosion. Permanent type grasses shall be established as soon as possible during the next seeding period after grading has been completed. Trees, plants and vegetative cover should be of native species, when possible. Reference the city development manual and other city ordinances for examples. 
(12)  When grading operations are completed or suspended for more than fourteen (14) days between permanent grass seeding periods, temporary cover shall be provided. All finished grades (areas not to be disturbed by future improvements) 4:1 slopes or steeper shall be sodded, hydro seeded, or have erosion control fabric installed; slopes less than 4:1 (four (4) horizontal to one (1) vertical) shall be mulched at the rate of one hundred (100) pounds per one thousand (1,000) square feet when seeded. 
(13)  Ground adjoining project sites (lots) shall be provided with protection from accelerated and increased surface water, silt from erosion, and any other consequences of erosion. Runoff water from developed areas (parking lots, paved sites, and buildings) above the area to be developed shall be directed to diversions, detention basins, concrete gutters, and/or underground outlet systems. Sufficiently anchored straw bales may be substituted with the approval of the city engineer. 
(14)  Development along natural watercourses shall have a minimum fifty-foot general maintenance and drainage easement. The easement shall be measured from the top of the existing stream bank. Development shall not encroach on said fifty-foot easement. The watercourse shall be maintained by and be made the responsibility of the appropriate legal entity. Permanent vegetation should be left intact. Variances will include designed stream bank erosion control measures and shall be approved by the city engineer. FEMA guidelines shall be followed where applicable regarding site development in floodplains. 
(15)  All lots shall be seeded and mulched or sodded, with a density of at least seventy (70) percent vegetative cover over the entire disturbed area before the certificate of occupancy shall be issued. 
(16)  BMPs for post construction water quality improvement are to be used when feasible. Designers are encouraged to implement cooperative use of required landscaping areas and stormwater quality measures. Examples of these BMPs are located in the city standards and specifications.

Sec. 23-10. - Stormwater management system design requirements. 
(1)  Calculations. The design of the stormwater system shall be in accordance with the City of Cape Girardeau's Storm Drainage Design Manual (if available). If not available, the development calculations shall be based on the minimum of one (1) fifteen-minute rainfall using the following: 
Watershed Area (acres) Method 0-25 Rational (See Note 1) >25 Technical Release 55 (TR-55) (See Note 2)  
    Note 1: Rational Method shall be as identified in Missouri Department of Transportation Design Manual Chapter IX - Hydraulics and Drainage current edition. 
    Note 2: Technical Release 55 (TR-55) shall be as identified in the NRCS Urban Hydrology for Small Water Sheds. 
(2)  Open channels. 
(a)  Open channels, natural or improved, may be placed at the rear or side of properties upon approval of the city engineer where the design provides adequate protection to the existing and future property and structures. Such protection shall be through the provision of a fifty-year floodplain setback and a minimum distance from the toe of bank to the setback of fifty (50) feet. This drainage setback line shall be shown on the final plat. Permanent vegetation, existing ground elevation, and grades within the fifty-foot setback area shall be left intact and undisturbed on channels with watersheds of one hundred (100) acres or more unless modification is approved in writing by the director or his designee. 
(b)  Area inlets shall be required behind the curbs to intercept overland flows greater than one (1) cfs to prevent flows from crossing sidewalks and/or curbs. 
(3)  Inlets and junction boxes. Inlets, junctions boxes and inlet spacing shall be per the city's standard details and as approved by the city engineer. When locating inlets in sump locations consideration must be made with respect to the major drainage system. A 100-year 30-minute storm design event shall not cause buildings to flood in the event that a single inlet becomes blocked. In new developments the 100-year 30-minute design storm elevation shall be mapped on the final plat as a building setback. Overland relief to another inlet or surface channel shall be provided to protect property. 
(4)  Enclosed systems. 
(a)  The outlet of an enclosed system shall have sufficient energy dissipation provided to negate the increases posed by development as approved by the city engineer. 
(b)  Building gutter drainage systems may not be discharged directly into the city's enclosed system. 
(c)  If development plans call for the enclosure of an existing, natural drainageway which carries greater than fifty (50) cfs during the design storm event, the enclosure shall be sized for a fifty-year 30-minute storm event. Upstream inundation shall be checked. Where inundation extends beyond the site property line and exceeds the design water surface elevation of the natural drainway/channel, a backwater ponding easement from the affected off-site property owner(s) shall be required prior to final plan approval. A reduction in the design storm requirement may be granted by the city engineer when existing off-site, downstream storm sewer would be smaller than the required on-site, upstream sewer and the downstream storm sewer are not designed to intercept/pass the fifty-year twenty-minute storm event. 
(5)  Detention design criteria. Detention in the overall system, including swales, lakes, canals, greenways, etc., shall be provided as follows. 
(6)  General. 
(a)  Storage volumes. The minimum volume of storage provided in detention basins, together with such storage as may be authorized in other on-site facilities, shall be sufficient to store the volume of the difference between the ten-year 30-minute storm under undeveloped conditions and the twenty-five year 30-minute storm under developed conditions. 
(b)  Outlet control structures. Outlet control structures shall be designed to operate simply and automatically. They will limit discharges into existing or planned downstream channels or conduits so as not to exceed predetermined maximum authorized peak flow rates. 
(c)  Release rate. A release rate shall be calculated for a ten-year 30-minute storm for the proposed development in the condition prior to the proposed development. 
(d)  Emergency spillway. Emergency overflow facilities must be provided in all instances so that stored waters will not exceed the safe capacity of the basin. At a minimum, the emergency spillway must be able to pass without damage the 100-year 30-minute storm. 
(e)  Appearance. Designs should result in aesthetically pleasing configurations which will enhance public acceptability. 
(7)  Dry-detention facilities. 
(a)  Perimeter maintenance easements of twenty (20) feet (minimum) width at slopes no steeper than three to one (3:1) (horizontal to vertical) shall be provided. 
(b)  Side slopes of the facility shall not be steeper than three to one (3:1) (horizontal to vertical). 
(c)  Provisions must be incorporated to facilitate complete interior drainage to dry bottom basins, to include the provision of natural grades to outlet structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage facilities, or the installation of subsurface drains. 
(d)  Multipurpose features may be designed to serve secondary purposes for recreation, open space or other types of use which will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding. 
(e)  In no case shall the limits of maximum ponding elevation of a dry-detention facility within two (2) feet vertically below the lowest sill elevation be closer than twenty-five (25) feet horizontally from any building. The entire reservoir area shall be seeded, fertilized and mulched, sodded or paved. 
(f)  Fully paved low flow channels are prohibited. The flow channel for low flow events shall be reinforced turf or open sectioned pavers with grass or aggregate to allow filtering of the stormwater and to support mowing equipment. Other methods may be used as approved. 
(8)  Wet-detention facilities. 
(a)  Perimeter maintenance and operation easements of twenty (20) feet (minimum preferable) width at slopes no steeper than three to one (3:1) (horizontal to vertical) shall be provided. 
(b)  Control elevations should be no higher than two and one-half (21/2) feet below the minimum road centerline elevation in the area served by the control device in order to protect the road subgrade when structures are constructed near roads. 
(c)  Side slopes shall not be steeper than three to one (3:1) (horizontal to vertical) out to a depth of two (2) feet below the control elevation, then as steep as soils stability will allow. 
(d)  If fish are to be used to help keep the basin clean, at least one-quarter (1/4) of an area of the permanent pool must be a minimum depth of ten (10) feet. 
(e)  For emergency purposes, cleaning or shoreline maintenance, facilities shall be provided or plans prepared for the use of auxiliary equipment to permit emptying and drainage. 
(f)  In no case shall the limits of maximum ponding elevation of a wet-detention facility within two (2) feet vertically below the lowest sill elevation be closer than thirty (30) feet horizontally from the lowest sill elevation of any building. 
(9)  Underground storage. All or a portion of the detention storage may also be provided for in underground facilities, as long as all applicable requirements of this chapter are met. Details of such designs are to include type of facility, depth and volume of storage, details of inlet and outlet devices and locations, emergency overflow provisions, and measures to be used for surface water and groundwater pollution control. 
(10)  Design alternatives. The above listing of design criteria is not intended to preclude the use of other known state-of-the art methods and available best management practices and should not be construed as a mechanism to discourage innovative design concepts. 
(11)  Developments adjoining a floodplain. Where a development adjoins or encompasses a portion of a floodplain for a 100-year flood, the following shall apply: 
(a)  The applicant shall show the floodplain and floodway on the stormwater management plan.

1.  "Flood Insurance Rate Map" published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
2.  Backwater curve profiles of the proposed waterway due to a 100-year 30-minute storm recurrence interval. 
(f)  Designation on the final plan of all areas reserved for flood routing, detention or storage, together with the required wording pertaining to restrictions, dedications and maintenance responsibilities of such areas. 
(14)  Detention storage. If detention storage is provided within a floodplain, only the net increase in storage volume above that which naturally existed on the floodplain shall be credited to the development. No credit will be granted for volumes below the elevation of the regulatory flood at that location unless compensatory storage is also provided. 
(15)  Verification of adequacy. Analysis of all elements of design is to be verified by the engineer of record submitting the plan. The following outline is provided to ascertain that certain critical elements are in workable compliance with the aims of this chapter.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 5070 , art. 5, adopted April 16, 2018, repealed the former § 23-10 and enacted a new section as set out herein. The former § 23-10 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 4253, § 1, adopted Aug. 15, 2011; and Ord. No. 4805, arts. 4-6, adopted Jan. 19, 2016. 
Sec. 23-11. - Rights-of-way and easements. 
(1)  All stormwater management facilities shall be constructed within an easement or right-of-way dedicated for stormwater management use and connected to a public road or other location from which operation and maintenance is legally available. Minimum rights-of-way and maintenance easements shall be provided by instrument or plat dedication for all waterways used to convey or detain runoff. Where permanent maintenance will be provided by the property owner, maintenance easements or rights-of-way may not be required. The minimum widths of rights-of-way and easements shall be as follows: 
Facility Maintenance 
Access Width Open drainage channel or facility 50 feet from top of bank Greenways Width of greenway Pipes and culverts 20 feet centered Detention areas 20 feet continuous around total area Connecting access 20 feet  
(2)  Easements must include the "top of the bank width" and the maintenance access width. 
(3)  The maintenance access width begins at the point of the bank or slope of the facility. 
(4)  Additional maintenance access width may be required by the city manager or his designee in special circumstances where more width on one (1) or both sides is necessary for maintenance purposes. 
(Ord. No. 4253, § 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 23-12. - Maintenance responsibilities for stormwater management facilities. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish maintenance standards to ensure that after stormwater management facilities have been properly designed and constructed, they continue to function properly. Continued proper functioning is highly dependent upon the proper maintenance of the facilities. Proper long term function is critical to maintaining the water quality improvement aspects of the stormwater management facilities. 
(2)  Design of facilities. Maintenance costs over a period of years will generally surpass the costs of initially constructing water management facilities. The applicant and the city manager or his designee should utilize all appropriate methods, approaches and techniques to design and construct these facilities in such a manner that fulfills the requirements of this chapter, facilitates their inspection, facilitates cleaning and repair activities, and minimizes future maintenance costs. The design should include provisions for access to areas requiring cleaning and/or maintenance work after the project is constructed. 
(3)  Inspection of facilities. Inspection of stormwater management facilities should be performed annually, at a minimum. The owner is responsible to have the inspection performed by a competent individual or firm. A written report of the inspection, including findings and recommendations, is to be sent to the city manager or his designee. When cleaning or repairs are recommended, the owner shall send a subsequent report to the city manager or his designee documenting that the recommended action has been completed. The city manager or his designee has the authority to inspect all stormwater facilities on public or private property to confirm proper maintenance is being performed. Enforcement shall follow the guidelines set forth in this chapter. 
(4)  Maintenance responsibilities. The growth of noxious weeds, the creation of conditions which support the growth of mosquitoes and other insects, and the decrease in available storage by accumulated sediments shall be controlled. The cleanup of accumulated debris, flotsam and other materials after runoff events have subsided shall be assured. 
(a)  Detention facilities, when mandatory, are to be built in conjunction with the storm sewer installation and/or grading. Since these facilities are intended to control increased runoff, they must be partially or fully operational soon after the clearing of the vegetation. Silt and debris connected with early construction shall be removed periodically from the detention area and control structure in order to maintain close to full storage capacity. 
(b)  The responsibility for maintenance of stormwater management facilities in single-lot development projects shall remain with the owner, developer and general contractor until final inspection of the development is performed and approved, and a legal occupancy permit, where applicable, is issued. After legal occupancy of the project, the maintenance of stormwater management facilities shall be vested with the owner of the project. 
(c)  The responsibility for maintenance of stormwater management facilities in subdivision projects shall remain with the developer until such time as responsibility is transferred, under appropriate legal arrangements, to the private individual owners in the subdivision, the trustees of the subdivision, the city or such other maintenance entity or authority as may be proposed and approved by the city council. 
(d)  If responsibility is to be transferred to the private individual owners in the subdivision, the developer shall assure perpetual maintenance of the drainage management facilities, including detention systems, if any are included, through the adoption of maintenance agreements or covenants for any facilities that remain in private ownership. Such agreements or covenants shall be subject to the approval of the city manager or his designee. 
(e)  If the responsibility is to be transferred to the trustees of the subdivision, the developer shall establish a suitable indenture of trust. Upon release of escrows required for the subdivision development, the responsibility for maintenance shall be vested in the trustees of the subdivision by virtue of the trust indenture. The indenture of trust shall clearly indicate resident responsibility for maintenance and shall be subject to the approval of the city manager or his designee. 
(5)  Performance and maintenance security. Security against defects in workmanship shall be required for any portion of the drainage management facilities dedicated to the public. The terms of the performance security shall apply to any repairs needed and maintenance needed during the two-year period following completion. Inspection and repair of defects shall be required as a condition of release of the posted security.

(d)  Transferability. Except as provided in this article or as otherwise required by law, no franchise, agreement or permit may be transferred without the written application to and consent of the city based on the requirements and policies of this article and only after satisfaction of all applicable procedural or substantive requirements established by Charter or other law.

An application fee for such agreement or franchise shall be submitted to the city in the amount of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) or as otherwise established by the city manager to recover any actual costs anticipated and incurred by the city in reviewing, documenting, or negotiating such agreement or franchise, including reasonable legal fees and costs to review compliance of the applicant and any initial proposed facilities and uses, provided that no costs, if any, of litigation or interpretation of RSMo § 67.1830 or 67.1832, shall be included if such inclusion is prohibited by law as to that applicant. If the actual costs are thereafter determined to be less than the application fee, such amount shall be returned to the applicant after written request therefrom; if the actual costs reasonably exceed the application fee, applicant shall, after written notice from the city, pay such additional amount prior to issuance by the city of any final approval. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the city from also charging reasonable compensation for use of the public rights-of-way where such a fee is not contrary to applicable law.

After submission by the ROW user of a duly executed and completed application and application fee, and executed franchise or ROW agreement as may be provided by the city manager, or as modified by the city manager in review of the specific circumstances of the application, all in conformity with the requirements of this article and all applicable law, the city manager shall submit such franchise or agreement to the city council for approval. Upon determining compliance with this article, the city council shall authorize execution of the franchise or agreement (or a modified agreement otherwise acceptable to the city consistent with the purposes of this article), and such executed franchise or agreement shall constitute consent to use the public rights-of-way; provided that nothing herein shall preclude the rejection or modification of any executed franchise or agreement submitted to the city to the extent such applicable law does not prohibit such rejection or modification, including where necessary to reasonably and in a uniform or nondiscriminatory manner reflect the distinct engineering, construction, operation, maintenance, public works or safety requirements applicable to the applicant. 
(f)  No cause of action. A ROW user shall have no damages remedy or monetary recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising from any of the provisions or requirements of any franchise or agreement, or from the use of the rights-of-way and any use of the rights-of-way shall be deemed subordinate to the primary public use by the city.

    The following conditions shall apply to all excavation and facilities maintenance and to all permits issued under this article unless specifically stated otherwise in the permit: 
(a)  City specification; applicable codes. All excavations and facilities maintenance shall comply with the city standard specifications as may be amended from time to time by the authority of the city manager establishing such specifications and procedures consistent with the requirements and purposes of this chapter. A ROW user shall perform all excavations or facilities maintenance in full compliance with all applicable engineering codes adopted or approved by the city and in accordance with applicable statutes of the State of Missouri, and the rules and regulations of the PSC and any other local, state or federal agency having jurisdiction over the parties. A ROW user shall be responsible for all excavations or facilities maintenance done in the rights-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of by whom the excavation or facilities maintenance is done. 
(b)  Permit-specific conditions. Each permit shall be deemed to incorporate the provisions of this article as permit conditions. The city manager may also impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of a permit and the performance of the ROW user in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to ensure the structural integrity of the rights-of-way, to protect the property and safety of other users of the rights-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public. Such reasonable conditions may include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  The amount of excavation or facilities maintenance which may occur at one (1) time and the amount of rights-of-way which may be obstructed during construction; 
(2)  The number or size of conduits or other facilities that may be installed by each ROW user based on the reasonable needs to ensure that no one (1) ROW user may unreasonably consume a disproportionate amount of the available rights-of-way to deter competition or deprive the public or others of the reasonable use of the rights-of-way; 
(3)  Posting of an additional or larger performance and maintenance bond for additional facilities, except as otherwise provided in section 24-104 hereof, when the established amount is reasonably determined to be insufficient;

(5)  Other reasonable conditions regarding the timing, safety precautions, or specific implementation of the specific work proposed. 
(c)  Responsible for costs. A ROW user shall be responsible for all reasonable costs borne by the city that are directly associated with a ROW user's permit or use of the rights-of-way thereunder. 
(d)  Stop work orders. Except in cases of an emergency or with approval of the city manager, no excavation or facilities maintenance may be done in violation of a stop work order issued by the city manager if in his or her determination conditions are unreasonable for such excavation or facilities maintenance based on standard engineering and construction practices. 
(e)  No interference with ROW uses. A ROW user shall not disrupt rights-of-way such that the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways is interfered with. No person may park private vehicles within or next to the facilities maintenance or excavation area, except for such areas which may be designated and marked as safe areas for vehicle parking in accordance with an approved traffic control plan. 
(f)  Responsible for subcontractors. If excavation or facilities maintenance is being done for the ROW user by another person, a subcontractor or otherwise, the ROW user shall be responsible for ensuring that the excavation or facilities maintenance of said person is performed consistent with its permit and applicable law and shall be responsible for promptly correcting acts or omissions by said person. 
(g)  Minimum impact required; no interference. The ROW user shall, in the performance of any excavation or facilities maintenance required for the installation, repair, maintenance, relocation and/or removal of any of its facilities, limit all excavations or facilities maintenance to that necessary for efficient operation and so as not to interfere with other users of the rights-of-way. 
(h)  Open excavations; street-plate bridging. The ROW user shall not permit an excavation to remain open or facilities maintenance actions to continue in the rights-of-way longer than is necessary to complete the repair or installation or action, and in no event may an excavation or facilities maintenance remain open or continue beyond the expiration of the permit or any approved extension. Any excavation left open overnight on any thoroughfare or collector type street shall be securely covered. Unless otherwise approved by the city manager in writing, all excavations shall be filled in or covered at the end of each working day. The ROW user assumes the sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, plates, safety fencing and/or lights as required from the time of opening of the excavation until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel. Street plate bridging (SPB) to cover open excavations shall be authorized subject to requirements contained in the standard specifications. 
(i)  Barricades and safety devices. All excavations and facilities maintenance shall be barricaded in such a manner as to protect both pedestrians and vehicular traffic. Such excavations, facilities maintenance and barricades shall be lighted at night with danger signals in such a manner that all traffic may be warned of the existence and location of such excavations, facilities maintenance and barricades. All traffic control devices shall be in compliance with the current version of the standard specifications and the Manual of Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), unless otherwise agreed to by the city. All surplus excavation materials, tools or supplies at the site of the excavation or facilities maintenance shall be barricaded and lighted at night in the manner described in this section. No open excavation may be left in the pavement area without placing street plates over the opening.

Whenever there is an excavation or facilities maintenance by the ROW user, the ROW user shall be responsible for providing adequate traffic control to the surrounding area as determined by the city manager. In the event the excavation or facilities maintenance is not completed in a reasonable period of time, the ROW user may be liable for actual damages to the city for delay caused by the ROW user pursuant to this article. 
(k)  Hours of activity. Nonemergency excavations or facilities maintenance on arterial and collector streets may not be performed during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., in order to minimize disruption of traffic flow. The ROW user shall perform excavations or facilities maintenance on the rights-of-way at such times that will allow the least interference with the normal flow of traffic and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood, and shall not work between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. 
(l)  Location of facilities; undergrounding. 
(1)  All underground mains and service lines with ancillary appurtenances thereto shall, wherever practicable, be placed between the curb or pavement edge and sidewalk line in the section of the street known as the parkway. Where the pavement and sidewalk occupy the entire street, the underground utilities shall be located under the sidewalk, unless otherwise directed by the city. 
(2)  Except as provided herein, all facilities constructed after the date of this article shall be placed underground. Facilities may be located above ground if approved by the city manager for good cause or as may otherwise be specifically authorized in a franchise or ROW agreement consistent with law. Aboveground facilities may be installed if approved by the city manager where alternative underground facilities are not technically or economically feasible, or where the imposition of such additional costs of undergrounding on the ROW user are precluded by applicable law. 
(m)  Notice of completion. The ROW user shall notify the office of the city manager upon completion of the excavation or facilities maintenance authorized by the permit. 
(n)  Guarantee of work. Every person to whom an excavation permit has been granted shall guarantee for a period of four (4) years the restoration of the rights-of-way in the area where such person conducted an excavation and performed the restoration.

(o)  Tree trimming. A ROW user shall neither remove, cut, nor damage any trees, or their roots, in and along the rights-of-way of the city except as authorized by the city pursuant to an approved tree trimming plan authorized by an excavation or facilities maintenance permit. Tree trimming and pruning may be permitted to occur only after prior written notice to the city of the extent of trimming and pruning to be performed and the prior written approval thereof by the city. The type and extent of trimming and pruning shall be in accordance with the requirements of the city as provided in article II of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4826, art. 1, 3-7-16) 
Sec. 24-407. - Inspection and acceptance of excavations after backfilling and settlement. 
    When an excavation has been made within the limits of any street, alley or sidewalk and after the same has been properly backfilled, the person making the excavation shall notify the city manager that the same is ready for final repair. The city manager or his duly authorized agent shall immediately inspect the same, and if he finds that such excavation has been properly backfilled, the permit holder shall complete the restoration of the surface of such street, alley or sidewalk, all in accordance with the city's standard specifications for street restoration. The judgment of the city manager or his authorized agent as to when an excavation has been properly backfilled to permit final repair shall be conclusive. 
(Ord. No. 4826, art. 1, 3-7-16) 
Sec. 24-408. - Final repair of excavations; specifications; city restoration.

(a)  The ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, fails to provide all the necessary information requested by the city for managing the public rights-of-way. 
(b)  The ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, including contractors or subcontractors, has a history of noncompliance or permitting noncompliance within the city. For purposes of this section, "history of noncompliance or permitting noncompliance within the city" shall include where the ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, including contractors or subcontractors, has failed to return the public rights-of-way to its previous condition under a previous permit. 
(c)  The city has provided the ROW user with a reasonable, competitively neutral, and nondiscriminatory justification for requiring an alternative method for performing the excavation or facilities maintenance identified in the permit application or a reasonable alternative route that will not result in additional installation expense of more than ten (10) percent to the ROW user or a declination of service quality. 
(d)  The city determines that the denial is necessary to protect the public health and safety, provided that the authority of the city does not extend to those items under the jurisdiction of the PSC, such denial shall not interfere with a ROW user's right of eminent domain of private property, and such denials shall only be imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis. In determining whether denial of a permit application is necessary to protect the public health and safety, the city manager may consider one (1) or more of the following factors: 
(1)  The extent to which the rights-of-way space where the permit is sought is available, including the consideration of competing demands for the particular space in the rights-of-way, or other general conditions of the rights-of-way. 
(2)  The applicability of any ordinance, code provision, or other regulations that affect the location of facilities in the rights-of-way. 
(3)  The degree and nature of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the rights-of-way, including whether the issuance of a permit for the particular dates and/or times requested would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. 
(e)  The area is environmentally sensitive as defined by state statute or federal law or is a historic district designated by city ordinance. 
(f)  The failure to comply with applicable city ordinances or any other violation, unsafe conditions, or damage or threatened harm to the rights-of-way or public, except where such circumstance would otherwise not constitute a lawful basis for revocation of a permit.

Sec. 24-411. - Deposit with city manager. 
    Unless otherwise provided by law, a ROW user shall submit a deposit with the city manager sufficient in amount to ensure payment for the proper repair of such excavation in accord with the terms of this Code and other city ordinances and to insure and protect the city from all damage that may arise from such excavations prior to acceptance by the city, after proper backfilling. Such deposits shall be returned one hundred eighty (180) days after the excavation has been backfilled and after an inspector has reported the excavation to have been properly repaired. Any party claiming exemption from the requirements of this subsection shall, prior to the subject excavation, so state in writing to the city, setting forth the factual and legal basis for such exemption in verified form. 
(Ord. No. 4826, art. 1, 3-7-16)

(b)  Supplemental review deposit. Where the permit application requires investigation, inspection, studies, review or other costs in excess of the permit fee to be incurred by the city to reasonably determine, enforce or condition compliance with the applicable requirements, the city manager may require, subject to other applicable requirements, that an estimated payment for such additional costs be submitted before the application is deemed complete. Any portion of such additional deposit above actual costs incurred by the city therein shall be returned to the applicant upon completion of the application and project upon written request of the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 4826, art. 1, 3-7-16) 
Sec. 24-413. - Map and location. 
    Where an application is made for a permit by a ROW user to install or repair its facilities, the applicant shall submit a map or plat of where the excavation or facilities maintenance is to take place. Such plat or map shall be specific as to location and depth of the excavation or facilities maintenance, as to street address or other location. For excavations or facilities maintenance involving streets or curbs, a traffic control plan shall be needed and approved by the city manager before beginning work. Persons who obtain a bulk facilities maintenance permit shall provide such information to the city relating to facilities maintenance prior to performing facilities maintenance in the rights-of-way. Unless otherwise approved by the city manager, such notice shall be provided to the city in writing at least two (2) business days in advance of the work, and shall be subject to denial or modification by the city manager based on public safety or other requirements in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4826, art. 1, 3-7-16) 
Sec. 24-414. - Liability insurance, performance and maintenance bond requirement. 
    Except as provided in this section, each ROW user shall provide, at its sole expense, and maintain during the term of an agreement or franchise, commercial general liability insurance with a reputable, qualified, and financially sound company licensed to do business in the State of Missouri, and unless otherwise approved by the city, with a rating by Best of not less than "A", that shall protect the ROW user, the city, and the city's officials, officers, and employees from claims which may arise from operations under an agreement or franchise, whether such operations are by the ROW user, its officers, directors, employees and agents, or any subcontractors of the ROW user. This liability insurance shall include, but shall not be limited to, protection against claims arising from bodily and personal injury and damage to property, resulting from all ROW user operations, products, services or use of automobiles, or construction equipment. The amount of insurance for single limit coverage applying to bodily and personal injury and property damage shall be at least two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000.00), but in no event less than the individual and combined sovereign immunity limits established by RSMo § 537.610 for political subdivisions; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive the city's sovereign immunity. An endorsement shall be provided which states that the city is listed as an additional insured and stating that the policy shall not be cancelled or materially modified so as to be out of compliance with the requirements of this section, or not renewed without thirty (30) days' advance written notice of such event being given to the city manager. If the person is self-insured, it shall provide the city proof of compliance regarding its ability to self-insure and proof of its ability to provide coverage in the above amounts. The insurance requirements in this section or otherwise shall not apply to a ROW user to the extent and for such period during an agreement or franchise as ROW user is exempted from such requirements pursuant to RSMo § 67.1830(6)(a) and has on file with the city clerk an affidavit certifying that ROW user has twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and is otherwise therefore so exempted unless otherwise provided by agreement or franchise.

(Ord. No. 5162 , art. 1, 2-18-19) 
Sec. 24-603. - Permitting provisions. 
(a)  Permit requirements-Inside the right-of-way. Any person desiring to collocate small wireless facilities, or to install, replace, maintain, or operate a utility pole inside the right-of-way must first apply for and obtain a permit, in addition to any other required permit, license, or authorization that is generally applicable. 
(1)  The collocation of small wireless facilities and the installation, maintenance, modification, operation, and replacement of utility poles along, across, upon, and under the right-of-way in areas zoned single-family residential or as historic as of August 28, 2018, remain subject to any applicable zoning requirements. 
(2)  Small wireless facilities and utility poles shall be installed and maintained so as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel, including pedestrian travel, or public safety on the right-of-way or obstruct the legal use of the right-of-way by the city or other authorized right-of-way users. 
(3)  A new, replacement, or modified utility pole installed in the right-of-way, except for in areas zoned single-family residential or historic as of August 28, 2018, shall not be subject to zoning requirements so long as the Utility Pole does not exceed the greater of ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing Utility Pole in place as of January 1, 2019 located within five hundred (500) feet of the new utility pole in the same right-of-way, or fifty (50) feet above ground level. A new, modified, or replacement utility pole that exceeds these height limits shall be subject to applicable city zoning requirements, and any applicable ROW management, building and safety requirements as established in this article, or any other applicable Code section, and that are consistent with Sections 67.5090 to 67.5103, RSMo. 
(4)  New small wireless facilities in the right-of-way shall not extend more than ten (10) feet above an existing utility pole in place as of August 28, 2018. 
(5)  Small wireless facilities on a new utility pole shall not extend above the height permitted for a new utility pole in subsection 3 above. 
(6)  A wireless provider shall be permitted to replace decorative poles when necessary to collocate a small wireless facility, but any replacement utility pole shall reasonably conform to the design aesthetics of the decorative pole(s) being replaced. The term 'reasonably conform' as used herein, shall mean that the design aesthetics of the replacement pole shall be as nearly identical as possible to the decorative pole replaced. The city manager is authorized to determine if the replacement utility pole reasonably conforms to the decorative elements of the utility pole being replaced, based upon the reasonable objective design standards of the city. In districts where there are utility poles which were specifically designed for their aesthetic nature and compatibility with the built environment of that district, as determined by the city, such utility poles be deemed to be decorative poles (or "decorative utility poles"). Such decorative utility poles, when authorized to be replaced by an applicant for small wireless facilities, or any other applicable facility, pursuant to applicable law and in compliance with this article and Code, shall only be replaced with a substantially similar decorative utility pole which matches the aesthetics and decorative elements of the original decorative utility pole being replaced. Such replacement expenses shall be bore wholly by the applicant seeking to place wireless communications facilities on such decorative utility pole. 
(7)  The city may require replacement of a utility pole that is proposed to be used for a collocation for reasons of safety and reliability, including a demonstration that the collocation would make the utility pole structurally unsound. 
(b)  Permit requirements-Outside the right-of-way. 
(1)  The city may allow collocation of small wireless facilities on city wireless support structures and city utility poles that are located on city property outside the right-of-way to the same extent, if any, that it allows access to such structures for other commercial projects or uses. Any such collocations shall be subject to reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates, fees, and terms as provided in an agreement between the city and the wireless provider. 
(2)  The city shall not enter into an exclusive agreement with a wireless provider concerning city utility poles or city wireless support structures that are located on city property outside the right-of-way, including stadiums and enclosed arenas, unless the agreement meets the requirements of applicable law. 
(c)  Permit process for an applicant seeking to construct small wireless facilities in or outside the right-of-way, or to install, replace, maintain or operate a utility pole inside the right-of-way. 
(1)  All applications for permits shall be submitted to the city manager. The city manager may draft a standard application form, consistent with the provisions of this article, and that form shall be used by all applicants. An applicant shall not be required to provide more information to obtain a permit under this article than other communications service providers that are not wireless providers, unless RSMo, §§ 67.5110-67.5121 allows such information to be included. 
(2)  An application for a permit shall include the following: 
a.  Construction and engineering drawings which demonstrate compliance with the criteria in section 24-515(f);

(g)  Incorporation by reference. Any permit granted pursuant to this article shall by implication include a provision that shall incorporate by reference this article, and any other applicable law, into such permit as fully as if copied therein verbatim. 
(h)  Calculation of time. Unless otherwise indicated, when the performance or doing of any act, duty, matter, or payment is required under this article or any permit, and a period of time is prescribed and is fixed herein, the time shall be computed so as to exclude the first and include the last day of the prescribed or fixed period of time. 
(i)  Self-preemption. No provision of this article shall apply to any circumstance in which such application shall be unlawful under superseding federal or state law and furthermore, if any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this article is now or in the future superseded or preempted by state or federal law or found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unauthorized, such provision shall be automatically interpreted and applied as required by law. 
(j)  Severability. If any term, condition, or provision of this article shall, to any extent, be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder hereof shall be valid in all other respects and continue to be effective. In the event of a subsequent change in applicable law so that the provision that has been held invalid is no longer invalid, said provisions shall there upon return to full force and effect without further action by the city and shall thereafter be binding on the applicant and the city.

(f)  Computation of frontage. Except as provided for in this article, if a premises contains walls facing more than one (1) property line or encompasses property frontage bounded by more than one (1) street or other property usages, the sign area(s) for each building wall or property frontage will be computed separately for each building wall or property line facing a different frontage. The sign area(s) thus calculated shall be permitted to then be applied to permitted signs placed on each separate wall or property line frontage. 
(g)  Maintenance, repair and removal. Every sign permitted by this section shall be kept in good condition and repair. When any sign becomes insecure, in danger of falling or is otherwise deemed unsafe by the code official, or if any sign shall be unlawfully installed, erected or maintained in violation of any of the provisions of this article, the owner thereof or the person or firm using same shall, upon written notice by the code official forthwith in the case of immediate danger, and in any other case within not more than ten (10) days, make such sign conform to the provisions of this article, or shall remove it.

Sec. 25-1252. - Cluster subdivisions. 
(a)  Purpose. Cluster subdivisions may be approved according to the provisions of this section to preserve environmentally sensitive areas and open space. The intent of this section is to authorize a developer to decrease lot sizes and leave the land in natural conservation areas, thereby lowering development costs and increasing the amenity of the project without increasing the density beyond what would be permissible if the land were subdivided into the size of lots required by the underlying zoning district. 
(b)  Applicability. A developer may create a cluster subdivision in a standard residential zoning district which includes lots that are smaller and arranged differently than those required by the underlying zoning district regulations if the application conforms to this section. 
(c)  Project size and density. There is no minimum or maximum acreage limitation for a cluster subdivision. The maximum allowable residential density shall not exceed the maximum density allowed in the underlying zoning district, except as provided for in this section. 
(d)  Lot dimensions and setback requirements. There are no prescribed minimum lot dimensions. Lot widths and depths shall be sufficient to accommodate the use and minimum building setbacks required in the underlying zoning district. 
(e)  Required open space. The amount of open space which must be set aside in cluster subdivisions shall be based on the difference between the total area contained within all cluster lots and the total area which would have been contained within an equivalent number of standard lots based on the density allowed in the underlying zoning district. 
(f)  Open space standards. The developer shall provide for the ownership and continued maintenance of all open space by one (1) of the methods stated below. City approval of the form of dedication or conveyance shall be required. 
(1)  Offer to dedicate land for public use; or 
(2)  Convey open space to be held in common by an organization established by the applicant and approved by the city. The applicant shall submit covenants and restrictions regarding permanent maintenance of the open space, including provisions addressing: maintenance duties of the organization; the manner in which lot owners will be assessed by the organization; conditions of default; and the manner of enforcement by the city. 
(g)  Open space allocation. Open space shall be provided for each phase of a development. If common open space will not be provided proportionally by phase, the applicant shall execute a reservation of common open space by grant of an easement or covenant in favor of the city, authorizing the city to dedicate all or a portion of such reserved area to common open space in the event that the development is not completed. 
(h)  Open space design and improvements. Open space areas shall be linked to existing and planned public open space and trail systems wherever possible. Open space shall be arranged to maximize access and use by residents of the cluster subdivision. Where open space improvements are provided, a safe, secure and barrier-free system of trails, paths, walkways and bikeways shall be designed. Improvements may include paved pedestrian paths located in public rights-of-way or permanent access easements. 
(i)  Increased density. An increase in the maximum density allowed in the underlying zoning district may be approved for a cluster subdivision if one (1) or more of the following requirements are met: 
(1)  The preservation of a significant natural resource; 
(2)  The provision of more than twenty-five (25) percent of the subdivision as open space; 
(3)  The dedication to the city of public parkland that has been deemed to be desirable by the city. 
The increase in density shall generally be related to the significance and/or size of the open space, natural resource or parkland associated with the cluster subdivision.

(Code 1967, § 26-161; Ord. No. 732, § 3, 7-24-89; Ord. No. 2105, art. 3, 12-16-96) 
Sec. 26-79. - Disposition of towed abandoned property. 
(a)  Upon causing the removal of any abandoned property under this division, if the police department knows the registered owner or lienholder of the abandoned property, it shall within five (5) working days give notice in writing to the registered owner and any lienholder of the fact of the removal, the grounds for the removal, and indicate the place to which the property has been removed. If the abandoned property is stored with a tow company, a copy of the notice shall be given to the tow company. The notice provided for in this subsection shall include the amount of mileage, if available, shown on the abandoned property at the time of removal. 
(b)  A tow company storage facility where abandoned property is stored pursuant to this division shall accept cash, a cashier's check or a valid bank credit card for payment of towing and storage by a registered owner or the owner's agent claiming the abandoned property, except where the tow and impoundment of the abandoned property was the result of an arrest or accident whereby the towing company may then demand payment in the form of cash or cashier's check. A tow company who refuses to accept a valid bank credit card pursuant to this subsection is liable to the registered owner of the abandoned property for four (4) times the amount of the towing and storage charges, but not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), as provided by section 304.158.7, R.S.Mo. In addition, persons operating or in charge of a tow company storage facility shall have sufficient moneys on the premises to accommodate, and make change in, a reasonable monetary transaction. 
(c)  Any towing company which comes into possession of abandoned property pursuant to this division and who claims a lien for recovering, towing or storing abandoned property shall give notice to the title owner and to all persons claiming lien thereon, as disclosed by the records of the Missouri Department of Revenue or of a corresponding agency in any other state. The towing company shall notify the owner and/or lienholder(s) within ten (10) business days of the date of mailing indicated on the Missouri Department of Revenue notice to the towing company of the names and addresses of the owner and/or lienholder(s) ascertained. The notice shall contain the following: 
(1)  The name, address and telephone number of the tow company storage facility; 
(2)  The date, reason and place from which the abandoned property was removed; 
(3)  A statement that the amount of the accrued towing, storage and administrative costs are the responsibility of the owner, and that storage and/or administrative costs will continue to accrue as a legal liability of the owner until the abandoned property is redeemed; 
(4)  A statement that the tow company claims a possessory lien for all such charges; 
(5)  A statement that the owner or holder of a valid security interest of record may retake possession of the abandoned property at any time during business hours by proving ownership or rights to a secured interest and paying all towing and storage charges; 
(6)  A statement that, should the owner or holder of a valid security interest consider that the towing or removal was improper or not legally justified, the owner has a right to request a hearing as provided in subsection (f) of this section to contest the propriety of such towing or removal; 
(7)  A statement that if the abandoned property remains unclaimed for thirty (30) days from the date of mailing the notice, title to the abandoned property will be transferred to the person or firm in possession of the abandoned property free of all prior liens; and 
(8)  A statement that any charges in excess of the value of the abandoned property at the time of such transfer shall remain a liability of the owner. 
    A towing company may assess storage charges for abandoned property only for the time in which it complies with the procedural requirements of this division. 
(d)  In the event that the records of the Missouri Department of Revenue fail to disclose the name of the owner or any lienholder of record for the abandoned property, upon notification by the Department of Revenue to the towing company of such failure, the towing company shall attempt to locate documents or other evidence of ownership on or within the abandoned property itself. The towing company must certify that a physical search of the abandoned property disclosed no ownership documents and that a good faith effort was made. For purposes of this subsection, "good faith effort" means that the following checks have been performed by the tow company to establish the proper state of registration and title: 
(1)  Check of the abandoned property for any type of license plates, license plate record, temporary permit, inspection sticker, decal or other evidence which may indicate a state of possible registration and title; 
(2)  Check the police report for a license plate number or registration number if the abandoned property was towed at the request of a law enforcement official; 
(3)  Check the tow ticket/report of the tow company operator to see if a license plate was on the abandoned property at the beginning of the tow, if a private tow; and 
(4)  If there is no address of the owner on the impound report, check the police report to see if an out-of-state address is indicated on the drivers license information. 
    If no ownership information is discovered, the Missouri Department of Revenue shall be notified in writing by the tow company. Title may then be obtained in accordance with section 304.156, R.S.Mo., and subsection (e) of this section. 
(e)  Thirty (30) days after the notification form has been mailed by the towing company to the abandoned property owner and any holder(s) of a security agreement and the property is unredeemed and no satisfactory arrangement has been made with the lienholder in possession for continued storage, and the owner or any holder(s) of a security agreement has not requested a hearing as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the lienholder in possession may apply to the Missouri Department of Revenue for a salvage certificate of title designated with the words "salvage/abandoned property" or junking certificate based on the condition of the abandoned property as stated in the abandoned property report or crime inquiry and inspection report. The application for title shall be accompanied by: 
(1)  An affidavit from the lienholder in possession that he has been in possession of the abandoned property for at least thirty (30) days and the owner of the abandoned property or any holder of a security agreement has not made arrangements for payment of towing and storage charges: 
(2)  An affidavit that the lienholder in possession has not been notified of any application for hearing as provided in subsection (f) of this section: 
(3)  A copy of the abandoned property report or crime inquiry and inspection report; 
(4)  A copy of the thirty-day notice given by certified mail to any owner and person holding a valid security interest and a copy of the certified mail receipt indicating that the owner and/or lienholder(s) of record received notice as required in this section. 
    If notice to the owner and/or holder of a security agreement has been returned marked "not forwardable" or "addressee unknown." the lienholder in possession shall comply with subsection (d) of this section. 
(f)  The owner of abandoned property removed pursuant to the provisions of this division or any person claiming a lien, other than the towing company, within ten (10) days after the receipt of notification from the towing company pursuant to subsection (c) of this section may file a petition in the Associate Division of the Cape Girardeau County Circuit Court to determine if the abandoned property was wrongfully taken or withheld from the owner, as provided in section 304.156.5, R.S.Mo.

But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or in an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time.

a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except as provided in subsection (a)(3)b. of this section. 
b.  The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience to a red signal, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the state highways and transportation commission with reference to an intersection involving a state highway, and local authorities with reference to an intersection involving other highways under their jurisdiction, may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any intersection where safety conditions so require, such prohibition shall be effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 26-128, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.

It shall be unlawful to use these lanes as through driving lanes. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a driver who is making a left turn onto a street having a center-left-turn-only lane from entering the center-left-turn-only lane and pausing until he is able to proceed in the proper traffic lane. 
(6)  Left turns off of street at non-intersection. The driver of any vehicle intending to turn left from a two-way street into an alley or driveway or onto open land shall, before turning, approach the left turn in the portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the centerline. 
(7)  Turns from one-way streets. Turns from one-way streets shall be made from the right side of the street for right turn and from the left side of the street for left turn. 
(b)  U-turn generally. It shall be unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to turn such vehicle so as to proceed in the opposite direction at any intersection controlled by a traffic signal or police officer; nor shall such be made at any place unless the movement can be made in safety and without interfering with other traffic. The driver of a vehicle shall not turn such vehicle around so as to proceed in the opposite direction upon any curve or upon the approach to or near the crest of a grade, or at any place upon a roadway where such vehicle cannot be seen by the driver of any other vehicle approaching from either direction along the roadway within a distance of three hundred (300) feet, or where the same may create a traffic hazard. 
(c)  Authority of city traffic engineer. The city traffic engineer may, by placing markers, buttons, signs or markings within or adjacent to intersections, require and direct that a different course from that prescribed in this section be traveled by vehicles turning, and when markers, buttons, signs or marking are so placed no driver of a vehicle shall make a turn other than as directed and required by such markers, buttons, signs or markings.

Sec. 29-3. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and policy. This article sets forth uniform requirements for users of the wastewater collection and publicly owned treatment works (POTW) for the City of Cape Girardeau and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws including the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403). The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will interfere with the operation of the POTW; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into the receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW; 
(3)  To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; 
(4)  To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public; 
(5)  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the POTW; 
(6)  To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the POTW; and 
(7)  To enable the city to comply with its NPDES permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject. 
(b)  Administration. Except as otherwise provided herein, the city manager shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this article. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the city manager may be delegated by the city manager to other city personnel. 
(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 29-4. - General sewer use requirements. 
(a)  Prohibited discharge standards. No industrial user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all industrial users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. Furthermore, no industrial user may contribute the following substances to the POTW: 
(1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the municipal wastewater collection system and POTW, including, but not limited to, wastewater streams with closed-cup flashpoint of less than one hundred forty (140) degrees F (sixty (60) degrees C) using the test method specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
(2)  Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.5 or more than 9.5, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment, or endangering city personnel. 
(3)  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case solids greater than one (1) inch or two and one-half (2.5) centimeters in any dimension. 
(4)  Any wastewater containing pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, COD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with either the POTW; or any wastewater treatment or sludge process, or which will constitute a hazard to human or animals. 
(5)  Any wastewater having a temperature greater than one hundred fifty (150) degrees F or sixty-five (65) degrees C, or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed one hundred four (104) degrees F (forty (40) degrees C). 
(6)  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through. 
(7)  Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
(8)  Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the city in accordance with section 29-6(e). 
(9)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance, a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(10)  Any wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent thereby violating the city's NPDES permit. Color (in combination with turbidity) shall not cause the treatment plant effluent to reduce the depth of the compensation point for photosynthetic activity by more than ten (10) percent from the seasonably established norm for aquatic life. 
(11)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except as specifically approved by the city manager in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(12)  Stormwater, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted industrial wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the city manager. 
(13)  Any sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes. 
(14)  Any medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the city manager in an industrial pretreatment user permit. 
(15)  Any wastewater causing the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test. 
(16)  Any wastes containing detergents, surface active agents, or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW. 
(17)  Any discharge of fats, oils, or grease in violation of section 29-5. 
    Wastes prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. All floor drains located in process or materials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user's pretreatment facility before connecting with the POTW. 
(b)  Federal categorical pretreatment standards. The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 and hereafter amended are hereby incorporated. 
(c)  State pretreatment requirements. The State of Missouri Pretreatment Standards found at 10 CSR Division 20-6.100 and hereafter amended are hereby incorporated. 
(d)  Specific pollutant limitations. The city will evaluate annually the need for local limits as determined by MoDNR. 
(e)  City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in industrial pretreatment user permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives in section 29-3 of this article or the general and specific prohibitions in section 29-4(a) of this article. 
(f)  Special agreements. The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with industrial users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from categorical pretreatment standard from EPA. Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13. 
(g)  Dilution. No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The city manager may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 29-5. - Fat, oil, and grease control. 
(a)  Scope and purposes. The objective of this section is to aid in preventing the introduction and accumulation of fats, oils, and greases into the municipal wastewater system which will or tend to cause or contribute to sanitary sewer blockages and obstructions. Food service establishments and other industrial, institutional or commercial establishments generating wastewater containing fats, oils or greases are subject to this section. This section regulates such users by requiring that grease interceptors and other approved strategies be installed, implemented, and maintained in accordance with the provisions hereof. Existing grease traps or interceptors that are in good repair and functioning properly may be exempt from grease trap location requirements until such time that the establishment changes ownership, undergoes a major remodel, change of purpose, or fails to meet discharge action levels. 
(b)  Grease interceptor installation, inspection, maintenance, record-keeping, and grease removal. 
(1)  Grease interceptors shall be installed and maintained at the user's expense, when a user operates a food service establishment. Grease interceptors may be required in noncooking or cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs establishments and other industrial or commercial establishments when the establishment generates wastewater containing fat or grease and the public works director or his designee determines an interceptor is necessary to prevent contribution or accumulation of grease to the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from subject grease interceptor to exceed an established action level of one hundred (100) milligrams per liter, expressed as hexane extractable material. Any user in violation of these limits shall be subject to penalties as set out in this article. All grease interceptors shall be of a type, design, and capacity approved by the public works director or his designee and shall be readily and easily accessible for maintenance and repair, including cleaning and for inspection. All grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but not less often than every sixty (60) days or as permitted in a valid program modification. Users who are required to pass wastewater through a grease interceptor shall: 
a.  Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of twenty-four (24) minutes at actual peak flow between the influent and effluent baffles, with twenty-five (25) percent of the total volume of the grease interceptor being allowed for any food-derived solids to settle or accumulate and floatable grease-derived materials to rise and accumulate, identified hereafter as a solids blanket and grease cap respectively. 
b.  Remove any accumulated grease cap and solids blanket as required, but at intervals of not longer than sixty (60) days at the user's expense, or in accordance with a valid program modification or other public works director or his designee's requirements. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials, such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, styrofoam, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle into this solids blanket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the grease interceptor. 
c.  Operate and maintain the grease interceptor to achieve and maintain any applicable grease action level. This shall mean any wastewater sample taken from such grease interceptor must meet the terms of numerical limit attainment described in section 29-5(b)(1). 
d.  If a user documents that conditions exist ("space constraints") on their establishment site that limit the ability to locate a grease interceptor on the exterior of the establishment, the user may request an interior location for the interceptor. Such request shall contain the following information: 
1.  Location of city sewer main and easement in relation to available exterior space outside building. 
2.  Existing plumbing layout at or in a site. 
3.  A statement of understanding, signed by the user or authorized agent, acknowledging and accepting conditions the public works director or his designee may place on permitting an identified interior location. Conditions may include requirements to use alternative mechanisms, devices, procedures, or operations relative to an interior location. 
4.  Grant of access to interceptor for city inspection. 
5.  Such other information as may be required by the public works director or his designee. 
e.  The use of biological or other additives as a grease degradation or conditioning agent is not permissible. 
f.  The use of automatic grease removal systems is permissible only upon prior written approval of the public works director or his designee and the Cape Girardeau County Public Health Center Director or designee. Any user using a grease interceptor located on the interior of the site shall be subject to any operational requirements set forth by the City of Cape Girardeau. Any user using this equipment shall operate the system in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the unit's outlet, is achieved as required by the public works director or his designee. 
g.  The public works director or his designee may make determinations of grease interceptor adequacy need, design, appropriateness, application, location, modification(s), and conditional usage based on review of all relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance, facility site and building plan review by all regulatory reviewing agencies and may require repairs to, or modification or replacement of grease interceptors. 
h.  The user shall allow access to the public works director or his designee for the purpose of determining compliance with this article. 
(2)  The user shall maintain a written record of grease interceptor maintenance for three (3) years. All such records will be available for inspection at all times. These records shall include: 
a.  FSE name and physical location; 
b.  Date of grease interceptor service; 
c.  Time of grease interceptor service; 
d.  Name of grease interceptor service company; 
e.  Name and signature of grease interceptor service company agent performing said service; 
f.  Established service frequency and type of service; 
g.  Number and size of each grease interceptor serviced at FSE location; 
h.  Approximated amount, per best professional judgment of contract service provider, of grease and solids removed from each grease interceptor;

(2)  The city manager may issue an industrial pretreatment user permit under section 29-7(h) or modify an existing discharge permit under section 29-8(d). 
(3)  No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and unless the city manager has responded to the industrial user's notice. 
(4)  For purpose of this requirement flow increases of ten (10) percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants shall be deemed significant. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in section 29-4(a) of this article), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the city manager of the incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user. 
(2)  Within five (5) days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the city manager, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article. 
(3)  Failure to notify the city manager of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this article. 
(4)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (1), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(5)  Significant industrial users are required to notify the city manager immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(g)  Reports from nonsignificant industrial users. All industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain an industrial pretreatment user permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the city manager may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the city manager within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city manager within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the city performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and MDNR Waste Management Program Director in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under section 29-9(e), above. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of section 29-9(a), (c) and (d) above. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph 29-9(a) of this subsection during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. 
Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and the MDNR Waste Management Program Director of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of an industrial pretreatment user permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(k)  Sample collection. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsection (2) and (3) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city manager. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City of Cape Girardeau, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City of Cape Girardeau, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports required in section 29-9 [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city manager may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs section 29-9(k) (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(l)  Determination of noncompliance. The city manager may use a grab sample to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards. 
(m)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(n)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this ordinance, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the City of Cape Girardeau, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city manager. 
(Ord. No. 4779, art. 3, 10-19-15) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4779, art. 3, adopted Oct. 19, 2015, repealed the former § 29-9, and enacted a new section as set out herein. The former § 29-9 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, adopted Aug. 15, 2011. 
Sec. 29-10. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Inspection and sampling. The city shall have the right to enter the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article, and any permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements thereof. Industrial users shall allow the city manager or his representative ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where an industrial user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel the city, state, and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The city, state, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the industrial user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The city may require the industrial user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the industrial user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated periodically to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the city manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the industrial user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing city personnel access to the industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
(6)  While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in section 29-10(a), the city manager or duly authorized employees of the city shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company. 
(b)  Search warrants. If the city manager has been refused access to a building, structure or property or any part thereof, and if the city manager has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article or that there is need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then upon application by the city attorney, the municipal court judge of the city shall issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing therein the specific location subject to warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything, may be searched and/or seized on the property by the city manager in the company of a uniformed police office of the city. In the event of an emergency affecting public safety, inspections shall be made without the issuance of a warrant. 
(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 29-11. - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, surveys, industrial pretreatment user permit applications, industrial pretreatment user permits, and monitoring programs, and from the city inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the industrial user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city manager, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 29-12. - Publication of industrial users in significant noncompliance. 
    The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the industrial users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 29-13. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the city manager finds that any user has violated or is violating this article, an industrial pretreatment user permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the city manager or his agent may serve upon said user a written notice of violation. Within five (5) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability from any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The city manager is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any industrial user responsible for noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 29-13(d) and 29-13(e) below and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The city manager may order any user which causes or contributes to violation(s) of this article, industrial pretreatment user permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the city manager and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Compliance orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this article, industrial pretreatment user permits or, orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within thirty (30) days. If the user does not come into compliance within thirty (30) days, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the city manager finds that a user is violating this article, the user's industrial pretreatment user permit, any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements. 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Administrative penalty. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other section of this article, any user that is found to have violated the cease and desist order issued by the city manager shall be penalized in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Such penalties shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, penalties shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  Unpaid penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten (10) percent of the unpaid balance and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate ten (10) percent per month. A lien against the individual user property will be sought for unpaid charges and penalties. 
(3)  Users desiring to dispute such penalty must file a written request for the city manager to reconsider the penalty along with full payment of the penalty amount within sixty (60) days of being notified of the penalty. Where a request has merit, the city manager shall convene a hearing on the matter within thirty (30) days of receiving the request from the industrial user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment together with any interest accruing thereto shall be returned to the industrial user. The city manager may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions such as notices and orders to the penalty. 
(4)  Issuance of an administrative penalty shall not be prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in section 29-13(h) are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the city manager, prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under section 29-13(c) and (h). 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. In addition to those provisions in section 29-8(f) of this article, any user that violates the following conditions of this article, industrial pretreatment user permits, or orders issued hereunder, is subject to discharge termination. 
(1)  Violation of industrial pretreatment user permit conditions. 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge. 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge. 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling. 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 29-4 of this article. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 29-13(c) of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. 
(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 29-14. - Judicial enforcement; remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this article, industrial pretreatment user permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the city manager may petition the appropriate court through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the industrial pretreatment user permit, order or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the industrial user. Such other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by the city. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  Any user which has violated or continues to violate this article, any order or industrial pretreatment user permit hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city manager for a maximum penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation per day. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The city manager may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  Any user that willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, any orders or industrial pretreatment user permits issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than three (3) months or both. 
(2)  Any user that willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least five hundred dollars ($500.00) and/or be subject to imprisonment for three (3) months. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(3)  Any user knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, industrial pretreatment user permit or order, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a penalty of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than three (3) months or both. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The provisions in sections 29-12 through 29-15 are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right to take other action against any user when circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently. 
(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 29-15. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(a)  Liability insurance. The city manager may decline to reissue an industrial pretreatment user permit to any user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this article, any order, or a previous industrial pretreatment user permit issued hereunder, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by this discharge. 
(b)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this article, orders, or industrial pretreatment user permits issued hereunder, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(c)  Public nuisances. Any violation of this article, industrial pretreatment user permits, or orders issued hereunder, is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the city manager. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the City Code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 29-16. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purpose of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (3) are met. 
(3)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
c.  The industrial user submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance. 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue. 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
4.  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
5.  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
6.  The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. The requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(b)  General/specific prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 29-4(a) of this article if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharge from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during the pass through or interference, or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section. 
a.  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass if possible. 
b.  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it became aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided with five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(2)  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (2) of this section. 
(3)  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (3)a. of this section. 
(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 29-17. - Miscellaneous provisions.

(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11; Ord. No. 4345, art. 1, 8-6-12) 
Sec. 29-30. - Sewer service charges. 
(a)  Levied. There is hereby levied on each sewage system user having any sewer connection with the sewage system of the city or otherwise discharging sewage, industrial waste, or other liquids, either directly or indirectly into the city's sewage system, a sewage service charge. Subject to the exceptions provided in this chapter, such charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used in or on the premises as the same is measured by a water or sewage meter or meters approved by the city. Additional charges for extra strength sewage, toxic pollutants, and wastewater monitoring will be levied where applicable. 
(b)  Basic sewer service charge. Each user of the sewage system of the city shall pay for the use of such system based on the following schedule of rates: 
User Charge Portion Capital Charge Portion Total Service Charge: $3.46 monthly bill $9.23 monthly bill $12.69 monthly bill Quantity Charge: All Volume $2.69/Ccf $0.43/Ccf $3.12/Ccf  
(1)  Quantity charges for residential users shall be based on the average monthly water usage during the immediate preceding months of January, February and March. When a residential user does not have a history of water usage for the immediate preceding January, February and March or when a residence is not properly metered, the quantity charge shall be computed on the basis of average water usage for the entire residential class. Charges for commercial and industrial users shall be based on one hundred (100) percent of the monthly metered water used except as otherwise provided in section 29-31. 
(2)  Beginning July 1, 2017, temporary construction users of the sewage system of the city shall pay for the use of such system based on the following schedule of rates: 
User Charge Portion Capital Charge Portion Total Service Charge: $3.46 monthly bill $9.23 monthly bill $12.69 monthly bill  
(c)  Extra strength charge. Wastewater discharged to the sewage system from commercial or industrial users shall be subject to an extra strength charge when the BOD or suspended solids concentration exceeds three hundred (300) milligrams per liter (mg/l) by weight. All analyses shall be performed on composite samples collected at no less than hourly intervals over a twenty-four-hour period. Extra strength charges shall be calculated based on one hundred (100) percent of metered water use, except as otherwise provided in section 29-31, in accordance with the following formula: 
S = Vs x 0.00637 x [$0.116 (BOD - 300) + $0.094 (SS-300)] 
Where: 
S = Surcharge in dollars monthly. Vs = Sewage volume in one hundred (100) cubic feet per month. 0.00637 = Conversion factor for one hundred (100) cubic feet to million pounds. $0.116 = Unit charge for BOD in dollars per pound; of which $0.112 represents the user charge portion and $0.004 represents capital charges. BOD = BOD strength index in mg/l by weight. 300 = Allowed BOD and suspended solids strengths in mg/l by weight. $0.094 = Unit charge for suspended solids in dollars per pound; of which $0.092 represents the user charge portion and $0.002 represents capital charges. SS = Suspended solids strength index in mg/l by weight.  
(d)  Monitoring charge. When regulations as set forth by federal, state and city require monitoring of the waste from a commercial or industrial user whether for strength calculations or for national pollutant discharge elimination system compliance, that user shall pay a monitoring charge. The monitoring charge shall consist of all costs for personnel, material and equipment used to collect and analyze samples from the user's sewage. The exact charge shall be based on actual costs and shall be determined by the city. 
(e)  Toxic pollutant charge. Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing effluent or sludge from the city's treatment system shall pay for such increased costs. 
(Ord. No. 4981, art. 3, 6-19-17) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 4981, art. 3, adopted June 19, 2017, repealed the former § 29-30 and enacted a new section as set out herein. The former § 29-30 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 4864, art. 1, adopted June 20, 2016. 
Sec. 29-31. - Determination of amount of use. 
(a)  The amount of sewage discharged to the sewage system of the city shall be determined by the quantity of water metered to the user. In the case of a single user whose water usage is measured by several meters, the total water usage for all the meters shall be the basis on which sewer service charges are computed and not on the basis of each separate meter reading. Each person from whose property or premises sewage in any quantity is discharged into the sewage system of the city but whose water usage is not metered, is hereby required to meter, at its source, at their own expense, the quantity of water used, with an appropriate meter to be approved by the city, and to pay a monthly sewer service charge based upon the amount of water thus metered, to be computed in like manner as provided in section 29-30. 
(b)  If a commercial or industrial user desires to establish eligibility for a sewage service volume base of less than one hundred (100) percent of monthly water usage he may at his sole expense: 
(1)  Install a sewage meter acceptable to the city to measure the volume of liquid actually discharged into the sewage system from his premises. Such meter shall be maintained and calibrated by the user and the readings from the meter shall be taken at least once monthly and shall be provided to the city on a monthly basis. In the event a sewage meter is installed, the rate schedule as set forth in section 29-30 shall be applied to: 
a.  The volume of sewage entering the sewage system as measured by the meter; or 
b.  A calculated volume based on the percentage of metered water usage discharged to the sewage system as determined by the historical comparison of water usage and metered sewage. 
(2)  In lieu of a sewage meter the user may install auxiliary water meter(s) to measure that portion of water used which is diverted from entering the sewage system. In the event an auxiliary water meter is installed the volume of water metered by such meter(s) shall be deducted from the total volume of water usage before the sewer service rate schedule is applied. 
(c)  No refunds, allowances or reductions from the one hundred (100) percent water use base will be granted commercial or industrial users for any time period prior to approval of a sewage metering or diverted water metering system. 
(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 29-32. - Determination of extra strength. 
(a)  The city will perform analyses at intervals no greater than twelve (12) months to determine the strength of sewage discharged by commercial and industrial users who discharge an annual average volume of twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons or more of sewage per day and whose wastes are subject to extra strength charges. Industrial and commercial users who discharge an average of less than twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons per day and whose wastes are subject to extra strength charges shall have their wastes analyzed as often as deemed necessary by the city to obtain representative samples. 
(b)  If any industrial or commercial user chooses not to accept the analytical determination made by the city they may at their sole expense employ an independent laboratory, acceptable to the city, to conduct sampling and analysis of their sewage. The time period and location for the collection of the samples shall be designated by the city. The city and the independent laboratory shall both preside over the collection of the samples and shall equally divide the final composite so that duplicate analyses may be made. 
(c)  If results of the analyses of the sewage sample made by both the city and the independent laboratory are not comparable, the city may appoint a second independent laboratory to analyze the sewage. The sampling procedures used will be the same as those outlined above. The results of these analyses together with the previous results shall be used to determine the actual extra strength charges. The fee for the second independent laboratory analysis shall be shared equally between the city and the user. 
(d)  If any industrial or commercial user improves the quality of their discharged sewage, the city will reevaluate the strength of the sewage if requested to do so by the user. The user will pay an additional monitoring charge for the necessary sampling and analysis. 
(e)  The city shall have the right to enter into all premises served by the sewage system of the city, for the purpose of inspecting, reading or otherwise examining all meters and appurtenances involved in the recording of water received on the premises or sewage discharged therefrom, or to collect samples for analysis of sewage discharged therefrom. If the city is denied entry to any such premises it may disconnect sewer services for such premises from the city's sewage system.

If the last day for remittance falls upon a weekend or holiday, or any other day when the offices of the department, regularly used for the payment of customer bills, are not open to the general public, the final payment date shall be extended through to the close of the next business day. The date of payment for remittance through the mail shall be the date on which the department receives the remittance. All accounts which become delinquent shall be charged a ten (10) percent penalty. 
(c)  The city finance director shall keep a list of all delinquent sewage service accounts. The list shall include a legal description of the real property enjoying the use of the sewage system and the amount of the sewage charge plus penalty remaining unpaid. Delinquent sewage service accounts so listed shall constitute a lien upon the real property so served. The lien shall be enforced and the amounts owing shall be collected in the same manner as delinquent real estate taxes. 
(Ord. No. 4255, art. 1, 8-15-11) 
Sec. 29-35. - Disconnection. 
    In the event an account declared delinquent has not been paid in full within three (3) months of the initial due date, the city may disconnect sewer services from such premises from the city's sewer system. The location of the disconnection shall be at the discretion of the city. The sewer may be reconnected to the city's sewage system by the affected property owner, who shall bear the entire expense of all costs for the reconnection, providing the delinquent account has been paid in full and that the city has been reimbursed in full for all costs borne by the city resulting from disconnecting the sewer.

(c)  Water service lines to previously unserved properties or to properties previously served by an inadequate or combined service line shall be installed by the department from the water main to the customer's property line upon application and only after all requirements for water main extension and payment have been met. At the time service is available at the property line, the customer shall connect within sixty (60) days. Such installation shall include the pipe, fittings, valves, meter riser, meter box and all related appurtenances, as well as preparation of the main for water tap along with associated work such as excavation, backfill, permits, removal, repair and maintenance of paving on surface. 
(d)  The customer shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of the customer's water installation from the property line regardless of meter location. All such installation shall be performed by a licensed plumber and shall be subject to standards specifications. The customer's water installation shall be subject to inspection and approved by the city. 
(e)  Only department personnel shall be permitted to make service taps on the main except as otherwise specifically approved in writing by the department. 
(f)  Water service lines to previously unserved properties or to properties previously served by an inadequate, combined or noncity owned service line shall be subject to payment of connection and tapping fees as provided for in this section, or otherwise approved by the city manager. The required fees for tapping and water line installation to the property line shall be as follows and shall be paid at the time of application. The city may demand payment in cash. 
(1)  Tapping fee (applies to all customer connections): For all pipe sizes, the fee shall be the actual cost of materials, including the meter box, riser, meter, and where applicable, a pressure reducing valve, plus twenty (20) percent of the material cost for overhead.

(c)  When it is impractical to install the meter box at the property line, as determined by the city manager, the water meter may be installed elsewhere on the property to be served, provided it is protected from damage or freezing and is readily accessible. Such an installation location does not change maintenance responsibility of the customer's water installation. If a meter is determined by the department to be inaccessible for reading or maintenance, the customer must make provision for its relocation or for a remote reading device as directed by the department and may be charged for costs incurred for such work. If customer landscaping or property improvements render a meter inaccessible, the customer will move such obstructions as directed to the satisfaction of the department. Regardless of its location, the customer shall be responsible for damage to the meter appurtenances, caused by the customer's negligence or failure to properly safeguard and protect such meter and appurtenances from hazards.

In case of disapproval the commission shall communicate its reasons to the council, and the council, by vote of not less than two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of its entire membership, may overrule the disapproval and, upon the overruling, the council or the appropriate board or officer may proceed, except that if the public facility or utility is one the authorization or financing of which does not fall within the province of the council, then the submission to the commission shall be by the board having jurisdiction, and the commission's disapproval may be overruled by that board by a vote of not less than two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of its entire membership. The acceptance, widening, removal, extension, relocation, narrowing, vacation, abandonment, change of use, acquisition of land for, sale or lease of any street or other public facility is subject to similar submission and approval, and the failure to approve may be similarly overruled. The failure of the commission to act within sixty (60) days after the date of official submission to it shall be deemed approval. 
(l)  Commission to make recommendations to council on plats; when. When the commission adopts a city plan which includes at least a major street plan or progresses in its city planning to the making and adoption of a major street plan, and files a certified copy of the major street plan in the office of the county recorder, no plat of a subdivision of land lying within the city shall be filed or recorded until it has been submitted to and a report and recommendation thereon made by the commission to the city council and the council has approved the plat as provided by law. 
(m)  Regulations governing subdivision of land, contents, public hearings. The commission shall recommend and the council may by ordinance adopt regulations governing the subdivision of land within its jurisdiction. The regulations, in addition to the requirements provided by law for the approval of plats, may provide requirements for the coordinated development of the city; for the coordination of streets within subdivisions with other existing or planned streets or with other features of the city plan or official map of the city; for adequate open spaces for traffic, recreation, light and air; and for a distribution of population and traffic. 
    The regulation may include requirements as to the extent and the manner in which the streets of the subdivision or any designated portions thereto shall be graded and improved as well as including requirements as to the extent and manner of the installation of all utility facilities, and compliance with all of these requirements is a condition precedent to the approval of the plat. The regulations or practice of the council may provide for the tentative approval of the plat previous to the improvements and installation; but any tentative approval shall not be entered on the plat. The regulations may provide that, in lieu of the completion of the work and installations previous to the final approval of a plat, the council may accept a bond in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it, providing for and securing the actual construction and installation of the improvements and utilities within a period specified by the council and expressly in the bond; and the council may enforce the bond by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. The regulations may provide, in lieu of the completion of the work and installations previous to the final approval of a plat, for an assessment or other method whereby the council is put in an assured position to do the work and make the installations at the cost of the owners of the property within the subdivision. The regulations may provide for the dedication, reservation or acquisition of lands and open spaces necessary for public uses indicated on the city plan and for appropriate means of providing for the compensation, including reasonable charges against the subdivision, if any, and over a period of time and in a manner as is in the public interest. 
    Before adoption of its subdivision regulations or any amendment thereof, a duly advertised public hearing thereon shall be held by the council. 
(n)  Upon complying with the provisions of section 30-202(m). 
(1)  Commission to approve plats; when. Within sixty (60) days after the submission of a plat to the commission, the commission shall approve or disapprove the plat; otherwise the plat is deemed approved by the commission, except that the commission, with the consent of the applicant for the approval, may extend the sixty-day period. The ground of disapproval of any plat by the commission shall be made a matter of record. 
(2)  Commission approval of plats; effects. The approval of a plat by the commission does not constitute or effect an acceptance by the city or public of the dedication to public use of any street or other ground shown upon the plat. 
(3)  Approval of plats required for recording. No county recorder shall receive for filing or recording any subdivision plat required to be approved by city council or commission unless the plat has endorsed upon it the approval of the city council under the hand of the clerk and the seal of the city, or by the secretary of the commission. 
(4)  Use of unapproved plat in sale of land; penalty, vacation or injunction of transfer. No owner, or agent of the owner, of any land located within the platting jurisdiction of the city, knowingly or with intent to defraud, may transfer, sell, agree to sell, or negotiate to sell that land by reference to or by other use of a plat of any purported subdivision of the land before the plat has been approved by the council or commission and recorded in the office of the county recorder. Any person violating the provisions of this section shall forfeit and pay to the city a penalty not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00) for each lot transferred or sold or agreed or negotiated to be sold; and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from this penalty. The city may enjoin or vacate the transfer or sale or agreement by legal action, and may recover the penalty in such action. 
(5)  Public improvements; how approved after adoption of major street plan. Upon adoption of a major street plan and subdivision regulations, the city shall not accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave or light any street, lay or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections or other utilities in any street within the city unless the street has received the legal status of a public street prior to the adoption of a city plan; or unless the street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by the council or commission or on a street plan made by and adopted by the commission. The council may locate and construct or may accept any other street if the ordinance or other measure for the location and construction or for the acceptance is first submitted to the commission for its approval and approved by the commission or, if disapproved by the commission, is passed by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the entire membership of the council. 
(o)  No building permitted on streets not conforming to major street plan. After the adoption of a major street plan, no building permit shall be issued for and no building shall be erected on any lot within the territorial jurisdiction of the commission unless the street giving access to the lot upon which the building is proposed to be placed conforms to the requirements of section 30-202(n). 
(p)  Establishment of building lines; board of adjustment. Whenever a plan for major streets has been adopted, the council, upon recommendation of the commission, is authorized and empowered to establish, regulate and limit and amend, by ordinance, building or setback lines on major streets, and to prohibit any new building being located within building or setback lines. When a plan for proposed major streets or other public improvements has been adopted, the council is authorized to prohibit any new building being located within the proposed site or right-of-way when the centerline of the proposed street or the limits of the proposed sites have been carefully determined and are accurately delineated on maps approved by the commission and adopted by the council. The regulations of this section shall not be adopted, changed, or amended until a public hearing has been held thereon as provided in section 30-202(j).

Editor's note- Ord. No. 5012, art. 2, adopted Oct. 2, 2017, repealed the former § 30-203 and enacted a new section as set out herein.

Sec. 30-204. - Board of adjustment; created; composition, term, removal of members; rules, quorums, officers, meetings, records; appeals; powers. 
(a)  A board of adjustment is hereby created. The board shall consist of five (5) members, who shall be freeholders, appointed by the mayor and approved by the city council. Except as otherwise provided in section 2-98, members of the board of adjustment shall serve terms of five (5) years, beginning on the seventh day of March. All members' terms shall be staggered so that one (1) member's term shall expire each year. Three (3) alternate members may be appointed to serve in the absence of, or the disqualification of, the regular members. Except as otherwise provided in section 2-98, these alternate members shall be appointed for a term of five (5) years each, beginning on the fifth day of September. All alternate members' terms shall begin and end on the same date. Any regular or alternate members shall be removable for cause by the mayor and city council upon written charges and after public hearing. 
(b)  The board of adjustment shall adopt rules for the conduct of business, and keep a public record of all findings and decisions. The board of adjustment shall meet annually in the month of April to elect officers. Meetings of the board shall also be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. Each session of the Board of Adjustment, at which an appeal is to be heard, shall be a public meeting with public notice of such meeting and business to be carried on published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, at least one (1) time seven (7) days prior to the meeting. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the building official or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under these regulations. 
(c)  Appeals to the board of adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the building official. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the building official and with the board of adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. A fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall accompany all notices of appeal. The building official shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
(d)  The board of adjustment shall have the following powers: 
(1)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the building official in the enforcement of this chapter and may affirm or reverse, in whole or part, such decision of the enforcement officer. 
(2)  To hear requests for variances from the literal provisions of this chapter in instances where strict enforcement of this chapter would cause undue hardship due to circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration and grant such variances only when it is demonstrated that such action will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of this chapter. the board of adjustment must determine that the alleged hardship has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property, and the particular circumstances involved would result in an undue hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out. The board of adjustment may impose conditions in the granting of the variances to insure compliance and to protect adjacent property. 
(3)  To hold a public hearing on, and decide the following exceptions to or variations of this article: 
a.  To permit the extension of the district where the boundary line thereof divides a lot held in a single ownership at the time of adoption of this article.

c.  Vary the yard regulations where there is an exceptional or unusual physical condition of a lot, not generally prevalent in the neighborhood, which condition, when related to the yard regulations of this article, would prevent a reasonable or sensible arrangement of buildings on a lot. 
d.  Vary the parking regulations by not more than fifty (50) percent where it is conclusively shown that the specific use of a building would make unnecessary the parking spaces otherwise required by the City Code, or where it can be conclusively shown that adequate off-street parking to serve a particular use has been provided by or is controlled by the city. 
e.  Vary the requirement for off-street parking space in the front yard of any R district, or any other district when the property is used for residential purposes, to allow a driveway providing access to a residential space other than a garage, carport or other parking area behind the front yard, but only within secondary front yards required on corner lots, and for the purpose of providing access for handicapped residents. 
In granting such a variance, the board of adjustment may also stipulate that the drive may be used for access only and that no long term (four (4) hours or more) parking of vehicles be permitted. 
(e)  Decision of the board in respect to the above shall be subject to appeal to the circuit court of the county within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board. 
(f)  In the event that any application is denied by the board, a reapplication for the purposes of further review of the same application shall not be accepted by the board until six (6) months following the date of final action on the original application has elapsed, unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of the building official that substantial new evidence not available during the review of the original application will be presented. 
(g)  Any variance granted by the board of adjustment shall be valid for a period no greater than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date upon which the variance is granted, unless within such period: 
(1)  A building permit is obtained and the construction, or the alteration, of the structure is commenced and pursued diligently toward completion. 
(2)  A certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use or occupancy commenced. The board may grant extensions not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days, upon written application, without notice or public hearing.

(Ord. No. 5012, art. 5, 10-2-17) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 5012, art. 5, adopted Oct. 2, 2017, repealed the former § 30-336 and enacted a new section as set out herein. The former § 30-336 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 4109, art. 2, adopted March 1, 2010; Ord. No. 4149, art. 4, adopted Aug. 16, 2010; and Ord. No. 4206, arts. 8, 25, 26, adopted March 7, 2011. 
Sec. 30-340. - Other districts. 
Sec. 30-341. - PD, planned development district. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the planned development district is to provide for greater flexibility in the development of land that is not possible to achieve in conventional zoning districts. This district is intended to encourage a more creative and innovative design and to promote a more desirable community. The objectives of the planned development district are: 
(1)  Promote site planning that better adapts to site conditions and surrounding properties. 
(2)  Allow for a diversity of uses permitted and variation in uses, structures, open space and height of structures. 
(3)  Promote the creation of open space areas and the preservation of natural features of a development site. 
(4)  Ensure efficient and effective traffic circulation. 
    Planned development districts can allow for flexibility in terms of density, uses and bulk regulations. These districts should be designed to lessen congestion in the streets, to secure public safety, to promote the health and general welfare of the public, to prevent the overcrowding of land, to preserve natural features, and to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewage, schools and parks. 
    Approval of a planned development district, also known as a "PD district," shall constitute an amendment to the zoning ordinance. Designation of a property as a PD district in accordance with an approved development plan shall supersede all existing and prior zoning classifications. All properties receiving this designation shall for zoning purposes be identified by the letters "PD" followed by an identifying number. A development plan shall be approved in conjunction with the rezoning of a tract to the PD district. The development plan shall specify both for the project as a whole and for subareas within the project, as appropriate, those principal and accessory uses and development densities that are to be permitted. The city council may include or exclude uses from the development plan, or include uses with attached conditions as appropriate, to achieve the intent of these provisions. In making its determination of the uses and development densities to be permitted within the PD district, the council may consider the compatibility and relationship of uses within the project, the compatibility and relationship of permitted uses adjoining or in proximity to the PD district, the appropriateness of permitted uses for the area in general and their overall impact on the community, and the consistency of the permitted uses with other adopted plans and policies. 
(b)  General standards. The approved final development plan shall provide detail regarding density, lot dimensions, maximum height of structures, setbacks, and the provision of off-street parking and loading spaces. No planned development district shall be allowed which would result in: 
(1)  Inadequate or unsafe vehicular access; 
(2)  An undue burden on public parks, recreation areas, schools, or the provision of other city services; 
(3)  Substantial detriment to the surrounding area; or 
(4)  Otherwise create substantial adverse impacts on the public health, safety or welfare. 
    It shall be the responsibility of the applicant for a planned development district to demonstrate that the above factors are avoided or mitigated to a level that is acceptable to the city. Planned development districts are to be used solely for new development of vacant land or the redevelopment of existing commercial or residential uses. Planned development districts are not to be used to obtain approval for uses in existing development that are not permitted under the property's existing zoning district. Standards which vary from those contained in chapter 25, Development Code, may be approved in a preliminary development plan or final development plan. If approved, these variances would not need approval from the board of adjustment. Any use that requires a special use permit under a property's existing zoning district may be included as a use in the planned development district if it otherwise satisfies the requirement of the special use. 
(c)  Minimum district size. The minimum site size for a planned development (PD) district shall be three (3) acres. 
(d)  Application and process. An application for approval of a development plan and PD zoning may be filed by the owner of the property which is the subject of the application. Applications for PD district designation shall be processed pursuant to a three-step review process as specified in this section. The three-step process shall include: 
(1)  A sketch plan; 
(2)  A preliminary development plan; and 
(3)  A final development plan. 
(e)  Sketch plan. Prior to filing a preliminary development plan, the applicant shall prepare a sketch plan of the proposed planned development for review by the director of development services, and such other city staff as the director may desire. The director of development services shall coordinate sketch plan review of the proposed planned development. Upon completion of the sketch plan review, the director of development services shall provide the applicant with written comments with respect to the proposed planned development and shall also provide such recommendations as may inform and assist the applicant in preparing an application for approval of a PD district. 
(f)  Preliminary development plan. The preliminary development plan is intended to provide the applicant with an opportunity to submit a plan showing the basic concept, character, and nature of the entire proposed planned development without becoming involved in the preparation of detailed development plans or engineering drawings. In order to permit the city and the applicant to proceed with some assurance, approval of the preliminary development plan binds the applicant and the city with respect to the following development constraints: 
(1)  Categories of uses to be permitted; 
(2)  Overall maximum density of residential uses and intensity of nonresidential uses; 
(3)  General location of vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems; 
(4)  General location and extent of public and private open space; 
(5)  General location of residential and nonresidential land uses; and

(i)  Action by the planning and zoning commission. Within forty (40) days following the conclusion of the public hearing, unless a delay is requested by the applicant, the planning and zoning commission shall transmit to the city council its recommendation that the preliminary development plan either be approved, be approved subject to modifications, or not be approved. In considering the preliminary development plan and formulating its recommendation, the planning and zoning commission shall be guided by the standards set forth in this section. The failure of the planning and zoning commission to act within forty (40) days following the conclusion of such hearing, or such longer period as may be agreed to by the applicant, shall be deemed a recommendation for the denial of the preliminary development plan as submitted. 
(j)  Public notice and hearing before the city council. A public hearing on the preliminary development plan shall be set and conducted by the city council within thirty (30) days of action or failure to act by the planning and zoning commission in accordance with the provisions of this section.

Within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of the public hearing, unless a delay is requested by the applicant, the city council shall either refuse to approve the preliminary development plan; shall refer it back to the planning and zoning commission for further consideration of specified matters; or shall, by ordinance duly adopted, approve the preliminary development plan, with or without modifications to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of such approval; provided, however, that if such plan is approved with modifications, no application for approval of a final development plan shall be filed or considered until the applicant has filed with the director of development services his written consent to such modifications. In the event the city council shall fail to act within the time limit herein specified, the preliminary development plan shall be deemed finally denied. 
(l)  Effect of preliminary development plan approval. Unless the applicant shall fail to meet time schedules for filing a final development plan or plans, or shall fail to proceed with development in accordance with the plans as approved, or shall in any other manner fail to comply with any condition of this section or any approval granted pursuant to it, a preliminary development plan which has been approved, or approved with modifications which have been accepted by the applicant, shall not be modified, revoked or otherwise impaired, pending the application for approval of a final development plan or plans, by any action of the city without the consent of the applicant. 
(m)  Land uses. Billboards and telecommunication towers may be approved in planned developments that contain commercial uses consistent with the permitted uses in the C-2, M-1 or M-2 districts. Any proposed billboard or telecommunication tower must be located within the commercial portion of the planned development with a minimum distance of 100 feet from any residential use within the planned development or residential use or district adjacent to the planned development. Additionally, any billboard proposed in a planned development must meet the standards contained in section 25-401. Any telecommunication tower proposed in a planned development must meet the standards contained in section 30-404. 
(n)  Density. 
(1)  For nonresidential development, the intensity of development may be regulated: 
a.  By specifying a floor area ratio (FAR) or ratios; 
b.  By specifying maximum square footage or gross leasable area; 
c.  By specifying setbacks, height and bulk restrictions; or 
d.  By a combination of the restrictions set out in subparagraph a., b. or c., hereinabove, for the project as a whole or for components or subareas within the project. In addition, nonresidential preliminary development plans may specify performance standards to be imposed on the project and restrictions regarding the location and nature of industrial, commercial, and other nonresidential activities. In making its determination regarding the intensity of development and appropriate performance standards, the city council may consider the character and scale of similar development, the character and scale of surrounding development and the area in general, and the real or anticipated impact on public facilities and services. 
(2)  The permitted number of dwelling units may be distributed in any manner over the residential portion of the project consistent with the intent and provisions of this section. The preliminary development plan shall specify distribution of residential density for the project as a whole or for subareas within the project. In making its determination regarding the distribution of residential densities, the city council may consider the compatibility of residential densities with other uses within the district as well as outside the district and the impact of residential densities on public facilities and services. 
(o)  Bulk, area and height requirements. The preliminary development plan shall specify bulk, area, and height restrictions for the project as a whole, for subareas, and for components of the project. In making its determination regarding such restrictions, the council may consider the character and scale of the proposed development as it relates to other uses and structures both within the district and outside the district, and the general character and scale of similar development within the area of the proposal. 
(p)  Open space. Common open space shall comprise at least twenty (20) percent of the gross area of the total development. Common open space shall be used for recreational, park or environmental amenity purposes for the collective enjoyment of the occupants of the development. Of the required common open space, up to one-half (1/2) of it may be covered by water, floodplain, stormwater detention/retention facilities, or left in a natural state which does not violate the nuisance provisions of the city code. To the extent practicable, common open spaces shall be distributed equitably throughout the development in relation to the dwelling units which such common open space is intended to serve. The open space shall not be relegated to only isolated areas of unusable land, but shall be highly accessible, either physically or visually, to the majority of the residents of the development. Common open space shall be maintained by a property owners association or may be conveyed to a public entity which will agree to maintain the common open space and facilities, subject to city council approval. 
(q)  Perimeter buffer requirements. Where a PD district is adjacent to an existing residential area or an area zoned for residential uses, there shall be a minimum thirty-foot wide bufferyard, which shall be free of structures or parking areas and shall be landscaped with trees and shrubs, or preserved with natural features so that the PD district is visually obscured from the abutting residential properties. All landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy, neat and weed-free growing condition. 
(r)  Public facilities. The preliminary development plan shall specify conditions, restrictions and standards relating to the timely provision of necessary public facilities. In making its determination regarding such conditions, restrictions and standards, the city council may consider the adequacy of existing facilities, the timely provision of adequate facilities, the impact of the proposed development on existing and planned facilities, and the overall cost to the community. 
(s)  Access to public thoroughfares. The preliminary development plan shall specify the location and general design of ingress and egress to the project along with any proposed access restrictions. The city council may impose such access standards and restrictions as are necessary to protect the integrity and function of the city's thoroughfare system and to ensure the safe and efficient circulation of vehicles and pedestrians within the PD district. In making its determination regarding such access standards and restrictions, the city council may consider the classification and function of the thoroughfare system, existing and projected volumes, the condition and design of the affected thoroughfares, the effect of the proposed development on traffic flow and circulation patterns, and the consistency with other adopted plans and policies. 
(t)  Final development plan; purpose. The final development plan is intended to provide more detail, and to refine and implement the preliminary development plan. A final development plan may be submitted for the entire planned development or in phases as approved in the preliminary development plan. When approving the preliminary development plan, the city council may permit review and approval of the final development plan in its entirety or for specified portions of the project by the planning and zoning commission. 
(1)  Application. Upon approval of the preliminary development plan, the applicant shall submit an application for final development plan approval to the director of development services. The application for final development plan may include the entire area included in the approved preliminary development plan or one (1) or more stages or phases thereof in accordance with a staging plan approved as part of the preliminary development plan.

f.  Significantly alters the arrangement of land uses within the planned development. 
g.  Violates any provision of the codes and ordinances applicable to the proposed planned development, or 
h.  Departs from the preliminary development plan in any other manner which the planning and zoning commission or city council shall, based on stated findings and conclusions, find to materially alter the plan or concept for the proposed planned development. 
(3)  Action by planning and zoning commission. Within forty (40) days following the submission of a complete application for the final development plan, or such longer period as may be agreed to by the applicant, the planning and zoning commission shall review the plan with respect to its conformity to the approved preliminary development plan; with respect to the merit or lack of merit of any departure of the final development plan from substantial conformity with the preliminary development plan; and with respect to compliance of the final development plan with any conditions imposed by approval of the preliminary development plan, and with the provisions of this section and all other applicable federal, state and city codes, ordinances and regulations. 
If the planning and zoning commission finds that there is substantial conformity between such plans, and shall further find the final development plan to be in all other respects complete and in compliance with any conditions imposed by approval of the preliminary development plan, and with the provisions of the section and all other applicable federal, state and city codes, ordinances and regulations, it shall approve the final development plan. Planning and zoning commission action shall constitute final approval of the final development plan. 
If the planning and zoning commission shall find that the final development plan lacks substantial conformity to the preliminary development plan but merits approval notwithstanding such lack of conformity, it shall transmit such plan to the city council together with its recommendation that the final development plan be approved. 
In any case where the planning and zoning commission finds that the final development plan lacks substantial conformity to the preliminary development plan and does not merit approval, it shall transmit such plan to the city council, together with its recommendation that the final development plan not be approved. The failure of the commission to act within the aforesaid time period shall be deemed a recommendation to the city council to deny the final development plan as submitted. 
(4)  Action by city council. Within forty-five (45) days, or such longer period as may be agreed to by the applicant, following the action of the planning and zoning commission, or its failure to act as provided, the city council shall either refuse to approve the final development plan, shall refer it back to the planning and zoning commission for further consideration of specified matters, or shall, by ordinance duly adopted, approve the final development plan, with or without modifications, to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of such approval. The failure of the city council to act within the aforesaid time period shall be deemed a final denial of the final development plan approval.

(1)  Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of such nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives. 
(2)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport manager to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the Cape Girardeau Regional Airport. 
(l)  Permits. 
(1)  Future uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (a), (b) and (c) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted by the building official. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with section 30-204. 
a.  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
b.  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones. 
c.  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this article except as set forth in section 30-342(i)(10). 
(2)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction, or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this article or any amendments thereto, or than it is when the application for the permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(3)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the building official determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(4)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall only be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and that the relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, and will not create a hazard to air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. In addition, such variances shall only be allowed where it is duly found that the relief granted will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the Board of Adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the airport manager for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport manager does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
(5)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purposes of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the Cape Girardeau Regional Airport at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights. 
(m)  Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the building official to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the building official upon a form published for that purpose. Applications required by this article to be submitted to the building official shall be promptly considered and granted or denied. Application for action by the board of adjustment shall be forthwith transmitted by the building official. 
(n)  Conflicting regulations. Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations prescribed in this article and any other regulations applicable to the same area, whether the conflict be with respect to the height of structures or trees, and the use of land, or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail.

A certificate of appropriateness is intended to provide for review and approval of any work to be undertaken on structures within the historic overlay zoning district or on designated local landmarks in order to ensure compliance with the city's design guidelines as based on the Secretary of the Interior's standards for historic preservation. This permit is not intended to disrupt or discourage investment in historic properties, but is intended to promote and encourage use of these established standards and guidelines for the rehabilitation, preservation, adaptive reuse, and restoration of historic resources and neighborhoods. 
(h)  Certificate of appropriateness; applicability. All properties within a historic overlay district or any property designated as a local landmark shall be subject to the provisions of this article. No application for a building permit or demolition permit for any action in a historic district shall be approved until the city council, historic preservation commission, or its designee has issued a certificate of appropriateness. A certificate of appropriateness shall be required before one (1) or more of the following actions affecting the exterior architectural appearance of any landmark or property within a historic overlay zoning district may be undertaken: 
(1)  Any construction, repair, alteration, or removal affecting an exterior architectural feature or features; 
(2)  Demolition in whole or in part of any structure; or 
(3)  Any construction, repair, alteration, removal, or demolition, in whole or in part, proposed by the city or any of its agencies or departments affecting a significant exterior architectural feature or features, or an archaeological site. 
(i)  Certificate of appropriateness; applications. Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall include the following information: 
(1)  Photographs of the existing conditions; 
(2)  Scaled drawings of proposed changes; 
(3)  List of proposed materials with dimensions; 
(4)  As necessary for review, manufacturer's literatures, material samples, site map and a structural report; and 
(5)  Any other information deemed necessary to conduct a thorough analysis of the application. 
(j)  Certificate of appropriateness; approval criteria. A certificate of appropriateness shall not be approved unless the applicant presents clear and convincing evidence that the application meets the following criteria, adapted from the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. The criteria are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility. 
(1)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide that a property will be used as it was historically, or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and special relationships. 
(2)  The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alterations of features, shapes, and relationships that characterize a property will be avoided when possible. 
(3)  Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will be discouraged. 
(4)  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be recognized and respected. 
(5)  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be treated with sensitivity. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features will be repaired, rather than replaced whenever possible. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new features should match the old in design, color, texture, and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used. 
(8)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide that archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If these resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken. 
(9)  Whenever possible, new additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall be done in such a manner that they will not destroy historic materials, features, and special relationships that characterize the property. Any new work should be differentiated from the old and be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)  Whenever possible, new additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment will be unimpaired. 
(11)  In conducting a review, the historic preservation commission may consider economic hardship and other factors that may affect an owner's ability to undertake and complete rehabilitation or other work under consideration. 
(k)  Certificate of appropriateness; review procedure. All applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be reviewed and considered within sixty (60) days of the filing of the application. Determinations will be based on the approval criteria set forth in this article and generally accepted preservation policies as determined and set forth by the historic preservation commission. 
(1)  Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the historic preservation commission and formal action shall be taken by majority vote. The historic preservation commission may delegate the review and approval or denial of a certificate of appropriateness application to the city manager or his/her designee where the application is limited to one (1) or more of the following: 
a.  Exterior changes to a building or structure arising from an emergency situation that requires immediate attention. Examples include repairs due to a storm, tornado, earthquake, flood, fire, act of vandalism, etc., where the interior of the building or structure is exposed to the weather, and there is a change in material, color, texture, finish, or other characteristic. 
b.  Temporary signs. 
Approval of such applications may only be granted if the proposed work is in compliance with the City Code. The historic preservation commission shall be notified of any applications approved or denied. 
(2)  Written notice of the approval or denial of the application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be provided to the applicant following the determination. 
(3)  Upon the approval of an application, the planning services office may, if all other applicable requirements are met, issue a certificate. The certificate may specify any conditions of approval under which the work shall be completed to be in compliance with the approved application. 
(4)  Upon the denial of an application, a statement of the reasons for denial shall accompany the written notice. The historic preservation commission shall make recommendations to the applicant concerning changes, if any, in the proposed action, which would cause the historic preservation commission to reconsider its denial. The applicant may submit an amended or revised application that takes into consideration the recommendations. 
(l)  Certificate of appropriateness; demolition. 
(1)  Demolition, in whole or in part, of individual landmarks or any primary structure within a historic district is not permitted unless a certificate of appropriateness has been obtained for that purpose. Deterioration caused by neglect or lack of routine maintenance by the existing owner does not provide grounds for the approval of demolition. Grounds for approving a certificate of appropriateness for demolition include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  The structure has been substantially damaged through fire, deterioration, or natural disaster; 
b.  The structure does not possess the integrity, originality, craftsmanship, and age to merit preservation; and 
c.  There is substantial evidence that it would not be physically or economically viable to rehabilitate the structure. 
(2)  For applications for demolition, the city should provide notice of the proposed demolition to surrounding property owners, as outlined in section 30-206(h) of this Code, and post a sign on the affected property indicating the proposed demolition. In cases of demolition, the owner shall permit access to the subject property for the purpose of inspections and/or appraisals required by the historic preservation commission or city staff. 
(3)  Applications for demolition of a landmark or primary structure shall be reviewed by the historic preservation commission and forwarded to the city council with a recommendation. The city council shall take formal action on the application. approval shall be made by resolution of the city council. 
(m)  Certificate of appropriateness; appeal procedure. An appeal of the denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be filed with the division of planning services within thirty (30) days of the date of denial. The appeal of a denial by the historic preservation commission shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission must render a decision within sixty (60) days of the filing of the appeal or the appeal shall be deemed to have been denied. It shall require a favorable vote by a majority of the members of the planning and zoning commission present at the meeting to overturn the decision of the historic preservation commission. The appeal of a denial by the city manager or his/her designee shall be reviewed by the historic preservation commission. The decision of the historic preservation commission to uphold or overturn an appeal shall not be further appealed to the planning and zoning commission. 
(n)  Certificate of appropriateness; hardship appeal procedure. 
(1)  If an appeal of the denial of a certificate of appropriateness is based solely upon hardship, proof of hardship shall be the burden of the property owner. 
(2)  Reversal of a certificate of appropriateness denial based solely upon hardship shall not be approved unless the applicant presents clear and convincing evidence that may include the following criteria: 
a.  Any deterioration or damage cited to establish hardship shall not be due to the present owner's willful act, neglect or inattention to maintenance and repairs. Evidence showing that the owner or applicant failed to maintain or protect the property, or performed or permitted any acts to the detriment of the property, may be used as a basis to reject allegations of hardship; 
b.  For income-producing property, a reasonable rate of return cannot be obtained from the property if it retains its historic features or structures in either its present condition or if its features or structures are rehabilitated; or 
c.  For non-income-producing property, the property has no beneficial use in its present condition or if rehabilitated. 
(o)  Certificate of appropriateness; stop work order. 
(1)  The director shall monitor all projects that require a certificate of appropriateness to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of a certificate of appropriateness, building permit or demolition permit. Where a project fails to comply with any part of a certificate of appropriateness or the provisions of this article, it shall be considered a violation of this Code, and the director may issue a stop work order in writing which states the violation and a deadline by which to rectify the violation. If the project fails to meet this deadline for compliance, a second stop work order may be issued in writing and delivered by certified mail, which shall set forth the terms of compliance and the penalties for violation of this article. 
(2)  Whenever the director has reason to believe that an action for which a certificate of appropriateness would be required has been initiated or is about to be initiated, he shall make every reasonable effort to contact the owners, occupants, contractor, or subcontractor and inform them of the application process. If a stop work order is determined to be necessary to halt an action that requires a certificate of appropriateness, a copy of the stop work order shall be delivered to the owners, occupants, contractors, or subcontractors. A copy of the application form shall also be included with the stop work order. 
(p)  Certificate of appropriateness; lapse in work. Approval of any certificate of appropriateness shall be effective for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days, at the end of which time a building permit, if required, shall have been issued for the action(s) so authorized. In the event that a required building permit has not been issued within one hundred eighty (180) days or at such time work is suspended or abandoned for a period exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days, the certificate of appropriateness shall be null and void, and the applicant shall be required to submit a new certificate of appropriateness application. 
(q)  Fees and penalties. The city council shall establish an appropriate system for processing fees for the review of nominations and certificates of appropriateness. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to undertake or cause an alteration, construction, demolition or removal of any nominated or designated landmark or property within a nominated or designated historic district without a certificate of appropriateness. Any person or entity convicted of violating the provisions of this section shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 30-205. 
(2)  It shall be unlawful not to maintain designated property or landmarks, or property within a designated historic district within the minimum maintenance requirements of section 30-352(t). 
(r)  District H, design guidelines. In addition to the criteria for approval of a certificate of appropriateness as set forth in this article, the following design guidelines may be used, in conjunction with design guidelines and policies adopted by the historic preservation commission in considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness and can serve as the basis for conditions of approval. These guidelines are based on accepted practices for historic preservation and are not intended to inhibit change, new construction, new architectural styles, or new technologies when these changes complement the existing buildings and streetscapes. Design review decisions shall be based on the same set of design guidelines for all properties designated by the district H, however, structures possessing a greater degree of integrity, originality, craftsmanship and historic significance may have the guidelines more stringently applied than those with lesser significance as determined by the historic preservation commission. These guidelines may be applied for all alterations, construction, demolition, or repairs affecting the exterior appearance of the property. 
(1)  New buildings and additions to existing buildings: New buildings should be compatible with the architecture of the district. Scale, placement on lots and street setback must conform to the scale, placement and setback of adjacent structures, especially in the context of rows of buildings and streetscapes. Styles of architecture will be controlled only to ensure that their exterior design, materials, and color are in harmony with neighboring structures. 
(2)  Alterations: Alterations should restore a structure's original elements, materials, and appearance, if economically or physically feasible. Alterations affecting the exterior of a structure should preserve all significant original exterior elements, including building materials, doors, windows, and decorative elements. Elements that are not original, but which may have acquired significance by virtue of age or craftsmanship, should also be preserved. Alterations that disguise or sheath original elements and materials should not be permitted. Storefronts and commercial building facades should be treated as a whole, and alterations to the first floor should be compatible with the upper floors. 
(3)  Demolition: Demolition of past additions that have disguised or sheathed original elements or facades is encouraged, as long as the intention is to restore those elements and facades. 
(4)  Relocation of buildings: Structures shall not be removed from their original site unless there is substantial evidence that it would not be practical or economical to utilize the building on its present site. If a building lies in the path of a public improvement project and if the building meets the requirements for preservation by virtue of its integrity, originality, craftsmanship or age, relocation may be considered as an alternative only after it is determined that the project cannot be altered to avoid the relocation of the historic structure. 
(5)  Exterior walls: A structure's original walls, including masonry, siding, sheathing materials, and exposed foundations, should be maintained and preserved, if feasible. Walls, siding, and sheathing materials that may not be original, but have acquired significance by virtue of age or craftsmanship, should also be maintained and preserved. These walls, siding, and sheathing materials should not be altered, covered or disguised by new building materials unless it is no longer feasible to maintain the significant materials. Masonry should not be painted or stuccoed unless it is no longer feasible to maintain the significant materials. Restoration of original walls, siding and sheathing materials is encouraged. Removal of false facades that cover or disguise original walls and materials is encouraged. 
(6)  Decorative and character defining elements: Original decorative and character defining elements and those that may not be original, but have acquired significance by virtue of age or craftsmanship should be restored, maintained, and preserved, if feasible. 
(7)  Doors and windows: Original doors and windows should not be replaced unless there is substantial evidence that they are no longer serviceable or cannot be restored. Restoration of original entryways that may have been covered, altered, or removed over time is encouraged. Replacement doors and windows that imitate an earlier inappropriate style are discouraged. In general, existing openings should not be covered or relocated, whenever possible. If additional entryways or service doors become necessary, they should be located and designed in a sensitive manner. If it is necessary to expand original openings, it should be accomplished in a manner that respects and complements the surrounding building elements, materials, and colors. 
(8)  Porches: Porches, porticos, stoops, entryways, loading docks and exterior stairways should be of a scale, design, material, and color that complement the existing facade and its individual elements. Loading docks and service entrances should be located inconspicuously and should be considered a part of a building's overall design scheme. 
(9)  Roofs: Rooflines and shapes should not be altered, if feasible. Visible roofing materials should be compatible with other building elements and materials in terms of color, materials, and texture. The use of roofing materials appropriate to the style and period of the building is encouraged. The use of roofing materials that reflect an earlier or later style or period is discouraged. 
(10)  Mechanical equipment and weather protection devices: Mechanical and weather protection devices shall be placed and installed in a manner that is unobtrusive. 
(11)  Fences, sidewalks, decorative dividers and walls: Fences and decorative walls should be placed and scaled in a manner that do not cover, block or damage significant building facades or elements. Fences and walls should be of a style or period that corresponds with the style or period of the building or buildings they serve. Original fences, walls and sidewalks and those that have acquired significance by virtue of age or craftsmanship should not be removed or destroyed and should be maintained and preserved, whenever possible. 
(12)  Vacant lots, alleys, and parking areas: Parking lots, driveways, and other spaces between and around buildings shall be designed and maintained in a manner that does not detract from neighboring buildings and facades. The creation of new parking lots, driveways and parking pads shall be done in a way to minimize their appearance and to complement the buildings they serve and the surrounding neighborhood. Garbage dumpsters, bollards, loading docks and other similar fixtures shall be structurally and cosmetically maintained and shall be placed in a manner that is as inconspicuous as possible. 
(13)  Signs and awnings: Maintenance and preservation of original signs or those that have acquired significance by virtue of age or craftsmanship is encouraged. Signs that disguise, obstruct, or detract from significant facade elements shall not be allowed. Signs and awnings shall be designed to complement the style, materials, and color of the building. Lighting and other illumination shall be properly shielded or diffused to eliminate glare. Individual building mounted lights shall be no brighter than one hundred (100) watts and be mounted no lower than six (6) feet and no higher than nine (9) feet in height.

I. - PREFACE 
    This traffic schedule reference book was compiled in December, 1983 based on the researching of ordinances dating back to commission form Ordinance #1, passed April 18, 1918. Ordinance numbers in the "List of Schedules" refer to the schedule's chapter and section number as listed in the "Code of Ordinances" for the City of Cape Girardeau. Ordinance numbers in the "Traffic Ordinances by Number" and "Traffic Ordinances by Schedule" sections refer to the numerical sequence number assigned to each ordinance when it is passed. The ordinance number prefixes are as follows: 
1.  COM - Commission form ordinance; 
2.  MAN - City manager form ordinance; 
3.  CHA - Charter form ordinance. 
    The loading zone file was created in February of 1986 using the loading zone approval form. Existing loading zones were given current approval dates even though they had been in existence for some time.
