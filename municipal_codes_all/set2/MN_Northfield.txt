PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Northfield, Minnesota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code, as supplemented through Febuary 6, 2000, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1986 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Karl Huber, Finance Director/City Clerk and Ms. Maren Swanson, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - NORTHFIELD CITY CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is Northfield City Charter, as adopted and effective on March 11, 1910. For the preparation of this part, the city furnished a copy that was amended through September 5, 1989. Subsequent amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note bearing a date after September 5, 1989 indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter, as amended through September 5, 1989. After preparation of the proofs of the Code the city furnished ordinances amendatory of the Charter commencing with Ordinance No. 499, adopted August 4, 1986. History notes have been inserted in the Charter referencing these ordinances. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines, capitalization, expression of numbers, and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
State Law reference- City charters generally, Minn. Stat. ch. 410. 

CHAPTER ONE. - PREAMBLE 

Section 1.1. - Preamble. 
    One of our nation's most cherished qualities is freedom. There can be no freedom, however, without responsibility and order. Written documents governing our nation and state governments clearly declare the right of all persons to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Accompanying statements spell out the responsibilities and order that make freedom possible. It is proper that cities also spell out the freedoms and responsibilities of their citizens that make for good order. 
    Be it hereby declared that no person in the City of Northfield shall, on the grounds of age, race, color, creed, sex, religion, national origin, marital status or status with regard to public assistance or disability be subjected to discrimination in any form. Human freedom and human rights are indivisible. If anyone is denied equality, no one is free. The following charter is a declaration of the public policy of the City of Northfield to fulfill its responsibility to treat all of its citizens equally and with good order. 
CHAPTER TWO. - NAME, BOUNDARIES, POWER AND GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Section 2.1. - Name and Boundaries. 
    The City of Northfield, Rice County and Dakota County, Minnesota, shall continue to be a municipal corporation under that name and with the same boundaries as now are or hereafter may be established. 
Section 2.2. - Powers of the City. 
    In order to promote and protect the health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience, and welfare of the inhabitants of the city, the city shall have all powers which may now or hereafter be possible for a municipal corporation in this state to exercise in harmony with the constitutions of this state and of the United States. It is the intention of this Charter to confer upon the city every power which it would have if it were specifically mentioned. Unless granted to some other officer or body, all powers are vested in the city council. 
Section 2.3. - Home Rule Charter. 
    As provided by Article XII, Sections 4 and 5 of the Minnesota Constitution, and Minn. Stat. ch. 410, the City of Northfield voted in 1910 to adopt home rule government and define it as a charter which is now part I of the City Code. The statutes provide that the process of originating and amending of a charter be managed by a charter commission of seven (7) members. Any registered voter of the city may submit an application for appointment. The chairperson of the charter commission will oversee the process for receiving, verifying eligibility and forwarding applications of qualified applicants to the Chief Judge of the Third Judicial District Court who will make the appointment(s). 
(Ord. No. 934, 7-10-2012, effective 10-12-2012) 
Section 2.4. - Home Rule Charter Amendments. 
    Minn. Stat. §§ 410.12 and 410.14 provide that amendments may be initiated by the commission itself, by the city council or by citizen petition consistent with the aforementioned state statutes and other provisions of this Charter. All proposed amendments will be documented as ordinances by the commission. Commission and petition initiated amendments require approval by either an unanimous vote of the full city council or by an approving majority in a public referendum. Council initiated amendments must be approved by a public referendum. 
(Ord. No. 934, 7-10-2012, effective 10-12-2012)

(Ord. No. 739, § 3.4, 11-6-2000) 
Section 3.5. - Vacancies in the Council or in the Office of Mayor.

In each such case, the council shall by resolution declare the vacancy to exist and shall forthwith appoint an eligible person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs between July 1 and December 31, the appointee shall serve until the end of the following year. If the vacancy occurs between January 1 and June 30, the appointee shall serve until the end of the current year. A replacement shall be elected on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of the year in which the appointment expires. A special election shall be held if no regular municipal election is scheduled for that date. The elected replacement shall serve a full term if the term of the person requiring replacement ends at the end of the year in which the replacement election occurs. Otherwise the elected replacement shall have a shortened term that fills the unexpired part of the term of the person requiring replacement.

DIVISION 2. - DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP REGISTRY[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 935, § 1, adopted June 16, 2012, set out provisions intended for use as Div. 1, §§ 2-1-2-6. To maintain the existing § 2-1 and to preserve the style of this Code, these provisions have been included as Div. 2, §§ 2-11-2-16, at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 2-11. - Purpose, intent and establishment. 
    The City of Northfield has long valued diversity within its citizenry. We aspire to be a welcoming place for people of all ages; racial, ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds; professions and interests; and familial patterns and sexual orientation. We have benefitted from the diversity that exists within our community and the richness it brings to all of us. To further recognize our valuing of all people, the City of Northfield authorizes and establishes a voluntary program of registration of domestic partners. The domestic partner registry is a means by which unmarried, committed couples who reside or work in Northfield and who share a life and home together may document their relationship. By doing so they provide a government-based foundation to such committed relationships, which positively contributes to the health, safety, and welfare of the community as a whole. 
    This ordinance does not create or confer rights or privileges that are available to married persons under state or federal law. The City of Northfield does not and cannot provide legal advice concerning domestic partnerships. Applicants and registrants should consult with attorneys or other advisors for advice on such matters, including but not limited to: wills, health care directives, powers of attorney, medical matters, finances, children and dependents, medical, health care and employment benefits.

(3)  Are competent to enter into a contract; 
(4)  Have no other domestic partner; 
(5)  Are jointly responsible to each other for the necessities of life;

(8)  At least one of whom resides in or is employed in Northfield. 
    Domestic partnership: The term "domestic partnership" includes (upon production of valid and government-issued documentation): 
(1)  Any persons who have a currently registered domestic partnership in Northfield or with any government body pursuant to state, local, or other law authorizing such registration. The term domestic partnership shall be construed broadly to include unions, regardless of title or gender, in which two individuals are committed to one another as married persons are traditionally committed (except for the traditional marital status and solemnities); and 
(2)  Marriages legally recognized in another local, state, or foreign jurisdiction, but for the operation of Minnesota law. 
    Health care facility: A medical facility such as a hospital, sanitarium, nursing home, or similar facility licensed under Minnesota law. 
(Ord. No. 935, § 1, 6-19-2012) 
Sec. 2-13. - Registration of domestic partnerships. 
(a)  Application. The city clerk shall accept an application to register as domestic partners from persons who state in such application that they meet the definition of domestic partners as set out in section 2-2. 
(b)  Fees and charges. For all applications received in 2012, the city clerk will charge an application fee of $40.00 for the registration of a domestic partnership. After 2012, the application fee may be changed by resolution of the city council from time to time. The city clerk shall also charge a reasonable fee per document for providing certified copies of registrations, amendments, or notices of termination. There shall be no charge for filing amendments or notices of termination. 
(c)  Certificate. The city clerk shall provide each domestic partner with a registration certificate. This certificate may be used as evidence of the existence of a domestic partnership relationship. 
(d)  Records. The city clerk shall keep a record of all registrations of domestic partnership, amendments to registrations, and notices of termination. The records shall be maintained so the amendments and notices of termination are filed with the original registration of domestic partnership to which they pertain. 
(e)  Data. The application and amendments thereto, the registration certificate, and termination notices shall constitute government data and will be subject to disclosure pursuant to the terms of the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minn. Stat. ch. 13). 
(Ord. No. 935, § 1, 6-19-2012) 
Sec. 2-14. - Amendments. 
    The city clerk may accept amendments for filing from persons who have a domestic partnership registration on file (except amendments that would replace one of the registered partners with another individual). 
(Ord. No. 935, § 1, 6-19-2012) 
Sec. 2-15. - Termination of domestic partnerships. 
(a)  Either person in a domestic partnership may initiate termination of the domestic partnership by written notification to the city clerk on a form provided by the city clerk's office.

Sec. 2-16. - Benefits. 
    This section does not create any rights, privileges, or responsibilities for domestic partners other than those expressly provided in this section. 
(1)  City fees for recreational programs and general services. If the city offers a family fee, family membership or family registration for any city-provided recreation program or service available to residents or the general public, domestic partners are entitled to the same family fee, family membership, or family registration. 
(2)  Visitation in health care facilities. If a patient has not designated permitted or restricted visitors, or does not have a health care directive as defined in Minnesota Statutes, a health care facility shall allow the patient's domestic partner, the children of the patient's domestic partner, or the domestic partner of the patient's parent or child to visit the patient. Such visitation rights shall be consistent with the health care facility's visitation policy pertaining to other family members. A health care facility may reasonably determine not to allow visitors based on the patient's medical condition. The health care facility may deny visitation upon the reasonable determination that the presence of a particular visitor would endanger the health or safety of a patient or patients, or would endanger the primary operations of the facility.

Sec. 6-70. - Temporary expansion of licensed premises; outdoor sales and service. 
    The purpose of this section is to allow temporary expansion of the licensed premises of a liquor licensee, to temporarily include limited outdoor areas directly adjacent to and contiguous with the permanently licensed premises on city owned land or city public right of way, subject to such conditions as the council determines will protect the public health, safety and welfare. The city council finds that allowing outdoor sales and service in the downtown commercial areas is beneficial to the creation of a vibrant and prosperous business community so long as adequate review, controls and accountability are in place. Accordingly, both liquor licensees and purveyors of food and beverages who are not liquor licensees shall be entitled to apply for the benefits available under this section. 
    Therefore, the holder of any retail liquor license for premises located in the C-1 or C-2 zoning districts of the city may, on an annual basis, apply for a permit for temporary expansion of its licensed premises, for an area directly adjacent to and contiguous with the permanently licensed premises. Similarly, and as provided by chapter 14, article V of this code, a purveyor of food and beverages on premises located in such districts who is not a liquor licensee may, on an annual basis, apply for a permit to use such an area for the sale and service of food and beverages other than alcoholic beverages. The city council may grant such a permit on the terms and conditions specified in this section and such other terms and conditions as the city council may determine are necessary or advisable to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such a permit shall authorize use of any temporary expansion area on particular days, dates and times and shall be valid for a period of time as specified in the permit, not to exceed one year. If approved by the city council, a temporary expansion area may include defined areas on public property including public sidewalks. Application for a permit for temporary expansion of a licensed premises or other unlicensed premises shall be subject to the following requirements and procedures.

(6)  A detailed description of the planned staffing of the temporary expansion area during hours of operation, and methods the licensee will use to ensure that consumption of alcoholic beverages is restricted to the licensed premises and the temporary expansion area and that alcoholic beverages are not removed from those areas.

(c)  Review. Applications shall be submitted to the community development department and shall be reviewed by such staff persons as may be appropriate in the circumstances, including the chief of police in all applications which involve the outdoor sale of liquor. Review of applications shall include consideration of all pertinent building code, fire code and other life safety issues, applicable zoning ordinances, history of the licensee with regard to maintaining order on the licensed premises and complying with applicable laws, potential impact of proposed outdoor service on adjoining properties in terms of light, noise and liquor control, and other considerations.

(2)  Hours of operation shall be limited to between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., subject to other limitations imposed by this chapter or other law and subject to any greater restrictions which the city council may determine should apply to a temporary expansion area due to its particular circumstances. 
(3)  Days or dates of operation shall be as specified in the permit and no permit shall be valid for more than one year. 
(4)  Service of alcoholic beverages shall be only at tables and limited to the approved seating capacity in a temporary expansion area, and food service shall be available in the temporary expansion area during all hours when liquor is sold.

The licensee shall provide proof of such insurance to the city prior to issuance of any permit under this section and from time to time thereafter upon request of the city. 
(17)  By applying for and receiving a permit hereunder, the licensee or owner shall be deemed to have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold the city, its officers, employees and agents, harmless from any claims, damages, losses, costs and expenses which may arise as a result of the use of the temporary expansion area by the licensee, owner, and/or the licensee's or owner's employees, agents and customers. Specifically, but not by way of limitation, the licensee or owner shall be responsible for the cost of any clean up and repair required by reason of such use, whether within or outside the temporary expansion area, which may be incurred by the city, and the city shall have a lien against the licensed premises or the regular premises of the permittee for any such claim, damage, loss, cost or expense which is incurred by the city. 
(e)  Violation. In addition to any other penalties which may be available under applicable law, and regardless of any other limitation on sanctions which may be imposed by the city, the following occurrences shall be cause for immediate suspension of the temporary expansion permit, exercisable by the Northfield Chief of Police or his/her designee and subject to review by the city council: 
(1)  Any violation of this section, or of a material term or condition of a permit issued hereunder, or of any applicable liquor law or other law; or 
(2)  Any use of public property pursuant to a temporary expansion permit which results in a nuisance to neighbors or the public, including but not limited to noise, harassment, litter, property damage, or other condition which would be considered a harm or annoyance to a person of ordinary sensibility. 
The chief of police or his/her designee shall deliver written notice to the licensee or owner of the suspension of the temporary expansion permit, which shall be effective as of the date and time stated in the notice. The licensee or owner may, within five days of the date of the notice of suspension, file with the city clerk a written request for reinstatement of the permit by the city council. If such a request is filed, the city council shall consider reinstatement of the permit at its next regular meeting which is at least ten days following the date the request is filed. The council may, in its sole discretion, reinstate, reinstate on conditions, continue the suspension of, or revoke the permit.

ARTICLE III. - RENTAL HOUSING[2] 
Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 883, adopted August 18, 2008, amended art. III in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. III, §§ 14-78-14-80, 14-91-14-98, 14-115-14-140, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 868, adopted Sept. 17, 2007; Ord. No. 871, adopted Nov. 19, 2007. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Secs. 14-76, 14-77. - Reserved. 
Sec. 14-78. - Purpose and scope. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide minimum standards to safeguard life, personal health and safety, and the public welfare by regulating and controlling the use and occupancy, maintenance and repair of all buildings and structures within the city which are used for the purpose of rental housing. 
    To the extent that any standards of this article apply only to rental properties in R-1 and R-2 districts of the city, such standards are based on a finding by the city council that low density residential neighborhoods in the city are comprised primarily of owner-occupied single family dwellings and are designed and intended to be quiet, orderly, and safe neighborhoods for children and others, and that the quiet enjoyment and value of properties in such neighborhoods may be adversely impacted by the existence of rental properties occupied by groups of unrelated adults, where occupants tend to have more motor vehicles, generate greater traffic and parking congestion, and generate other adverse impacts on the neighborhood such as noise and disorderly conduct. In addition, the council finds that rental houses tend not to be as well or as aesthetically maintained as owner-occupied houses and that this tendency causes a decline in the condition and appearance of homes in the historic neighborhoods of Northfield, which are among its most valuable attributes and are of benefit to the public as a whole because they help make the city an attractive place to visit and to live. 
(b)  Scope; application to existing rental properties. 
(1)  Except as otherwise specifically provided, the provisions of this article shall apply to all buildings or portions thereof used, designed or intended to be let for human habitation. 
(2)  Homes for the aged, licensed in-home residential care facilities, hotels, motels, college owned dormitories, residential college-related facilities in a College Development Zone (CDZ), dwelling units which are occupied by the owner as the owner's primary residence and by one or more other persons who are not owners of the dwelling unit, and private residences that are occupied by a person or persons related, by blood, marriage, registered domestic partnership or adoption as herein defined, to the owner of the property, are exempt from the provisions of this article. 
(3)  Residential college-related facilities other than those located in a CDZ shall be treated as follows: 
a.  Residential college-related facilities which came into existence in 1981 or before (before the adoption of a zoning ordinance requiring a conditional use permit for certain of such uses) may be nonconforming uses under the zoning ordinance. Such facilities shall be allowed to maintain the occupancy numbers in existence as of the effective date of this article but shall be subject to the other requirements of this article, including licensing. 
b.  Residential college-related facilities which came into existence after 1981 but before the effective date of this article shall be required to obtain a conditional use permit as soon as reasonably possible if one is required under the zoning ordinance and has not been obtained previously, shall be allowed the occupancy numbers in existence as of the effective date of this article, and shall be subject to the other requirements of this article. 
c.  If any of the residential college-related facilities mentioned in a. and b. above did not have rental licenses as of the effective date of this article, but licenses were applied for within 30 days of such effective date, such licenses shall be granted regardless of the density limitations of section 14-97, if all other requirements of this article are met. Otherwise the density limitations of section 14-97 shall apply to all residential college-related facilities in R-1 and R-2 zones. 
d.  Residential college-related facilities which come into existence after the effective date of this article shall be subject to all of the requirements of this article. 
(4)  Except as otherwise specifically provided, all licensed rental properties in existence on the effective date of this article shall be subject to the following limitations: 
a.  Compliance required. All rental properties shall comply with the requirements of this article immediately upon the effective date of this article. 
b.  Redistricting. The city shall be redistricted into one district which shall place pre-existing district 1 and pre-existing district 2 into a single district. The rental administrator shall determine the distribution of the relicensing program within the district in a reasonable manner. The relicensing program shall require the property owners of rental properties to relicense the rental properties every two years. The single district redistribution program shall not, because of redistricting in calendar year 2011, result in an increase in the inspection or licensing fees for the property owners when evaluated over the previous two district licensing program. 
c.  Immediate action. Nothing in this section shall prevent the building official from taking any immediate enforcement or corrective action allowed by this article in the event a condition exists which causes a risk of serious harm to the public health or safety. 
(c)  Inconsistency with other regulations. If any standard of this article is inconsistent with any other applicable state or federal law, rule or regulation, the most stringent requirement shall apply. However, this article preempts any apparently inconsistent provisions of chapter 14 of this Code as they may pertain to rental properties. 
(Ord. No. 883, 8-18-2008; Ord. No. 900, 7-20-2009; Ord. No. 919, 6-21-2011; Ord. No. 933, § 1, 6-5-2012) 
Sec. 14-79. - Enforcement generally. 
(a)  Authority. The building official is hereby authorized and directed to enforce or cause the enforcement of this article. For such purposes, the building official shall work with local law enforcement officers to promote the detection and enforcement of criminal violations of this article, and shall have the powers necessary to pursue all civil remedies under this article, except as otherwise provided. Law enforcement officers shall have the authority to issue citations for criminal offenses under this article whether they occur on public or private property and may issue citations for civil penalties by arrangement with and as a designee of the building official. The building official shall be advised of any citations issued by law enforcement officers. The building official shall have the power to render interpretations of this article. Such interpretations shall be in conformity with the intent and purpose of this article. 
(b)  Right of entry. When it is necessary to make an inspection for purposes of this article, or when the building official has reasonable cause to believe there exists on a rental property a condition which is contrary to or in violation of this article, the building official may enter the rental property or any part thereof at reasonable times to inspect and otherwise perform the duties imposed by this article, provided that if such rental property is occupied, city credentials must be presented to the occupant and entry requested. If such rental property is unoccupied, the building official shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person having charge or control of the property and request entry. If entry is refused, the building official shall have recourse to the remedies provided by law to secure entry. No rental license shall be issued or renewed if the building official cannot obtain entry to make inspection as required for the issuance or renewal of a license and any existing license shall be deemed suspended until entry is obtained and a satisfactory inspection is completed, unless the building official temporarily and in writing extends a license pending a satisfactory inspection for a period of time and for reasons acceptable to the building official. 
(c)  Responsibilities of owners, occupants, managers and rental agents. Owners and occupants, and managers and rental agents who function as managers, shall be jointly responsible for maintaining rental property in a safe, sanitary and orderly condition and in compliance with this article and other applicable laws, rules and regulations. Owners are and remain liable for violation of duties imposed by this article even if a duty is also imposed on the occupants of the property, or on a manager or rental agent, and even if the owner has, by agreement, imposed on the occupant, manager or rental agent the duty of furnishing or maintaining required devices, equipment or facilities or otherwise complying with this article. 
(d)  Violations. Any violation of this article is a misdemeanor and is also subject to all available civil penalties and other remedies. Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate violation.

Sec. 14-92. - Issuance. 
    The building official shall issue a rental housing license for each dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit, when, upon inspection, the building official finds that the dwelling or unit meets or exceeds the minimum requirements set forth by this article. A rental license shall show the number of occupants for which the dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit is approved and, once issued, shall remain valid until it expires under the terms of this article or is suspended or revoked or until such time as the building official determines that the dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit does not meet the minimum requirements of this article. When a rental property is sold, the new owner shall apply for a rental license in the name of the new owner within 30 days of closing on the sale. The property may be required to be re-inspected prior to issuance of the license, in the discretion of the building official. If a new license is not issued within 60 days of closing on the sale of the property, or within such extended period of time as may be allowed in writing by the building official, the property shall cease being rented and shall not be rented again until a rental license may be issued thereafter, on terms as if it were being issued for the first time. A license issued to a new owner during a two year license cycle shall expire at the end of that license cycle. The new owner shall be credited with having paid any license fee paid by the previous owner for the current license cycle, but if any amount is owing, the new owner shall pay the full license fee if the new owner takes over at any time during the first year of the license cycle and shall pay half the license fee if the new owner takes over at any time during the second year of the license cycle. The property will be subject to re-inspection and license renewal at the same time as other rental properties.

The owner and occupants of the property shall not allow parking anywhere other than on approved parking spaces. 
(1)  Number of spaces. Each rental dwelling unit shall have a minimum of two off-street parking spaces, and as many additional off-street spaces as may be desired so long as they meet the dimensional, surface, location, and other requirements of this section. 
(2)  Dimensional standards. Parking spaces shall have the following minimum dimensions:

Length (non-tandem): 18 feet. 
Length (tandem): 22 feet.

A licensed rental property in existence at the time of adoption of this article which cannot feasibly provide parking spaces as required by subsection (1) of this section may request a variance from that subsection and the rental housing board of appeals may approve such a variance if it finds that strict enforcement of that subsection would cause an undue hardship because of circumstances unique to the individual property under consideration, which circumstances were not created by the current owner of the property, provided that the board of appeals may impose conditions in the granting of such a variance to protect neighboring properties and their occupants from the impact of such a variance.

After any order of the building official or the rental housing board of appeals made pursuant to this article becomes final, no person to whom any such order is directed shall fail, neglect or refuse to obey any such order. Any person who fails to comply with any such order is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(b)  Failure to obey order.

(c)  Failure to commence work. Whenever any required repair or demolition is not commenced within the time required, or, if no different time is stated, within 30 days after any final notice and order issued under this article becomes effective: 
(1)  The building official shall cause the building described in such notice and order to be vacated by posting at each entrance thereto a notice in form as shown in section 14-134 of this article. 
(2)  No person shall occupy any building that has been posted as specified in this section. No person shall remove or deface any such notice so posted until the repairs, demolition or removals ordered by the building official have been completed and a certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to the provisions of the current building code. 
(3)  The building official may, in addition to any other remedy herein provided, cause the building to be repaired to the extent necessary to correct the conditions as set forth in the notice and order; or, if the notice and order required demolition, to cause the building to be sold and demolished; or, to be demolished, and the materials, rubble and debris therefrom removed and the lot cleaned.

(Ord. No. 883, 8-18-2008) 
Sec. 14-138. - Recovery of costs. 
(a)  Costs incurred by city. The costs of such work, including the costs of administration, enforcement and other related costs, including attorneys fees related to enforcement of this article, shall be paid from a repair and demolition fund or other available funds of the city, and may be made a special assessment against the property involved, or may be made a personal obligation of the property owner, as the city council shall determine is appropriate. 
(b)  Account of expense; filing of report. The building official shall keep an itemized account of the expenses incurred by the city in the repair or demolition of any building under this article.

(Ord. No. 883, 8-18-2008) 
DIVISION 5. - ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES 

Sec. 14-139. - Administrative citations and civil penalties. 
(a)  Purpose. The city council finds that there is a need for alternative methods of enforcing the rental housing ordinance. While criminal fines and penalties have been the most frequent enforcement mechanism, there are certain negative consequences for both the city and the accused. The delay inherent in the criminal justice system does not ensure prompt resolution of problems which affect the public interest. Individuals may resent being labeled as criminals for violation of administrative regulations. The higher burden of proof and the potential of being incarcerated do not appear appropriate for many administrative violations. The court system does not always regard city code violations as being important. Accordingly, the city council finds that the use of administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties is a legitimate and necessary alternative method of enforcement. This method of enforcement is in addition to any other legal remedy that may be pursued for violation of this article. 
(b)  General provisions. 
(1)  A violation of any provision of this article is an administrative offense which shall be subject to an administrative citation and civil penalties. Each day a violation exists constitutes a separate offense. 
(2)  An administrative offense shall be subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $2,000.00. 
(3)  The city council shall adopt by resolution a schedule of penalties for offenses initiated by administrative citation. The city council may also adopt a schedule of fees and expenses to be paid to administrative hearing officers. 
(4)  The city administrator or his/her designee shall adopt procedures for administering the administrative citation program. 
(c)  Administrative citations. 
(1)  Any person authorized to enforce the provisions of this article may issue an administrative citation upon belief that a violation has occurred. The citation shall be issued in person or by first class mail to the owner of the rental property, or the owner's agent if known, and to any other person known to be responsible for the violation. In the case of a violation involving a motor vehicle, a copy of the citation shall also be attached to the motor vehicle. The citation shall state the date, time, and nature of the offense, the name of the issuing person, the amount of the scheduled penalty, and the manner for paying the penalty or appealing the citation. 
(2)  The person responsible for the violation must either pay the scheduled penalty or request a hearing within seven days after issuance of the citation. Payment of the penalty constitutes admission of the violation. A late payment fee of ten percent of any scheduled penalty amount shall be imposed. 
(d)  Administrative hearing. 
(1)  Hearing officers. The city council shall periodically approve a list of lawyers from which the city clerk shall randomly select a hearing officer to hear and determine a matter for which a hearing is requested. The clerk shall notify the accused of the selection of the hearing officer. The accused shall have the right to request, no later than five business days before the date of the hearing, that the assigned hearing officer be removed from the case. One request for removal in each case will be granted automatically by the city clerk. A subsequent request must be directed to the assigned hearing officer who shall decide whether he or she cannot fairly and objectively review the case and in that case the officer shall remove himself or herself from the case and the city clerk shall assign another hearing officer. The hearing officer is not a judicial officer but is a public officer as defined by Minn. Stat. § 609.415. The hearing officer shall not be a city employee or city official. The city administrator shall create procedures for evaluating the competency of the hearing officers, including comments from accused persons and city staff. The city administrator shall report to the city council regarding such evaluations at the request of the council, and the council may revise the list of approved officers at any time. 
(2)  Subpoena. Upon the hearing officer's own initiative or upon written request of an interested party demonstrating the need, the officer may issue a subpoena for the attendance of a witness or the production of books, papers, records or other documents which are material to the matter being heard. The party requesting the subpoena (or the city, if issued on the hearing officer's own initiative) is responsible for serving the subpoena in the manner provided for civil actions and for paying the fees and expenses of a witness. A person served with a subpoena may file an objection with the hearing officer promptly but no later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance. The officer may cancel or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable or oppressive. A person who, without just cause, fails or refuses to attend and testify or to produce the required documents in obedience to a subpoena is guilty of a misdemeanor. Alternatively, the party requesting the subpoena may seek an order from the district court directing compliance. If the accused fails or refuses to comply with a subpoena, the facts sought to be proved through compliance with the subpoena may be found by the hearing officer to have been admitted. 
(3)  Notice and hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be served in person or by mail on the person(s) responsible for the violation at least ten days in advance of the hearing, unless a shorter time is accepted by all parties. At the hearing, the parties shall have the opportunity to present testimony and question any witnesses, but strict rules of evidence shall not apply. The hearing officer shall tape record the hearing, receive testimony and exhibits, and provide the record of the proceeding and any exhibits to the city with the officer's decision. The officer shall receive and give weight to evidence admitted, including hearsay evidence which possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent people in the conduct of their affairs. 
(4)  Decision. The hearing officer has the authority to determine that a violation occurred; to impose the scheduled penalty; to reduce, stay, or waive a scheduled penalty either unconditionally or upon compliance with appropriate conditions; and to dismiss a citation. When imposing a penalty for a violation, the hearing officer may consider any or all of the following factors: 
a.  The duration of the violation; 
b.  The frequency or reoccurrence of the violation; 
c.  The seriousness of the violation; 
d.  The history of the violation; 
e.  The violator's conduct after issuance of the citation or notice of hearing; 
f.  The good faith effort by the violator to comply; 
g.  The economic impact of the penalty on the violator; 
h.  The impact of the violation on the community; and 
i.  Any other factors appropriate to a just result. 
The hearing officer may exercise discretion to impose a penalty for more than one day of a continuing violation, but only upon a finding that (i) the violation caused a serious threat of harm to or impact on the public health, safety, or welfare, or that (ii) the accused intentionally and unreasonably refused to comply with the requirements of this article. The hearing officer's decision and supporting reasons shall be in writing, served personally or by registered mail to the last known address of the person served. Service by registered mail shall be complete upon mailing. 
(5)  Failure to attend. A failure to attend the hearing constitutes a waiver of the accused's right to an administrative hearing and an admission of the violation. A hearing officer may waive this result upon good cause shown. Examples of good cause are: death or incapacitating illness of the accused; a court order requiring the accused to appear for another hearing at the same time; and lack of proper service of the citation or notice of the hearing.

ARTICLE VI. - PAWNBROKERS AND PRECIOUS METAL DEALERS 

Sec. 14-200. - Findings and purpose. 
    The city council finds that use of services provided by pawnbrokers and precious metal dealers provides an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment because pawn and precious metal businesses have the ability to receive and transfer property stolen by others easily and quickly. The city council also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers and precious metal dealers. The city council further finds that the pawn and precious metal industry will exceed the city's ability to effectively or efficiently identify criminal activity related to pawn shops and precious metal dealers. The purpose of this article is to prevent pawn and precious metal businesses from being used as facilities for the commission of crimes and to assure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city. 
    To help the police department better regulate current and future pawn and precious metal businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the pawn and precious metal industry, and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawn and precious metal industry through timely collection and sharing of pawn and precious metal transaction information, this article also implements and establishes the required use of the automated property system (APS). 
(Ord. No. 962, § 1, 9-16-2014)

(b)  Procedure for requesting variance. The procedure for requesting a variance shall be as follows: 
(1)  An application for a variance shall be filed with the department and shall be accompanied by development plans and specifications showing all information which the department may reasonably require to assess the variance request. The plans need not provide complete engineering or construction details as long as they contain sufficient information for the department to determine whether the proposed variance will meet all standards if the variance is granted. In all cases the application shall include the following: 
a.  Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the applicant and permittee; 
b.  The legal description of the real property on which the system will be located; 
c.  The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the owners of the property or any persons having a legal interest therein; 
d.  A site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, buildings, structures and significant natural features having an influence on the variance; 
e.  Copies of any required county, state or federal permits or approvals; and 
f.  A description of the variance requested and a statement outlining the unique or particular situation or peculiar hardship that creates the need for a variance. 
(2)  At its option, the department may hold a public meeting on any application for a variance. If a public meeting is held, notice of the purpose, time and place of the meeting shall be published in the official newspaper of the city at least ten days prior to the date of the meeting. Written notice of the public meeting shall also be mailed to all property owners of record within 350 feet of the subject property.

If the department denies a request for a variance, it shall state in writing the reasons for denial at the time of denial. 
(5)  All decisions by the department on variance requests shall be final, except that any aggrieved person shall have the right to appeal within 30 days for a hearing before the city council. 
(6)  No application for a variance which has been denied wholly or in part shall be resubmitted for a period of six months from the date of the denial, except on the grounds of relevant new evidence or proof of a significant change of conditions. 
(7)  Each violation of any condition set forth in a variance shall be a separate violation of this article and shall be sufficient grounds for terminating the variance. 
(8)  In exercising its authority to review any order, requirement, decision or determination made by any administrative official, the city council shall not grant any variance unless it finds that: 
a.  Because of exceptional circumstances the strict enforcement of any section of this article would cause undue hardship; 
b.  Disposal of the sewage is necessary for the public health, safety, or welfare; and 
c.  Strict conformity with the standards of this article would be unreasonable, impractical, not feasible under the circumstances or not reasonable due to proximity of sewer systems. 
(9)  Upon a request for review of a previously granted variance, the department may reconsider and amend specific conditions attached to a variance, provided that they are in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this article.

ARTICLE V. - CLEANUP OF CLANDESTINE DRUG LAB SITES AND CHEMICAL DUMP SITES 

Sec. 22-201. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to reduce public exposure to health risks where law enforcement officers have determined that hazardous chemicals or residue from a suspected clandestine drug lab site or associated dump site may exist. Professional reports, based on assessments, testing and investigations, show that chemicals used in the production of illicit drugs can condense, penetrate, and contaminate surfaces, furnishings, and equipment of surrounding structures. The city council finds that such sites, and the personal property within such sites, may contain suspected chemicals and residues that place people, particularly children or adults of child bearing age, at risk when exposed through inhabiting or visiting the site or using or being exposed to contaminated personal property. 
(b)  Interpretation and application. In the interpretation and application of this article, the provisions herein shall be construed to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this article are either more or less restrictive to the public than comparable provisions imposed by any other law, ordinance, statute, or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements on the public shall prevail. Should any court of competent jurisdiction declare any section or subpart of this article to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the article as a whole or any part thereof, other than the provision declared invalid. 
(Ord. No. 767, 5-20-2002)

ARTICLE VI. - SURFACE WATER MANAGEMENT 
DIVISION 1. - EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 

Sec. 22-230. - Purpose, scope and definitions. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this division is to safeguard property and to control or eliminate storm water pollution by regulating clearing and grading on public and private property. This division sets forth rules and regulations to control land disturbances, land fill, soil storage, and erosion and sedimentation resulting from such activities, and establishes procedures for issuance, administration and enforcement of a permit, unless otherwise specifically provided in this division or elsewhere in this Code. This division is adopted pursuant to the authorization contained in Minnesota Statutes Chapter 103B, Section 103F.401, Section 103F.441, and Minnesota Rules Chapters 7050 and 7090. 
(b)  Applicability; permit required. Any person proposing a land disturbance activity within the city shall apply to the city for an erosion and sediment control (E & SC) permit. No land shall be disturbed until a permit has been issued by the city. All land disturbance activities shall conform to the standards set forth in this division. If the standards set forth in this division are inconsistent with any other standards, which apply to the particular activity, the most stringent standards shall apply. This division shall apply to land disturbance activities in the following four categories: 
(1)  Residential. Land disturbance activities on residential lots in R-1 and R-2 zoning districts which meet one of the following descriptions: 
a.  Any excavating, grading, filling or other change in the earth's topography resulting in the movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material, except in any designated wetlands, floodplain or shoreland district or as exempted in subsection (c) of this section; 
b.  Any excavating, grading, or filling or change in the earth's topography in any designated wetlands, floodplain or shoreland district; 
c.  Any changing of a natural drainageway or drainage pattern that results in increasing or intensifying the flow of surface water upon an adjacent property. This may include creating berms with less than 50 cubic yards of material. 
(2)  Site plan. Land disturbance activities, which are associated with any development for which site plan review is required under chapter 34 of this Code. 
(3)  Platted development. Land disturbance activities, which are associated with any subdivision for which plat approval is required under chapter 34 of this Code. 
(4)  Grading. Any land disturbance activities not included in categories (1), (2) or (3) which constitute any of the following activities: 
a.  Any excavating, grading, filling or other change in the earth's topography resulting in the movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material, except in any designated wetlands, floodplain or shoreland district, or as exempted in subsection (c) of this section; 
b.  Any excavating, grading, or filling or change in the earth's topography in any designated wetlands, floodplain or shoreland district; 
c.  Any changing of a natural drainageway or drainage pattern that results in increasing or intensifying the flow of surface water upon an adjacent property. 
(c)  Exemptions. Exemption from the permit requirements of this division shall not be deemed to grant authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation of this division and shall not exempt the activities from any other applicable regulation, law or provision of city code. The following activities are exempt from obtaining a permit as required by this division: 
(1)  The total volume of earth material disturbed, stockpiled, disposed of, or used as fill does not exceed 50 cubic yards. These activities may include the installation and maintenance of home gardens, minor landscaping, fences, signs and mailboxes, etc., so long as the activity does not change a natural drainage way or drainage pattern resulting in increasing or intensifying the flow of surface water upon adjacent property. 
(2)  Creation and maintenance of cemetery graves. 
(3)  Creation and maintenance of refuse disposal sites controlled by other regulations, laws or the city code. 
(4)  Activities relating to mining and excavation, which are regulated under chapter 34 of this Code. 
(5)  Excavations for wells, tunnels or utilities controlled by other regulations, laws or the city code. 
(6)  Tilling, planting, or harvesting of agricultural, horticultural or silvicultural (forestry) crops. This shall not exempt these types of activities from other permit requirements set forth by city code. 
(7)  Exploratory excavations and borings under the direction of geotechnical engineers or engineering geologists. 
(8)  Emergency work necessary to protect life, limb or property. 
(9)  City, county, state or federal agency projects whose plans and specifications meet the requirements of this division and are reviewed and approved by the city under a separate process. 
(d)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. Words, terms and phrases which are defined by state law or regulation and which apply to applicants or activities under this division shall have the meanings ascribed to them by such state law or regulation. Other words, terms and phrases shall have the meaning indicated by their context or shall be construed according to their common usage. 
(1)  Applicant. Any person that applies for a permit to allow land disturbance activities under this division or who conducts activities pursuant to such permit. 
(2)  Common plan of development or sale. A contiguous area where multiple separate and distinct land disturbance activities may be taking place at different times, or on different schedules, but under one proposed plan. 
(3)  Developer. Any person engaged in a land disturbance activity. 
(4)  Development. Any land disturbance activity that changes the site's runoff characteristics in conjunction with residential, commercial, industrial or institutional construction or alteration. 
(5)  Discharge. The release, conveyance, channeling, runoff, or drainage of storm water, including snowmelt, from a construction site. 
(6)  Erosion. Any process that wears away the surface of the land by the action of water, wind, ice, or gravity. Erosion can be accelerated by the activities of people and nature. 
(7)  Erosion control. Methods employed to prevent erosion such as soil stabilization practices, horizontal slope grading, temporary or permanent cover, and construction phasing. 
(8)  Final stabilization. Means that all land disturbance activities at the site have been completed, and that a uniform (evenly distributed, e.g., without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a density of at least 75 percent of all areas not covered by pavement or permanent structures has been established, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures have been employed. Simply sowing grass seed is not considered final stabilization. Where agricultural land is involved, such as when pipelines are built on crop or range land, final stabilization constitutes returning the land to its preconstruction agricultural use. 
(9)  Impervious surface. A constructed hard surface that either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil and causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities and at an increased rate of flow than existed prior to development. Examples include rooftops, sidewalks, patios, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, and concrete, asphalt, or gravel roads. 
(10)  Land disturbance activity. Any land change that may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into or upon waters or lands within the city's jurisdiction, including construction, clearing and grubbing, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land, and similar activities. Land disturbance activity does not include: 
a.  Minor land disturbance activities such as home gardens and home landscaping, or home repairs and maintenance work. 
b.  Construction, installation, and maintenance of fences, signs, posts, poles, and electric, telephone, cable television, utility lines or individual service connections to these utilities. 
c.  Tilling, planting, or harvesting of agricultural, horticultural, or silvicultural (forestry) crops. 
d.  Emergency work to protect life, limb, or property and emergency repairs. If, apart from the emergency, the land disturbance activity requires a permit under this article, the property owner shall submit a SWPPP and obtain a permit, and shape and stabilize the disturbed land area, as soon as possible following the emergency work. 
(11)  Permanent cover. Means the various elements of "final stabilization." Examples include grass, gravel, asphalt, and concrete. 
(12)  Permit. A written warrant or license granted to allow land disturbance activities. 
(13)  Person. Any human being, any governmental or political subdivision or public agency, any public or private corporation, any partnership, any firm, association or other organization, any receiver, trustee, assignee, agent, or legal representative of any of the foregoing, or any other legal entity. 
(14)  Sediment. The soil, which is the product of an erosion process and is in suspension, is being transported, or has been moved by water, wind, or ice, and has come to rest on the earth's surface either above or below water level. 
(15)  Sedimentation. The process or action of depositing sediment. 
(16)  Sediment control. Methods employed to prevent sediment from leaving a development site, such as silt fences, sediment traps, earth dikes, drainage swales, check dams, subsurface drains, pipe slope drains, storm drain inlet protection, and temporary or permanent sedimentation basins. 
(17)  Soil. The unconsolidated mineral and organic material on the immediate surface of the earth. For purposes of this division, temporary stockpiles of clean sand, gravel, aggregate, concrete or bituminous materials are not considered "soil" stockpiles. 
(18)  Stabilized. The exposed ground surface after it has been covered by suitable vegetation, erosion control blanket, riprap, pavement or other material that prevents erosion. Simply sowing grass seed is not considered stabilization. 
(19)  Storm water. Precipitation runoff, storm water runoff, snow melt runoff, and any other surface runoff and drainage. Storm water does not include construction site dewatering. 
(20)  Subdivision. Any tract of land divided into lots for private, public, commercial, industrial, or other development purposes. 
(21)  Temporary protection. Short-term methods employed to prevent erosion, such as straw, mulch, erosion control blankets, wood chips, and erosion netting.

Sec. 22-231. - Permit process; storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP). 
(a)  General. No building permit, site plan approval, subdivision approval, or grading permit shall be issued until the city has issued an E & SC permit or the project is determined to be exempt from E & SC permitting requirements. An application for an E & SC permit shall be on a form provided by the city and shall include all accompanying documents required by the city. The issuance of an E & SC permit does not exempt the applicant from the requirements and permitting authority of other agencies having jurisdiction over the work performed nor from other permitting processes required by the city. The applicant shall submit a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) which is satisfactory to the city engineer. The SWPPP shall at a minimum conform to the practices set forth in Chapter 6 of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's publication, "Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas." If conditions arise which require modification of the SWPPP and the permit, the applicant shall comply with such modifications immediately upon notification by the city. The process and requirements for issuance of E & SC permits in each of the four categories set forth above shall be as specified below: 
(1)  Residential. 
a.  Permit application. Application for an E & SC permit shall be made at the time of building permit application or at least five business days prior to commencement of land disturbance activities not requiring a building permit. A SWPPP shall be submitted as part of the application. 
b.  Storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP). A SWPPP shall be prepared by a qualified professional certified by the Minnesota Department of Transportation or other certification acceptable to the city. The plan shall include at a minimum the lot boundaries, easement areas, building location(s), drainage directions indicated by arrows, location of construction site access, stockpiles, trash containers, concrete washout area, and any erosion and sediment controls. 
c.  Permit fee. A permit fee shall be paid by the applicant prior to issuance of any permit. The fee shall cover review of the application and all routine inspections for enforcement. Any inspections and administration of the permit triggered by a correction notice are not included in this fee. The amount of the permit fee shall be set by city council resolution from time to time. 
d.  Escrow deposit. The applicant shall deposit funds into an escrow deposit with the city to cover any costs incurred by the city due to failure by the applicant to comply with this division or any other applicable law or regulation or with the E & SC permit issued by the city, including any costs associated with a correction notice. The amount of the escrow deposit shall be set by city council resolution from time to time, but additional amounts may be required by city staff prior to issuance of the permit and from time to time thereafter as circumstances warrant. The applicant may be required to maintain the escrow deposit at a minimum amount set by the city. 
e.  Application review and approval. City staff shall review the application for completeness and compliance with standards. If needed, staff shall return the application to the applicant to make changes or supply additional information. Land disturbing activities may begin only upon approval of the application and issuance of the permit. 
f.  Reviewed plans. When the city issues the permit, the city shall endorse in writing or stamp on the plans and specifications "Reviewed." Such reviewed plans shall not be changed or deviated from by the applicant without authorization from the city. One set of reviewed plans shall be returned to the applicant, and that set shall be kept on the site of the building or work at all times during which the authorized work is in progress. 
g.  Construction initiation and first compliance inspection. The applicant shall inform the building inspections department when the erosion and sediment control measures are in place and construction has begun on the site. The city shall complete an initial site inspection to determine compliance with the permit after the notification but no later than the framing inspection. 
h.  Non-compliance; correction notice. If the erosion and sediment control measures do not comply with the permit, city staff shall write a correction notice and deliver it to the applicant. Corrections must be made within 48 hours of delivery of the notice unless otherwise specified in the notice. The time allowed for compliance may be less than 48 hours and shall be based on site conditions, weather conditions, and other relevant factors. 
i.  Follow-up on non-compliance; stop work order. City staff shall complete a follow-up inspection at the time designated for corrections to be complete. If staff determines that the corrections have not been completed or the site is otherwise not in compliance with the permit, staff shall issue a stop work order and set a time limit for corrections to be completed under the stop work order. Staff shall complete an additional compliance inspection at the time specified for completion in the stop work order. If the work is not completed, the city may initiate a correction of items that do not comply with the permit and may draw down the escrow deposit to cover the cost of such correction, of the additional inspections required, and of the administrative work involved, including legal costs, if any. 
j.  Second compliance inspection. City staff shall complete a second compliance inspection for all projects, at a time determined by the city. If the erosion and sediment control measures do not comply with the permit at the time of inspection, the city shall initiate the non-compliance procedures described in h. and i. above. 
k.  Project completion. The applicant shall inform the city when the site has reached final stabilization, at which time the city shall complete a final compliance inspection. This may be completed at the same time as the certificate of occupancy inspection. If the site complies with city requirements, the project may be determined complete and the city shall return the applicant's escrow deposit, less any costs to the city related to enforcement actions. If the applicant chooses to sell the parcel before the site has reached final stabilization, the applicant must inform the city of the proposed transfer and submit a form approved by the city and signed by both the applicant and the new owner, transferring responsibility for the site and for the work under the E & SC permit to the new owner. In that event the city shall return any unused portion of the escrow deposit to the new owner once the site has been finally stabilized. 
(2)  Site plan. 
a.  Permit application. Application for an E & SC permit shall be made on forms provided by the city at the time of application for site plan approval. A SWPPP as described below shall be submitted as part of the application. 
b.  Storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP). A SWPPP shall be prepared by a qualified professional certified by the Minnesota Department of Transportation or other certification acceptable to the city. The plan shall meet state standards as to what must be included in a SWPPP, regardless of the size of the disturbed area. 
c.  Permit fee. A permit fee shall be paid by the applicant prior to issuance of any permit. The fee shall cover review of the application and all routine inspections for enforcement. Any inspections and administration of the permit triggered by a correction notice are not included in this fee. The amount of the permit fee shall be set by city council resolution from time to time. 
d.  Escrow deposit. The applicant shall deposit funds into an escrow deposit with the city to cover any costs incurred by the city due to failure by the applicant to comply with this division or any other applicable law or regulation or with the E & SC permit issued by the city, including any costs associated with a correction notice. The city engineer shall determine the amount of the escrow deposit required for each application. Additional amounts may be required to be deposited from time to time as circumstances warrant. The applicant may be required to maintain the escrow deposit at a minimum amount set by the city. 
e.  Application review. The city's development review committee shall review the application for completeness and compliance with standards. City staff may request changes or additional information from the applicant. Land disturbing activities may begin only upon approval of the application and issuance of the permit.

(Ord. No. 911, 9-17-2010) 
Sec. 22-302. - Post-construction performance standards for stormwater management. 
(a)  Water quality criteria. 
(1)  Best management practices shall be implemented that reduce the total suspended solids load by 90 percent, and the phosphorus load by 60 percent from the runoff generated by the two-year, 24-hour event for the developed site as a whole, as compared to no runoff management controls. These standards may be met through the runoff volume reduction criteria below (subsection (c) of this section). If the criteria are met through ponding, the following guidelines for the design of wet detention basins shall be followed: 
a.  A permanent pool ("dead storage") volume below the principal spillway (normal outlet) which shall be greater than or equal to the runoff from a two and one-half-inch storm over the entire contributing drainage area assuming full development. 
b.  A permanent pool average depth (basin volume/basin area) which shall be = four feet, with a maximum depth of = ten feet. 
c.  Basin side slopes above the normal water level should be no steeper than 3:1, and preferably flatter. A basin shelf with a minimum width of ten feet and one-foot deep below the normal water level is recommended to enhance wildlife habitat, reduce potential safety hazards, and improve access for long-term maintenance. 
d.  The pond should be wedge shaped with the inlet at the narrowest end and the outlet at the widest end. A length to width ration of 3:1 or greater shall be used whenever possible. Distance between outfalls and outlets should be maximized. 
e.  Skimmers or other similar devices are required on pond outlets. Designs shall provide for skimmers that extend a minimum of four inches below the water surface and minimize the velocities of water passing under the skimmer to less than one-half foot per second for the one-year 24-hour event. 
f.  Side slopes shall be seeded with native seed mix appropriate to the site conditions. Upland buffers on side slopes are required. Buffers shall include a mixture of deciduous and coniferous shrubs and include access for pond maintenance. Trees are encouraged as part of the upland buffer. Buffers shall be designed to provide maintenance access to the facility. 
g.  The applicant shall provide the city with a two-year warranty on all vegetation to ensure plant establishment and survival. 
h.  Pond designs that incorporate filtered bottom withdrawal, vegetated swale discharges, or constructed wetland treatment cells to limit temperature increases are encouraged. 
i.  Pond designs that incorporate tree shading to limit future temperature increases are encouraged. 
(2)  Infiltration/filtration methods, described under runoff volume control are the preferred approach to satisfying the water quality treatment requirements in all areas of the city where practical and subject to the limitations of (c)(4) below. Infiltration/filtration methods described under runoff volume control are the required approach to satisfying the water quality treatment requirements in areas that drain to Rice Creek and its tributaries. 
(3)  For all projects, street catch basins must have a three-foot sump. 
(b)  Runoff rate control criteria. 
(1)  Expansion/redevelopment projects. For the two-year, ten-year, and 100-year 24-hour SCS Type II storm events and the 100-year ten-day snowmelt event (Table 1), the proposed post development runoff rate must not exceed the existing conditions runoff rate at all points leaving the site. The city may reduce or waive the need for expanded on-site improvements if downstream facilities can accommodate the additional rate increase. In flood prone areas and landlocked subwatersheds, greater restrictions may apply. Pervious curve numbers shown in Table 3 shall be used for existing and new turf grass. 
(2)  All new development in the city and any development in the Rice Creek Subwatershed. For the two-year, ten-year and 100-year 24-hour SCS Type II storm events and the 100-year ten-day snowmelt event (Table 1), the proposed post development runoff rate must not exceed the rate for pre-settlement conditions. Pre-settlement conditions shall be defined as the estimated land cover in the area before European settlement as determined by historic topographic and photographic data. Runoff curve numbers shown in Table 2 shall be used for determining presettlement conditions. In flood prone areas and landlocked subwatersheds, greater restrictions may apply. Pervious curve numbers shown in Table 3 shall be used for existing and new turf grass.

* Curve number of 61 is used for both A and B soils to reflect the standard landscaping practice of placing loamy soils on top of compacted subgrade in preparation for the placement of turf grass. 
(4)  The stormwater system must be designed to provide discharge capacity or level of service for the following system components. The city may allow variance to these standards if regional ponding systems are located downstream. 
Local storm sewer-Five-year event. 
Trunk storm sewer-Ten-year event. 
Storm ponds, pipe and drainageways connecting ponds, and open channels-100-year event. 
(5)  For stormwater collection systems not designed to meet rate control standards (e.g. catch basins), a clogging factor of 50 percent will be used to size intake structures 
(6)  No orifice having a diameter less than eight inches is allowed in the design of rate control structures within the city. If a structure having an opening less than eight inches is required to meet rate control requirements, the required rate control for a site will be increased to allow a rate consistent with an opening of this size. 
(7)  An emergency spillway or outlet from ponding areas shall be installed at a minimum of one foot below the lowest building opening and shall be designed to have a capacity to overflow water at an elevation below the lowest building opening at a rate not less than three times the 100-year peak discharge rate from the basin or the anticipated 100-year peak inflow rate to the basin, whichever is higher. A narrative shall be submitted describing the secondary flow paths for events larger than the 100-year event. 
(c)  Runoff volume control criteria. 
(1)  New development and expansion/redevelopment projects proposing one acre or more of new impervious area. Projects must infiltrate the first one inch of runoff from impervious surfaces. 
(2)  Rice Creek subwatershed. For the two-year 24-hour SCS Type II event (Table 1), the proposed post development runoff volume must not exceed the presettlement conditions runoff volume at all points where runoff leaves the site. Infiltration/filtration basins must be setback at least 300 feet from the centerline of Rice Creek to minimize thermal impacts to groundwater and Rice Creek. 
(3)  When designing infiltration for volume control, on-site testing and detailed analyses are strongly encouraged in order to determine the infiltration rates of the proposed infiltration facility. Documented site-specific infiltration or hydraulic conductivity measurements completed by a licensed soil scientist or engineer is required for all regional infiltration facilities, which are defined as infiltration facilities with proposed drainage areas greater than two acres or with proposed drainage areas with 0.7 acres or more of impervious surfaces. In the absence of a detailed analysis, the saturated infiltration rates listed in Table 4 must be used A soil boring with blow counts is required at the location of a proposed regional infiltration facility. The soil boring is required to go to depth of at least five feet below the proposed bottom of the infiltration facility. If bedrock is suspected, the soil boring must go to a depth of at least ten feet below the proposed bottom of the infiltration facility. The soils must be classified using the Unified Soil Classification system. The least permeable soil horizon will dictate the infiltration rate. Infiltration practices shall be designed to infiltrate the required runoff volume within 24 hours within the Rice Creek Subwatershed and 72 hours for any development elsewhere in the city. 
Table 4. 
Hydrologic Soil Groups and Saturated Infiltration Rate 
Hydrologic Soil Group A B C D Saturated Infiltration Rate (inches per hour) 0.50 0.25 0.10* 0.01*  
* Infiltration is not allowed in C and D soils without soil corrections. 
(4)  The following standards apply to infiltration facilities or practices: 
a.  Pretreatment of stormwater runoff is required to protect the infiltration systems from clogging with sediment and to protect ground water quality. 
b.  Must conform to the minimum setbacks required by the Minnesota Department of Health. 
c.  Cannot be used within fifty feet of a municipal, community, or private well unless specifically allowed by an approved wellhead protection plan. 
d.  Cannot be used on areas with less than three feet vertical separation from the bottom of the infiltration system and the seasonal high water table or bedrock, or ten feet where fractured bedrock is present. 
e.  Cannot be used for runoff from fueling and vehicle maintenance areas and industrial areas with exposed materials posing contamination risk. 
f.  Cannot be used in type C and D soils without soil corrections. 
(5)  Where achieving volume control standards through infiltration is not possible due to site limitations (see immediately preceding subsection), or where space limits opportunities for site redevelopment and expansion, the following steps will be considered in order of decreasing preference and approved by the city engineer: 
a.  Modifications to the site design to incorporate additional LID or "better site design" practices as described in the Minnesota Stormwater Manual, to the extent practical. 
b.  Use of filtration practices. 
c.  Opportunities for storage and reuse of water on-site. 
d.  Purchase of volume-control capacity in a city owned facility through the payment of a stormwater availability charge (SWAC) in lieu of on-site volume control measures. Any SWAC imposed as provided in this Division shall be established by resolution of the city council from time to time. 
(d)  General performance standards. 
(1)  For development proposals having more than one acre of new impervious area, all stormwater treatment must be designed to address the actual amount of impervious surface or the following impervious surface coverage amounts for the entire development site, whichever is higher. 
a.  Residential lots (one or two dwelling units)-40%. 
b.  Commercial and industrial lots-85%. 
c.  All plats in the Rice Creek watershed-65%. 
(2)  Unless superseded by the city's requirements, stormwater management practices shall be designed according to the most current technology as reflected in the MPCA publication "Minnesota Stormwater Manual," as supplemented and amended from time to time. 
(3)  The natural surface water drainage system shall be used as far as is feasible for storage and flow of runoff. All stormwater diversion discharged to natural waterways must meet the performance standards in section 22-302. 
(4)  All structural or engineered stormwater treatment facilities shall be located in an outlot or in a drainage and utility easement dedicated to the city. Facilities may be located within the right of way at the city's discretion. Access of sufficient size shall be provided to each treatment facility to perform maintenance activities identified in the maintenance plan. 
(5)  Subdivision design shall be consistent with limitations presented by steep slopes. Subdivisions shall be designed so that no construction or grading will be conducted on slopes steeper than 12 percent in grade unless it can be demonstrated through satisfactory design that the area can be built upon without problems with soil erosion or danger from slides. 
(6)  All applicants shall submit as-built plans for all structural or engineered facilities at project completion. The plans must show the final design specifications for all facilities. Plans must certify that the facilities meet the performance standards and be signed by a registered professional engineer. 
(7)  Stormwater management plans must show construction staging and specifically address measures to preserve the infiltration capacity of proposed infiltration facilities to ensure that the performance of such facilities are not impaired at the conclusion of construction. Plans shall also demonstrate methods of staging construction to minimize soil compaction of landscaped areas during construction. Soil testing and decompaction may be required if site construction activities negatively impact soil permeability. 
(8)  A planted vegetated buffer width of 50 feet shall be established and maintained around all wetlands, stormwater ponds and infiltration/filtration facilities. Buffers shall be measured perpendicular from the high water level of a constructed facility or the delineated wetland edge, and shall be provided and maintained at all times. Monuments/signs shall be located to delineate the buffer. The monuments/signs should be placed at an interval of approximately 100 feet and at locations where the buffer line deviates by more than 30 degrees. The signs should conform to local standards and be at least four feet high, made of non-degradable material, and minimally contain the words: Buffer-Do Not Mow or Fill. Contact City of Northfield for Further Information. 
(9)  No fences, structures or other impediments shall be constructed across the natural or constructed waterway that will reduce or restrict the flow of water. Fences, structures or other impediments or other structures built within drainage easements are placed at the owner's risk.

Said order or notice shall further advise that, should the offending party fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof may be charged to the violator. 
(d)  Emergency cease and desist orders. When the city finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, or any order or notice issued hereunder, or that the person's past violation is likely to reoccur, and that the violation has caused or has contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the storm drain system or waters of the state which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment, the city may issue an emergency cease and desist order in lieu of a notice of violation to the violator or other action directing him or her to: 
(1)  Immediately comply and stop or eliminate the endangering discharge; 
(2)  Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including, but not limited to, immediately halting operations or terminating the discharge; and 
(3)  Immediately comply with all requirements of this division and other applicable laws and regulations. 
    In the event of a person's failure to immediately comply with the emergency cease and desist order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the storm drain system or waters of the state, or endangerment to persons or to the environment, including immediately terminating the facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The city may allow the person to recommence the discharge activities when he or she has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the person under this article. A person that is found by the city to be responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency within 30 days of receipt of the emergency cease and desist order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, the city taking any other action against the violator. 
    In the event that a violation or suspected violation occurs which constitutes an immediate danger to public health and safety, the city is authorized to, in lieu of an emergency cease and desist order or notice of violation, enter upon the subject property without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and preserve public health and safety. 
(e)  In the event that the abatement or restoration work is performed by the city, the city may charge the violator for its costs and expenses associated with the work. If the bill received for abatement or restoration is not paid within 30 days, the city may draw the amount of the bill from any financial guarantees or security that the city may be holding or may certify the amount to the county for collection with the property taxes. 
(f)  Violation of any provision of this division may be enforced by civil action including an action for injunctive relief and by any administrative penalties approved by the city. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this division is a threat to public health, safety and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense or a civil action to abate, enjoin or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. 
(g)  Violation of any provision of this division shall be a misdemeanor, and each day during which any violation is committed, continued or permitted, shall constitute a separate offense.

    Because the city recognizes that many persons under the age of 18 years purchase or otherwise obtain, possess, and use tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery products or devices, and such sales, possession, and use are violations of both state and federal laws; because studies have shown that most smokers begin smoking before they have reached the age of 18 years and that those persons who reach the age of 18 years without having started smoking are significantly less likely to begin smoking and because smoking has been shown to be the cause of several serious health problems which subsequently place a financial burden on all levels of government, this article shall be intended to regulate the sale, possession, and use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery products or devices for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws; to protect minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco, tobacco products, tobacco-related devices, and nicotine or lobelia delivery products or devices; and to further the official public policy of the state in regard to preventing young people from starting to smoke as stated in Minn. Stat. § 144.391, as it may be amended from time to time. In making these findings, the city council accepts the conclusions and recommendations of the Center for Disease Control in their study "Selected Cigarette Smoking Initiation and Quitting Behaviors Among High School Students, United States, 1997," and of the following medical professionals in these medical journals: Khuder SA, et al., "Age at Smoking Onset and its Effect on Smoking Cessation," Addictive Behavior 24(5):673-7, September-October 1999; D'Avanzo B, et al., "Age at Starting Smoking and Number of Cigarettes Smoked," Annals of Epidemiology 4(6):455-59, November 1994; Chen, J & Millar, WJ, "Age of Smoking Initiation: Implications for Quitting," Health Reports 9(4):39-46, Spring 1998; Everett SA, et al., "Initiation of Cigarette Smoking and Subsequent Smoking Behavior Among U.S. High School Students," Preventive Medicine, 29(5):327-33, November 1999, copies of which are adopted by reference.

1.3 - Code Authority. 
    The authority to adopt this LDC within the City of Northfield, is derived from the authority provided under the Charter of the City of Northfield and from the powers granted and limitations imposed by the Minn. Stat. § 462.357, § 462.358, and other applicable sections. Whenever the charter or other laws, including the state statutes, referenced in this LDC have been amended or superseded, this LDC shall be considered amended in reference to the new or revised charter or other laws.

[1] Fixed-Boundary districts are districts that are currently located on the zoning map but no new areas may be rezoned to these districts (See Section 2.2.4, Fixed-Boundary Districts). 
[2] The A-S, PB-S, CD-S, and PI-S districts are considered special base zoning districts as they have a limited purpose as it relates to development within the city. For this reason, these base districts maintain an "S" in the abbreviation.  
2.2.2  Relationship of Overlay Districts to Base, Special, and Floating Districts . 
(A)  Where land is classified into an overlay zoning district, the regulations governing development in the overlay district shall apply in addition to the regulations governing the underlying base, special, or floating zoning district unless otherwise noted in the district specific standards of Section 2.3, Base Zoning Districts, 2.4, Special Base Zoning Districts, Section 2.5, Overlay Zoning Districts, or Section 2.6, Floating Zoning Districts. In the event of an express conflict between the standards of the overlay zoning district and the base, special, or floating zoning district, the standards governing the overlay district shall control. 
(B)  In some instances, land may be classified into multiple overlay districts. In the event of an express conflict between the standards of the multiple overlay districts, the most restrictive standards shall apply. 
2.2.3  References to Previous Zoning Districts . Some of the district classifications and names established within this LDC differ from previous versions of this LDC. In instances where there may be references to the previous zoning district nomenclature, Table 2.2-2 identifies how each of the previous district classifications were renamed for this LDC. This section shall only be used for comparison purposes. 
2.2.4  Fixed-Boundary Districts . Fixed-Boundary districts are districts that are currently located on the zoning map but which may not be applied to other locations. The intent of a Fixed-Boundary district is to allow existing uses to remain and to expand under the development standards for that particular zoning district. Certain districts have fixed boundaries because the preferred future development pattern is described in districts that do not have fixed boundaries.

2.3.5  Neighborhood General 1 District (N1) [Fixed-Boundary District] . 
(A)  Purpose . 
(1)  The N1 district should generally apply to those areas developed and/or final platted and designated as "Neighborhood General 1" on the framework map of the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  The Neighborhood General 1 (N1) district is applied to existing residential neighborhoods of the city that are found outside the R1 district. The N1 district is characterized by primarily single family homes, or attached housing, on parcels that are generally larger than those found in the R1, and that are located on streets more curvilinear and less connected than traditional urban development patterns. The essential, existing character of the N1 district should be reinforced with any infill or redevelopment of properties. When feasible, infill or redevelopment in the N1 district should also create a more pedestrian-friendly, walkable development pattern with a mixture of housing types. 
(B)  Fixed-Boundary District. The N1 district is a Fixed-Boundary district and is maintained in this LDC to minimize the creation of nonconformities (See Section 2.2.4, Fixed-Boundary Districts). Applications for amendments to the Official Zoning Map for the N1 district shall be prohibited after the effective date of this LDC.

(D)  Other Development Standards. In addition to the standards established for the N1 district in this article, all development shall be subject to all other applicable standards in Article 3: Development Standards. 
2.3.6  Neighborhood General 2 District (N2) . 
(A)  Purpose . 
(1)  The N2 district should generally apply to those areas intended for residential neighborhoods designated as "Pipeline" and "Managed Growth" on the conservation and development map of the comprehensive plan, and those areas designated as "Neighborhood General 1" on the framework map of the comprehensive plan and Neighborhood General 2 on the Zoning Map. 
(2)  The Neighborhood General 2 (N2) district is applied to residential neighborhoods of the city that may include larger vacant areas within the current city limits and areas that will be within city limits through future annexations. The N2 district will create a pedestrian-friendly environment, such as found in the R1 district, with strong neighborhood qualities, such as a grid-like street pattern, consistent block size, compact development, a range of housing types and architectural styles, street connectivity, sidewalks, and homes located in close relationship to the street. In addition, the N2 district will include greenways and natural areas, and options for neighborhood-serving commercial. This development pattern is the preferred future pattern for the city, as expressed in the comprehensive plan. 
(B)  Site Development Standards. See Section 3.2.2, Residential Site Development Standards, and Table 3.2-2 for the site development standards that apply to the N2 district. 
(C)  Other Development Standards. In addition to the standards established for the N2 district in this article, all development shall be subject to all other applicable standards in Article 3. 
(D)  Mixture of Dwelling Unit Types . 
(1)  For the purpose of promoting a mixture of dwelling unit types within a single neighborhood and subdivision, a mixture of dwelling unit types shall be required in accordance with Table 2.3-1 based on the size of the subdivision. This dwelling unit type mixture shall be distributed throughout the subdivision, not clustered in one area. 
(2)  Final plats for all phases of any residential subdivision shall adhere to the dwelling unit mixture requirements as specified in Table 2.3-1. 
Table 2.3-1: Mixture of Dwelling Unit Types Number of Lots
in a Subdivision Minimum Percentage of Lots Required to Accommodate Any Mixture of Two, Three, or Multi-Family Dwellings Required Minimum

2.4.2  College Development District (CD-S) . 
(A)  Purpose . Carleton College and St. Olaf College are essential and defining parts of Northfield's unique identity, valued contributors to community life, and powerful drivers of the local economy. The purpose of the College Development (CD-S) district is to allow college facilities and operations within the city limits while providing boundaries which respect the function and character of the colleges and their adjoining districts, particularly adjoining residential and commercial districts. Development near the edges of the campus referred to as the Perimeter Transition Area (PTA), which adjoins existing and/or planned residential and commercial districts, will utilize a wider process of dialog and input to facilitate compatibility between the campus and adjoining districts. 
(B)  Applicability . 
(1)  The CD-S district should generally apply to those areas designated as an "educational district" on the framework map of the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  The CD-S district shall include regulations applicable to two separate sub-zones referred to as the Internal Development Area (IDA) and the Perimeter Transition Area (PTA). 
(a)  The Internal Development area is all that area within the CD-S zone that is internal to the core of the college campus and is located a distance away from the CD-S district edge by 200 feet or more. 
(b)  The Perimeter Transition Area (PTA) shall be defined as an area inside the CD-S district that is within 200 feet of the boundary of the CD-S district. Where applicable, this area shall be measured from the midpoint of public rights-of-way adjoining the edge of college properties. If a public right-of-way adjoining the college property edge (with no adjoining buildings) is wider than 200 feet and contains no existing or planned buildings, then no PTA standards shall be applied and the area may develop consistent with the IDA standards. PTA procedures and standards shall be applicable where the PTA adjoins all districts except areas zoned agricultural and industrial. Areas adjacent to property zoned agricultural and industrial may develop consistent with the IDA standards and procedures. 
(C)  Purpose Statement and General Description of Development Process - IDA/PTA. In order to reflect the differing levels of impact that college development may have on non-college properties, two distinct development review and decision processes are applicable for development in the CD-S zone. 
(1)  For development proposed in the IDA sub-zone, such development will be subject to development standards and development review processing that is more general, flexible and administrative in nature using the Type 2 review procedure (See Section 8.4.5, Type 2 Review Procedure, City Planner Decision with Development Review Committee Review). 
(2)  For development proposed in the PTA sub-zone, except as specifically noted in (B)(2)(b) above, such development will be subject to development standards that are applicable to Conditional Use Permit criteria and will be subject to a thorough public review and decision process using the Type 4 review procedure with a Neighborhood meeting requirement (See Section 8.4.7, Type 4 Review Procedure, Planning Commission or Heritage Preservation Commission Recommendation and City Council Decision ). 
(3)  For all development proposed in the CD-S zone a parking study shall be prepared and provided to the city that analyzes campus wide parking supply and parking demand as a basis of determining the amount of parking that is needed to comply with the parking requirements as established in Section 3.6.5, Off-Street Parking Space Requirements and Table 3.8-2. The parking study shall include at a minimum the following data and information: 
(a)  Background of study and description of study methodology; 
(b)  Existing supply and demand analysis including existing supply, existing demand by user type including faculty, staff, student and visitor parking demand; 
(c)  Parking occupancy and adequacy analysis; 
(d)  Future demand analysis; 
(e)  Future planned parking facility expansion; 
(f)  Conclusions and recommendations. 
2.4.3  Public Benefit District (PB-S) . 
(A)  Purpose. The purpose of the Public Benefit District (PB-S) is to distinguish city owned parks and open space areas and the privately owned golf course and cemetery facilities which are devoted to the use by the public or the specific members of the golf course or religious institution that own the facilities from other open space agricultural areas that are intended for long term agricultural productivity or nearer term conversion to some other urban development use. The Public Benefit District (PB-S) is intended to primarily apply to city owned park and open space areas and facilities as shown on Map 8.1 Existing Park and Trail System Plan of the comprehensive plan. Additionally, the Public Benefit District (PB-S) has a more limited application related to privately owned golf course facilities and grounds and cemeteries. The use of land that is zoned Public Benefit District (PB-S) will be subject to limited regulatory requirements since the primary land use activity is that of open space, low intensity land use with minimal impact on the surrounding neighborhoods and the city infrastructure and services needed to support this land use. 
(B)  Site Development Standards. Building and development that occurs on city owned property shall comply with the site development standards that are found in Section 3.2.7, PB-S Public Benefit Site Development Standards to the greatest extent possible. All other building and development on privately owned property in areas zoned PB-S shall adhere to the standards found in Section 3.2.7, PB-S Public Benefit Site Development Standards. 
(C)  Other Development Standards. In addition to the standards found in Section 3.2.7, PB-S Public Benefit Site Development Standards, all buildings and development shall adhere to other requirements of Article 3: Development Standards of this LDC as they may apply and all other requirements of the City. 
All development and building that is to occur in areas zoned PB-S shall be subject to the development review procedures found in Article 8: Development Procedures of this LDC as outlined in the Type 2 review procedure (See Section 8.4.5, Type 2 Review Procedure, City Planner Decision with Development Review Committee Review). 
2.4.4  Public Institutional District (PI-S) . 
(A)  Purpose . 
(1)  The PI-S district can potentially apply to any land in any category on the framework map of the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  The Public Institutional (PI-S) district is intended to establish and protect sites for city, state, federal, and school district uses while also ensuring compatibility with the surrounding neighborhoods. The PI-S zone implements and is consistent with the land use designations of the comprehensive plan. 
(B)  Additional Site Plan Review Requirements. In addition to the requirements established for site plan review in Section 8.5.6, Site Plan Review, the city engineer shall have the authority to require a traffic impact study or stormwater management study depending on the size and impact of the proposed use. 
(C)  Other Development Standards . 
(1)  More than one principal building may be located on a single lot. 
(2)  In addition to the standards established for the PI-S district, all development shall be subject to all other applicable standards in Article 3: Development Standards. 
2.5 - Overlay Zoning Districts. 
2.5.1  Floodplain Overlay District (FP-O) .

2.7 - Permitted Principal Uses. 
2.7.1  General Provisions . Table 2.7-1 lists the principal uses allowed within all zoning districts except for the overlay zoning districts. The uses permitted in the overlay districts shall be controlled by the underlying base zoning district unless otherwise modified in the district standards of this article. 
2.7.2  Explanation of Table of Permitted Uses . 
(A)  Organization of Table. Table 2.7-1 organizes the uses by use categories and use types. 
(1)  Use Categories. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into broad general classifications (e.g., household living, mixed-use, commercial, etc.). The use classifications then organize land uses and activities into specific "use types" based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. 
(2)  Use Types. The use categories are divided into specific use types. The use types identify the specific uses that are considered to fall within characteristics identified in the broader use category. For example, single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, and townhome clusters are some of the specific use types that fall under the "household living" use category. 
(3)  Use Categories and Use Types Defined. Use categories and use types are defined in Section 2.8, Use Definitions. 
(B)  Symbols in Table . The symbols used in Table 2.7-1 are defined as follows: 
(1)  Permitted Uses (P). A "P" in a cell indicates that a use type is allowed by-right in the respective zoning district subject to compliance with the use-specific standards set forth in the final "use-specific standards" column of Table 2.7-1. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable standards of this LDC, including those set forth in Article 3: Development Standards. 
(2)  Conditional Uses (C). A "C" in a cell indicates that a use type is allowed as a conditional use in the respective zoning district subject to compliance with the use-specific standards set forth in the final "use-specific standards" column of Table 2.7-1 and approval of a conditional use permit in accordance with Section 8.5.9, Conditional Use Permit are subject to all other applicable standards of this LDC, including those set forth in Article 3: Development Standards. 
(C)  Pre-Existing Uses (PE). A "PE" in a cell indicates that a use type existed in the applicable zoning district prior to the effective date of this LDC and it is the intent of the city to allow the continuance of the use, regardless if the use is no longer permitted by-right (P) or conditionally allowed (C) in the district. Unless otherwise specifically provided, designated pre-existing uses are not nonconforming uses subject to the limitations of Section 2.12, Nonconformities, and may continue in accordance with Section 2.13, Pre-existing Uses. Pre-existing uses shall register with the city through the zoning certificate process (See Section 8.5.1(B)(1), Type 1 Review Procedure). 
(D)  Prohibited Uses. A cell with a "-" or a blank cell indicates that the listed use type is prohibited in the respective zoning district. 
(E)  Use-Specific Standards. The "use-specific standards" column of Table 2.7-1 cross-reference standards that are specific to an individual use type and are applicable to that use in all districts unless otherwise stated in the use-specific standards. 
(F)  Unlisted Uses. If an application is submitted for a use that is not listed in Table 2.7-1, the city planner is authorized to classify the new or unlisted use, with consultation from appropriate city departments, into an existing use type that most closely fits the new or unlisted use. If no similar use determination can be made, the city planner shall refer the use to the planning commission, who may initiate an amendment to the text of this LDC to clarify where and how the use should be permitted.

2.9 - Use-Specific Standards. 
2.9.1  Purpose and Applicability. 
(A)  This section provides site planning, development, and/or operating standards for certain land uses that are permitted or conditionally permitted in Table 2.7-1. 
(B)  The land uses and activities covered by this section shall comply with the applicable standards for the specific use in all districts unless otherwise specified, in addition to all other applicable provisions of this LDC. 
2.9.2  Adult Uses. 
(A)  Findings and Purpose . Studies conducted by the Minnesota Attorney General, the American Planning Association, and the Texas City Attorneys' Association and cities such as St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana, Hopkins, Minnesota, Ramsey, Minnesota; Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles California; Seattle, Washington; St. Croix County, Wisconsin; Adams County and the City of Denver, Colorado have studied the impacts that adult establishments have in those communities. These studies have concluded that adult establishments have adverse impacts on the surrounding neighborhoods. These impacts include increased crime rates, lower property values, increased transience, neighborhood blight, and potential health risks. The adverse impacts which adult uses have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the adult establishments increases. Based on these studies and findings, the city council concludes: 
(1)  Adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set forth above on the neighborhoods surrounding them, which is distinct from the impact caused by other commercial uses. 
(2)  The adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish if adult establishments are governed by geographic, licensing, and health requirements. 
(3)  It is not the intent of the city council to prohibit adult establishments from having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city. 
(4)  Many members of the public perceive areas within which adult establishments are located as less safe than other areas that do not have such uses. 
(5)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult establishment. A licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the adult establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the residents of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(6)  The fact that an applicant for an adult establishment license has been convicted of a sexually-related crime is rationally related to the legitimate concern that the applicant may engage in similar criminal conduct in the future. 
(7)  The barring of individuals with sexually-related criminal convictions from the management of adult establishments for a period of time serves as a deterrent to future criminal conduct. 
(8)  The general health, safety, and welfare of the community are promoted by prohibiting nudity in adult establishments. This prohibition is based on concerns of potential adverse effects such as prostitution, the transmission of sexually-transmitted diseases, exposure to minors, obscenity and unsanitary conditions in public places. 
(9)  Smaller cities throughout Minnesota experience many of the same adverse impacts of adult establishments that are present in larger metropolitan communities. 
(10)  The public health, safety, morals and general welfare will be promoted by the city adopting regulations governing adult establishments. 
(11)  The city council finds the characteristics of the city are substantially similar to those of the cities cited when considering the effects of adult establishments. 
(12)  The city council finds, based upon the report and the studies cited, that adult uses may have adverse secondary effects upon certain preexisting land uses within the city, and that the public health, safety, and general welfare will be promoted if the city adopts regulations regarding adult uses. 
(13)  The city council finds that the adverse secondary effects tend to diminish if adult uses in the city are regulated by locational and licensing requirements. 
(B)  Permitted Location for Adult Uses . Only one adult use establishment is allowed per free-standing building. Adult use establishments shall be located at least 500 feet as measured in a straight line, from the main public entrance of the adult establishment to the nearest boundary line of the following:

2.13 - Pre-Existing Uses. 
2.13.1  Purpose . A Pre-Existing use identified in Table 2.7-1 with a "PE" is not a nonconforming use and may continue whether or not the use is a permitted or conditional use in a particular district under this code. However, if a major amendment or change to the use is proposed to be made (as defined in Section 8.5.9(E), Amendments to an Approved Conditional Use Permit, of this code), such proposal shall be reviewed using the procedures and criteria of Section 8.5.9, Conditional Use Permit. A major amendment means an increase in floor space by 20 percent or more or a change in the type of use (e.g., residential to commercial). The conditions imposed by any pre-existing conditional use permit shall continue to apply unless otherwise approved by the City. 
Unless otherwise specifically provided by this code (e.g. 320 3 rd Street E.), pre-existing college-related office uses in a residential district shall be treated as nonconforming uses subject to Section 2.12, Nonconformities, rather than as pre-existing uses under this section. 
2.13.2  Abandonment or Discontinuance . In the event that a pre-existing use is abandoned or discontinued, only a use classified as the same as the abandoned pre-existing use may be reestablished in the structure or on the land. For example, only a restaurant may be permitted in a structure or on land that was formerly used as a restaurant. 
2.13.3  Damage or Destruction . If a structure that contained a pre-existing use is damaged or destroyed to any extent, it may be fully reconstructed. Any new structure or reconstruction shall be contained within the same footprint of the previous structure and shall not exceed the height of the previous structure.

3.1 - Measurements, Computations, and Exceptions. 
3.1.1  Percentages and Fractions . When a calculation or ratio established in this LDC results in a fractional number or percentage, any fraction of 1/2 or less shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than 1/2 shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number. Any percentage of .5 percent or less shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number and any percentage greater than .5 percent shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number. 
3.1.2  Distance Measurements . Unless otherwise expressly stated, distances specified in this LDC are to be measured as the length of an imaginary straight line joining those points. Building square footage shall be determined by measuring the area of the building using the outermost building exterior walls. 
3.1.3  Lot Area Measurements . 
(A)  The area of a lot includes the total horizontal surface area within the lot's boundaries minus any of the following, regardless of whether they may be used by the general public or are reserved for residents of the subdivision: 
(1)  A vehicular or non-vehicular access easement through the parcel; 
(2)  An easement for an open drainage course, whether a ditch, natural channel or floodway; and 
(3)  Other easements restricting the use of the property. 
(B)  For nonconforming lots, see Section 2.12.5, Nonconforming Lots of Record. 
(C)  With the exception of governmental acquisition of land as provided for in Section 2.12.5(D), Governmental Acquisition of a Portion of a Lot, no lot shall be reduced in area so that the lot area per dwelling unit, lot width, yards, building area, or other requirements of this LDC are not met. 
3.1.4  Lot Width Measurements . Lot width is the distance between the side lot lines measured at the point of the front building line where a build-to line is established or between the side lots lines measured 30 feet from the front lot line where a minimum front yard setback is required (See Figure 3-1). 

Figure 3-1: This image shows a building that has 60 percent of the front building façade built to the build-to-line. In this case, the lot width is measured at the build-to-line. 
3.1.5  Build-to-Line and Setback Requirements and Exceptions . 
(A)  Build-to Lines . 
(1)  Where a build-to-line is established, the front façade of the principal building shall be constructed along that build-to-line for the minimum percentage required (See Figure 3-1). 
(2)  Eaves and other projections may encroach into the front yard, past the build-to-line, in accordance with Section 3.1.5(F), Allowed Encroachments into Setbacks and Build-to Lines. 
(3)  The city planner may waive build-to line requirements for a project with more than one building, where the project street frontage is occupied by one or more buildings in compliance with applicable build-to line requirements and secondary buildings are placed on the site to the rear of the front buildings. 
(4)  No portion of any structure, including eaves or roof overhangs, shall extend beyond a property line, or into an access easement or street right-of-way, except as provided by this section. 
(B)  Setbacks . 
(1)  Setback standards provide open areas around structures for visibility and traffic safety, access to and around structures, access to natural light, ventilation and direct sunlight, separation between potentially conflicting activities, and space for privacy, landscaping, and recreation. 
(2)  Each structure shall comply with the front, interior side, corner street side, and rear setback requirements of the applicable zoning district, except: 
(a)  Where a front or street-side build-to line requirement is established by the applicable zoning district, in which case a proposed structure shall instead comply with the build-to line requirement; 
(b)  Where a setback requirement is established for a specific land use type in Section 2.9, Use-Specific Standards; 
(c)  In the case of development near a waterway, which shall comply with the setback requirements established by the WS-O district, where applicable; and 
(d)  As otherwise provided by this section. 
(3)  No portion of any structure, including eaves or roof overhangs, shall extend beyond a property line, or into an access easement or street right-of-way, except as provided by this section. 
(C)  Exemptions from Setback and Build-to Line Requirements . The minimum setback requirements and build-to line requirements of this LDC do not apply to the following: 
(1)  A building feature that encroaches into a required setback as allowed by Section 3.1.5(F), Allowed Encroachments into Setbacks and Build-to Lines; 
(2)  A fence or wall that is allowed pursuant to Section 3.3.2, Fencing and Walls; 
(3)  A deck, earthwork, step, patio, free-standing solar device other than in a front setback, or other site design element that is placed directly upon grade and does not exceed a height of 18 inches above the surrounding grade at any one point; 
(4)  A sign in compliance with Article 6, Signage; or 
(5)  A retaining wall less than 30 inches in height above finished grade. 
(D)  Measurement of Setbacks and Build-to Lines . Setbacks shall be measured as follows, unless otherwise established elsewhere in Section 3.1, Measurements, Computations, and Exceptions, or in instances where the city planner may require different setback measurement methods because an unusual parcel configuration makes the following requirements infeasible or ineffective (See Figure 3-2). 
(1)  General Requirements . 
(a)  A front setback shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the public right-of-way at the front of the parcel to the nearest point of the wall of the structure, except as provided for in this subsection. The front property line is the narrowest dimension of a lot adjacent to a street. 

Figure 3-2: Setback locations and traffic safety visibility triangle. 
(b)  If the city has established a plan that identifies a right-of-way for the future construction of a new street or the widening of an existing street, a required front or street side setback, or build-to line, shall be measured from the line shown on the plan. 
(c)  Where the city has established specific setback requirements for individual single-dwelling parcels through the approval of a specific plan, subdivision map, or other entitlement, prior to the effective date of this LDC, those setbacks shall apply to infill development within the approved project instead of the setbacks required by this LDC. 
(2)  Corner Lots . 
(a)  The front setback or build-to line shall be measured from the nearest point of the wall of the structure to the nearest point of the most narrow street frontage property line. If the property lines on both street frontages are of the same length, the property line to be used for front setback measurement shall be determined by the city planner. 
(b)  For the purposes of accessory uses, the rear yard shall be the setback that is on the opposite side of the lot from the front setback (front yard) from the street on which the building faces (See rear setback location on Figure 3-2). 
(c)  The side setback or side build-to-line on the street side of a corner parcel shall be measured from whichever of the following points results in the greatest setback from an existing or future roadway: 
(i)  The nearest point on the side property line bounding the street; 
(ii)  The inside edge of the sidewalk; or 
(iii)  The boundary of a planned future right-of-way established as described in Section 3.1.5(D) (1), General Requirements. 
(3)  Double-frontage Lots . 
(a)  A double-frontage lot is considered to have two front lot lines and a required front setback or build-to-line shall be provided from both front lot lines (See Figure 3-3). 

Figure 3-3: Illustration of a double frontage lot, related lot lines, and related yards. 
(b)  Vehicular access onto a double frontage lot shall generally be from the street with the lowest existing and projected traffic volumes, but with the proposed building designed so that its primary façade faces the higher volume street. 
(c)  The city engineer may authorize alternative access locations, where appropriate, because of localized traffic conditions, and/or nearby residential areas that would be adversely affected by increased traffic. 
(d)  For the purposes of accessory uses and structures, the rear yard shall be considered the yard that is behind the front, or principal, façade of the building. 
(e)  See Section 5.2.2(G), Double Frontage Lots, regarding the limited circumstances where new double frontage lots are allowed. 
(f)  Reverse frontage on double frontage lots shall be regulated by Section 3.3.1, Reverse Frontage. 
(4)  Side Setbacks . The side setback shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the side property line of the parcel to the nearest point of the wall of the structure; establishing a setback line parallel to the side property line, which extends between the front and rear setbacks (See Figure 3-2). 
(5)  Rear Setbacks . 
(a)  The rear setback shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the rear property line to the nearest part of the structure, establishing a setback line parallel to the rear property line (See Figure 3-2). 
(b)  Where a parcel has no rear lot line because its side lot lines converge to a point, the city planner shall be responsible for determining the location of the rear setback. 
(E)  Limitations on the Use of Setbacks for Structures . A required setback area shall not be occupied by structures other than: 
(1)  The fences and walls permitted by Section 3.3.2, Fencing and Walls; 
(2)  Accessory uses permitted in the established yard per Section 2.11, Accessory Uses and Structures; and 
(3)  The projections into setbacks allowed by Section 3.1.5(F), Allowed Encroachments into Setbacks and Build-to Lines, and the applicable zone. 
(F)  Allowed Encroachments into Setbacks and Build-to Lines . An architectural feature attached to a principal structure may extend beyond the wall of the structure and into a required front, side, or rear setback in compliance with Table 3.1-1 (See also Figure 3-4). These requirements do not apply to accessory structures, which are instead subject to Section 2.10, Accessory Uses and Structures.

Figure 3-4: Allowed projections and encroachments. 
(G)  Setback Requirements for Specific Structures . A detached deck, steps, terrace, or other site design element that is placed directly upon the grade, and that exceeds a height of 18 inches above the surrounding grade at any point, shall comply with the setback requirements of this LDC for detached accessory structures in Section 2.10, Accessory Uses and Structures. 
3.1.6  Height Measurement, Limits, and Exceptions . 
(A)  The height of each structure shall not exceed the height limit established for the applicable zoning district (See Section 3.2, Site Development Standards) except as otherwise provided by this subsection. 
(B)  The maximum allowable height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the natural grade of the site to an imaginary plane located at the maximum allowed number of feet above and parallel to the grade (See Figure 3-5). The location of natural grade shall be determined by the city planner, and shall not be artificially raised to gain additional building height. 

Figure 3-5: Maximum allowable height. 
(C)  Where specified in feet, building height shall be measured as the vertical distance from grade at the base of the structure to (See Figure 3-6): 
(1)  The highest point of a flat roof; 
(2)  The deck line of a mansard roof; or 
(3)  The mean height between the eaves and highest point on gable, hip, or gambrel roofs. 

Figure 3-6: The height of a structure is measured based on the roof type. 
(D)  Exceptions to Height Limits . The following structures and structural features may exceed the height limits of this LDC as noted: 
(1)  Architectural features including a chimney, cupola, monument, mechanical equipment, or vent may exceed the height limit by a maximum of three feet. A spire, theater scenery loft, tower, or other uninhabitable feature may exceed the height limit by 25 feet for nonresidential uses. 
(2)  The height of telecommunications facilities, including antennas, poles, towers, and necessary mechanical appurtenances, shall comply with Section 2.9.18, Telecommunication Facilities and Antennas. 
(3)  The height of wind energy turbines shall comply with Section 2.10.4(K), Wind Energy Turbines (WET). 
(E)  Height Limit at Street Corners (Traffic Safety Visibility Triangle) . Development proposed adjacent to any public or private street or alley intersection in every district except C1 shall be designed to provide a traffic safety visibility area for pedestrian and traffic safety (See Figure 3-2, Figure 3-7, and Figure 3-8). 
(1)  A traffic safety visibility area, which may include private property and/or public right-of-way, is a triangle area defined by measuring 35 feet from the intersection of the extension of the front and side street curb lines (or the right-of-way lines where there is no curb) and connecting the lines across the property (See Figure 3-7). 

Figure 3-7: Traffic safety visibility triangle for intersecting streets. 
(2)  For intersections of streets and driveways, the traffic safety visibility area shall be created by measuring 25 feet from the edge of the driveway along the street and 20 feet along the driveway, perpendicular from the street (See Figure 3-8). 

Figure 3-8: Traffic safety visibility triangle for driveway and street intersections. 
(3)  The city planner, in consultation with the city engineer, may reduce the distance requirement where it determines a narrow parcel frontage would excessively reduce buildable area. 
(4)  No structure, sign, or landscape element shall exceed 30 inches in height, measured from the top of the curb, within the traffic safety visibility area, unless approved by the city engineer. 
(5)  An exception to this requirement shall be for existing trees where the canopy is trimmed to a minimum of eight feet above grade. 
3.2 - Site Development Standards. 
3.2.1  Purpose . The purpose of these site development standards is to further the purpose of this LDC and the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan. Furthermore, these standards are intended to establish appropriate lot dimensions within each zoning district, provide for appropriate scale of structures, and prescribe how structures will relate to a vibrant, pedestrian friendly streetscape. 
3.2.2  Residential Site Development Standards . 
(A)  Building Orientation in Residential Districts . All residential development shall be located parallel to the associated street or be consistent with existing development patterns rather than being sited at unconventional angles, unless irregular lot layouts require alternative orientations. Such alternative orientations shall be subject to approval by the city planner (Figure 3-9). 

Figure 3-9 Example of residential development that is oriented toward the primary street. 
(B)  Principal Building Placement . Table 3.2-1 and 3.2-2 present the dimensional regulations for placing principal buildings in the residential districts.

Where an alley is not permitted, the minimum lot width for a single family home is 50 feet. 5 A height of up to 50 feet is allowed for a building with nine or more residential units, but the impact of the building shall be mitigated according to the standards of Section 2.9.14, Multi-Family Dwellings. 6 Refer to Table 2.2-1 of the Transportation chapter of the Northfield comprehensive Plan for a map of streets by type.  
(C)  Garage Placement and Size in the Residential Districts . Table 3.2-3 presents the dimensional regulations for garages in the residential districts. 
(a)  Purpose and Intent . The intent of regulations on the setback, width and relative proportion of attached or detached garages is: 
(i)  To ensure that there is a physical and visual connection between the living area of the home and the street; 
(ii)  To ensure that the location and amount of living space of the home, as seen from the street, is more prominent than the garage; 
(iii)  To prevent garages from obscuring the main entrance from the street and ensure that the main entrance for pedestrians, rather than automobiles, is the prominent entrance; 
(iv)  Provide for a more pleasant pedestrian environment by preventing garages from dominating the views of the neighborhood from the sidewalk; and 
(v)  Enhance public safety by preventing garages from blocking views of the street from inside the home. 
(b)  Dimensional Regulations . Dimensional regulations for attached and detached garages for 1-, 2- and 3-family buildings are presented in Table 3.2-3.

The length of that wall should be equal to or greater than 25 percent of the length of that property line. 
[2] May be reduced for shared parking lots and similar public benefits. 
[3] Additional square footage may be allowed by Conditional Use Permit.  
(B)  Site and Building Design Guidelines . Table 3.2-8: Site and Building Design Guidelines for the C2 District 
Table 3.2-8: Site and Building Design Guidelines for the C2 District Development Intensity 1. Development should be compact; each site should be used efficiently. This means that the size of the each building should be maximized while the amount of off-street parking should be the minimum practical. Vertical or horizontal mixtures of differing types of development such as business and housing may be used to make full use of sites. Land Uses 1. Retail and service businesses should be the primary uses of land in the C2 District, as listed in Table 2.7-1. Multiple-family housing may be included as part of a mixed use development or may be appropriate as a stand-alone use in certain locations. Relationship of Buildings to Streets 1. Whenever practical, at least one side of each building should be located in close proximity (without intervening parking) to one or more of the adjacent local or collector public streets such as Jefferson Road, Jefferson Parkway, Heritage Drive or Honeylocust Drive. On corner sites, the building should be located near the corner. The intention of this guideline is to add a sense of enclosure to the street and to help pedestrians walk from the street sidewalk to the building entrance. The rear or service side of the building should not be used for this purpose. 
2. The primary entrance of buildings shall be oriented toward a public street or, if in the interior of a development and none of the facades has frontage on a public street, toward a driveway. 
3. Site entrances should be located along the local or collector public streets and separated from other driveways or public street intersections according to the access management guidelines of the Transportation Plan chapter of the Northfield Comprehensive Plan. Pedestrian and Bicyclist Access 1. Site and building design shall include site improvements that create a system of pedestrian and bicycle circulation on site from parking areas to plazas, open space, other pedestrian pathways and to adjoining building. Existing and proposed pedestrian and/or bicycle circulation systems and easements shall be integrated into site design. 
2. There should be a concrete sidewalk at least 5 feet wide in the street right-of-way along each public street abutting the site except for the Highway 3 frontage. 
3. There shall be an obvious, designated walkway from the public sidewalk along the street to the front door of the building. 
4. Bicycle parking is encouraged for every building. Bicycle parking facilities shall be provided according to Section 3.6.7. Building Primary Materials Allowable Primary Materials: 
1. Easily-maintained materials that are durable and have a pattern, texture and detailing that are compatible with those in the Historic District Sub-District. 
2. Brick, stone, stucco or colored and textured pre-cast concrete. 
3. Metals with matte finish and with neutral or earth tone colors; metals that are used for exterior walls should have visible corner moldings and trim. Metal wall finishes should be secondary to masonry and pre-cast finishes. 
4. Transparent glass. 
5. Canvas awnings. 
6. Wood as an accent material or in elements that are integrated with other desirable materials. Prohibited Primary Materials: 
1. Non-durable siding materials such as plywood, corrugated metal, fiberglass, asphalt or fiberboard siding, or other materials that decay rapidly when exposed to the elements. 
2. Materials that have no pattern or relief, especially when those materials are applied to large wall surfaces. 
3. Vinyl. 
4. Mirrored glass. 
5. Materials that represent corporate colors, patterns or trademarks (except for signs). 
6. Brightly colored metal roofing or canopies. 
7. Concrete that is not enhanced as indicated under "Allowable Materials," especially pre-cast, tilt-up walls. Building Facades 
and Massing 1. Although the front façade of a building is expected to be the focal point in terms of the level of architectural character and features, all sides of buildings that are visible from a public roadway should have a similar appearance in terms of materials and general design. 
2. Building design should help create an environment conducive to walking and viewing by using generously-sized first-floor windows, doors, materials, articulation, canopies, awnings or other architectural elements. 
3. Buildings shall be divided into increments by articulating the façade. This can be achieved through a combination of the following techniques and others that may meet the objective: 
 (a) Stepping back or extending forward a portion of the façade. 
 (b) Vertical divisions using different textures or materials. 
 (c) Division into storefronts with separate display windows and entrances. 
 (d) Variation in roof lines by alternating dormers, stepped roofs, gables or other roof elements to reinforce the modulation or articulation interval. 
 (e) Variations in color. 
 (f) Arcades, awnings, window bays, arched windows and balconies at intervals equal to the articulation interval. 
 (g) Providing a lighting fixture, trellis or similar landscape feature with each articulation interval. 
4. Walls that face a public street shall have one or more windows or glass doors. The primary façade of each building should consist of a base, a body and a cap. The cap should consist of at least one of the following architectural features: a cornice, parapet, awning, canopy, or eaves. The base and cap should be clearly distinguishable from the body through changes in color, material, pattern, profile, or texture. Building facades visible from a public street should use materials and design features similar to those of the front façade. 
5. Buildings over 100 feet in length should be at least 1-1/2 stories in height for at least 30 percent of their length. 
6. When flat roofs are used, parapet walls with three-dimensional cornice treatments should conceal them. Windows 1. The primary street level façade of large retail or office establishments (over 25,000 square feet) that face a public street or walkway shall be transparent between the height of 3 and 8 feet above sidewalk grade for at least 40 percent of the horizontal length of the building façade. 
2. The primary street level façade of smaller retail or office establishments (25,000 square feet or less) shall be transparent for at least 50 percent of the horizontal length of the building façade, between the height of 3 and 8 feet above sidewalk grade, at minimum. Customer Entrance Design 1. Buildings should have clearly-defined, easily visible customer entrances that include at least three of the following features: 
 (a) Canopies or porticos above the entrance; 
 (b) Roof overhangs above the entrance; 
 (c) Entry recesses or projections; 
 (d) Arcades that are physically integrated with the entrance; 
 (e) Raised corniced parapets above the entrance; 
 (f) Gabled roof forms or arches above the entrance; 
 (g) Outdoor plaza adjacent to the entrance having seating and a minimum depth of 15 feet; 
 (h) Display windows that are directly adjacent to the entrance; 
 (i) Architectural details, such as tile work and moldings, that are integrated into the building structure and design and are above and/or directly adjacent to the entrance; or 
 (j) Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas or seating areas. A wing wall is a wall secondary in scale projecting from a primary wall and not having a roof. Landscaping 1. Areas not used for buildings or parking should be generously and intensively landscaped consistent with the standards of Section 3.5. 
2. The following shall apply to interior landscaping in the C2 district: 
 a. Landscape islands shall be located at the end of each parking row with a minimum size of 135 square feet for single loaded parking rows, and a minimum size of 270 square feet for double loaded rows (Figure 3-10). 
 b. No more than 15 spaces shall be located in a continuous row without being interrupted by a landscaped island, unless the island is used for surface water infiltration. Such landscape islands shall be of the minimum size established in (a) above (Figure 3-10). 
 c. Landscape medians with a minimum width of ten feet shall be located as to separate every four parallel rows of cars and shall run the full length of the parking row (Figure 3-10). 
 d. Each individual landscaped island shall include a minimum of one tree and two shrubs. 
 e. The landscaped medians required in paragraph (c) above shall be planted with one deciduous tree every 20 lineal feet. Properties near 
the Cannon River 1. If property is adjacent to a city-owned park or trail land along the Cannon River, landscaping shall be incorporated along the perimeter of the property in accordance with Table 3.5-3 of this LDC, if it does not already exist, to screen parking lots, outdoor storage, and loading spaces from view of park or trail users.

3.4 - Neighborhood Compatibility Standards. 
3.4.1  Purpose and Intent . The purpose of the neighborhood compatibility standards is to protect the character of existing residential neighborhoods in instances where there is a proposed infill development, redevelopment project, or building expansion. The primary focus of these compatibility standards is to ensure that new infill development, redevelopment, or building expansion relates to the massing and scale of the surrounding structures. 
3.4.2  General Provisions . 
(A)  Except where exempted by Section 3.4.3, Exemptions, these standards shall apply to the development, expansion, or redevelopment of structures in the R1, R2, R3, N1, and NC-F districts. In the PTA sub-zone, these standards shall be used as guidelines and not absolute standards. 
(B)  The city desires to protect the quality of its surface waters, including the Cannon River and its creek tributaries. 
(C)  Definitions : For the purposes of these standards: 
(1)  "Building Placement" shall mean the actual location of an existing building on a property (See Section 3.1); and 
(2)  "Primary Façade" shall mean the front face of a building which faces the front yard and is located nearest the front property line. An attached garage is not a component of the primary facade; and 
(3)  "Recessed Façade" shall mean that portion of a building which faces the front yard and is set back from the front property line a distance greater than that of the primary façade. 
3.4.3  Exemptions . The following forms of development shall be exempt from the standards of this section: 
(A)  Accessory buildings; 
(B)  Development subject to an approved master plan, development agreement, variance, or planned unit development protected by a PD-O district; 
(C)  Existing nonresidential or mixed-use development lawfully established prior to the effective date of this LDC; 
(D)  A change of use, with no structural changes, that is permitted in the base zoning district. 
3.4.4  Standards for Residential Development . 
(A)  Development subject to these neighborhood compatibility standards shall comply with the standards of this subsection. 
(B)  Design Standards for One, Two and Three Family Dwellings in R1, R2 and R3 
(1)  Methods for Determining Compatibility Standards . For the purposes of this subsection, the following are the methods by which compatibility is determined for building placement, building height and massing: 
(a)  Proposed new housing units or building expansions shall be compared to similar existing housing units. For example, single family homes shall be compared to other low density homes, not churches, schools, or high density residential land uses. 
(b)  Proposed new development or building expansion in the front yard shall be placed within five feet of the average distance from the property line of the two structures adjacent on both sides of the same street, except those structures more than 50 feet or less than 15 feet from the front yard property line (see Figure 3-14). If there are fewer than four structures on the same side of the street, the lower number of structures is used in the calculation. 

Figure 3-14: Because of the variety in existing placement of buildings on the same block face, new development or building expansion on the subject property (lot C) may be located with a building placement of 20 feet, which is the average of the placement of lots B, D, and E. The building on lot A is not included in the average because it is located more than 50 feet from the property line. 
(c)  For corner lots, proposed new development or building expansion shall be compared to the average of the two adjacent structures on both streets, except those structures no more than 50 feet or no less than 15 feet from their front yard line (see Figure 3-15). If there are less than two structures on either street, the lesser number of structures is used in the calculation. 

Figure 3-15: Building placement for corner lot conditions. 
(2)  Building Placement .

(3)  Building Height and Massing . 
(a)  No principal building shall be constructed which is more than five feet taller than the average height of the two adjacent buildings on either side of the subject property as shown in Figure 3-14 or Figure 3-15. However, if the two adjacent buildings on either side of the subject property are single story homes, the building height for the subject property may be constructed to two stories, or 30 feet in height, whichever is less. 
(b)  No principal building shall be constructed where the primary façade is more than five feet wider or narrower than the average width of the two adjacent buildings on either side of the subject property. However, the width of the façade may be increased by more than five feet beyond the average width of the two adjacent buildings if the building has a recessed façade which is set back at least six feet back from the primary façade.

(C)  A pedestrian way accessible to physically disabled persons shall be provided from each parking space to related facilities including curb cuts or ramps. 
3.6.7  Bicycle Parking . The purpose of bicycle parking regulations is to encourage bicycling for personal transportation, to provide access to employment, commercial, residential and other destinations, and to provide safe, convenient bicycle parking located as close as possible to the main entrance of a destination. Provision of bicycle parking is required throughout the city. 
(A)  Those areas of the C1 district that do not require vehicle parking are not required to provide bicycle parking. However, bicycle parking is still encouraged in those areas. 
(B)  The number of required bicycle parking spaces is found in Table 3.6-2. The city planner may waive or reduce the required number of bicycle parking spaces in those instances where bike parking is not physically feasible. The following standards are applicable to bicycle parking spaces: 
(1)  If more than ten bicycle parking spaces are required, at least 50 percent of those spaces shall be sheltered by overhangs or covered walkways. 
(2)  Each bicycle parking space shall be accessible without moving another bicycle, usually by allowing 21/2 feet by six feet for each bicycle parking space. 
(C)  Bicycle parking shall be located in an area that will not pose a safety hazard to the bicyclist and shall be separated from auto parking and traffic with space and a physical barrier. 
(D)  A sign shall be posted at the main building entrance indicating the location of large bicycle parking areas. 
(E)  Bicycle parking areas shall be well-lit for theft protection, personal security, and accident prevention.

(2)  With the exception of parking located in the CD-S zone, no off-site parking space shall be located more than 500 feet from the primary entrance of the use served, measured along the shortest legal, practical walking route. This route may include crossing a right-of-way provided it uses a legal crosswalk. 
(3)  If an off-site parking area is located in a different zoning district, the off-site parking areas shall adhere to the regulations of the same or a more intensive zoning classification than that required for the use served. 
(4)  In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement as outlined in (5), below, shall be required. 
(5)  An off-site parking agreement shall be submitted and approved as to form by the city attorney. This agreement shall include evidence of deed restrictions or other recorded covenants that ensure that the spaces will be properly maintained during the life of the development. 
(6)  The approved off-site parking agreement shall be filed with the application for a zoning certificate and shall be filed with the appropriate county and recorded in a manner as to encumber all properties involved in the off-site parking agreement. 
(7)  No zoning certificate will be issued until proof of recordation of the agreement is provided to the city planner. 
3.6.9  Location of Parking . 
(A)  Generally . 
(1)  Unless otherwise stated, parking spaces shall be located on the same lot as the principal use they serve unless the spaces meet the requirements of Section 3.6.8(D), Shared Parking or Section 3.6.8(E), Off-Site Parking. 
(2)  Parking is prohibited in any required screening or landscaping buffering areas as may be required in Section 3.5, Landscape, Screening, and Buffering Standards. 
(B)  Spaces accessory to multiple-family dwellings shall be on the same lot as the principal use served or within 200 feet of the main entrance to the principal building served.

Article 4. - FLOODPLAINS, WETLANDS AND SHORELANDS 

4.1 - Development Standards for the FP-O District. 
4.1.1  Applicability . This section shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of Northfield shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments thereto as being located within the boundaries of the floodway, flood fringe, or general flood plain subdistricts (designated as the FP-O district on the official zoning map). 
4.1.2  General Provisions . The official zoning map is incorporated herein by reference. The official zoning map shall be on file in the office of the city clerk and the city planner. The materials attached to the official zoning map shall include the following: (Revised by Ordinance 923, October 18, 2011). 
(A)  The Flood Insurance Study, Rice County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas and the flood insurance rate maps with panel numbers 27131C0154D, 27131C0158D, 27131C0159D, 27131C0161D,27131C0162D,27131C0170D, all of these documents being prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated April 3, 2012; and 
(B)  The Federal Emergency Management Agency's Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) for the City of Northfield (case # 12-05-1809P), having an effective date of October 2, 2012; and 
(C)  The Flood Insurance Study, Dakota County, Minnesota and Incorporated Areas and the flood insurance rate maps with panel numbers 27037C0480 E, 27037C0481 E, and 27037C0482 E, all of these documents being prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated December 2, 2011. 
4.1.3  Interpretation . 
(A)  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(B)  The boundaries of the subdistricts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official zoning map, as for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, and there is a formal appeal of the decision of the city planner, the zoning board of appeals shall make the necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the regional (100-year) flood profile, the ground elevations that existed on the site at the time the city adopted its initial flood plain ordinance or on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the 100-year floodplain, if earlier, and other available technical data. Persons contesting the location of the subdistrict boundaries shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the zoning board of appeals and to submit technical evidence. 
(C)  It is not intended by this section to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this section shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this section are superseded by this section for flood plain management. 
(D)  This section does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such subdistricts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
4.1.4  Development Standards for the Floodway Subdistrict (FW) . 
(A)  Permitted Uses . 
(1)  Permitted uses shall include fences, parks, loading areas, parking areas, lawns, gardens, play areas, trails, and buried utility transmission lines, subject to the additional standards in this section. 
(2)  All other uses, including those permitted or conditionally permitted in underlying base zoning districts, shall be prohibited. 
(3)  Standards for floodway permitted uses shall be as follows and as determined by engineering studies required by the city as part of the application: 
(a)  The use shall have a low flood damage potential. 
(b)  The use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district. 
(c)  The use shall not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and shall not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of materials or equipment. 
(B)  Conditional Uses . Conditional uses shall include accessory structures, placement of fill, excavation, and/or storage of materials or equipment related to the permitted uses in Section 4.1.4(A), Permitted Uses, above and the uses listed below: 
(1)  Structural works for flood control such as levees, dikes, and floodwalls constructed to any height where the intent is to protect individual structures and levees or dikes where the intent is to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten year frequency flood event. 
(2)  Storage yards for equipment, machinery, and materials. 
(3)  Railroad, streets, bridges, pipelines, and above grade utility transmission lines. 
(4)  Recreational vehicles on individual lots of record. 
(C)  Standards for Conditional Uses in the Floodway Subdistrict . 
(1)  No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and levees), deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other uses may be allowed as a conditional use that will cause any increase in the stage of the 100-year or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected. 
(2)  All floodway conditional uses shall be subject to the procedures and standards contained in this Section 4.1, Development Standards for the FP-O District, and Section 8.5.9, Conditional Use Permit. 
(3)  The conditional use shall be permissible in the underlying zoning district. 
(4)  Fill and all other similar materials deposited or stored in the flood plain shall be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap, or other acceptable method. 
(5)  Accessory Structures . 
(a)  Accessory structures shall not be designed for human habitation. 
(b)  Accessory structures, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood waters: 
(c)  Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and 
(d)  So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures. 
(e)  Accessory structures shall be elevated on fill or structurally dry flood proofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classifications in the state building code. As an alternative, an accessory structure may be flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 flood proofing classification in the state building code provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment, does not exceed 500 square feet in size at its largest projection, and for a detached garage, the detached garage must be used solely for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All flood proofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards: 
(i)  The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure and shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; and 
(ii)  Any mechanical and utility equipment in a structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly flood proofed; and 
(iii)  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
(6)  Storage of Materials and Equipment .

(B)  Standards for flood fringe permitted uses shall be as follows: . 
(1)  All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor including basement floor is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon. 
(2)  As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet at its largest projection may be internally flood proofed in accordance with Section 4.1.4(C)(5)(c). 
(3)  The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(4)  The provisions of Section 4.1.5(E), Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses. 
(C)  Conditional Uses . Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood proofed in accordance with Section 4.1.5(B)(1) and Section 4.1.5(B)(2) or any use of land that does not comply with the standards in Section 4.1.5(B)(3) shall only be allowable as a conditional use, including those uses that are permitted as of right in the underlying base zoning district. An application for a conditional use shall be subject to the standards and criteria and evaluation procedures specified in paragraph (D) and (E) below, Section 4.1.10(D) and Section 8.5.9, Conditional Use Permit. 
(D)  Standards for Flood Fringe Conditional Uses: . 
(1)  Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure; 2) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and 3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards: 
(a)  The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the state building code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding. 
(b)  Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: 
(i)  A minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a flood proofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and 
(ii)  That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the state building code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage. 
(2)  Basements, as defined by Article 9: Definitions, of this LDC, shall be subject to the following: 
(a)  Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(b)  Nonresidential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry flood proofed in accordance with Section 4.1.5(D)(3) below. 
(3)  All areas of nonresidential structures including basements to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood proofed in accordance with the structurally dry flood proofing classifications in the state building code. Structurally dry flood proofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 flood proofing classification in the state building code and this shall require making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures flood proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not be permitted. 
(4)  Storage of materials and equipment: . 
(a)  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
(b)  Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning and in accordance with a plan approved by the city. 
(5)  The provisions of Section 4.1.5(E), Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses shall also apply. 
(E)  Standards for All Flood Fringe Uses . The following standards shall apply to all uses in the flood fringe subdistrict: 
(1)  New Principal Structures . All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the zoning board of appeals must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist. 
(2)  Commercial Uses . Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, a flood development permit for such facilities to be used by the employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be inundated to a depth and velocity such that when multiplying the depth (in feet) times velocity (in feet per second) the product number exceeds four upon occurrence of the regional flood. 
(3)  Manufacturing and Industrial Uses . Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations subject to requirements set out in paragraph (2) above. In considering flood development permit applications, due consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose business requires that it be located in flood plain areas. 
(4)  Fill . Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation-FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested. 
(5)  Flood Plain Developments . Flood plain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining flood plain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been specified on the official zoning map. 
(6)  Recreational Vehicles . Standards for recreational vehicles are contained in Section 4.1.9, Manufactured Homes and Manufactured Home Parks and Placement of Recreational Vehicles. 
(7)  Manufactured Homes . All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
4.1.6  Development Standards for the General Flood Plain Subdistrict . 
(A)  Permitted Uses . Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s). 
(1)  The uses listed in Section 4.1.4(A), Permitted Uses shall be permitted uses. 
(2)  All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria pursuant to Section 4.1.6(B) below. Section 4.1.4, Development Standards for the Floodway Subdistrict (FW), shall apply if the proposed use is in the floodway subdistrict and Section 4.1.5, Development Standards for the Flood Fringe Subdistrict (FF), shall apply if the proposed use is in the flood fringe subdistrict. 
(B)  Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations within the General Flood Plain District 
(1)  Upon receipt of an application for a flood development permit or other approval within the general flood plain subdistrict, the applicant shall be required to furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the city planner for the determination of the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use is within the floodway or flood fringe subdistrict: 
(a)  A typical valley cross-section(s) showing the channel of the stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water information. 
(b)  Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the ground, pertinent structure, fill, or storage elevations, the size, location, and spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site, and the location and elevations of streets. 
(c)  Photographs showing existing land uses, vegetation upstream and downstream, and soil types. 
(d)  Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed development. 
(e)  A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) from FEMA and a flood plain map that result in FEMA approval. 
(2)  The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the floodway or flood fringe subdistrict and to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation. Procedures consistent with Minnesota Regulations 1983, Parts 6120.5000-6120.6200 and 44 Code of Federal Regulations Part 65 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation methodology with the respective Department of Natural Resources' area hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert shall: 
(a)  Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood. 
(b)  Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas. 
(c)  Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than 0.5 foot. A lesser stage increase than 0.5 foot shall be required if, as a result of the additional stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 
(3)  The city planner shall present the technical evaluation and findings of the designated engineer or expert to the council, who must formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended floodway and/or flood fringe subdistrict boundary or deny the flood development permit application. The city council, prior to official action, may submit the application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) or the planning commission for review and comment. Once the floodway and flood fringe subdistrict boundaries have been determined, the city council shall refer the matter back to the city planner who shall process the flood development permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of Section 4.1.4, Development Standards for the Floodway Subdistrict (FW) and Section 4.1.5, Development Standards for the Flood Fringe Subdistrict (FF) of this LDC.

(2)  The city council reserves the rights to, in its sole discretion, elect to install all or any part of the basic improvements required under the provisions of this section and assess the costs to the benefiting property owners pursuant to Minn. Stat., ch. 429, as may be amended. 
(3)  Unless separate written approval has been given by the city as provided for in Section 8.5.12(B)(3)(a), within the plat or land to be platted, the subdivider may not grade or otherwise disturb the earth, remove trees, construct sewer lines, water lines, streets, utilities, public or private improvements, or any buildings within the plat or land to be platted until all the following conditions have been satisfied: 
(a)  The development agreement has been fully executed by both parties and filed with the city clerk; 
(b)  The necessary security has been received by the city; 
(c)  The plat has been filed with the county recorder's office; 
(d)  The construction plans have been approved and signed by the city engineer; and 
(e)  The city has issued a letter that all conditions have been satisfied and that the subdivider may proceed. 
(4)  The improvements shall be installed in accordance with this LDC, city standard specifications for utilities and street construction, and the city's engineering standard specifications. The subdivider shall submit plans and specifications that have been prepared by a competent registered professional engineer to the city for approval by the city engineer. The city shall, at the subdivider's expense, provide all on-site inspection and soil testing to certify that the construction work meets the city's standards and approved plans. 
(5)  All labor and work shall be done and performed in the best and most workmanlike manner and in strict conformance with the approved plans and specifications. No deviations from the approved plans and specifications will be permitted unless approved in writing by the city engineer. The subdivider shall not do any work or furnish any materials not covered by the plans and specifications and special conditions of this development agreement, for which reimbursement is expected from the city, unless such work is first ordered in writing by the city engineer as provided in the specifications. 
(D)  Time of Performance . 
(1)  The subdivider shall complete all required basic improvements no later than one year following the commencement of work on the improvements, except: 
(a)  Where weather precludes completion; 
(b)  For street lighting; 
(c)  For landscaping; and 
(d)  For the wearing course of streets. 
(2)  Where weather precludes completion, the timeline for completion of the improvements may be extended an additional six months. 
(3)  The subdivider shall complete street lighting within two years following the initial commencement of work on the required basic improvements. 
(4)  The subdivider shall complete landscaping by the development phase within 90 days following the issuance of a building permit for the last vacant lot within a phase unless weather precludes completion, in which case the landscaping shall be completed at the outset of the next growing season. 
(5)  Neither curb and gutter nor bituminous pavement shall be installed between November 15, and April 15. The final wear course on streets shall be installed between May 15 and October 1 the first summer after the base layer of asphalt has been in place one freeze thaw cycle. Any deficiencies in the base asphalt, curb or other improvements must be repaired by the subdivider at its own cost prior to final paving. The subdivider may, however, request an extension of time from the city. If an extension is granted, it shall be conditioned upon updating the security posted by the subdivider to reflect cost increases and the extended completion date. Final wear course placement outside of this time frame must have the written approval of the city engineer. 
(E)  Financial Guarantees . 
(1)  Subsequent to execution of the development agreement but prior to approval of a signed final plat for recording, the subdivider shall provide the city with a financial guarantee in the form of a letter of credit from a bank, cash escrow, or other form of security acceptable to the city. A letter of credit or cash escrow shall be in an amount as determined by the city engineer. 
(2)  It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to insure that a submitted financial guarantee shall continue in full force and effect until the city engineer has approved and the city council has accepted all of the required improvements. The city engineer thereby is authorized to release the guarantee or reduce the amount of the guarantee as provided in Section 5.1.4(G), Approval and Acceptance of Basic Improvements. 
(3)  When any instrument submitted as a financial guarantee contains provision for an expiration date, after which the instrument may not be drawn upon, notwithstanding the status of the development agreement or of the required improvements, the expiration date shall be December 31 or the closest business day in the case of weekends and legal holidays. Further, the financial guarantee shall be deemed automatically extended without change for six months from the expiration date unless 60 days prior to the expiration date the financial institution notifies the city in writing by certified mail that it does not elect to renew the financial guarantee for an additional period. If the instrument is not to be renewed and has not been released by the city engineer, another acceptable financial guarantee in the appropriate amount shall be submitted at least 60 days prior to the expiration. The term of any extension shall be approved by the city engineer and subject to the requirements of this section. Upon receipt of an acceptable substitute financial guarantee, the city engineer may release the original guarantee. 
(4)  Forms of Financial Guarantees . 
(a)  Letter of Credit . If the subdivider posts a letter of credit as a guarantee, the credit shall: 
(i)  Be irrevocable; 
(ii)  Be from a bank approved by the city; 
(iii)  Be in a form approved by the city; 
(iv)  Be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty periods identified in this section; and 
(v)  Require only that the city present the credit with a sight draft and an affidavit signed by the city administrator or the city administrator's designee attesting to the city's right to draw funds under the credit. 
(b)  Cash Escrow . If the subdivider posts a cash escrow as a guarantee, the escrow instructions approved by the city shall provide that: 
(i)  The subdivider will have no right to a return of any of the funds except as provided in Section 5.1.4(G), Approval and Acceptance of Basic Improvements; and 
(ii)  The escrow agent shall have a legal duty to deliver the funds to the city whenever the city administrator presents an affidavit to the agent attesting to the city's right to receive funds whether or not the subdivider protests that right. 
(c)  Cash . A cash deposit made with the city finance department may be used as part of the required financial guarantee in those instances where the subdivider elects to have the city install some or all of the public improvements. 
(5)  Amounts of Financial Guarantees . The subdivider shall submit either a financial guarantee in one of the forms listed in Section 5.1.4(E)(4), Forms of Financial Guarantees, for an amount determined by the city engineer in accordance with the following: 
(a)  Subdivider Installed Improvements . For basic improvements to be installed by the subdivider, the required financial guarantee shall include all of the following fixed or estimated costs: 
(i)  Costs of the basic improvements identified in Section 5.1.4(B)(1), Basic Improvements. 
(ii)  Engineering, to include subdivider's design, construction management, surveying, inspection, and drafting. 
(iii)  Twenty-five percent contingency or add-on to the costs in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above; and 
(iv)  Estimated cost of energy for street lights for the first two years of operation. 
(b)  City Installed Improvements . For basic improvements to be installed by the city, the required financial guarantee shall be the sum of the following fixed or estimated costs: 
(i)  A cash deposit in an amount equal to 25 percent of the estimated cost of installing the specified public improvements as determined by the city engineer, which costs would include charges incurred by the city for legal, planning, engineering and administration associated with the installation project(s). The deposit shall be applied to the costs of such installations, with the remainder of the costs specially assessed, in the manner provided by Minnesota Statutes, over a period of five years together with interest thereon. 
(ii)  In lieu of the cash deposit, the subdivider may elect to have the city provide 100 percent of the cost of such installations, which costs shall be assessed over a period of five years. In such event, the subdivider shall post a letter of credit for 60 percent of the cost of assessments, which letter of credit shall be released after the subdivider pays the principal and interest on said assessments for two years and which letter of credit shall be separate from any other letters of credit associated with the subdivider's project. 
(F)  Other Cash Requirements . The subdivider will be responsible for additional cash requirements which must be furnished to the city at the time of final plat approval. The subdivider shall not proceed with any improvements until these cash requirements have been paid to the city. The cash requirements may include: 
(1)  Park dedication fees (See Section 5.2.6, Parks, Trails, and Open Space Dedication); 
(2)  Utility charges and fees . This may include sewer availability charges (SAC), water availability charges (WAC), and trunk fees; 
(3)  Special assessments including interest; 
(4)  The city's legal, engineering administration, and construction observation fees; 
(5)  Costs associated with traffic control and street signs to be installed in the plat by the city; 
(6)  Map upgrade fee; and 
(7)  Other charges or fees as determined by the city. 
(G)  Approval and Acceptance of Basic Improvements . 
(1)  Upon receipt of proof satisfactory to the city engineer that work has been completed and financial obligations to the city have been satisfied, with city engineer approval the security may be reduced from time to time by 90 percent of the financial obligations that have been satisfied. Ten percent of the amounts certified by the subdivider's engineer shall be retained as security. Reductions in the financial guarantee shall be considered only after underground utilities are tested and found to be satisfactory and again after the base bituminous layer has been placed. 
(2)  The financial guarantee shall be held by the city until, upon written notice by the subdivider and certification from a professional engineer that all of the required improvements have been completed and upon verification of such by the city staff, a portion or the entire financial guarantee is released by the city engineer. No financial guarantee shall be released in full until the following has occurred: 
(a)  All improvements have been completed and public improvements have been accepted by the city engineer. 
(b)  Iron monuments for lot corners have been installed. 
(c)  All financial obligations to the city have been satisfied. 
(d)  Reproducible record plans of all public improvements as required by the city engineer have been furnished to the city by the subdivider. Such record plans shall be certified to be true and accurate by the registered engineer responsible for the installation of the improvements. 
(e)  A warranty/maintenance guarantee has been provided as described in Section 5.1.4(H), Warranty/Maintenance Guarantee. 
(f)  A title insurance policy approved by the city attorney indicating that the improvements are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances. 
(H)  Warranty/Maintenance Guarantee . The subdivider shall submit either a warranty/maintenance bond or a letter of credit for an amount determined by the city engineer. 
(1)  The required warranty period for materials and workmanship from the utility contractor installing public sewer and water mains shall be two years from the date of final written city acceptance of the work. 
(2)  The required warranty period for all work relating to street construction, including concrete curb and gutter, sidewalks and trails, materials and equipment shall be subject to one year from the date of final written acceptance, unless the wearing course is placed during the same construction season as the bituminous base course. In those instances, the subdivider shall guarantee all work, including street construction, concrete curb and gutter, sidewalks and trails, material and equipment for a period of two years from the date of final written city acceptance of the work. 
(3)  The required warranty period for trees and landscaping is one growing season following installation. 
(4)  The required warranty period for erosion control will be as established in the development agreement. 
(I)  Insurance . The subdivider shall take out and maintain or cause to be taken out and maintained until six months after the city has accepted the public improvements, public liability and property damage insurance covering personal injury, including death, and claims for property damage which may arise out of subdivider's work or the work of its subcontractors or by one directly or indirectly employed by any of them. Limits for the coverage shall be in accordance to the city's current requirements. The city shall be named as an additional insured on the policy, and the subdivider shall file with the city a certificate evidencing coverage prior to the city signing the plat. The certificate shall provide that the city must be given ten days advance written notice of the cancellation of the insurance. 
5.2 - Subdivision Design Standards. 
5.2.1  General Standards . 
(A)  Applicability . Each subdivision shall be designed in compliance with the standards of this section, unless an exception is granted in compliance with Section 8.5.16, Variance. 
(B)  Public Access to Public Resources . Each proposed subdivision shall be designed and constructed to provide public access to waterways, lakes, and reservoirs, if they are adjacent to the subdivision. 
(C)  Sidewalks, Pathways, and Trails . Sidewalk, pathways, trails, and other pedestrian connections shall be required in accordance with Section 3.7, Pedestrian Access and Circulation. 
(D)  Monuments . 
(1)  Official permanent monuments shall be placed as required by Minn. Stat. § 505.021 (as may be amended). 
(2)  All monument markers shall be correctly in place upon final grading and installation of utilities. 
(3)  The city will not issue building permits for a lot within a plat until monuments have been placed for that lot. 
(4)  All United States, state, county or other official bench marks, monuments or triangulation stations in or adjacent to the property shall be preserved in precise position. 
(E)  Subdivision Names . The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the city or county. The city shall have final authority to designate the name of the subdivision. 
(F)  Street Names . Street names shall be designated by the city's "Administrative Program for Assigning Roadway Names and Addresses." The city planner shall have discretion to alter the city street naming system, when appropriate, in order to avoid confusion to the traveling public. 
(G)  Debris and Waste . No cut trees, diseased trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and removal of those items and materials shall be required prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy in a subdivision. No items and materials as described in the preceding sentence shall be left or deposited in any area of the subdivision at the time of expiration of the development agreement or dedication of public improvements, whichever occurs sooner. 
(H)  Open Space and Natural Features . 
(1)  Natural features (including views, protected trees, creeks, riparian corridors, rocky outcrops, and similar features) shall be preserved and incorporated into proposed development to the greatest extent feasible. 
(2)  Development on hillsides shall generally follow the natural terrain contour. Stepped building pads, larger lot sizes, and setbacks shall be used to preserve the general shape of natural land forms and to minimize grade differentials with adjacent streets and with adjoining properties. 
(3)  Public access and visibility to creeks and the separation of residences and other uses from creeks shall be provided through the use of single-loaded frontage roads or multi-use trails. Pedestrian access to and along creeks and riparian corridors may need to be restricted to flatter areas (e.g., beyond top of bank, natural benches) where grading needs and erosion potential are minimal and where sensitive environmental resources require protection. 
(4)  Development adjacent to parks or other public open spaces shall be designed so that not more than 50 percent of the park perimeter abuts private property. The intention is to make at least half of the park perimeter open and visible to the neighborhood. 
5.2.2  Lot and Block Design . 
(A)  Lot Dimensions . 
(1)  All lot dimensions shall comply with the standards of the applicable zoning district in this LDC. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial, office or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use contemplated, as established in this LDC. (See Tables 3.2-1, 3.2-2 and 3.2-3) 
(2)  No subdivision shall be designed to leave unsubdivided islands, strips or parcels, or property unsuitable for subdividing, which is not either accepted by the city or other appropriate entity for public use, or maintained, as common area within the development. 
(B)  Lots Designed for Affordable Housing . The city encourages the development of affordable housing. In an effort to encourage the distribution of lots for affordable housing across the city, as an alternative to clustering affordable housing in a single area of the city, no more than 20 percent of any lots on a single block may include deed restrictions or other covenants that are tied to the provision of affordable housing (e.g., limiting housing costs or establishing maximum income levels)(See Table 3.2-2, Note [4]). 
(C)  Lot Arrangement . The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with this LDC. In addition, all lots shall abut and have direct access to an improved street except for developments within manufactured home parks, in which case the base lot shall abut and have direct access to an improved street. 
(D)  Street Frontage Required . Each proposed parcel shall have frontage on a public street. The frontage width shall be the lot width required by the applicable zoning district. 
(E)  Side Lot Lines . Side lines of lots shall be substantially at right angles to street lines and substantially radial to curved street lines, unless an alternative layout will result in a better street or lot plan. 
(F)  Corner Lots . 
(1)  Corner lots shall be of sufficient width and depth to comply with the minimum building setback or build-to line requirement from both streets and to comply with the minimum driveway setback from the intersection, as established in this LDC. 
(2)  See the provisions related to corner lots in Section 3.1.5(D)(2), Corner Lots. 
(G)  Double Frontage Lots . 
(1)  No parcel shall have streets abutting both the front and rear lot lines, except when necessary because of topographical or other physical conditions or where access from one of the roads is prohibited. An alley is not considered a street for the purposes of this section. 
(2)  Vehicular access onto a double frontage lot shall generally be from the street with the lowest existing and projected traffic volumes, but with each proposed building designed so that its primary façade faces the higher volume street. Authorization may be given by the city for alternative access locations where appropriate because of localized traffic conditions, and/or nearby residential areas that would be adversely affected by increased traffic. 
(3)  Corner lots shall be of sufficient width and depth to comply with the minimum building setback or build-to line requirement from both streets and to comply with the minimum driveway setback from the intersection, as established in this LDC. See the provisions related to corner lots in Section 5.2.2(F)(1). 
(4)  See the provisions related to double frontage lots in Section 3.1.5(D)(3), Double-frontage Lots. 
(H)  Panhandle Lots . 
(1)  Panhandle lots are prohibited except as may be necessary due to topography, configuration of land, existing road layouts or other special circumstances. 
(2)  Where panhandle lots are included in a subdivision, such lots shall be exempt from the maximum lot width and lot depth standards of the applicable zoning district and shall, instead, be required to have a minimum lot area of 20,000 square feet (See Section 3.2, Site Development Standards, for setback and other site development requirements related to building placement). 
(3)  The stacking of multiple panhandle lots shall be prohibited (See Figure 5-1). 

Figure 5-1: The stacking of multiple panhandle lots is prohibited. 
(I)  Access from Arterials and Collectors . 
(1)  Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from an arterial or collector roadway. No lot parallel to an arterial or collector roadway and having a width of less than 200 feet should front on these roadways unless: 
(a)  Access is limited to streets other than an arterial or collector; 
(b)  Access is provided jointly with other lots; or 
(c)  Access is ultimately to be provided from a planned frontage road. 
(2)  Where possible, driveways shall be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on arterial or collector roadways. 
(J)  Lots Abutting Water . 
(1)  If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the shoreline of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The city may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the shoreline of the water body is so placed that it will not become a city responsibility. 
(2)  Lots abutting a water body, wetland, drainage way, channel, stream or pond shall be of sufficient width and depth and at the elevation needed to assure that building sites are not subject to flooding. The platting of lots within the floodplain is subject to the FP-O district regulations in Section 2.5.1, Floodplain Overlay District (FP-O), and Section 4.1, Development Standards for the FP-O District. 
(K)  Large Tracts . When a parcel of land is subdivided into larger tracts than for building lots, such tracts shall be divided so as to plan for future lots and for the opening of major streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets and utilities. 
(L)  Blocks . 
(1)  A block shall normally be so designed as to provide two tiers of lots, unless it adjoins a railroad, arterial or collector street, lake, wetland, park, stream, or other natural feature, where it may have a single tier of lots. 
(2)  Block length and width or acreage within bounding streets shall be sufficient to accommodate the size of lots required by this LDC and to provide for convenient access, circulation control and safety of street traffic. Residential block lengths, measured between street centerlines, shall not exceed 700 feet nor be less than 300 feet, except where topography or a block design feature justifies a departure from that standard. 
(3)  Commercial and industrial block lengths shall not exceed 900 feet nor be less than 500 feet, except where topography justifies a departure from that standard. These block lengths shall not apply to areas zoned C1 district where the maximum block length shall be 330 feet or such length as to reflect the historic block pattern of the area of the city zoned C1 district. 
5.2.3  Streets . 
(A)  Purpose . Northfield views the street system as an integral element of the public realm that is designed in coordination with the Land Use Principles found in the Northfield Comprehensive Plan. A well designed street system creates a lasting image of the City. Therefore, these regulations are proposed to insure: 
(1)  A high degree of connectivity, 
(2)  Provide for a pleasant experience while moving throughout the city, 
(3)  Linkage to the various residential and commercial neighborhoods, 
(4)  An accessible multi-modal system, and 
(5)  A system with a high degree of safety and convenience for the movement of people, goods and services. 
(B)  General Requirements . 
(1)  Gated Communities Prohibited . "Gated communities" and similar residential developments (developments that contain a gate or other barrier placed across an access road, or that are designed to appear or function as walled-off areas disconnected and isolated from the rest of the community) are prohibited. 
(2)  Grid Street Network . New subdivisions shall be based on a grid or modified grid street system to the maximum extent feasible. 
(3)  Street Dedications . A street that is not constructed to city standards will not be accepted by the city for dedication as a public street. However, even a street that complies with all applicable city standards may not be accepted for dedication. Acceptance of street dedication is at the discretion of the city council. 
(4)  Topography and Arrangement . 
(a)  The arrangement, character, extent, width, and location of all streets shall be considered in relation to existing and planned streets, shall provide for reasonable traffic circulation and traffic calming, and shall be appropriately located in relation to topography, run-off of surface water, convenience and safety, and proposed uses of the land to be served. Wherever possible, the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall provide for the continuation of existing and planned streets within and outside the proposed plat. Where adjoining lands are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets shall make provision for the proper projection of streets into adjoining lands by carrying the streets to the boundaries of the plat. The arrangement of streets shall not cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in platting their own land and providing convenient access to it. 
(b)  Streets proposed within a new subdivision shall be interconnected and shall connect with adjacent streets external to the subdivision, to provide multiple routes for multi-modal circulation, emergency access, and trips from, to, and within the subdivision. Where street connections cannot occur due to topography, design constraints or some other feature beyond the control of the developer, sidewalks and/or trails shall be extended to connect with other pedestrian access improvements. 
(c)  In commercial and industrial developments, the streets and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the location of buildings, rail facilities, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and sidewalks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian traffic. 
(5)  Grading and Improvement Plan . The full width of the street right-of-way shall be graded and improved in conformance with the city's engineering standard specifications and the construction plans submitted as part of the final plat application. 
(6)  Roadway and Access Offsets . Roadways or other access points entering upon opposite sides of any given roadway shall have their centerlines located directly opposite each other as far as practical or the centerlines located shall be offset at least 150 feet for local residential streets, and at least 200 feet for all other roadways. Driveways on local streets accessing one, two, or three family residential units are exempt from this requirement. 
(7)  Access . 
(a)  Vehicle access shall be prohibited from a stub street to adjoining lots until such time as the stub street is extended into an adjoining tract, or unless a temporary turn around feature is provided. 
(b)  When a proposed plat contains or borders on the right-of-way of an existing or planned principal or minor arterial roadway, the city may require dedication and installation of a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way for adequate protection of properties and to afford a separation of local and through traffic. Such streets shall be located at a distance from the major roadway suitable for the appropriate use of any intervening land. Such distance shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach connections, future grade separations, and lot depths. 
(c)  The subdivider shall provide access to all lots via local streets. When a proposed plat contains or borders on the right-of-way of a principal arterial, vehicle access points shall be restricted in accordance with the city's comprehensive transportation plan update and the access requirements of the Minnesota Department of Transportation in the relevant counties. When a proposed plat contains or borders on the right-of-way of an arterial or collector roadway, vehicle access points shall be restricted from such roadways. If access onto an arterial or collector is the only option for access and is therefore required, such vehicle access points shall be limited from individual lots onto such streets through the use of shared driveways, consistent with the access management provisions of the city's comprehensive transportation plan update. 
(d)  Driveway access shall comply with Table 5.2-1. 
Table 5.2-1: Driveway Access Standards Driveway Dimensions Residential Nonresidential Driveway Access Width 11 to 22 feet 
(16 feet is desired) 16 feet to 32 feet 
(32 feet is desired) Minimum Corner Clearance from a Collector street 60 feet 80 feet [1] NOTE: 
[1] At the discretion of the city engineer this standard may be modified.  
(e)  Access to minor and major collector streets shall be in compliance with Table 5.2-2. 
Table 5.2-2: Access Spacing for Collector Roadways in Northfield [1] Type of Access by Land Use Type Major Collector Minor Collector Single-Family, Two-Family, and Three-Family Dwellings Private Access Not Permitted [2] As Needed [3] Minimum Corner Clearance from a Collector Street 660 Feet 300 feet Commercial, Industrial, Institutional, and Multi-Family Residential Private Access Not Permitted [2] As Needed [3] Minimum Corner Clearance from a Collector Street 660 Feet 660 feet NOTES: 
[1] These guidelines apply to city streets only. Rice and Dakota Counties and Mn/DOT have access authority for roadways under their jurisdiction. Please refer to Rice and Dakota Counties' minimum access spacing guidelines identified in their current transportation plans. 
[2] Access to Major Collectors is limited to public street access. Steps should be taken to redirect private accesses on Major Collectors to other local streets. New private access to Major Collectors is not permitted unless deemed necessary. 
[3] Private access to Minor Collectors is to be evaluated by other factors. Whenever possible, residential access should be directed to non-continuous streets rather than Minor Collector roadways. Commercial/ Industrial properties are encouraged to provide common accesses with adjacent properties when access is located on the Minor Collector system. Cross-traffic between adjacent compatible properties is to be accommodated when feasible. A minimum spacing between accesses of 660 feet in commercial, industrial, or high density residential areas is encouraged for the development of turn lanes and driver decision reaction areas.  
(8)  Signs, Traffic Signs and Lights, and Street Lights . 
(a)  Street signs of standard design approved by the city shall be installed at each street intersection or at such other locations within the subdivision as designated by the city engineer, in accordance with the Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MMUTCD). 
(b)  Traffic control signs pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 169.06 and the Comprehensive Transportation Plan Update, where applicable, shall be installed at locations within the subdivision as designated by the city engineer. 
(c)  Turn lanes and traffic lights shall be installed at the expense of the subdivider when required as a result of the proposed subdivision. 
(d)  Street lights shall be installed at all intersections and at other locations, as required by the city engineer. All street lights within new subdivisions shall be on street light poles meeting the standards of the city and shall be equipped with underground electrical service, and shall conform to city lighting standards. The developer shall pay to the city the energy cost for the first two years of operation, or until the dwellings on all lots within the subdivision have been completed, whichever time period is less. 
(9)  Sidewalks and Trails . Sidewalks and trails required by Section 3.7, Pedestrian Access and Circulation and Section 5.2.6, Parks, Trails, and Open Space Dedication, shall be installed at the time a street is constructed. 
(10)  Street Trees Required . At least one street tree shall be properly installed at the time of street construction for each 40 foot length of right-of-way. This requirement may be modified depending on the chosen tree species and its typical spread at maturity. 
(11)  Dead-End Streets, Stub Streets, and Cul-de-Sac Streets (Permanent and Temporary) . 
(a)  Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stub streets. 
(b)  Stub streets shall be installed to permit future street extensions into adjoining tracts, where appropriate. Barricades shall be installed at the end of stub streets and signage may be provided indicating a future street connection. Stub streets shall not exceed 150 feet in length. Where required by the city engineer a temporary connection to another street, or a temporary turnaround, shall be provided by the subdivider. 
(c)  Permanent cul-de-sac streets are prohibited except as may be installed where absolutely necessary due to topography, configuration of land, existing road layouts or other special circumstances. The closed end of the cul-de-sac shall have a pavement width of 80 feet in diameter and the overall length of the road shall not exceed 600 feet in length as measured from the centerline of the nearest intersection to the closed end of the cul-de-sac. 
(d)  In those instances where a street is terminated pending future extension in conjunction with future platting and its terminus is located 150 feet or more from the nearest intersection, a temporary cul-de-sac with a pavement width of 70 feet in diameter shall be provided at the closed end. Any portion of a temporary cul-de-sac not located within the street right-of-way shall be placed in a temporary roadway easement extending at least ten feet beyond the curb line of the temporary cul-de-sac in all directions. No building permit shall be issued for any properties containing or adjacent to a temporary cul-de-sac or roadway easement. 
(12)  Alleys and Private Streets . 
(a)  Alleys may be established in the city under the following conditions: 
(i)  The alleys are publicly owned and maintained; 
(ii)  The alleys shall be made of concrete, asphalt, pervious pavers, or other similar non-graveled surfaces; 
(iii)  No home shall be oriented to face the alley; and 
(iv)  Alleys are permitted as a secondary access when the lots front on an arterial or collector street as identified in Table 5.2-3. 
(b)  Private streets are prohibited except in the R4 district. 
(C)  Street Design Standards . 
(1)  In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width, and general improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation and road maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, all streets shall be subject to the standards of this section. 
(2)  Street types shall be regulated by Table 5.2-3 and the design standards established in the Northfield comprehensive transportation plan update as shown in Appendix A. 
(3)  Street Surfacing and Improvements . After the subdivider has installed sewer and water, the subdivider shall construct poured-in-place concrete sidewalks, curbs and gutters and shall surface streets to the width prescribed in this section. Curbs and gutters shall only be installed to the degree where necessary to accommodate the street design standard. The designer is encouraged to include techniques that will direct surface water drainage to off-street areas. Types of pavement shall be as prescribed in the city's engineering standard specifications. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, drains and bridges. The portion of the right-of-way outside the area surfaced shall be sodded or planted with other acceptable materials as approved by the city engineer. All road pavement, shoulders, drainage improvements and structures, curbs, turnarounds and sidewalks shall conform to all construction standards and specifications in the city's engineering standard specifications and shall be incorporated into the construction plans required to be submitted by the subdivider for final plat approval. 
(4)  Grading . 
(a)  Streets shall be graded with at least 0.5 percent slope from the centerline to the curb to maintain drainage. 
(b)  Arterial and collector streets shall have a maximum running grade of five percent. 
(c)  All other streets shall have a maximum running slope of seven percent, or as determined by the city engineer. 
(5)  Street Intersection, Tangent, Deflection and Other Design Standards . 
(a)  Street Intersections shall intersect at right angles and in no instance shall the angle formed by the intersection be less than 60 degrees. Street intersections having more than four corners shall be prohibited and the curb line at street intersections shall have a radius not less than 15 feet. 
(b)  Street tangents of at least 150 feet shall be designed between reverse curbs on collector streets and 100 feet on all local streets. 
(c)  When connecting street lines deflect from each other at a point of more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to insure a site distance of no less than 500 feet for arterials, 300 feet for collectors, and 100 feet for local streets. 
(d)  Half streets and any corresponding right-of-way for half streets shall be prohibited. 
Table 5.2-3: Street Types and Requirements 

5.2.4  Sanitary Sewer, Water, and Other Utilities . 
(A)  The subdivider shall install adequate sanitary sewer and water facilities (including fire hydrants) subject to the specifications in the city's engineering standard specifications, and the Recommended Standards for Water Works and the Recommended Standards for Wastewater Facilities (known collectively as the "ten-state standards"). 
(B)  The subdivider shall install sanitary sewer, water mains and service connections, stubbed to the lot line, meeting the minimum size requirements of the city and provided to all lots in the subdivision. Where a subdivider is required to install sanitary sewer or water mains that are larger than the minimum size as required by the city, the subdivider will be compensated by the city for the cost differential for material only for the cost of the minimum size sanitary sewer or water compared to the cost of the larger mains installed. 
(C)  The subdivider shall extend sewer and water mains to the lot lines of abutting sites that do not have public water service. 
(D)  All utility facilities, including but not limited to telecommunications cabling, natural gas and electric power, shall be located underground. Whenever existing utility facilities are located above ground, except when existing on public roads and right-of-way, they shall be removed and placed underground. 
(E)  Five foot utility easements shall be required along the front lot line of each lot, measured from the lot lines. Such easements shall have continuity for alignment from block to block. Such easements shall also be provided at deflection points for pole-line anchors where necessary. 
(F)  Easements shall be dedicated on the plat instrument for the required use. 
5.2.5  Surface Water, Drainage, Water Quality, and Erosion Control . 
(A)  Purpose . These regulations are intended to result in the effective management of surface water run-off by ensuring compliance with the adopted Surface Water Management Plan of the City of Northfield and also the requirements found in Chapter 22, Article VI of the Northfield Municipal Code. The City of Northfield supports a regional approach to surface water management or any similar innovative approach to managing surface water that protects and improves surface water quality, promotes ground water recharge, enhances wildlife through proper management of surface water, and minimizes public expenditures needed to protect water quality problems. 
(B)  Subdivider Responsibilities . The subdivider is responsible for compliance with the overall objectives and expectations as stated in the Surface Water Management Plan and shall install needed improvements or pay to the City fees and or charges that have been established to ensure compliance with surface water management requirements as established by the City. If the city's surface water management plan designates a regional pond within the boundaries of the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall provide the city with drainage and utility easements for the regional pond. The subdivider shall construct the pond in conjunction with development of the subdivision. 
(C)  Nature of Surface Water Facilities . 
(1)  Location . The city may require the subdivider to carry away by pipe any spring or surface water that may exist either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width and shall be constructed in accordance the city's engineering standard specifications. 
(2)  Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas . A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area in accordance with the city's surface water management standards in Chapter 22, Article VI - Surface Water Management. 
(3)  Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas . The city's surface water management plan, together with such other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a standard to needed improvements in downstream drainage facilities outside the subdivision. 
(a)  The subdivider shall mitigate increased runoff due to development in accordance with the city's surface water management plan. 
(b)  Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff attributable to the development of the subdivision will overload any existing downstream drainage facility, the city may withhold approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for the expansion of the existing downstream drainage facility. 
(4)  Floodplain Areas . The city may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety or welfare of the present or future population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage and sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any portion of a property that lies within the floodplain of any stream or drainage course in accordance with the provisions of this LDC. 
(D)  Dedication of Drainage Easements . 
(1)  Where a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream traverses a subdivision, the subdivider shall provide a surface water easement, or park dedication, whichever the city may deem more appropriate. This easement or dedication shall conform substantially with the lines of such water courses, together with such further width for construction and maintenance, or both, as will be adequate for the surface water drainage of the area. The city engineer shall determine the width of such easements or dedication areas. 
(2)  Drainage Easements . 
(a)  Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, the subdivider shall provide perpetual, unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width for drainage facilities across property outside the road lines and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat. Drainage easements shall extend from the road to a natural watercourse or to other drainage facilities. 
(b)  When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the plat. 
(c)  The subdivider shall dedicate by a drainage easement, land on each side of the centerline of any wetland, body of water, watercourse or drainage channel, whether or not shown on the city's comprehensive plan, to a sufficient width to: 
(i)  Provide proper protection for water quality; 
(ii)  Provide retention of surface water runoff; and 
(iii)  Provide for the installation and maintenance of storm sewers. 
5.2.6  Parks, Trails, and Open Space Dedication . 
(A)  Purpose, Nexus, and Proportionality 
(1)  Purpose . These requirements are established for the purpose of assisting with the implementation of the Parks, Open Space and Trail System Plan of the City of Northfield by providing for the orderly development of recreation areas and the conservation of natural resources and scenic beauty in the city. The Parks, Open Space and Trail System Plan promotes a balanced and systematic approach to acquiring park and open space resources that include active park facilities, an interconnected trail system, areas of natural and ecological significance emphasizing the Cannon River corridor that is available to residents of the city and the broader region. As a means to accomplish these goals, each developer shall be required to dedicate land, or at the discretion of the city, pay an equivalent cash payment in lieu of land dedication for parks and open space acquisition and development. The policy of the city is to acquire and manage larger parcels of park and open space land resources; therefore, as a result of this policy, it is likely that a cash payment in lieu of land dedication will be the method by which this requirement will be accomplished in most instances, although not to the complete exclusion of a land dedication requirement. 
(2)  Nexus . The city council finds that there is a rational nexus between the demands created by the subdivision and related development of land and the need for parks, trails, open space areas, public art, and facilities. 
(3)  Proportionality . Further, the city council herein establishes requirements for the dedication and/or development of park land, trail improvements, and open space land that is roughly proportionate to the demands created by the subdivision and development of land resulting from such subdivision approval. 
(B)  Authority . It is found and declared that, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 462.358, subd. 2b, it is reasonable to require dedication of an amount of land equal in value to that percentage of the undeveloped land set forth in Section 5.2.6(D), Land Dedication Required. 
(C)  Waiver of Requirements . Upon a request by the developer, the city council, may waive or reduce the requirements of this section for development in the C1 (Downtown), ED-F (Economic Development) or N2 (Neighborhood General) districts where the city council finds: 
(1)  That the vitality resulting from development or redevelopment occurring in areas zoned C1 district is of greater benefit to the city in comparison to parks, trail and open space improvements; 
(2)  That development in areas zoned ED-F district which results in significant increases in tax revenues to the city or significantly increases employment opportunities is of greater benefit to the city in comparison to parks, trail, or open space improvements; 
(3)  That development in areas zoned N2 district which allows for the construction of affordable housing units of a type, price, or amount that is determined to be of greater benefit to the city in comparison to parks, trail, or open space improvements; or 
(4)  That city-assisted development or redevelopment projects achieve public objectives. 
(D)  Land Dedication Required . 
(1)  In every plat, replat, or subdivision of land allowing development for residential, commercial, industrial, or other uses or any combination thereof, or where a waiver of platting is granted, but excluding adjacent parcel land conveyances (See Section 8.5.10, Adjacent Parcel Land Conveyance) that do not create additional lots, a reasonable portion of such land shall be set aside and dedicated by the applicant to the public for park, trail, or open space purposes. 
(2)  The park and recreation advisory board may recommend to the city council that the applicant may be required to dedicate other parcels of property that are separate and distinct from the property proposed for subdivision that are owned or acquired by the applicant that more effectively accomplish the goals of systematically developing park and open space resources as outlined in the Parks, Open Space and Trail System Plan. Where the applicant is not able to dedicate or acquire such alternate property, the applicant shall be required to make cash payment in lieu of land dedication as set forth in Section 5.2.6(K), Dedication or Cash-in-Lieu of Requirements, of this LDC. 
(3)  Pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 462.358, subd. 2b, it is reasonable to require a portion of buildable land to be dedicated to the public for parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands or open space purposes. The land to be used for the purposes previously stated shall be determined to be suitable at the sole discretion of the city and the city shall not be required to accept land that is not usable for the stated purposes. 
(4)  The land required to be dedicated by the applicant for parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, public art, trails, wetlands or open space is a recreational and open space resource available for the benefit of the public. The amount and type of park and open space resource dedicated is intended to be proportionate to the users of the park and open space resource that result from the subdivision of the land. 
(5)  The amount of land required to be dedicated by the applicant for stated purposes in (1) above shall be based upon the net area (gross area minus area required for public streets, trails, and stormwater ponding) of the land to be subdivided which could be developed for residential, commercial, industrial or other purposes. The area shall be determined at the time of the preliminary plat and shall be calculated as follows: 
(a)  Residential Development . 
Dwelling Units per Net Acre Percent of Net Land Dedicated 0 to 3.9 12 4.0 to 7.9 9 8.0 or more 6  
(b)  Commercial Development . Five percent of the gross area subdivided. 
(c)  Industrial Development . Two percent of the gross area for the purpose of trails only. 
(6)  This dedication shall be in addition to the land dedicated for streets, alleys, stormwater ponds or other public purposes. 
(7)  Such dedication shall be in an amount based on the schedule of dedication requirements adopted by city council and maintained outside of this LDC. 
(E)  Land Suitability Requirement . 
(1)  Land dedicated for parks, trails, and open space shall be reasonably suitable as advised by the parks and recreation advisory board for its intended use and shall be at a location convenient to the people to be served. 
(2)  Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of a proposed park, trail, or open space dedication shall include: 
(a)  Future park needs pursuant to the Parks, Open Space, and Trail System Plan; 
(b)  Size (that is consistent with the city's policy of wanting more large parks and fewer small parks); 
(c)  Shape; 
(d)  Topography; 
(e)  Geology; 
(f)  Hydrology; 
(g)  Tree Cover; and 
(h)  Access and location. 
(3)  Parks, trails, or open space land to be dedicated shall be above the ordinary high water mark of any lake, river or stream. 
(4)  Areas of slope exceeding 12 percent shall be deemed unsuitable for dedication and not included as part of areas to meet the dedication requirements. 
(5)  Land with trash, junk, pollutants, and/or unwanted structures are not suitable. 
(6)  The city shall not be required to accept land which will not be useable for parks, trails or open space or which would require extensive expenditures on the part of the city. 
(7)  All land dedicated for parks, trails, and/or open space shall be designed to incorporate natural features such as rivers, streams, wildlife habitats, woodlands, and ponding areas. 
(F)  Conformance with the Comprehensive Plan . Land dedicated under this division shall conform to the city's comprehensive plan and Parks, Open Space, and Trail System Plan, wherever possible. If the comprehensive plan or Parks, Open Space and Trail System Plan for the parcel of land to be subdivided calls for public property in excess of that required by Section 5.2.6(D), Land Dedication Required, the city council shall, before approval or disapproval of the plat, determine whether to take the necessary steps to acquire, by purchase or condemnation, all or part of the additional public property. 
(G)  Dedication of Excess Land . If the city requires parks, trails or open space dedication in excess of the amount of land required by Section 5.2.6(D), Land Dedication Required, the city shall pay to the developer the fair market value of the land in excess of the percentage of land required to be dedicated. The excess amount that would otherwise be dedicated for parks, trail and open space under this section shall be due at the time of final plat approval. 
(H)  Dedication Process . Prior to the dedication of the required property pursuant to this division, the developer shall provide the city evidence of title in a form acceptable to the city attorney or a title insurance policy insuring the city's interest in the property. In any dedication of required land, the developer must have good and marketable title to the land, free and clear of any mortgages, liens, encumbrances or assessments, except easements or minor imperfections of title acceptable to the city. 
(I)  Trail Construction . When the city's comprehensive plan or Parks, Open Space, and Trail System Plan identifies a trail to be constructed in the land to be subdivided, this trail segment shall be interpreted by the city as basic infrastructure and, therefore, the developer shall be required to pay for the construction of the trail improvements. This trail construction requirement shall be in addition to the required land dedication as set forth in Section 5.2.6(D), Land Dedication Required, or set forth in Section 5.2.6(K) Dedication or Cash Payment in Lieu of Requirements. The construction specifications of trails shall be determined by the city engineer and whenever possible, trails shall connect with existing trails and/or sidewalks. 
(J)  Credit for Private Open Space, Recreational Areas and Trails . Where a private open space for park, recreation or trail purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, a credit of up to 25 percent of the requirements of Section 5.2.6(D), Land Dedication Required, may be given, provided that the following conditions are met: 
(1)  Such land area is not occupied by non-recreational buildings and is available for the use of all residents of the proposed subdivision. 
(2)  Required setbacks shall not be included in the computation of such private open space. 
(3)  The use of the private open space is restricted for park, recreational and trail purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of the future owners of the property within the tract and which cannot be eliminated without the consent of the city. 
(4)  Credit for private trail improvements shall be given by the city only when the private trail system connects to a public trail or walkway system. 
(5)  The proposed private open space is of an appropriate size, shape, location, topography and usability for park, recreational and trail purposes or contains unique natural features that are important to be preserved. 
(6)  The proposed private open space reduces the demand for public recreational facilities to serve the development. 
(K)  Dedication or Cash-in-Lieu of Requirements . The city may elect to accept a cash payment in lieu of land dedication for parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails, wetlands or open space purposes. In such cases the applicant shall be required to make such payment to the city's dedicated park fund based on the Estimated Market Value as indicated in the records of the County Assessor that is equivalent to a land dedication requirement as follows: 
(1)  Residential Development . 
Dwelling Units per Net Acre Percent of Land Dedication Equivalent 0 to 3.9 16 4.0 to 7.9 13 8.0 or more 10  
(2)  Commercial Development . Five percent of the gross area subdivided. 
(3)  Industrial Development . Two percent of the gross area subdivided. 
(L)  Time of Performance - Land Dedication or Cash Payment In Lieu Of . The dedication of land or the payment of cash in lieu of land dedication by the applicant shall occur as a condition prior the city council approval of the final plat. 
(M)  Park Tree Requirements . The subdivider or developer shall preserve existing trees on any land to be dedicated under this section in accordance with Section 3.5.6, Tree and Woodland Preservation. 
(N)  Other Conditions Prior to Deeding . Prior to dedicating land for parks, trails, or open space, the land shall meet the following conditions: 
(1)  Grading in the parks shall conform to the grading plan as approved by the city engineer. 
(2)  Rocks that are four inches or greater in diameter shall have been removed from the land. If possible, any boulders or glacial erratic should remain and be incorporated for landscaping interest in parks and open spaces. 
(3)  A minimum of four inches of topsoil shall have been provided by the developer dependent on subsoil material as determined by the city engineer. 
(4)  The surface should be planted with low maintenance vegetation to ensure the immediate stabilization of the exposed soils. The park and recreation advisory board should be consulted to determine which areas should become turf and which should be planted with non-turf vegetation. Areas of turf shall be seeded in the amount of 50-75 percent Kentucky bluegrass and 25-50 percent perennial ryegrass, or other quick establishing crop to prevent soil erosion. 
(O)  Infrastructure . The applicant may bring utilities a reasonable distance inside the property line of the future park, as determined by the city engineer, and shall cap them at no cost to the city. Utilities shall include gas, storm sewer, water, electricity and sanitary sewer. The location where such utilities are to be brought into the future park shall be determined by the city engineer. 
(P)  Access . All land dedicated for parks shall have at least 50 feet of street frontage on at least one side. All trails shall have at least 20 feet of access where the trail connects to a street or sidewalk. 
Article 6. - SIGNAGE 

6.1 - Purpose and Intent. 
    Regulating the location, size, placement, and physical characteristics of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities and to receive a wide variety of other messages, commercial and noncommercial, without difficulty and confusion, to encourage the general attractiveness of the community, to enhance public safety, and to protect property values. Accordingly, this section establishes regulations governing the display of signs that will: 
(A)  Promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, morals, and convenience; 
(B)  Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly, and effective display of signs and, thereby, encourage increased communication with the public; 
(C)  Restrict signs and lights that will increase the probability of traffic congestion and accidents by distracting attention or obstructing vision; 
(D)  Reduce conflict among signs and light and between public and private information systems; and 
(E)  Promote signs that are compatible with their surroundings. 
6.2 - Scope. 
(A)  This section shall regulate the height, area, location, graphics, color, materials, content and other visual aspects of signs and sign structures. It does not regulate public informational and safety signs, or signs required by law. 
(B)  The owner of any sign which is allowed by this sign ordinance may substitute non-commercial copy in lieu of any other commercial or non-commercial copy. This substitution of copy may be made without any additional approval or permitting. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial speech, or favoring of any particular non-commercial message over any other non-commercial message. This section prevails over any more specific section to the contrary. 
6.3 - Zoning Certificate and Compliance Required. 
(A)  Unless otherwise provided by this section, all signs shall require a zoning certificate and a payment of fees. Exceptions to the certificate requirement are as follows: 
(1)  If any sign is removed and replaced on the same supports, provided the size or type of sign is not changed. 
(2)  No zoning certificate is required for the maintenance of a sign or for a change of copy on changeable copy signs. 
(3)  Signs identified in Section 6.5, Exemptions. 
(4)  General maintenance, painting, repainting, cleaning and other normal maintenance and repair of a sign or any sign structure unless a structural change or copy change, on a non-changeable copy sign, is made that results in anything more than a minor modification. 
(B)  The relocation of a sign from one area of a lot to another location on the same lot shall require a zoning certificate (See Section 8.5.1, Zoning Certificate). 
(C)  The alteration or enlargement of any sign shall require a zoning certificate. 
(D)  All wiring, fittings, and materials used in the construction, connection and operation of electrically illuminated signs shall be in accordance with the provisions of the State Electrical Code in effect. 
(E)  No sign of any classification shall be installed, erected, or attached to a structure in any form, shape, or manner that is in violation of Northfield's or the state's building or fire codes. 
6.4 - Computations. 
    The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height: 
(A)  The area of a sign face, which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face, shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that shall encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display. This does not include any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets the regulations of this LDC and is clearly incidental to the display itself (See Figure 6-1). 
(B)  The sign area for a sign with more than one face (multi-faced signs) shall be computed by adding together the sign area of all sign faces. Even in cases where two identical sign faces are placed back-to-back, the sign area shall be computed by adding together the sign area of each sign face. 
(C)  The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. 
(D)  Unless otherwise specifically stated, when a calculation is based on street frontage, the longest single street frontage shall be used and not the total of all street frontages. 

Figure 6-1: Illustration of how sign area is calculated. 
6.5 - Exemptions. 
    The following types of signs are exempted from all the requirements of this section, except for construction and safety regulations and the requirements set forth:

(A)  Neon lights are permitted for messages and symbols, but shall not flash. 
(B)  Signs on multiple-use buildings must be coordinated in the use of colors, materials, and shapes. 
(C)  Landscaping Area Required . 
(1)  Ground and pylon signs shall have plantings at and around the base that serve to: 
(a)  Screen the sign base and/or any lighting installed at ground level; and 
(b)  Tie such signage to the principal use by using plantings that are similar to those used on the rest of the site. 
(2)  Such plantings shall be of the type and size specified in Section 3.5.4, General Landscaping Material Standards. 
(3)  A landscape plan indicating the location and type of plantings to be used in screening the base of the sign must be submitted prior to the issuance of a sign permit by the city. 
(4)  A certified check or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the city and in a form satisfactory to the city in the amount of 110 percent of the cost of the proposed plantings, as determined by a certified landscape professional, shall be held in escrow by the city until the plantings as indicated on the landscape plan approved in conjunction with the sign permit request are complete as determined by the city planner. 
(5)  If the cost of plantings is not determined by a certified landscape professional, the city planner shall determine the appropriate amount. The escrow or letter of credit shall be released to the applicant when all landscaping approved in conjunction with the sign permit application is installed to the satisfaction of the city planner. 
(6)  If required plantings are not installed by the applicant within one year of issuance of a sign permit, the city shall have the right to install such plantings and to use the escrowed funds or to draw on the letter of credit to pay for such installation of plantings. 
(D)  Changeable-Copy Signs . 
(1)  Generally . 
(a)  All changeable-copy signs shall be subordinate to the main signage permitted on the property.

(2)  Procedures for EAWs and EISs are set forth in the Minnesota Environmental Quality Review Board (EQB) regulations for the Environmental Review Program authorized by Minn. Stat. § 116D.04 and 116D.04S and specified in Minn. Rules Parts 4410.0200 to 4410.7800. 
(3)  Environmental reviews (EAWs and EISs) shall be conducted as early as practical in the processing of a development project. Time delays in the normal permit process caused by the filing and review of the EAW or EIS shall not be considered part of the development review approval time requirements set forth in this LDC and in Minn. Stat. § 15.99. Such delays shall be considered as additional required time for each required development review approval. The development review approval process for the proposed project may be continued from the point it was interrupted by the EAW/EIS process. No decision on granting a zoning certificate or other approval required to commence the project may be issued until the EAW/EIS process is completed. 
(C)  Environmental Assessment Worksheet (EAW) . 
(1)  Purpose . The purpose of an EAW is to rapidly assess, in a worksheet format, whether or not a proposed action has the potential for significant environmental effects. 
(2)  Mandatory EAW . The preparation of an EAW shall be mandatory for those projects that meet or exceed the thresholds contained in the state Environmental Review Program regulations, Minn. Rules 4410.4300, as may be amended. 
(3)  Discretionary EAW . A discretionary EAW may be required when it is determined that, because of the nature or location of a proposed project, the project may have the potential for significant environmental effects. The city council may require the preparation of a discretionary EAW if it is determined that a development project may have some significant environmental impact or when there is a perception of such, provided that the project is not specifically exempted by Minn. Rules 4410.4600, as may be amended. 
(4)  Procedures . EAW's shall be subject to the Type 4 review procedure as established in Section 8.4.7, Type 4 Review Procedure (Planning Commission or Heritage Preservation Commission Recommendation and City Council Decision). 
(a)  Preparation and Distribution . 
(i)  If it is determined that an EAW shall be prepared, the proposer of the project shall submit an application along with the completed data portions of the EAW. The applicant shall agree in writing, as a part of the application, to reimburse the city for all reasonable costs, including legal and consultants' fees, incurred in preparation and review of the EAW. 
(ii)  Pursuant to Minn. Rules 4410.1400, the city planner, along with other city staff as necessary at a development review committee meeting, shall promptly review the submittal for completeness and accuracy.

If the city planner determines that the submittal is complete, the proposer shall be notified of the acceptance of the submittal. 
(iii)  The city planner shall distribute copies of the EAW to the EQB for publication of the notice of availability of the EAW in the EQB Monitor. Copies shall be distributed at the same time to the official EAW distribution list maintained by the EQB staff, and the Northfield environmental quality commission. The city planner shall provide a press release to the city's official newspaper, containing notice of availability of the EAW for public review. 
(b)  Neighboring Property Owner Notification . Upon completion of the EAW for distribution, the city planner shall provide mailed notice of the availability of the EAW and the information about the planning commission meeting as to where it will be heard to all property owners within at least 350 feet of the boundaries of the property that is the subject of the EAW. Said notice shall be mailed according to the requirements of this section and Section 8.3.8, Public Notice. 
(c)  Review by Planning Commission . During the 30-day comment period that follows publication of the notice of availability of the EAW in the EQB Monitor, the planning commission shall review the EAW. The planning commission shall make a recommendation to the city council regarding potential environmental impacts that may warrant further investigation before the project is commenced and the need for an EIS on the proposed project. 
(d)  Decision by the City Council . The city council shall make its decision on the need for an EIS for the proposed project after the close of the comment period. The city council shall base its decision on the need for an EIS and the proposed scope of an EIS on the information gathered during the EAW process and on the comments received on the EAW, and in deciding whether a project has the potential for significant environmental effects, shall consider the factors listed in Minn. Rules 4410.1700, subd. 7, as the same may be amended. (e) After the city council's decision on the need for an EIS, notice shall be provided to all persons on the EAW distribution list, to all persons who commented in writing during the 30 day comment period, to the EQB staff for publication of the decision in the EQB Monitor and to any person upon written request. 
(5)  Mitigation Measures . Any measures for mitigating that are considered by the city council in making their EIS need decision may be incorporated as conditions for approval of any development review application. 
(D)  Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) . 
(1)  Purpose . The purpose of an EIS is to provide information for governmental units, the proposer of the project and other persons to evaluate proposed projects which have the potential for significant environmental effects, to consider alternatives to the proposed projects and to explore methods for reducing adverse environmental effects. 
(2)  Mandatory EIS . An EIS shall be prepared for any project that meets or exceeds the thresholds of any of the EIS categories listed in Minn. Rules 4410.4400, as may be amended. 
(3)  Discretionary EIS . An EIS shall be prepared when the city council determines that, based on the EAW and any comments or additional information received during the EAW comment period, the proposed project has the potential for significant environmental effects, or when the city council and/or the proposer of the project agree that an EIS should be prepared. 
(4)  Procedures . All projects requiring an EIS must have an EAW on file with the city, which will be used to determine the scope of the EIS. All EISs shall be prepared according to the procedures and requirements of the state Environmental Review Program, Rules 4410.2100-4410.3000, as may be amended. The costs of preparation of an EIS shall be assessed to the project proposer in accordance with Minn. Rules Parts 4410.6000 to 4100.6500, as may be amended. 
(5)  Mitigation Measures . Any measures for mitigating that are considered by the city council in making their EIS need decision may be incorporated as conditions for approval of any development review application.

Sec. 62-33. - Requirements for dumpsters temporarily placed on private property or public streets. 
(a)  Private property. A dumpster or similar waste receptacle may be placed on private property on the condition that it is placed in a location and used in a manner that is in compliance with this section, all other provisions of the city ordinances and the Minnesota State Statutes. It is a misdemeanor for a dumpster or similar waste receptacle to be placed in a location or used in a manner that constitutes a public health or safety hazard. 
(b)  Public streets. No dumpster or similar waste receptacle may be placed or permitted to stand on a public street. In the event of an extreme hardship, the public works director or his/her designated representative shall have the authority to grant a temporary permit allowing a dumpster or similar waste receptacle to be placed on a public street for up to 120 days. Application for a temporary hardship permit must be submitted in writing to the public works department. Any dumpster or similar waste receptacle temporarily allowed to be placed on a public street must: 
(1)  Be marked in accordance with the Minnesota Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highway, Section C., Object Marking, Subd. 3C-2, Objects in the Roadway, or other applicable state rule or regulation; and 
(2)  Be placed in a location and used in a manner that does not constitute a public health or safety hazard or interfere with snow removal. 
(c)  Violations. It shall be unlawful for any person to place or use a dumpster or similar waste receptacle in violation of the above requirements. If any such waste receptacle is placed or used in violation of the above requirements, the city may take any action at law (criminal or civil) or in equity to remedy the violation including, but not limited to, having the public works director, or his/her designated representative, give a written notice to the owner, renter or user of such waste receptacle stating that said owner, renter or user is in violation of this section. Such notice shall be served personally on the owner, renter or user. If the owner, renter or user cannot be found, then the notice may be served by posting it both upon the waste receptacle in a conspicuous place and also in a conspicuous place on the property that appears to be being served by said waste receptacle. The notice shall state the violation which exists, the requirements of the owner, renter or user of the waste receptacle under this section, and that if such requirements are not complied with, the city will move the waste receptacle to an appropriate alternative location (which may include placing the waste receptacle upon the property served by the waste receptacle) as determined by the city and charge the cost thereof against the property being served by the waste receptacle, which charge shall be a lien against the property until paid. 
(d)  Failure to comply with notice. If the requirements of the notice are not complied with within 48 hours of the posting or serving of the notice as aforesaid, the public works director, or his/her designated representative, may cause the dumpster or similar waste receptacle to be moved to an appropriate alternative location, which may include placing it upon the property served by the waste receptacle, and the public works department may send a bill for the cost thereof to the owner of the property. In no event shall the city, the public works director, or his/her designated representative be liable to the property owner for damage resulting from the movement of the waste receptacle or for damage or injury resulting from a decision not to move said waste receptacle. 
(e)  Assessment of cost. A property owner may appeal the validity and/or amount of the bill received from the city by submitting a written appeal to the city council within 30 days of the date of the bill. Appeals shall be heard at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the council, at which time any person appealing shall be heard. If no written appeal is made, or if an appeal is made and the council finds the cost, or any reduced amount which the council may order, to be reasonable, then such amount shall be billed to the property owner and shall constitute a lien against the premises until paid. If the bill is not paid within 30 days of issuance or within 30 days after an appeal and finding by the council that the costs are reasonable, whichever is later, it shall be levied as a special assessment against the premises pursuant to Minnesota Statutes ch. 429, and shall be payable in a single installment and, if not paid when due, shall be certified to the county auditor for collection with taxes.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 66-1. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose and intent of this chapter is to serve as a guide for the making of public improvements and the levying of special assessments within the city. The city shall follow the procedures and requirements of Minn. Stat. ch. 429. Specifically but not by way of limitation, the cost of any public improvement may be assessed upon property benefited thereby, whether or not the property abuts on the improvement and whether or not any part of the cost is paid from the county state-aid highway fund, the municipal state-aid street fund, or the trunk highway fund. Where this chapter may be inconsistent with the laws of the state, particularly but not limited to Minn. Stat. ch. 429, such laws shall prevail over this chapter, provided that, to the greatest extent possible, this chapter shall be interpreted and applied in a way that is in harmony with the laws of the state. Where a project includes unusual or extraordinary circumstances or conditions, the council may, in its discretion, vary from the standards of this chapter in order to accommodate such circumstances or conditions in a fair and reasonable manner. 
(Ord. No. 896, 7-6-2009) 
Sec. 66-2. - Definitions. 
    Definitions adopted in Minn. Stat. § 429.011 shall be used under this chapter and, in addition, the following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

(g)  Public improvements means all improvements authorized by Minn. Stat. § 429.021, including but not limited to public street, curb and gutter, sidewalk, storm sewer, sanitary sewer, water, street lighting and other improvements. 
(h)  Trunk utilities include the following public utilities which are intended to serve an extended area: 
(1)  Trunk sanitary sewer means a sanitary sewer pipe ten inches in diameter or greater. A sanitary sewer pipe of less than ten inches in diameter shall be considered a trunk sanitary sewer if, in order to serve an extended area, it is required to be placed at greater depth than it would be if it were meant to serve only the project area. Lift stations, force mains, and metering stations shall be considered to be part of the trunk sanitary sewer system only if they are intended to be permanent as indicated by the city's comprehensive sewer plan. 
(2)  Trunk storm sewer means storm sewer piping and/or ponding areas which serve an area outside of the tributary drainage area of which the project is part.

(Ord. No. 896, 7-6-2009) 
Sec. 66-3. - Improvement costs eligible for special assessment. 
    All costs related to public improvements are eligible for special assessment against real property in the city to the greatest extent authorized by Minn. Stat. ch. 429 and other state and local laws and regulations.

(Ord. No. 896, 7-6-2009) 
Sec. 66-4. - Service life of public improvements. 
    The city shall design public improvements to last for a definite period as stated in this section, or, if different, shall be as stated in the resolution ordering the improvement.

ARTICLE II. - PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT AND ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES 

Sec. 66-15. - Two track process. 
    Under Minn. Stat. ch. 429, there are two legal processes (tracks) related to public improvement projects, one for the initiation and approval of the project itself and one for adoption of assessments to recover all or part of the cost of the improvements, as outlined in this article. If allowed by law and if desirable in order to facilitate the prompt and economical completion of a project, the two tracks may overlap in time. 
(Ord. No. 896, 7-6-2009) 
Sec. 66-16. - Public improvement track. 
    Except as otherwise allowed by state law and approved by the city council, the general procedure for approval and construction of public improvement projects which will be paid for in whole or in part by special assessments shall be as follows. 
(1)  Initiation of project. A public improvement project may be initiated either by a petition from affected property owners or on the city council's own initiative. The council will review any petition and pass and publish a resolution determining whether the petition is legally sufficient or not. Any person directly affected by the resolution may challenge the council's determination as provided by Minn. Stat. § 429.036. If the petition is legally sufficient, the council will determine whether it wishes to proceed with study of the proposed improvement. The council is not required to do so. 
(2)  Planning commission review. The council will refer the proposed improvement to the planning commission for review under Minn. Stat. § 462.356, subd. 2, unless the council determines by a two-thirds vote of all members that the proposed improvement has no relationship to the comprehensive plan. 
(3)  Feasibility report. If the council chooses to proceed with a public improvement pursuant to a petition, or if the council has acted on its own initiative in proposing a public improvement, the council will order preparation of a feasibility report. 
(4)  Public hearing. If a public hearing is required prior to ordering the improvement, the council will order a public hearing. Notice of the public hearing will be published and mailed and the public hearing will be conducted as required by Minn. Stat. § 429.031. 
(5)  Ordering improvement and plans and specifications. A resolution ordering the improvement may be adopted at any time within six months after the date of the improvement hearing, subject to the voting requirements of Minn. Stat. § 429.031. At the same time as an improvement is ordered, the council will authorize preparation of plans and specifications for the project. 
(6)  Advertising for bids. When the council has approved the plans and specifications for the project, city staff will advertise for bids as provided by Minn. Stat. § 429.041. 
(7)  Award of contract. Staff will review bids and make a recommendation to the council for award of a contract for construction of the project. The council may reject all bids or may award a contract based on the bids received within one year of adoption of the resolution ordering the project, unless a different time is stated in the resolution ordering the project. Contracts will comply with all requirements of state public contracting law including performance and payment bond requirements. 
(8)  Performance of contract. City staff will supervise construction of the project and oversee payments to the contractor, withholding proper retainages, and will make a recommendation to the council as to final payment when all prerequisites are met. 
(Ord. No. 896, 7-6-2009) 
Sec. 66-17. - Special assessment track. 
    Except as otherwise allowed by state law and approved by the city council, the general procedure for adoption of special assessments to pay all or part of the cost of public improvement projects shall be as follows. 
(1)  Determination how cost of project will be paid. At any time after the expense incurred or to be incurred for a public improvement has been calculated, the council will determine by resolution the amount the city will pay, other than the amount the city will pay as a property owner, if any, and the amount to be assessed. 
(2)  Preparation of assessment roll. City staff will prepare the proposed assessment roll, based upon the benefits received by each parcel as a result of the project, as determined by a preliminary benefits appraisal prepared by a licensed certified general real property appraiser. 
(3)  Assessment hearing. The council will review the proposed assessment roll and order an assessment hearing. City staff will cause notice of the hearing to be published and mailed as required by Minn. Stat. § 429.061. The council will conduct the assessment hearing and hear and pass upon any objections to the proposed assessments, whether presented orally or in writing. The council may amend the assessment roll as to any parcel. The council may adjourn the hearing from time to time. 
(4)  Adoption of assessment roll. The council will adopt the assessment roll or amended assessment roll by resolution. If the amount adopted is different from the amount proposed, notice will be mailed to the affected property owner. The council will determine the interest rate on assessments, the number of years over which assessments may be paid, and any deferral of assessments which may be warranted. 
(5)  Certification of assessment roll. The council will authorize certification of the assessment roll to the county auditor for collection with real property taxes and city staff will so certify the assessment roll.

ARTICLE III. - DETERMINATION OF BENEFIT AND ASSESSMENT RATES 

Sec. 66-25. - Determination of benefit. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this chapter, special assessments shall be levied pursuant to M.S.A. Chapter 429. The cost of any improvement, or any part thereof, may be assessed upon property benefited by the improvement, based upon the benefits received, whether or not the property abuts on the improvement and whether or not any part of the cost is paid from the county state-aid highway fund, the municipal state-aid street fund, or the trunk highway fund. No assessment shall exceed the benefits to the property assessed. Unless another method is authorized by law and approved by the city council, the amount to be assessed to properties benefited by an improvement project shall be calculated by the city engineer, subject to approval by the city council, based upon assessment rates adopted by the city council after considering a preliminary benefits appraisal prepared by a licensed certified general real property appraiser. In the event that a preliminary benefits appraisal is used to calculate assessments rates for a category of assessable projects, such benefits appraisal shall be updated at least every three years. Nothing in this section shall preclude the city from commissioning a preliminary benefits appraisal for any specific individual improvement project authorized by law and calculating assessment amounts for such project based on the preliminary benefits appraisal. 
(Ord. No. 896, 7-6-2009; Ord. No. 954, § 1, 11-12-2013) 
Sec. 66-26. - Assessment of project components. 
    Unless otherwise authorized by law and approved by the city council, the city will assess or otherwise pay for the following specific types of improvements in the following manner: 
(1)  Street repairs. Street repairs including but not limited to reconstruction, reclamation, and overlays, shall be assessed to benefited properties based upon a preliminary benefits appraisal. 
(2)  Gravel streets. Upgrades to an existing gravel street shall be considered new construction and assessed to benefited properties based upon a preliminary benefits appraisal. 
(3)  Seal coats. Seal coat projects are funded by the city and not assessed. 
(4)  Frontage roads. Frontage roads along highways and other arterial streets are deemed to be of benefit to commercial and industrial properties abutting on the frontage roads. The entire cost of any improvements to such frontage roads shall be assessed to the benefited properties, to the extent supported by the city's preliminary benefits appraisal, even if there are only properties abutting one side of such frontage roads. 
(5)  Alleys. Upgrading existing gravel alleys by adding pavement and reconstructing existing paved alleys will be assessed to all lots abutting on the alley being improved based upon a preliminary benefits appraisal. 
(6)  Sidewalks. Sidewalks constructed or reconstructed as part of a street project are included in the total project cost to be assessed. New sidewalks not associated with a street project are funded by the city and not assessed. Reconstruction of existing sidewalks not associated with a street project shall be completed by the city in accordance with the city's sidewalk replacement criteria and not assessed. Property owners with sidewalk abutting their property may replace sidewalk at their own expense if they prefer an upgrade from what is allowed by the city's sidewalk replacement criteria, provided that the city shall review and approve the plans and specifications for such sidewalk replacement before any work begins thereon. 
(7)  Trails. Bituminous trails in developed areas are funded by the city and are not assessed. Bituminous trails that are part of a new development will normally be a part of the developer's project cost unless the city council agrees otherwise. 
(8)  Individual service laterals. Repair and replacement of an individual service lateral is a private improvement which is the responsibility of the property owner. When a public improvement project requires new service laterals, or new service laterals are otherwise required by ordinance, the property owner is responsible for the work and the cost thereof. However, the city may offer to have service laterals constructed or replaced in association with a public improvement project undertaken by the city, or otherwise, and to assess the cost of the service lateral work to the property served. In this event, property owners shall sign a construction easement, agreement of assessment and waiver of appeal allowing construction of the service laterals and assessment of the entire cost thereof to the property, without possibility of appeal. The agreement of assessment and waiver of appeal will recite the estimated cost of the work, but the estimated cost shall not bar assessment of additional amounts reasonably incurred by the city in completing the work. Any construction of individual service laterals by the city and the levy of assessments for them are done as a convenience to property owners and are not subject to the same statutory requirements as public improvement projects and special assessments for public improvements. 
(9)  Extensions. To the extent that an improvement benefits non-abutting properties which may be served by the improvement when one or more later extensions or improvements are made but which are not initially assessed, the city may pay such cost and reimburse itself by adding all or any portion of the cost so paid to the assessments levied for any of such later extensions or improvements, provided that notice that such additional amount will be assessed is included in the notice of hearing on the making of such extensions or improvements. As an alternative, the city may assess these costs to the area of future benefit immediately, based upon availability of the subject improvements. 
(10)  Burying electric lines. The entire cost associated with burying electric lines shall be the responsibility of the benefiting properties. 
(11)  New development projects. The following provisions shall apply to new development projects. 
a.  Except as otherwise approved by the city council, the developer shall be required to construct and pay the full cost of all public improvements within a new development project as provided by section 34-663 of this Code. 
b.  As provided by section 34-663, the developer may petition for construction of certain public improvements to be done by the city, which may be approved in the discretion of the city council. 
c.  In any project which includes a major street or trunk utility, the developer must petition the city if the developer wants the city to construct such improvements pursuant to Minn. Stat. ch. 429; the city will not undertake such construction simply by contractual arrangement with the developer. 
d.  The cost of any such improvements constructed by the city shall be assessed entirely to benefited properties within the project area except to the extent they benefit property outside the project area. Assessments to the project area will normally be allocated by the front foot method, as described below, however other methods may be utilized if conditions warrant as recommended by the city engineer. The developer may be required to sign an agreement of assessment and waiver of appeal rights pertaining to the cost of such improvements. 
e.  As also provided in section 34-663 of this Code, where the developer constructs and generally pays for the public improvements in a project, the city council may agree to pay part of the cost of the improvements where part of the cost is attributable to benefits outside the project area. The city's share of such costs shall come from any available source as designated by the council. Nothing in this article shall prevent the city from assessing such costs to other properties benefited by the subject improvements at some future time. 
f.  The city retains the right to refuse financial participation in any public improvement project if, in the opinion of the city council, the project is not necessary, feasible and cost effective. 
(Ord. No. 896, 7-6-2009) 
Sec. 66-27. - Properties subject to assessment. 
    The cost of public improvements shall be assessed against all properties benefited thereby, based upon the benefits received. 
(1)  Assessable property. All property receiving benefit from a public improvement project will be presumed to be assessable property. 
(2)  Publicly owned property. The city may levy assessments against the property of a governmental unit benefited by an improvement to the same extent as if such property were privately owned, except no such assessments shall be levied against property used or to be used for public street or highway right-of-way. Private right-of-way shall be assessable. 
(3)  Corner lots. 
a.  For a corner lot with improvements being made along more than one side of the lot, the frontage subject to assessment shall be the entire length of the shorter frontage and ten percent of the longer frontage of the lot. The city shall pay the remaining 90 percent of the assessment on the longer frontage of the corner lot. 
b.  For a corner lot with improvements being made along the longer frontage only, the assessment shall be ten percent of the abutting frontage with the city paying the assessment on the remaining 90 percent of the abutting frontage. 
c.  For a corner lot with improvements being made along the shorter frontage only, the assessment shall be for the entire shorter frontage. 
d.  For corner lots with two or more sides of equal length, the side on which the house fronts or will front shall be considered the shorter frontage.

ARTICLE IV. - METHODS OF ASSESSMENT 

Sec. 66-35. - [Methods of calculating special assessments.] 
    Unless otherwise determined by the city council, the city shall use one of two methods of calculating special assessments for public improvement projects, or a combination of those methods, depending on the circumstances of the project: the "front foot method" or the "per lot method." The feasibility report for a project shall recommend one or a combination of these methods for the project, based upon what method or combination of methods will best reflect the special benefit of the project to the properties to be assessed. The city council will approve the selected method(s) of calculating assessments at the time the project is ordered. The front foot method and the per lot method are described as follows: 
(1)  Front foot method. An assessment rate per front foot of the properties abutting on a public improvement is determined based upon a preliminary benefit appraisal provided to the city by a licensed certified general real property appraiser. Using comparable sales of land with and without public improvements of the type proposed to be built, the appraiser determines the value of one or more typical parcels in the project area before and after the subject improvement project. The difference in these values is the benefit of the project to the property. The benefit is divided by the length of the property's frontage on the improvement project in order to obtain a per front foot value. Based on that appraisal, a total front foot value is assigned to each parcel within the project area using its actual or adjusted front footage abutting the project, as described below,to determine the special assessment against that property. 
Because different parcels vary greatly in front footage, back and side footage, area, and configuration, and yet each similar property (for instance, each single family home) uses public improvements approximately equally, the city will adopt and employ a means of adjusting for these variations in size and configuration and arriving at an adjusted front footage, in order to render the allocation of assessments for public improvements reasonable, fair and equitable among all affected properties. 
(2)  Per lot method. The per lot method of assessment is based on equal assessment of all lots or parcels within the benefited area. This method may be used upon recommendation of city staff and approval of the council when the circumstances of the project and/or the property benefited by the project warrant. The assessment per lot is the quotient of the total estimated special benefit of the project to the project area divided by the total number of assessable lots or parcels benefiting from the improvement.

Secs. 66-36-66-44. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE V. - FINANCING AND PAYMENT 

Sec. 66-45. - Payment of assessments; prepayment. 
    Special assessment is one method by which the city finances the cost of public improvement projects which benefit certain properties. Assessments are levied against properties benefited by the project at the start of the project and property owners may pay the assessments back over a period of years (the assessment period). The assessment roll adopted by the council is certified to the county auditor, who collects the assessments, together with real estate taxes, over the assessment period. The city is able to issue bonds to pay for the project at the outset and then pay off the bonds with payments received from property owners over the assessment period. 
    Property owners may pay special assessments to the county with their real estate taxes over the assessment period. Such payments include equal installments of principal with interest on the declining principal balance. 
    Alternatively, property owners may prepay assessments using one of the following options: 
(1)  They may pay all or part of the assessments to the city within 30 days after the council adopts the assessment roll, in which case the city will not charge any interest on the amount paid. 
(2)  They may pay all or part of the assessments to the city after the 30 day period but before the assessment roll has been certified to the county auditor, in which case they must pay interest which has accrued on the amount paid, through the date of payment. 
(3)  At any time after certification of the assessment roll to the county auditor, property owners may pay all or part (but not less than $500.00) of the remaining principal balance of the assessments to the city. Any payment that is made before November 15 of any year will be reported to the county auditor by November 30 of that year and the county auditor will reduce the principal balance owing and recalculate the amount of principal and interest to be paid over the remainder of the assessment period. 
(Ord. No. 896, 7-6-2009) 
Sec. 66-46. - Interest. 
    The city will charge interest on special assessments at the rate specified in the resolution adopting the assessment roll. If bonds were sold to finance the improvement project, the interest rate will be two percent more than the average interest rate of the bonds, rounded to the nearest quarter of a percent. If no bonds were sold, the interest rate will be two percent more than the average interest rate of the last bond issue sold by the city. 
(Ord. No. 896, 7-6-2009) 
Sec. 66-47. - Discretionary deferral of special assessments. 
    In certain limited circumstances, the council has discretion to defer special assessments for future collection. In these circumstances, assessments are adopted and certified to the county auditor but are not collected until a specified time or until the occurrence of a specified event. All deferred assessments constitute liens on the property assessed until the assessments are paid. The council shall determine, by ordinance or resolution, the amount of interest on deferred assessments and (1) whether it must be paid annually during the period of deferment at the same times as the principal installments would have been payable if not deferred, or (2) whether interest for the period of deferment should be added to the principal amount of the assessment when it becomes payable, or (3) whether, if so provided in the resolution levying the assessment, interest thereon to December 31 of the year before the first installment is payable will be forgiven. 
    There are two types of discretionary deferrals: 
(1)  Senior citizen, disability, active military service, and other hardship deferrals. The council may defer special assessments for certain senior citizens, people with disabilities, and members of the military, as allowed by Minn. Stat. §§ 435.193 to 435.195 and subject to the following rules. 
a.  The council may, in its discretion, defer the payment of special assessments against any homestead property if: 
1.  It is owned by a person 65 or older; or 
2.  It is owned by a person who is retired by virtue of a permanent and total disability; or 
3.  It is owned by a member of the Minnesota National Guard or other military reserves who has been ordered into active military service; or 
4.  There is a hardship on the basis of exceptional and unusual circumstances not covered by other standards and guidelines, where the determination is made in a nondiscriminatory manner and does not give the applicant an unreasonable preference or advantage over other applicants; 
provided that, in each such case, the council has determined that it would be a hardship for the owner to make the payments. Under subsection 4. above, the council may limit the deferment to one year or to a limited period of years, and may require regular verification by the applicant of the continuation of the exceptional and unusual circumstances that justify the deferment. 
b.  If an applicant for deferral falls into one of the foregoing categories, hardship shall be determined based upon the applicant meeting one or more of the following conditions: 
1.  Gross household income is at or under United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) low income limits, adjusted for the year and household size. 
2.  Unusually high medical expenses relative to income. 
3.  Other conditions found by the council to justify deferment. 
c.  Except as otherwise expressly determined by the council in the resolution approving deferment, a hardship deferment ends and all accumulated amounts (including applicable interest, if any) become due: 
1.  Upon the death of the owner if the spouse is not otherwise eligible for deferment; 
2.  Upon the sale, transfer or subdivision of any part of the property; 
3.  Upon loss of homestead status; or 
4.  Upon the council's determination that immediate or partial payment would impose no hardship. 
(2)  Unimproved property. The council may, in its discretion, defer special assessments against unimproved property as allowed by Minn. Stat. § 429.061, sub. 2. Payment of the first installment of any assessment levied upon unimproved property may, in the council's discretion, be deferred until a designated future year or until the platting of the property or the construction of improvements thereon, upon such terms and conditions and based upon such standards and criteria as may be provided by resolution of the council. When such an assessment becomes payable, it must be divided into a number of installments such that the last installment thereof will be payable not more than 30 years after the levy of the assessment. 
(3)  Review of application for deferral. The city administrator or his/her designee shall review applications for deferral of special assessments to determine eligibility under this section and shall include his/her recommendation for approval or denial of the application in the context of and as reflected by the assessment roll. 
(4)  Appeal. Property owners dissatisfied with the decision regarding deferral reflected by the assessment roll may appeal the decision to the city council, by written notice filed with the city clerk at least five business days prior to the assessment hearing. If there is an appeal, the city administrator or his/her designee shall inform the council of the basis of his/her decision prior to the assessment hearing, and the council shall review the matter and, in its sole discretion, either approve the assessment roll as proposed by staff or request further information regarding the application for deferral and adjourn the hearing relative to that assessment and postpone adoption of that assessment.

Sec. 66-48. - "Green acres" deferral. 
    Special assessments will be deferred as against agricultural property meeting the requirements of Minn. Stat. § 273.111 (the Minnesota Agricultural Property Tax Law or "green acres" law), and will become payable when and in the manner provided by that law.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 70-1. - Highway construction or reconstruction hearing process. 
(a)  For purposes of this section, major construction or reconstruction shall be defined as any project which includes one or more of the following elements: regrading, realignment, increasing of traffic lanes within the existing right-of-way, or widening or narrowing of the roadway or any portion thereof. 
(b)  If major construction or reconstruction of any state or county highway within the boundaries of the city occurs, the city council shall hold at least one public hearing during each of the following phases of the proposed project: 
(1)  For state projects the procedure is as follows: 
a.  During initial consideration of the project or of design alternatives for the project by the state highway authority, when the city receives written notice that such consideration is under way, provided that the city shall file a written request with the state highway authority that the city be given such written notice as early as possible in the planning process; 
b.  During the preliminary design phase, prior to any public hearing held by the state highway authority and before granting preliminary municipal approval of the project; and 
c.  Before granting final municipal approval of the detail design for the project. 
(2)  For county projects, when the city receives written notice that the county is considering or planning such construction or reconstruction, provided that the city shall file written requests with the county boards of commissioners that the city be given such written notice as early as possible in the planning process. 
(Code 1986, § 1120:00) 
Sec. 70-2. - Snow, ice or other obstacles on sidewalks. 
(a)  Clean walks required. The owner or occupant of any real property within the city limits shall clean the sidewalks abutting the real property of snow and loose or melting ice within 12 hours after such snow or ice has ceased to be deposited; shall not place any rubbish, soil, brush, building materials, or other obstacles to pedestrian travel on such sidewalks; and shall remove any such obstacles found or placed thereon as soon as reasonably possible. 
(b)  Failure to clean walks. Whenever the owner or occupant of any premises fails to clear the walks as required by subsection (a) above, and a complaint is registered with the city, the public works director, or his/her designated representative, may give a written notice to the owner or occupant if the owner or occupant is found to be in violation of subsection (a), either by causing it to be served personally on the owner or occupant, or by handing the notice to some person residing upon the premises. If the premises appear to be vacant or unoccupied, or when the owner or occupant cannot be found, then the notice may be served by posting it upon the premises in a conspicuous place. The notice shall state the violation which exists, the requirements of the owner or occupant of the property under this section, and that if such requirements are not met, the city will do the work and charge the cost thereof against the property, which charge shall be a lien against the property until paid. 
If the sidewalk is not cleared within 24 hours of the posting or serving of the notice as aforesaid, it shall be the duty of the public works director, or his/her designated representative, to cause it to be cleared and to send a bill for the cost thereof to the owner of the property. 
(c)  Assessment of cost. A property owner may appeal the validity and/or amount of the bill received from the city by submitting a written appeal to the city council within 30 days of the date of the bill. Appeals shall be heard at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the council, at which time any person appealing shall be heard. If no written appeal is made, or if an appeal is made and the council finds the cost, or any reduced amount which the council may order, to be reasonable, then such amount shall be billed to the property owner and shall constitute a lien against the premises until paid. If the bill is not paid within 30 days of issuance or within 30 days after an appeal and finding by the council that the costs are reasonable, whichever is later, it shall be levied as a special assessment against the premises pursuant to Minn. Stat. ch. 429, and shall be payable in a single installment and, if not paid when due, shall be certified to the county auditor for collection with taxes.

    It shall be the duty of the public works director/city engineer to enforce this article. 
(Code 1986, § 1100:25) 
Sec. 70-32. - Permit. 
(a)  No opening shall be made by anyone in any street in the city without first having obtained a permit from the finance director/city clerk on forms supplied by the finance director/city clerk. The permit shall be accompanied by the respective fees for the proposed opening. All public utilities shall be notified before any digging is started by using the state gopher one call system. 
(b)  Fees for street openings shall be based on the area of the street surface after it has been prepared for surfacing. For this article, the term "one hole" shall be considered to be 32 square feet or less. The application for each street opening permit shall be accompanied by the respective fee for the proposed opening at the rate duly established by resolution of the council periodically. In a newly developed area where the city is maintaining a nongraveled street, a fee per opening is required at the rate duly established by resolution of the council periodically. 
(c)  All street openings shall have a street opening permit. Any street opening made before a permit is obtained will be subject to a penalty equal to the minimum fee. In an emergency, the public works director/city engineer may authorize an opening in a street prior to obtaining a street opening permit. The contractor shall obtain the permit as soon as possible thereafter. 
(d)  The public works director/city engineer shall measure each hole after it is prepared for surfacing. The public works director/city engineer shall transmit the measurement to the finance director/city clerk in writing, and the finance director/city clerk shall certify that the proper fee has been paid for the street opening. For underpayment or overpayment of any opening, such adjustment in the fee must be made by the permittee or the city. No new openings will be allowed by the permittee if the contractor has any unpaid street opening fees. All street opening fees shall be paid within 45 days after the date of the first billing. 
(e)  Before a street opening permit is issued, each applicant must have a bond of $10,000.00, executed by securities satisfactory to the city and on file with the finance director/city clerk. The bond shall guarantee that all work done by the bondee, his/her subcontractors or assignees shall be of the utmost quality and shall leave the city harmless of and from all accidents and damages consequent thereto or because of any opening in any street, lane, drive, boulevard, sidewalk or alley made by him or by any person in his/her employ and will restore the street as required by this article. Every person must provide the city with a certificate of insurance showing that he/she is currently carrying liability, X-C-U, and property damage insurance as follows: The city shall be named as one of the insured on the certificate of insurance, and the minimum liability coverage shall be $500,000.00 for each person or $500,000.00 for each incident. Each insurance policy shall contain a clause providing that it shall not be canceled by the insurance company without ten days' written notice to the city of intent to cancel. No person shall be allowed to open a street after his/her insurance has terminated. 
(Code 1986, §§ 1100:00-1100.10) 
Sec. 70-33. - Backfilling materials. 
    All street openings shall be backfilled with suitable soil. If there is any question of whether the soil is suitable, the public works director/city engineer shall make the final determination. All material used in backfilling shall be sand, gravel, or clay, free from pieces of rock, concrete, or clay lumps more than one cubic foot in volume; roots; stumps; organic soil; vegetation; tin cans; rubbish; frozen materials; and other similar articles and substances whose presence in the backfill would cause excessive settlement. Material which is not compactible due to moisture content will be classified as unsuitable soil. All such undesirable items or material shall be disposed of pursuant to section 70-34. In that portion of the backfill which is within six inches of the top of the roadway subgrade, there shall be no stones which will be retained on a three-inch sieve. 
(Code 1986, § 1100:15(1)) 
Sec. 70-34. - Disposal of excess materials and debris. 
(a)  Excavated material either not suitable or not required for fill material pursuant to this article shall be disposed of by the contractor outside of the right-of-way at his/her expense in any manner he/she may elect, subject to subsection (b) of this section and any specific regulations imposed by laws, ordinances, orders and decrees. 
(b)  All materials not designated for salvage and all debris resulting from the removal and demolition operations shall be disposed of by the contractor as provided in this section, subject to any specific regulations imposed by laws, ordinances, orders and decrees. 
(c)  If any waste materials or debris are to be removed from the project for disposal outside the right-of-way, a suitable disposal site shall be arranged for and secured by the contractor, and he/she shall assume full responsibility for acceptable disposition of the material as well as for any damages resulting from his/her disposal operations. 
(d)  Unless disposal is made at a publicly controlled dumping site or some other established facility where the public works director/city engineer is satisfied that the material will be properly disposed of by and at the expense of others, final acceptance of the work will not be made until the disposal areas are in acceptable condition with respect to the contractor's obligations as expressed in this section. 
(e)  When so requested by the public works director/city engineer, the contractor shall provide him/her with information and evidence concerning disposal details and arrangements as would satisfy him/her that disposal operations are being conducted acceptably. If the public works director/city engineer should find that waste materials or debris have been or are being disposed of in an improper manner, it shall be within his/her authority to order corrective action by the contractor to obliterate any debris that was improperly placed or left exposed at locations within view of any public road. Failure to arrange for and carry out the objectives expressed in this section may result in the withholding of payments until compliance is ensured. 
(f)  Before dumping such materials or debris on private or public land, the contractor must obtain from the owner of such land written permission for such dumping and a waiver of all claims against the owner for any damage to such land which may result therefrom together with all permits required by law for such dumping. A copy of such permission, waiver of claims and permit shall be filed with the public works director/city engineer before the disposal is made. 
(Code 1986, § 1100:15(2)) 
Sec. 70-35. - Backfilling procedures. 
(a)  Trenches made pursuant to this article shall be backfilled in no greater than one-foot lifts to the top of the existing ground. Backfill material shall be compacted to 95 percent of the standard moisture density relationship of soils (ASTMD698-70), except the top three feet of the trench which shall be compact to 100-percent density. 
(b)  The warranty period referred to in this article shall be two years. The top 12 inches of the trench shall be filled with state DOT Spec class 5 aggregate from a source approved by the public works director/city engineer. If the city is unsure of trench compaction, testing may be ordered by the public works director/city engineer and paid for by the city if the test passes. If the compaction test fails, the contractor shall pay all costs and retest expenses. 
(c)  In pavement areas, any settlements which interfere with normal use and maintenance (generally a settlement greater than one inch as measured with a ten-foot straight edge) within the warranty period of this article shall be considered failure of the mechanical compaction and shall be repaired by the contractor at no cost to the city. Curb and gutter sections that are tunneled under shall also be free from settlement for two years or replaced as determined by the public works director/city engineer at no cost to the city. Failure to replace settlements will be corrected and billed to the contractor. 
(d)  Any settlements in sidewalk, boulevard, yard and ditch areas which interfere with normal use and maintenance within a two-year period of this article shall be considered failure of mechanical compaction and shall be repaired by the contractor at no cost to the city. 
(Code 1986, § 1100:15(3)) 
Sec. 70-36. - Final surface application. 
    The city shall apply the bituminous surfacing to all street openings unless otherwise stipulated by the public works director/city engineer. For an opening in a concrete street the permit holder or his/her contractor shall apply the concrete surfacing as specified by the public works director/city engineer. Sidewalk or curb and gutter sections removed shall be replaced by the contractor or, in situations determined by the public works director/city engineer, by the city at a cost per square foot and per linear foot, respectively, as determined by resolution of the council periodically. All holes shall be constructed in a workmanlike manner, and the street shall be blocked off only a minimum amount of time. Cold or adverse weather will not be considered as an excuse for having a street blocked off for an unreasonable length of time. If the opening is not filled within a satisfactory period of time, the city will have the hole filled, and the permittee will pay all expenses incurred. 
(Code 1986, § 1100:15(4)) 
Sec. 70-37. - Safety devices. 
(a)  Approved public warning and protection must be provided by the contractor for each street opening. All traffic control devices (i.e., signs, barricades, channelizing devices, pavement markings, and lighting devices) used on street construction or maintenance work shall conform to the applicable specifications of the latest edition of the Minnesota Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MMUTCD) which includes appendix B, Traffic Control for Short-Term Street or Highway Work Zones. 
(b)  The contractor shall prepare a sketch or plan of his/her proposed traffic control plan for his/her proposed work zones which shall be submitted to the city at the same time as the completed permit application. The traffic control plan shall conform with the provisions and requirements of the MMUTCD and shall show, in a general way, the proposed traffic control devices to be used and their proposed placement. 
(c)  All work done shall be completed and the street opened to traffic before dark. However, if a portion of the street must remain closed overnight, the contractor shall place the proper traffic control devices, conforming to provisions of the MMUTCD, around the excavation in addition to security/safety fencing as approved by the public works director/city engineer. It is the contractor's responsibility to supply, install and remove all traffic control devices required. All traffic control devices shall be kept clean and free of mud, dirt, oil, grease, and in generally good condition by the contractor so that they are effective. 
(d)  Whenever a hole is to be made in any trunk highway or county road, additional warning and protection will be necessary. All plans for holes in state trunk highways must be reviewed and approved by the public works director/city engineer with special protection provided as needed, and a cash deposit will be required in the amount as specified by the district maintenance engineer of the state highway department. Such deposit will be made to the city, and the city will in turn hold this check on deposit until the hole is satisfactorily completed. All safety and warning equipment shall be furnished by the permit holder or his/her representative and must be in accordance with the Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control. All such work, especially backfilling, shall conform with state DOT and county standards and specifications.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 998, § 1, adopted Oct. 2, 2018, repealed Art. IV, §§ 70-91-70-112. Section 2, App. A of the ordinance enacted a new Art. IV, §§ 70-91-70-123, as set out herein. Former Art. IV pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 745, § 1105:00, adopted May 21, 2001. 

Sec. 70-91. - Findings, purpose, and intent. 
    To provide for the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, and to ensure the integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances. 
    Accordingly, the city hereby enacts this new chapter of this Code relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This chapter imposes reasonable regulation on the placement and maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this chapter, persons excavating and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear financial responsibility for their work. Finally, this chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons using the public rights-of-way. 
    This chapter shall be interpreted consistently with 1997 Session Laws, Chapter 123, substantially codified in Minn. Stat. §§ 237.16, 237.162, 237.163, 237.79, 237.81, and 238.086 (the "Act") and 2017 Minn. Laws, ch. 94, art. 9, amending the Act, and the other laws governing applicable rights of the city and users of the right-of-way. This chapter shall also be interpreted consistent with Minn. R. 7819.0050-7819.9950 and Minn. R., ch. 7560 where possible. To the extent any provision of this chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and case law is intended. This chapter shall not be interpreted to limit the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.

(22)  The permittee shall obtain all other necessary permits, licenses and approvals, pay all required fees therefor and comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws. 
(23)  The permittee shall not do any work outside the project area as specified in the permit. 
(c)  Small wireless facility conditions. Subject to a required city issued permit and pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 237.163, subd. 2(f), the placement of small wireless facilities and wireless support structures to accommodate small wireless facilities is a permitted use in a public right-of-way, provided however that a special or conditional land use permit is required to install a new wireless support structure for the siting of a small wireless facility in a right-of-way in a district or area zoned for single-family residential use or within a historic district established by federal or state law or city ordinance as of the date of application for a small wireless facility permit. This paragraph does not apply to areas outside a public right-of-way that are zoned and used exclusively for single-family residential use. 
In addition to the above paragraph of this clause (c), as applicable, and to clause (b) above, the erection or installation of a wireless support structure, the collocation of a small wireless facility, or other installation of a small wireless facility in the right-of-way, shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  A small wireless facility shall only be collocated on the particular wireless support structure, under those attachment specifications, and at the height indicated in the applicable permit application. 
(2)  No new wireless support structure installed within the right-of-way shall exceed 50 feet in height without the city's written authorization, provided that the city may impose a lower height limit in the applicable permit to protect the public health, safety and welfare or to protect the right-of-way and its current use, and further provided that a registrant may replace an existing wireless support structure exceeding 50 feet in height with a structure of the same height subject to such conditions or requirements as may be imposed in the applicable permit. 
(3)  No wireless facility constructed in the right-of-way after May 31, 2017 may extend more than ten feet above its wireless support structure in place as of May 31, 2017. 
(4)  Where an applicant proposes to install a new wireless support structure in the right-of-way after May 31, 2017, the city may impose separation requirements between such structure and any existing wireless support structure or other facilities in and around the right-of-way for purposes of the public health, safety and welfare, reasonable city right-of-way management, or protection of the right-of-way and its uses. 
(5)  Where an applicant proposes collocation on a decorative wireless support structure, sign or other structure not intended to support small wireless facilities, the city may impose reasonable requirements to accommodate the particular design, appearance or intended purpose of such structure. 
(6)  Where an applicant proposes to install a new or replacement wireless support structure for a small wireless facility or to collocate a small wireless facility on a wireless support structure in a public right-of-way, the city may impose reasonable restocking, replacement, or relocation requirements on the replacement of such structure. 
(7)  The city may condition its approval on compliance with generally applicable and reasonable health, safety, and welfare regulations consistent with the city's public right-of-way management. 
Pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 237.163, subd. 3a, an approval of a small wireless facility permit under this section authorizes the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of a small wireless facility to provide wireless service and shall not be construed to confer authorization to (i) provide any service other than a wireless service, or (ii) install, place, maintain, or operate a wireline backhaul facility in the right-of-way. 
(d)  Small wireless facility agreement. A small wireless facility shall only be collocated on a small wireless support structure owned or controlled by the city, or any other city asset in the right-of-way, after the applicant has executed a standard small wireless facility collocation agreement with the city. The standard collocation agreement may require payment of the following: 
(1)  Up to $150.00 per year for rent to collocate on the city structure. 
(2)  Twenty-five dollars per year for maintenance associated with the collocation; 
(3)  A monthly fee for electrical service as follows: 
a.  Seventy-three dollars per radio node less than or equal to 100 maximum watts; 
b.  One hundred eighty-two dollars per radio node over 100 maximum watts; or 
c.  The actual costs of electricity, if the actual cost exceed the foregoing. 
The standard collocation agreement shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the required small wireless facility permit, provided, however, that the applicant shall not be additionally required to obtain a license or franchise in order to collocate. Issuance of a small wireless facility permit does not supersede, alter or affect any then-existing agreement between the city and applicant,

(2)  Consist of substantially similar equipment; and 
(3)  Are to be placed on similar types of wireless support structures. 
In rendering a decision on a consolidated permit application, the city may approve some small wireless facilities and deny others, but may not use denial of one or more permits as a basis to deny all small wireless facilities in the application. 
(c)  Tolling of deadline. The 90-day deadline for action on a small wireless facility permit application may be tolled if: 
(1)  The city receives applications from one or more applicants seeking approval of permits for more than 30 small wireless facilities within a seven-day period. In such case, the city may extend the deadline for all such applications by 30 days by informing the affected applicants in writing of such extension. 
(2)  The applicant fails to submit all required documents or information and the city provides written notice of incompleteness to the applicant within 30 days of receipt the application. Upon submission of additional documents or information, the city shall have ten days to notify the applicant in writing of any still-missing information. 
(3)  The city and a small wireless facility applicant agree in writing to toll the review period.

Sec. 70-102. - Right-of-way patching and restoration. 
(a)  Timing. The work to be done under the excavation permit, and the patching and restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of circumstances beyond the control of the permittee or when work was prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under section 70-105. 
(b)  Patch and restoration. Permittee shall patch its own work and restore the right-of-way and assume all costs therefor unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. 
(1)  City restoration. If the city elects in writing to restore the right-of-way instead of permittee, permittee shall pay the costs thereof within 30 days of billing. If, following such restoration, the pavement settles due to permittee's improper backfilling, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, all costs associated with correcting the defective work. 
(2)  Permittee restoration. If the permittee restores the right-of-way itself, it shall at the time of application for an excavation permit post a construction performance bond in accordance with the provisions of Minn. Rule 7819.3000. 
(3)  Degradation fee in lieu of restoration. In lieu of right-of-way restoration, a right-of-way user may elect to pay a degradation fee pursuant to Minn. Rule 7819.1100. However, the right-of-way user shall remain responsible for patching and replacing and compacting the subgrade and aggregate base material in the excavation, and the degradation fee shall not include the cost to accomplish these responsibilities. 
(c)  Standards. The permittee shall perform excavation, backfilling, patching, and restoration according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city and shall comply with Minn. Rule 7819.1100. The permittee shall guarantee the restoration of the public right-of-way for 24 months following its completion (12 months for turf establishment). During the 24-month period, the permittee shall, upon written notification from the city, correct all non-complying restoration work, using the method required by the city. The correction work shall be completed within ten calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city, not including days during which work cannot be done due to circumstances constituting force majeure. The permittee shall submit to the city "as-built" drawings in a format usable by the city within one year of completion of the project, as required by applicable law. 
(d)  Duty to correct defects. The permittee shall correct defects in patching or restoration performed by permittee or its agents.

(b)  Shared fees. Registrants who apply for permits for the same obstruction or excavation, which the city does not perform, may share in the payment of the obstruction or excavation permit fee. In order to obtain a joint permit, registrants must agree among themselves as to the portion each will pay and indicate the same on their applications. 
(c)  With city projects. Registrants who join in a scheduled obstruction or excavation performed by the city, whether or not it is a joint application by two or more registrants or a single application, are not required to pay the excavation or obstruction and degradation portions of the permit fee, but a permit would still be required. 
(Ord. No. 998, § 2(App. A), 10-2-2018) 
Sec. 70-104. - Supplementary applications. 
(a)  Limitation on area. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the area of the right-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may do any work outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein. Any permittee which determines that an area greater than that specified in the permit must be obstructed or excavated must before working in that greater area (i) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required thereby, and (ii) be granted a new permit or permit extension. 
(b)  Limitation on dates. A right-of-way permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue working after the end date. If a permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or an extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. This supplementary application must be submitted before the permit end date. 
(Ord. No. 998, § 2(App. A), 10-2-2018) 
Sec. 70-105. - Other obligations. 
(a)  Compliance with other laws. Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by the city or other applicable rule, law or regulation. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws, including but not limited to Minn. Stat. §§ 216D.01-.09 (Gopher One Call Excavation Notice System) and Minn. R., ch. 7560. A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work. 
(b)  Prohibited work. Except in an emergency, and with the approval of the city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be done when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work. 
(c)  Interference with right-of-way. A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of those doing work in the right-of-way may not be parked within or next to a permit area, unless parked in conformance with city parking regulations. The loading or unloading of trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area unless specifically authorized by the permit. 
(d)  Trenchless excavation. As a condition of all applicable permits, permittees employing trenchless excavation methods, including but not limited to horizontal directional drilling, shall follow all requirements set forth in Minn. Stat. ch. 216D and Minn. R., ch. 7560 and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing underground utilities before excavating, as determined by the director. 
(Ord. No. 998, § 2(App. A), 10-2-2018) 
Sec. 70-106. - Denial permit. 
(a)  Reasons for denial of permit. The city may deny a permit for failure to meet the requirements and conditions of this chapter, applicable law, or if the city determines that the denial is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use. The city may additionally deny a permit for the following reasons: 
(1)  The applicant failed to fully comply with the application requirements herein. 
(2)  Except for small wireless facilities permits, the city has initiated revocation of a prior permit issued under this article against the applicant. 
(3)  Except for small wireless facilities permits, the applicant has violated within the past two years any requirements of this article. 
(4)  The time schedule for the project will conflict or interfere with a community exhibition, celebration, festival or any other similar community event in the area of the project. 
(5)  The time schedule for the project conflicts with scheduled public improvement of the public right-of-way. 
(6)  The time schedule for the project conflicts with another applicant's previously approved project. 
(7)  The proposed project violates a provision of this chapter or city Code. 
(8)  The proposed project is adverse to the public health, safety and welfare, by interfering with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the public right-of-way, or endangers the public right-of-way and its users based on one or more of the following factors: 
a.  The extent of public right-of-way area available; 
b.  The competing demands for the particular proposed area space in the public right-of-way; 
c.  The availability of other locations in the public right-of-way or in other public rights-of-way for the facility(ies) or equipment of the permit applicant; 
d.  The applicability of an ordinance or other regulation that affect the location of a facility or equipment in the public right-of-way; 
e.  Except for small wireless facilities permits, the applicant's prior noncompliance with the terms and conditions of its franchise, this article and other applicable ordinances and regulations; 
f.  The condition and age of the public right-of-way and the city's scheduled reconstruction thereof; and 
g.  The costs of disruption to the public and damage to the public right-of-way balanced against any benefits to the public served by an expansion into additional parts of the public right-of-way for facilities or equipment. 
(b)  Right to cure-Small wireless facilities. Pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 237.163, subd. 4(f), for small wireless facilities permits, if a permit application is denied, the telecommunications right-of-way user may cure the deficiencies identified by the city and resubmit its application. 
(c)  Procedural requirements. The denial of a permit must be made in writing and must document the basis for the denial. The city must notify the applicant or right-of-way user in writing within three business days of the decision to deny a permit. If an application is denied, the right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by the city and resubmit its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of receipt of the notice of denial, no additional application fee shall be imposed. The city must approve or deny the resubmitted application within 30 days after submission. 
(Ord. No. 998, § 2(App. A), 10-2-2018) 
Sec. 70-107. - Installation requirements. 
    The excavation, backfilling, patching and restoration, and all other work performed in the right-of-way shall be done in conformance with Minn. R. 7819.1100 and 7819.5000 and other applicable local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the Minn. Stat., §§ 237.162 and 237.163. Installation of service laterals shall be performed in accordance with Minn. R., ch. 7560 and these ordinances. Service lateral installation is further subject to those requirements and conditions set forth by the city in the applicable permits and/or agreements referenced in section 70-111 clause (b) of this ordinance.

(c)  Authority of director. 
(1)  At the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety, or well-being of the public. 
(2)  The director may issue an order to the permittee for any work that does not conform to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after issuance of the order, the permittee shall present proof to the director that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the director may revoke the permit pursuant to section 70-111. 
(Ord. No. 998, § 2(App. A), 10-2-2018) 
Sec. 70-109. - Work done without a permit. 
(a)  Emergency situations. Each registrant shall immediately notify the director of any event regarding its facilities that it considers to be an emergency. The registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary to respond to the emergency. Excavators' notification to Gopher State One Call regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith, and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this chapter for the actions it took in response to the emergency. 
    If the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's facilities, the city will attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. In any event, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose facilities occasioned the emergency. 
(b)  Non-emergency situations. Except in an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or excavates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit and, as a penalty, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the city code, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way, and comply with all of the requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 998, § 2(App. A), 10-2-2018) 
Sec. 70-110. - Supplementary notification. 
    If the obstruction or excavation of the right-of-way begins later or ends sooner than the date given on the permit, permittee shall notify the city of the accurate information as soon as this information is known. 
(Ord. No. 998, § 2(App. A), 10-2-2018) 
Sec. 70-111. - Revocation of permits. 
(a)  Substantial breach. The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit without a fee refund, if there is a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  The violation of any material provision or condition of the right-of-way permit or city Code. 
(2)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens. 
(3)  Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a right-of-way permit. 
(4)  The failure to complete the work in a timely manner, unless a permit extension is obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the permittee's control. 
(5)  The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to section 10-18 or that does not conform to applicable standards, conditions, federal, state or local laws. 
(6)  The permittee failed to maintain the required bonds or other security and insurance. 
(b)  Written notice of breach. If the city determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or any condition of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city, at its discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit to mitigate and remedy the breach. 
(c)  Response to notice of breach. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, permittee shall provide the city with a plan, acceptable to the city, that will cure the breach. Permittee's failure to so contact the city, or permittee's failure to timely submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee's failure to so contact the city, or permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year. 
(d)  Cause for probation. From time to time, the city may establish a list of conditions of the permit, which if breached will automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way grossly outside of the permit authorization. 
(e)  Probation revocation. If a permittee, while on probation, commits a breach as outlined above, permittee's permit may be revoked. 
(f)  Reimbursement of city costs. If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

(a)  Information required. Each registrant and permittee shall provide mapping information required by the city in accordance with Minn. R. 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Within 90 days following completion of any work pursuant to a permit, the permittee shall provide the director accurate maps and drawings certifying the "as-built" location of all equipment installed, owned, and maintained by the permittee. Such maps and drawings shall include the horizontal and vertical location of all facilities and equipment and shall be provided in a format or manner that is currently utilized and maintained by the permittee, when practical or as a condition imposed by the director. Failure to provide maps and drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the permit holder's registration. 
(b)  Service laterals. All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals, other than minor repairs as defined in Minn. R. 7560.0150, subp. 2, shall require the permittee's use of appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the director reasonably requires it. Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the director evidence satisfactory to the director of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this clause (b) and with applicable Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals installed after December 31, 2005, shall be a condition of any city approval necessary for: 
(1)  Payments to contractors working on a public improvement project, including those under Minn. Stat. ch. 429, and 
(2)  City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or site plan approval under Minn. Stat. ch. 462. The director shall reasonably determine the appropriate method of providing such information to the city. Failure to provide prompt and accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of the permit issued for the work or future permits to the offending permittee or its subcontractors.

(a)  Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other applicable law, and with Minn. R. 7819.3100, 7819.5000, and 7819.5100, to the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities. 
(b)  Undergrounding. Unless otherwise agreed in a franchise or other agreement between the applicable right-of-way user and the city or unless otherwise excepted herein, any new non-replacement facilities or equipment in the right-of-way must be located or relocated and maintained underground in accordance with section 70-114. 
The following exceptions to the strict application of this clause (b) shall be allowed upon the conditions stated: 
(1)  Technical feasibility; promotion of policy . Above-ground installation, construction, or placement of facilities shall be allowed in residential, commercial, and industrial areas where the council, following consideration and recommendation by the planning commission, finds that: 
a.  Underground placement is not technically feasible due to topographical, subsoil, or other existing conditions which significantly and adversely affect underground facilities placement; or 
b.  Failure to promote the purposes of undergrounding. The city determines on its own review that undergrounding is not warranted based on the circumstances of the proposed undergrounding. 
(2)  Temporary service. Above-ground installation, construction, or placement of temporary service lines shall only be allowed: 
a.  During new construction of any project for a period not to exceed three months. 
b.  During an emergency in order to safeguard lives or property within the city. 
c.  For a period of not more than seven months when soil conditions make excavation impractical. 
(3)  Facilities subject to preemptive public utilities commission siting and routing jurisdiction . Facilities that are subject to certificate of need and siting and routing requirements of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission are exempted from this section to the extent that the city's undergrounding authority is pre-empted by law. 
(4)  Collocation of small cell wireless facilities . Collocation of small wireless facilities and installation of wireless support structures, approved by the city and in compliance with Minn. Stat. §§ 237.162, 237.163, are exempted from this section. 
(c)  Corridors. The city may assign a specific area within the right-of-way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is or, pursuant to current technology, the city expects will someday be located within the right-of-way. All excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the city involving the installation or replacement of facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the facilities at issue. Any registrant who has facilities in the right-of-way in a position at variance with the corridors established by the city shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or excavation of the area where the facilities are located, move the facilities to the assigned position within the right-of-way, unless this requirement is waived by the city for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service needs, and hardship to the registrant. 
(d)  Nuisance. One year after the passage of this chapter, any facilities found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking possession of the facilities and restoring the right-of-way to a useable condition. 
(e)  Limitation of space. To protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its current use, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional facilities within the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular utility service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.

Sec. 82-31. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose of this article to establish and impose just and equitable charges for the availability of certain utility systems, including waterworks systems, sewer systems, storm sewer systems and related facilities, and for connections therewith, to pay for the construction, reconstruction, repair, enlargement, improvement, or other obtainment and the maintenance, operation and use of such facilities. Such charges are authorized and shall be determined and imposed in accordance with Minn. Stat. § 444.075. 
(Code 1986, § 171:00) 
Sec. 82-32. - Sanitary sewer availability charge and water availability charge for new developments. 
(a)  Charges authorized. A sanitary sewer availability charge (SAC) and/or a water availability charge (WAC) shall be imposed against the owner of property which is proposed to be subdivided or connected to public sewer and water. The SAC and/or the WAC shall be calculated as a fair and equitable amount per residential unit or adjusted residential unit or per acre, as provided in this section, which amounts shall be determined by the city council by resolution from time to time and which shall be reviewed at least every five years as to their adequacy to meet the needs of the subject utility system. In determining the reasonableness of any charges imposed, the council may consider any or all of the costs of the establishment, operation, maintenance, depreciation and necessary replacements of the system and of improvements, enlargements and extensions necessary to serve adequately the territory of the city, including the principal and interest to become due on obligations issued or to be issued. The fees for property being subdivided shall be paid at the time of final city approval of the subdivision. The fees for property being replatted or on property not being subdivided shall be paid at the time a building permit is issued. Credits shall be given for previously paid fees. 
(b)  Computation of units and charges. The number of units anticipated to be connected shall be computed as follows. The amount to be charged per unit shall be determined by the city council by resolution from time to time: 
(1)  Single-family houses, townhouses and duplex units shall each comprise one unit. 
(2)  An apartment which lacks separate plumbing for washer and dryer shall comprise 80 percent of a unit. An apartment with separate plumbing for washer and dryer shall comprise one unit. 
(3)  Public housing units and housing units subsidized under any governmental program for low and moderate income housing shall be counted as 75 percent of the unit equivalent for that type of housing. 
(4)  If the owner/developer does not know the density to be developed, the city shall impose applicable charges based upon the maximum allowable density for the area to be developed. 
(5)  Commercial, industrial and all other uses shall be charged on a net developable acre basis in such amount as the city council shall determine by resolution from time to time. A developable acre shall be defined as an aggregate acre of land which is available for development by the owner or developer, excluding only land dedicated or conveyed to the city for streets, parks, and holding ponds. 
(6)  All areas which use a lift station shall pay an additional charge per unit or per acre as the city council shall determine by resolution from time to time. 
(7)  All new developments shall be reviewed to determine whether they have paid for utility trunk systems by special assessment and, if so, any charges imposed pursuant to this section may be adjusted accordingly. Any property which has not paid for such systems by special assessment but which is subject to deferred special assessments for such systems shall pay the charges imposed by this section in lieu of any deferred assessments, unless the city council has previously made an explicit written commitment, other than the initial adoption of the deferred assessments themselves, to a property owner, directly or indirectly, with regard to the time and manner in which such deferred special assessments would be paid, which is more favorable to the property owner than the charges imposed by this section. 
(8)  The council shall review the assignment of units and other charges as provided in this subsection, may modify or add to them by resolution from time to time, and may deviate from the general assignment of units or other charges in particular cases where it is fair and reasonable to do so. The council may also prescribe more detailed rules regarding assignment of units or other charges by resolution from time to time. 
(c)  Adoption of reserve capacity charge manual. To the extent it is not inconsistent with this article or any policy or resolution adopted by the city council in connection with this article, the city may use the policies established by the Metropolitan Waste Control Commission Reserve Capacity Charge Manual, as revised from time to time, as a guide to determine appropriate classifications, calculations and charges under this article. 
(d)  Determination of need. The city shall be solely responsible for determining when and what utility trunk systems shall be constructed in the city.

Where satisfactory arrangements for payment have not been made, the finance director may, after the procedural requirements of subsection (e) of this section have been complied with, cause a discontinuance of service to the delinquent customer by shutting off the water at the curb stop. When water service to any premises has been discontinued, service shall not be restored except upon the payment of all delinquent bills and a fee to be established by the city council from time to time by resolution. Delinquent accounts shall be certified by the finance director who shall prepare an assessment roll each year providing for assessment of the delinquent amounts against the respective properties served. The assessment roll shall be delivered to the city council for adoption at or before the last meeting of the city council of each year for certification to the county auditor for collection along with taxes. Such action is optional and may be subsequent or in addition to taking other legal action to collect delinquent accounts. 
(d)  Past due amounts from underbilling by city. Past due amounts for periods up to six years resulting from underbilling by the city for whatever reason, including error by the city, shall be due and owing by the account holder. The past due amount shall constitute a lien against the property served until paid, unless: (a) the property has been sold, (b) the city was asked to submit a final water bill at the time of closing on the sale, and (c) the city failed to bill the entire amount due. In that event, the past due amount shall be due and owing by the account holder personally and shall constitute a lien against other property in the city owned by the same person or entity but shall not constitute a lien against the property sold. If there has been no culpable conduct on the part of the account holder or other occupant of the property which created or contributed to the past due amount, the account holder shall be given a period of time equal to the period of time during which the past due amount accrued to pay the past due amount, in equal monthly installments, and no penalty or interest shall be charged as long as payments are timely made, provided that a different payment plan may be established by agreement of the city and the account holder. 
(e)  Procedure for shutoff of service. The city shall mail a notice to the owner and the occupant of a property for which water charges are delinquent, which shall indicate the amount of the delinquency, the date such amount must be received by the finance director, and that if the amount is not received on such date the service will be shut off. Such date shall be 30 days after the date the notice is mailed. The notice must also state that the occupant may, before such date, demand a hearing on the matter to be heard by the city administrator, in which case the service shall not be shut off until after the hearing. The notice shall include a copy of this section. If the finance director has not received the amount owing or a demand for a hearing within the 30 day period, the city may shut off the service. If a demand for a hearing is made within the 30 day period, the city administrator shall hold a hearing on the matter and determine whether the amount is actually due and unpaid and whether there is no legal reason why the water supply may not be shut off. If the city administrator decides that such conditions are met, the city may shut off the supply.

DIVISION 2. - DISCHARGE RESTRICTIONS 

Sec. 82-206. - Unpolluted water or storm-water. 
(a)  No unpolluted water or stormwater shall be discharged to the public sanitary sewer system. Such water shall be discharged only to storm sewer or to natural outlets approved by the city and other regulatory agencies as outlined in this section. 
(b)  Except as otherwise expressly authorized in this section, no water from any roof, surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile, swimming pool, or other source of natural precipitation shall be discharged into the sanitary sewer system. Dwellings and other buildings and structures which require, because of infiltration of water into basements, crawl spaces, and the like, a sump pump discharge system shall have a permanently installed discharge line which shall not at any time discharge water into the sanitary sewer system, except as provided in this section. A permanently installed discharge line shall be one which provides for year-round discharge capability to either the outside of the dwelling, building, or structure, preferably to the ground surface (i.e. lawn) to encourage infiltration. If discharge to the yard is not feasible, the permanently installed discharge line may be connected to city storm sewer facilities or through the curb and gutter to the street as long as it does not create nuisance conditions (such as ice build-up on public right-of-way surfaces or excessive flows on neighboring properties). It shall consist of a rigid discharge line, without valving or quick connections for altering the path of discharge. 
(c)  Any person having a roof, surface, groundwater sump pump, footing tile, or swimming pool connected and/or discharging into the sanitary sewer system shall immediately disconnect or remove such. Any connections or openings in the sanitary sewer system shall be closed or repaired in an effective, workmanlike manner, subject to inspection and approval by a designated representative. 
(d)  Swimming pool water must be dechlorinated by chemical treatment or stopping the addition of chlorine three to four days in advance of discharge. It is preferred that swimming pool water, free of chlorine, be discharged to the ground surface (i.e. lawn) to encourage infiltration. The discharge should not flow onto any other persons' property or create nuisance conditions. If the discharge flow is to occur across bare soil areas, care should be taken to prevent soil erosion. Nuisance conditions and erosion may be limited by reducing the rate of discharge. If it is not possible to discharge swimming pool water to the ground surface, it may be discharged to city storm sewer facilities or through the curb and gutter to the street so long as the discharge does not create nuisance conditions. 
(e)  Any person who owns improved real estate that does or may discharge into the city's sanitary sewer system shall allow a designated representative to inspect the buildings to confirm that there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary sewer system. Alternatively, any person may furnish a certificate from a licensed plumber certifying that the property is in compliance with this article. 
(f)  Any sump pump connection may be reinspected from time to time as requested by the city. 
(g)  All new dwellings with sumps for which a building permit is issued after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives shall have a pump and shall be piped to the outside of the dwelling before a certificate of occupancy may be issued. 
(h)  A monthly surcharge equal to the amount of the sewer charges against the subject property for the 12-month period prior to the date of the notice of noncompliance shall be imposed against every property which is not in compliance with this article within 30 days following notice of noncompliance and order by the authorized representative to come into compliance or for which the property owner and/or occupant has refused to allow any inspection as allowed by this article. The surcharge shall be added to the service charge billed against the property on a monthly basis. Any property found during any reinspection to have violated this article shall be subject to a monthly surcharge in the amount established by resolution of the city council for all months between the two most recent inspections. 
(i)  The authorized representative is authorized to issue a permit to allow a property owner to discharge surface water into the sanitaryy sewer system between November 15 and March 15 only, provided that the property owner shall be required to meet at least one of the following criteria in order to obtain such a permit: 
(1)  The freezing of the surface water discharge from a sump pump or footing drain causes a dangerous condition, such as ice buildup or flooding, on either public or private property. 
(2)  The property owner has demonstrated that there is a danger that the sump pump or footing drain pipes will freeze up and result in either failure or damage to the sump pump unit or the footing drain and cause basement flooding. 
(3)  The water being discharged from the sump pump or footing drain cannot be readily discharged into a storm drain or other acceptable drainage system. 
(j)  Following ten days written notice, the authorized representative may require a property owner to discharge the sump pump into the sanitary sewer system between November 15 and March 15 if surface water discharge has caused or is causing an icy condition on streets.

Appeal from the determination of the city administrator or designee may be made to the city council by filing notice of such appeal in writing with the city clerk within 14 days of the date of notification to the property owner of the determination by the city administrator or designee. 
(d)  When vacant land is developed to the point of receiving either a sewer or water utility billing or both, the land shall be charged stormwater utility fees based on its developed land use. 
(e)  Exemptions. The following land uses are exempt from stormwater utility fees: 
 Public rights-of-way. 
 City-owned land except that which is leased to non-government entities or persons. 
 River and creek beds to the high water mark. 
 Public and private cemeteries. 
 Land outside city limits. 
    The area of any exempt land uses which is part of a parcel for which stormwater utility fees are otherwise payable shall be deducted from the area of the parcel as a whole to arrive at the net acreage referred to above. 
(f)  Area measurements provided by Rice and Dakota Counties shall be used to compute the net acreage of parcels of land for purposes of stormwater utility fees. If property measurements are changed or corrected by the County, the property owner shall so notify the city administrator or his/her designee so that city records may be corrected and fees adjusted, provided that fees shall not be adjusted retroactively from the date the city is notified of the correction. 
(g)  Residential equivalent factors for office, commercial and industrial parcels shall be determined based on the Stormwater Utility Fee Justification Report, Appendix F, adopted by resolution of the council, as the same may be modified from time to time by resolution of the council. 
(h)  Residential equivalent factors for St. Olaf College and Carleton College property are based on the Stormwater Utility Fee Justification Report, Appendix F, adopted by resolution of the council, and may be modified from time to time by resolution of the council to reflect changes made to such properties.

During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in addition to any permit or other fees being imposed on Company, the City may impose on Company a franchise fee by separate franchise fee ordinance. The franchise fee shall be a flat fee per customer based on metered service to retail customers within the City or on some other similar basis. 
2.  Separate Ordinance. The franchise fee shall be imposed by a separate ordinance duly adopted by the City Council, which ordinance shall not be adopted until at least 90 days after written notice enclosing such proposed ordinance has been served upon Company by certified mail. The fee shall not become effective until the beginning of a Company billing month at least 90 days after written notice enclosing such adopted ordinance has been served upon Company by certified mail. Paragraph 5 of Section 82-402 shall constitute the sole remedy for solving disputes between Company and the City in regard to the interpretation of, or enforcement of, the separate ordinance. No action by the City to implement a separate ordinance will commence until this Ordinance is effective. A separate ordinance which imposes a lesser franchise fee on the residential class of customers shall not be effective against Company unless the fee imposed on each other customer classification is reduced proportionately in the same or greater amount per class as the reduction represented by the lesser fee on the residential class. 
3.  Terms Defined. For the purpose of this Section, the following definitions apply: 
    Customer Class shall refer to the classes listed on the Fee Schedule and as defined or determined in Company's electric tariffs on file with the Commission. 
    Fee Schedule refers to the schedule setting forth the various customer classes from which a franchise fee would be collected if a separate ordinance were implemented. The Fee Schedule in the separate ordinance may include new Customer Class added by Company to its electric tariffs after the effective date of this franchise agreement. 
4.  Collection of the Fee. The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly and shall be based on the amount collected by Company during complete billing months during the period for which payment is to be made by imposing a surcharge equal to the designated franchise fee for the applicable customer classification in all customer billings for electric service in each class. The payment shall be due the last business day of the month following the period for which the payment is made. The franchise fee may be changed by ordinance from time to time; however, each change shall meet the same notice requirements and not occur more often than annually. The time and manner of collecting the franchise fee is subject to the approval of the Commission. No franchise fee shall be payable by Company if Company is legally unable to first collect an amount equal to the franchise fee from its customers in each applicable class of customers by imposing a surcharge in Company's applicable rates for electric service. Company may pay the City the fee based upon the surcharge billed subject to subsequent reductions to account for uncollectibles, refunds and correction of erroneous billings. Company agrees to make its records available for inspection by the City at reasonable times provided that the City and its designated representative agree in writing not to disclose any information which would indicate the amount paid by any identifiable customer or customers or any other information regarding identified customers. In addition, the Company agrees to provide at the time of each payment a statement summarizing how the franchise fee payment was determined, including information showing any adjustments to the total surcharge billed in the period for which the payment is being made to account for any uncollectibles, refunds or error corrections. 
5.  Equivalent Fee Requirement. The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be effective against Company unless it lawfully imposes and the City quarterly or more often collects a fee or tax of the same or greater equivalent amount on the receipts from sales of energy within the City by any other energy supplier, provided that, as to such a supplier, the City has the authority to require a franchise fee or to impose a tax. The "same or greater equivalent amount" shall be measured, if practicable, by comparing amounts collected as a franchise fee from each similar customer, or by comparing, as to similar customers the percentage of the annual bill represented by the amount collected for franchise fee purposes. The franchise fee or tax shall be applicable to energy sales for any energy use related to heating, cooling or lighting, or to run machinery and appliances, but shall not apply to energy sales for the purpose of providing fuel for vehicles. If the Company specifically consents in writing to a franchise or separate ordinance collecting or failing to collect a fee from another energy supplier in contravention of this paragraph 5, the foregoing conditions will be waived to the extent of such written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing equivalent fee requirement, City retains the right to determine a franchise fee structure that is a reasonably equivalent fee, and the right to exempt City facilities or operations from the franchise fee requirement. 
6.  Continuation of Franchise Fee. If this franchise expires and the City and the Company are unable to agree upon terms of a new franchise, the franchise fee, if any being imposed by the City at the time this franchise expires, will remain in effect until a new franchise is agreed upon, but not more than one year after expiration of the term set forth in paragraph 1 of section 82-402.

1.  Severability. Every section, provision, paragraph or part of this Ordinance is declared separate from every other section, provision, paragraph or part; and if any section, provision, paragraph or part shall be held invalid, it shall not affect any other section, provision, paragraph or part; provided, however, if any provision is held invalid, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to substitute, to the extent reasonably possible, amended provisions that validly carry out the primary purpose of the invalid provisions. Where a provision of any other City ordinance conflicts with the provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance shall prevail. 
2.  Limitation on Applicability. This Ordinance constitutes a franchise agreement between the City and Company as the only parties, and no provision of this franchise shall in any way inure to the benefit of any third person (including the public at large) so as to constitute any such person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto. 
(Ord. No. 941, § 1, 12-4-2012)

Sec. 82-509. - Franchise fee. 
1.  Fee Schedule. During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in addition to any permit or other fees being imposed on Company, the City may impose on Company a franchise fee by separate franchise fee ordinance. The franchise fee shall be a flat fee per customer based on metered service to retail customers within the City or on some other similar basis. 
2.  Separate Ordinance. The franchise fee shall be imposed by a separate ordinance duly adopted by the City Council, which ordinance shall not be adopted until at least 90 days after written notice enclosing such proposed ordinance has been served upon Company by certified mail. The fee shall not become effective until the beginning of a Company billing month at least 90 days after written notice enclosing such adopted ordinance has been served upon Company by certified mail. Paragraph 5 of Section 82-502 shall constitute the sole remedy for solving disputes between Company and the City in regard to the interpretation of, or enforcement of, the separate ordinance. No action by the City to implement a separate ordinance will commence until this Ordinance is effective. A separate ordinance which imposes a lesser franchise fee on the residential class of customers shall not be effective against Company unless the fee imposed on each other customer classification is reduced proportionately in the same or greater amount per class as the reduction represented by the lesser fee on the residential class. 
3.  Terms Defined. For the purpose of this Section, the following definitions apply: 
    Customer Class shall refer to the classes listed on the Fee Schedule and as defined or determined in Company's gas rate book on file with the Commission. 
    Fee Schedule refers to the schedule setting forth the various customer classes from which a franchise fee would be collected if a separate ordinance were implemented.

4.  Collection of the Fee. The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly and shall be based on the amount collected by Company during complete billing months during the period for which payment is to be made by imposing a surcharge equal to the designated franchise fee for the applicable customer classification in all customer billings for gas service in each class.

The franchise fee may be changed by ordinance from time to time; however, each change shall meet the same notice requirements and not occur more often than annually. The time and manner of collecting the franchise fee is subject to the approval of the Commission. No franchise fee shall be payable by Company if Company is legally unable to first collect an amount equal to the franchise fee from its customers in each applicable class of customers by imposing a surcharge in Company's applicable rates for gas service. Company may pay the City the fee based upon the surcharge billed subject to subsequent reductions to account for uncollectibles, refunds and correction of erroneous billings. Company agrees to make its records available for inspection by the City at reasonable times provided that the City and its designated representative agree in writing not to disclose any information which would indicate the amount paid by any identifiable customer or customers or any other information regarding identified customers. In addition, the Company agrees to provide at the time of each payment a statement summarizing how the franchise fee payment was determined, including information showing any adjustments to the total surcharge billed in the period for which the payment is being made to account for any uncollectibles, refunds or error corrections. 
5.  Equivalent Fee Requirement. The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be effective against Company unless it lawfully imposes and the City quarterly or more often collects a fee or tax of the same or greater equivalent amount on the receipts from sales of energy within the City by any other energy supplier, provided that, as to such a supplier, the City has the authority to require a franchise fee or to impose a tax. The "same or greater equivalent amount" shall be measured, if practicable, by comparing amounts collected as a franchise fee from each similar customer, or by comparing, as to similar customers the percentage of the annual bill represented by the amount collected for franchise fee purposes. The franchise fee or tax shall be applicable to energy sales for any energy use related to heating, cooling or lighting, or to run machinery and appliances, but shall not apply to energy sales for the purpose of providing fuel for vehicles. If the Company specifically consents in writing to a franchise or separate ordinance collecting or failing to collect a fee from another energy supplier in contravention of this paragraph 5, the foregoing conditions will be waived to the extent of such written consent.

When such premises shall appear to be vacant and unoccupied or when the owner or occupant cannot be found, notice may be served by posting it upon the premises in a conspicuous place. 
(d)  Upon the failure of the owner, occupant or agent to comply with the provisions of the notice and after the expiration of ten days, the public works director/city engineer shall cut and remove the weeds or grass or spray the weeds and shall determine the cost thereof and charge the owner of the premises therewith and shall report the costs thereof to the council at the next regular meeting thereof, at which time any person objecting shall be heard. 
(e)  If no objection is made or if the council shall find that the work was properly done, the amount of such cost shall be reported to the county auditor as for other special assessments, and the auditor shall cause the cost to be assessed, levied and collected in one payment, provided that within 30 days after the report of the public works director/city engineer is made to the council, the amount of such cost may be paid to the treasurer.
