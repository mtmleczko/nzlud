PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the city of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
    The Code was republished in 1996 with the inclusion of ordinances received for codification subsequent to the publication of Supplement No. 7 to the 1986 publication, and this republication constituted a replacement volume to the prior Code. 
    The Code has been republished a second time in 2002 with the inclusion of ordinances received for codification subsequent to the publication of Supplement No. 1 to the 1996 republication through and including Ord. No. 28-2001, adopted December 20, 2001, and this republication constitutes a replacement volume to the prior Code. 
    The Code was again republished for a third time in 2006 with the inclusion of ordinances received for codification subsequent to the second republication through and including Ord. No. 08-06, adopted April 25, 2006, and this republication constitutes a replacement volume to the prior Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 3 is numbered 3-1 and the fourth section of Chapter 6 is 6-4. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 5-4 and 5-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 5-4.1, 5-4.2, and 5-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 9 and 10, it will be designated as Chapter 9.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

The board shall notify the landlord if the petition was filed by the homeowner or resident or the homeowner or resident if the petition was filed by the landlord, of the receipt of such petition and of the right of either party to request a hearing in writing within 15 calendar days of receipt of such notice, or the board may schedule a hearing on its own initiative.

(Ord. of 1-13-77, § 9; Ord. of 6-26-86, § 1(7), (11)) 
Sec. 18-58. - Discontinuance permits. 
(a)  Scope. The provisions of this section regarding the discontinuance of the use of part, or all of the land owned and licensed as a mobile home park shall apply to all mobile home parks and mobile home park accommodations as defined in section 18-16. 
(b)  Definition of "discontinuance". When used in this section the term "discontinuance" shall include any change of use or discontinuance of the use of part, or all of the land owned and licensed as a mobile home park requiring a two-year notice pursuant to M.G.L.A., Chapter 140, Section 32 L (8). The term "discontinuance" shall include, but is not limited to, the licensee's conversion of the mobile home park, or part thereof, to a condominium or cooperative corporation. 
(c)  Discontinuance prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to discontinue the use of part or all of the land owned and licensed as a mobile home park without having first obtained a discontinuance permit from the city council subject to the provisions contained in this section. 
(d)  Discontinuance permit procedure. 
(1)  The city council shall consider an application for a discontinuance permit for a mobile home accommodation upon receipt of an application filed by the licensee or other authorized person. The city council shall forward said application within 14 days to the rent control board. 
(2)  The rent control board shall schedule a public hearing within 65 days of receipt of the application. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing, of the subject matter, sufficient for identification, shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Peabody once in each of two successive weeks, the first publication to be not less than 14 days before the date of the public hearing and by posting such notice in a conspicuous place in city hall for a period of not less than 14 days before the day of said hearing. The rent control board shall also notify all tenants living in the affected mobile home accommodations of the time, place, and subject matter of the public hearing. No defect in the form of any notice under this section shall invalidate any grant or denial of a discontinuance permit unless such defect is found to be misleading. 
(3)  No vote by the city council to grant or deny a discontinuance permit shall be taken until a report with recommendations by the rent control board has been submitted to the city council or 21 days after said hearing have elapsed without submission of such report. After such notice, hearing and report, or after 21 days shall have elapsed after such hearing without submission of such report, the city council may vote to grant or deny the discontinuance permit. If the city council fails to vote on the proposed discontinuance permit within 90 days after such hearing, no action shall be taken thereon until after a subsequent public hearing is held with notice and report as above provided. 
(4)  No discontinuance permit may be granted except by a majority vote of the city council. 
(5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the rent control board may, without holding a hearing, recommend the denial of a discontinuance permit if a decision has been made with regard to the discontinuance of a mobile home park accommodation within the preceding 12 months, and if the park licensee fails, in the new application, to allege a substantial change of circumstances since the previous hearing which would merit the rent control board in hearing new evidence. In addition, the rent control board may recommend denial of the discontinuance permit without holding a hearing if the application is not in conformance with the requirements of this section or other applicable regulations. 
(e)  Discontinuance permit criteria. In determining whether to recommend that the city council grant or deny a discontinuance permit, the rent control board shall consider the aggravation of the shortage of safe, decent and affordable mobile home park accommodations in Peabody, which may result from the discontinuance, especially for tenants of low and moderate income and handicapped or elderly persons on fixed incomes. In making such determination, the rent control board shall make findings of the following factors: 
(1)  The benefits and detriments to the persons whom this section seeks to protect; 
(2)  The hardships imposed on the tenant(s) residing in the mobile home accommodations proposed to be discontinued; 
(3)  Circumstances demonstrating hardship and inequity to the licensee seeking a discontinuance permit; 
(4)  The rate of vacancy of mobile home accommodations in the City of Peabody at the time the licensee applies for a discontinuance permit and the average rental rates for said available accommodations. 
(5)  The availability of land zoned and otherwise suitable for development or expansion of mobile home parks. 
The rent control board, in its discretion, may also review other relevant factors in making its report and recommendations. 
For purposes of this section, the "vacancy rate" shall be defined as that percentage of the mobile home park accommodations which are empty of mobile homes and are offered for rental to mobile home tenants. Further to be considered a "vacancy", the rental offer of the mobile home park accommodation must be without an entrance fee; without restrictions as to the age, size or character of the mobile home, and; without a requirement that the prospective tenant purchase a mobile home from the park owner. 
In its report, the rental control board shall determine the current vacancy rate for comparable mobile home park accommodations in the City of Peabody. Any parties involved may submit evidence or have the opportunity to contest data regarding the vacancy presented to the rent control board at the public hearing. 
If the current vacancy rate for mobile home park accommodations (or sites zoned for mobile home use and available for purchase) within said area is insufficient to accommodate all of the potentially displaced mobile home units, such determination by the rent control board shall create a rebuttable presumption that the granting of a discontinuance permit will be a disadvantage to the persons sought to be protected under this section and will result in the aggravation of the shortage of mobile home park accommodations and, in such case, the board shall recommend denial of the discontinuance permit unless such presumption has been rebutted by substantial evidence to the contrary. 
(f)  Additional provisions. 
(1)  The licensee/applicant seeking a discontinuance permit must make application to the city council for said permit within 30 days of serving the tenants with the notices required under M.G.L.A. Chapter 140 Section 32L(8). 
(2)  Notwithstanding the above, no eviction certificate shall be issued by the rent control board pursuant to section 18-71 unless a discontinuance permit has been issued by the city council.

(2)  The homeowner or resident is in substantial violation of an enforceable rule of the mobile home park; 
(3)  The homeowner or resident is in violation of a law or ordinance which protects the health or safety of other mobile home park residents; 
(4)  There is a discontinuance in good faith by the park owner or management, of the use of part or all of the land owned and licensed as a mobile home park subject to any existing contractual rights between the park owner or management and the homeowner or resident located in the mobile home park. No such discontinuance shall be valid for any mobile home sold by the licensee and for which a mobile home site was made available at the time of the sale, by the licensee, for a period of five years from the date of the sale; 
(5)  The homeowner or resident is committing or permitting to exist a nuisance in or is causing substantial damage to, the mobile home park accommodation, or is creating a substantial interference with the comfort, safety, or enjoyment of the park owner or management or other occupants of the same or any adjacent accommodation; 
(6)  The homeowner or resident is convicted of using or permitting a controlled mobile home park accommodation to be used for any illegal purpose; 
(7)  The homeowner or resident who had a written lease or rental agreement which terminated on or after the ordinance from which this article was derived has taken effect, has refused, after written request or demand by the park owner or management, to execute a written extension or renewal thereof for a further term of like duration and in such terms that are not inconsistent with or violation of any provisions of this article; 
(8)  The homeowner or resident has refused the park owner or management reasonable access to the unit for the purpose of making necessary repairs or improvements required by the law of the United States, the Commonwealth, or any political subdivision thereof, or for the purpose of inspection as permitted or required by the lease or by law, or for the purpose of showing the rental unit to any prospective purchaser or mortgagee; 
(9)  The homeowner or resident holding at the end of a lease term is a subtenant not approved by the park owner or management; 
(10)  The park owner or management seeks to recover possession for any other just cause provided that his purpose is not in conflict with the provisions and purpose of this article. 
(b)  A park owner or management seeking to recover possession of a mobile home park accommodation shall apply to the board for a certificate of eviction. Upon receipt of such an application, the board shall send a copy of the application to the homeowner or resident of the mobile home park accommodation together with a notification of all rights and procedures available under this section. If the board finds that the facts attested to in the park owner's or management's petition are valid and in compliance with (a) above, the certificate of eviction shall be issued. 
(c)  A park owner or management who seeks to recover possession of a mobile home park accommodation without a certificate of eviction shall be deemed to have violated this article. 
(d)  The provision of this section shall be construed as additional restrictions on the right to recover possession of a mobile home park accommodation. No provision of this section shall entitle any person to recover possession of such a mobile home park accommodation. Upon a decision of the rent board concerning the granting or withholding of a certificate of eviction, either party concerned may appeal to the Peabody District Court within 30 calendar days after such decision. 
(e)  In any instance in which a mobile home park owner has been sent a certified letter from an incorporated homeowners association indicating that such association has at least 51 percent of the homeowners residing within said park as members, and has articles of incorporation specifying all rights and powers, including the power to negotiate for, acquire and operate the mobile home park on behalf of the member residents, then, before a mobile home park may be sold for any purpose and before it may be leased for any purpose that would result in a discontinuance, the park owner or management shall notify said association by certified mail of any "bonafide" offer that the park owner or management intends to accept, to buy the park or to lease it for a use that would result in a discontinuance. 
The park owner shall also give notice by certified mail to the incorporated homeowners association of any intention to sell or lease the park within 14 days of any advertisement or other public notice by the owner or his agent that the park is for sale or the land upon which the park is located is for rent, and notice to the homeowners association shall include the price, calculated as a single lump sum amount which reflects the present value of any installment payments offered and of any promissory notes offered in lieu of cash payments or is the case of an offer to rent, the capitalized value of the annual rent, and the terms and conditions of the offer. Any incorporated homeowners association entitled to notice under this section shall have the right to pursue or lease the park, provided that it meets the price and substantially equivalent terms and conditions of any offer of which it is entitled to notice under this section by (1) executed a contract or purchase and sale or lease agreement within the park owner or management within 45 days of notice of the offer, and (2) obtaining any necessary financing or guarantees within an additional 45 days. No park owner or management shall unreasonably delay the execution of a purchase and sale or lease agreement with a homeowners association that has made a "bonafide" offer to meet the price and substantially equivalent terms and conditions of an offer which notice is required to be given pursuant to this section. 
Failure of the incorporated homeowners association to execute such a purchase and sale agreement within the first 45-day period or to obtain a binding commitment for financing within the second 45-day period shall serve to terminate the right of such association to purchase or lease the mobile home park for this effected period. The time periods herein provided may be extended by agreement of the association and the owner. Nothing herein shall be construed to require an owner to provide financing to any association or to prohibit an owner from requiring an association which is offering to lease a park to have within its possession a sum equivalent to the capitalized value of the proposed rent of the park and requiring that a portion of such sum, of an amount necessary to pay the rent on said park for a period of no greater than two years be kept in escrow for such purpose during the term of the lease. 
The right of first refusal created herein shall insure to a homeowners association for time periods herein before provided, beginning on the date of notice to the homeowners association. The effective period of such right of first refusal shall contain separately for each substantially different bonafide offer to purchase the park or lease it for a purpose that would result in a discontinuance and for each other substantially equivalent to an offer made more than three months prior to the later offer; provided, however, that in the case of a substantially equivalent offer made by a prospective buyer who has previously made an offer for which notice to a homeowners association was required by this section, the right of first refusal shall contain only if such subsequent offer is made more than six months after the earlier offer. The right of first refusal shall not apply within respect to any offer received by the homeowner for which notice to a homeowners association is not required pursuant to this section. 
No right of first refusal shall apply to a government taking by eminent domain or negotiated purchase, a foresale pursuant to a foreclosure, transfer by gift, devise, or operation of law, or a sale to a person who would be included within the table of descent and distribution if there were to be death intestate of a park owner. 
In any instance in which the incorporated homeowners association of a mobile home park is not the successful purchaser or lessee of such mobile home park, the seller or lessor of such park shall prove compliance with this section by filing an affidavit of compliance in the official records of the county where the property is located within seven days of the sale or rent of the park.

(17)  Any other information requested by the stormwater committee. 
(b)  Standards. Projects shall meet the most recent standards of the Massachusetts Stormwater Management Policy, which are as follows: 
(1)  No new stormwater conveyances (e.g. outfalls) may discharge untreated stormwater directly to or cause erosion in wetlands or water of the commonwealth. 
(2)  Stormwater management systems must be designed so that post-development peak discharge rates and volume do not exceed pre-development peak discharge rates and volume. 
(3)  Loss of annual recharge to groundwater should be minimized through the use of infiltration measures to the maximum extent practicable. The annual recharge from the post-development site should approximate the annual recharge rate from the predevelopment or existing site conditions, based on soil types. 
(4)  For new development, stormwater management systems must be designed to remove 80 percent of the average annual load (post development conditions) of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). It is presumed that this standard is met when: 
a.  Suitable nonstructural practices for source control and pollution prevention and implemented; 
b.  Stormwater management best management practices (BMPs) are sized to capture the prescribed runoff volume; and 
c.  Stormwater management BMPs are maintained as designed. 
(5)  Stormwater discharges from areas with higher potential pollutant loads require the use of specific stormwater management BMPs (see Stormwater Management Volume 1: Stormwater Policy Handbook). The use of infiltration practices without pretreatment is prohibited. 
(6)  Stormwater discharges to critical areas must utilize certain stormwater management BMPs approved for critical areas (see Stormwater Management Volume 1: Stormwater Policy Handbook). Critical areas are Outstanding Resource Waters (ORWs), shellfish beds, swimming beaches, cold water fisheries and recharge areas for public water supplies. 
(7)  Redevelopment of previously developed sites must meet the stormwater management standards to the maximum extent practicable. However, if it is not practicable to meet all the standards, new (retrofitted or expanded) stormwater management systems must be designed to improve existing conditions. 
(8)  Erosion and sediment controls must be implemented to prevent impacts during disturbance and construction activities. 
(9)  All stormwater management systems must have an operation and maintenance plan to ensure that systems function as designed. 
(10)  When one or more of the standards cannot be met, an applicant may demonstrate that an equivalent level of environmental protection will be provided. 
(Ord. No. 07-13, § 1, 6-13-13) 
Sec. 28-52. - Operation and maintenance plans. 
(a)  An operation and maintenance plan (O&M plan) is required at the time of application for all projects. The maintenance plan shall be designed to ensure compliance with the permit, this article and that the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards, 314, CMR 4.00 are met in all seasons and throughout the life of the system. The stormwater committee shall make the final decision of what maintenance option is appropriate in a given situation. The stormwater committee will consider natural features, proximity of site to water bodies and wetlands, extent of impervious surfaces, size of the site, the types of stormwater management structures, and potential need for ongoing maintenance activities when making this decision. The operation and maintenance plan shall remain on file at the department of public services plus with the stormwater committee and shall be an ongoing requirement. The O&M plan shall include: 
(1)  The name(s) of the owner(s) for all components of the system. 
(2)  Maintenance agreements that specify: 
a.  The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the person(s) responsible for operation and maintenance. If contact information changes the client must notify the stormwater committee in writing with these updated contacts. 
b.  The person(s) responsible for financing maintenance and emergency repairs. 
c.  A maintenance schedule for all drainage structures, including swales and ponds. 
d.  A list of easements with the purpose and location of each. 
e.  The signature(s) of the owner(s). 
(b)  Stormwater management easement(s). 
(1)  Stormwater management easements shall be provided by the property owner(s) as necessary for:

(2)  Erosion control inspection: to ensure erosion control practices are in accord with the filed plan. 
(3)  Bury inspection: prior to backfilling of any underground drainage or stormwater conveyance structures. 
(4)  Final inspection. After the stormwater management system has been constructed and before the surety has been released, the applicant must submit a record plan stamped by a professional engineer detailing the actual stormwater management system as installed. The stormwater committee shall inspect the system to confirm its "as built" features. This inspector shall also evaluate the effectiveness of the system in an actual storm. If the inspector finds the system to be adequate he shall so report to the stormwater committee which will issue a certificate of completion. 
(b)  If the system is found to be inadequate by virtue of physical evidence of operational failure, even though it was built as called for in the stormwater management plan, it shall be corrected by the permittee before the performance guarantee is released. If the permittee fails to act the City of Peabody may use the surety bond to complete the work. Examples of inadequacy shall be limited to: errors in the infiltrative capability, errors in the maximum groundwater elevation, failure to properly define or construct flow paths, or erosive discharges from basins.

Chapter 32 - WETLANDS AND RIVERS PROTECTION REGULATIONS 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 32-1. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this chapter is to protect the wetlands and rivers, related water resources, and adjoining land areas in the City of Peabody by review and control of activities likely to have significant or cumulative effect upon wetland and river resource area values, including, but not limited to the following: public or private water supply, groundwater, fisheries, wildlife, wildlife habitat, recreation, agriculture, aquaculture, flood control, erosion, sedimentation control, storm damage prevention, water quality, water pollution control, fisheries, shellfish, and rare species habitat, including rare plant species. These values shall to be known collectively as the "wetland values protected by this chapter." 
(b)  This chapter is adopted under the Home Rule Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution and the Home Rule Statutes, independent of the Wetlands Protection Act (WPA) (G.L. Chapter 131, Section 40A) and the Regulations (310 CMR 10.00) thereunder, in order to protect the aforementioned "wetland values protected by this chapter," with standards and procedures stricter than those of the WPA, and regulations thereunder. Nothing in this chapter shall absolve the applicant of his or her obligations under the Wetlands Protection Act or Rivers Protection Act, or Regulations adopted pursuant thereto. 
(Ord. No. 23-00, § 1, 12-19-00) 
Sec. 32-2. - Definitions. 
    The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation of this chapter: 
    Agent is any conservation commissioner or city staff who is appointed agent by a majority vote of the conservation commission at a regularly scheduled meeting of the conservation commission, and upon written approval of the mayor. (M.G.L. Chapter 40, Section 8c) 
    Alter shall include, without limitations, the following activities when undertaken to, upon, within, or affecting resource areas and buffer zones protected by this chapter: 
(1)  Removal, excavation or dredging of soil, sand, gravel, clay, minerals, or aggregate materials of any kind; 
(2)  Changing of preexisting drainage characteristics, flushing characteristics, salinity distribution, sedimentation patterns, flow patterns, or flood retention characteristics; 
(3)  Drainage or other disturbance of water level or water table; 
(4)  Dumping, discharging or filling with any material which degrades water quality; 
(5)  Placing of fill, or removal of material, which would alter elevation; 
(6)  Driving of piles, erection or repair of buildings, or structures of any kind; 
(7)  Placing of obstructions or objects in water; 
(8)  Destruction of plant life including cutting of trees; 
(9)  Changing water temperature, biochemical oxygen demand, or other physical, chemical or biological characteristics of surface and/or ground water; 
(10)  Any activities, changes or work which may cause or tend to contribute to pollution of any body water or groundwater; 
(11)  Incremental activities or changes which have, or may have, a cumulative adverse impact on the resource areas protected by this chapter. 
    Bank shall include the land area which normally abuts and confines a water body; the lower boundary being the mean annual low water level, and the upper level being the first observable break in the slope or the mean annual flood level, whichever is higher. 
    Buffer zone shall include, without limitation, that area of land extended 100 feet horizontally from the boundary of any resource area defined in section 32-2, definitions, "resource area" paragraphs (1)-(8), and 200 feet horizontally from the boundary of any resource area defined in section 32-2, definitions, "resource area" paragraph (9). Said buffer zones under the jurisdiction of the conservation commission shall overlay the buffer zones and riverfront area defined in the Wetlands Protection Act Regulations, 310 CMR 10.00, and Rivers Protection Act, Chapter 258 of the Acts of 1996. 
    Commission: The duly appointed conservation commission of the City of Peabody. 
    Freshwater wetlands: Riverine wetlands, marshes, wet meadows, bogs, or swamps that meet the following requirements: 50 percent of the natural vegetative community must consist of obligate or facultative wetland plant species as included or identified in generally accepted scientific publications, including the Wetland Plant List - Northeast Region (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), and the soils must be annually saturated, as evidenced by the observed groundwater, soil gleying, or soil mottling, within 18 inches of the surface, or must be mapped by the Soil Conservation Service as a hydric soil or as having inclusions of hydric soils. If an applicant believes that a soil is not wet or hydric in spite of soil mottles, soil gleying, or soil mapping, the burden is on the applicant to prove the soil is not hydric. Wetlands may be defined on soil conditions alone, using the above criteria, if the natural vegetation has been disturbed and wetland identification cannot be made using vegetation. 
    Groundwater recharge: Recharge of groundwater provided by infiltration of storm water through permeable surfaces and soils, unobstructed by any impervious surfaces. Impervious surfaces and enclosed drainage systems obstruct recharge of groundwater, by collecting and withholding storm water during rainstorms, and releasing concentrated quantities of water into natural or man-made systems, and therefore cannot provide necessary groundwater recharge to resource areas or buffer zones protected by this chapter. 
    Isolated wetlands and seasonal wetlands: Freshwater wetlands that do not border on creeks, rivers. streams, ponds, and lakes, isolated depressions which hold standing water for extended periods of time, such as kettle holes which are too small to be called ponds; and isolated depressions or closed basins which are subject to flooding during periods of high water table and high input from spring runoff, snow-melt, or heavy precipitation. Isolated wetlands shall include any isolated depression with no inlet or outlet which serves as a ponding area for run-off or high groundwater which has risen above the ground surface, and shall be capable of containing at least 5,000 cubic feet of water. Isolated and seasonal wetlands include temporary ponds and pools and vernal ponds and pools. 
    Lands subject to flooding: Depressions or closed basins which serve as ponding areas for runoff, snow-melt, heavy precipitation, or high ground water which has risen above the ground surface, and areas which flood from a rise in a bordering resource area as defined in section 32-2, definitions, "resource area." 
    Person shall include any individual, group of individuals, association, partnership, corporation, company, business organization, trust, estate, the commonwealth or political subdivision thereof to the extent subject to municipal ordinance, administrative agency, public or quasi-public corporation or body, this municipality, and any other legal entity, its legal representatives, agents or assigns. 
    Rare species shall include, without limitation, all vertebrate and invertebrate animal and plant species listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, regardless of whether the site in which they occur has been previously identified by the Division. 
    Resource area: The primary resource being protected by this chapter, which is the area of jurisdiction defined in section 32-3. Jurisdiction, excluding the 100- and 200-foot buffer zones. Resource areas include: 
(1)  Any coastal or freshwater wetland, bordering vegetated wetland, riverine wetland, marsh, wet meadow, bog or swamp; 
(2)  Any seasonal wetland, isolated wetland, including kettle holes; 
(3)  Any land subject to flooding or inundation by groundwater, surface water, or storm flowage. 
(4)  Any pond, reservoir, lake, natural or man-made; 
(5)  Any estuary, the ocean, land subject to tidal action, coastal storm flowage or flooding; 
(6)  Any land under aforesaid waters; 
(7)  Any bank, beach, dune; 
(8)  Any vernal pool, whether certified or uncertified; 
(9)  Any river, stream, creek, brook, whether intermittent or continuous, natural or man-made. 
    Vernal pool shall include a confined basin depression which, at least in most years, holds water for a minimum of two continuous months during the spring, and/or summer, and which is free of adult fish populations, as well as the area within 200 feet of the mean annual boundary of such a depression, regardless of whether the site has been certified by the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. 
    Wetland: Refer to section G.L. Chapter 131, Section 40A; section 32-2, definitions, "freshwater wetlands," "isolated wetlands and seasonal wetlands." 
    Unless otherwise stated in this ordinance or in regulations of the commission, the definitions of terms and the procedures, and performance standards in this chapter shall be as set forth in the Wetlands Protection Act (G.L. Chapter 131, Section 40A) and Regulations (310 CMR 10. 00).

(b)  Temporary vegetative cover and mulching shall be used on all disturbed and exposed slopes during construction. 
(c)  Permanent vegetative cover shall be planted within the first growing season. 
(d)  Plans shall demonstrate protection and preservation of all healthy trees to the maximum extent possible on the site, and when this is not possible, revegetation plans shall include replacement with suitable plantings. 
(e)  Wherever possible, brooks and streams shall remain as open waterways. 
(Ord. No. 23-00, § 1, 12-19-00) 
Sec. 32-29. - Commission approval. 
    If it issues an order of conditions, the commission may impose standard and special conditions in the order of conditions which the commission deems necessary or desirable to protect the wetland values protected by this chapter. All activities shall be done in accordance with those conditions. For all projects, the commission shall take into account the cumulative adverse effect of loss, degradation, isolation, and replication of protected resource areas and buffer zones throughout the community and the watershed, resulting from past activities, permitted and exempt, and foreseeable future activities. The commission may, at its discretion, require that construction of erosion control features and other features that protect the resource areas be completed before other work on the project proceeds. All work shall meet the requirements of this chapter, a determination of applicability and order of conditions, and shall be subject to inspection by the conservation commission and its agents. 
(Ord. No. 23-00, § 1, 12-19-00) 
Sec. 32-30. - Wildlife and wildlife habitat. 
(a)  Except as provided in this section, the performance standards contained in the Wetlands Protection Act Regulations (310 CMR 10.00) shall apply. 
(b)  The commission shall retain the right to require measures (such as the planting of vegetative cover) to maintain and/or restore wildlife habitat in disturbed areas. 
(c)  The commission may require from the applicant an analysis, by an individual or firm acceptable to the commission, of the impact on wildlife and/or wildlife habitat based upon a site inspection and review of the project where it is concluded that wildlife or wildlife habitat is of significant concern to the site. 
(d)  The commission may impose reasonable conditions as deemed necessary to limit adverse impacts on wildlife and/or wildlife habitat. 
(Ord. No. 23-00, § 1, 12-19-00) 
Sec. 32-31. - Structures of historical significance. 
    When structures of historical significance are located within a resource area or the buffer zone (old mill sites, dams, drainage systems, ice making sites, etc.), the commission may require adequate measures to protect these structures after consultation with the Peabody Historical Commission and/or Peabody Historical Society. 
(Ord. No. 23-00, § 1, 12-19-00) 
Sec. 32-32. - Recreation. 
    Where any recreation activity is proposed in any area subject to regulations under this chapter, the commission may impose such conditions as may be deemed necessary to protect the interests under the chapter, such as prevention of pollution. 
(Ord. No. 23-00, § 1, 12-19-00) 
Sec. 32-33. - No disturb zone presumption. 
(a)  Lands within 200 feet of rivers, streams, creeks, and brooks, and lands within 100 feet of all other resource areas, are presumed important to the protection of these resources because activities undertaken in close proximity to resource areas are presumed to result in alteration of the resource area and to have adverse impact upon the wetland values protected by this chapter, either immediately, as a consequence of construction, or over time, as a consequence of daily operation or existence of the activities. These adverse impacts from construction and use can include, without limitation, erosion, siltation, loss or impairment of groundwater recharge or flood control, poor water quality, and loss of wildlife habitat. The commission, therefore, may require that the applicant maintain a strip or buffer of continuous, undisturbed vegetative cover within 200 feet of resource areas defined in section 32-2, definitions, "resource area" (9), and within 100 feet of resource areas defined in section 32-2, definitions, "resource area" (1)-(8), respectively, unless the applicant convinces the commission by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the area or part of it may be disturbed without harm to the wetland values protected by this chapter. Said buffer shall be known as the "no disturb zone." Within the no disturb zone established by the commission, no grading, planting, site work, construction, or storage of materials is allowed. Vegetation in the no disturb zone shall not be cut or trimmed in any manner. 
(b)  In the review of proposed work within 200 feet of resource areas defined in section 32-2, definitions, "resource area" (9), and within 100 feet of resource areas defined in section 32-2, definitions, "resource area," (1)-(8) no permit issued hereunder shall permit any activities unless the applicant, in addition to meeting the otherwise applicable requirements of this chapter, has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that 1) there is no technically demonstrated feasible alternative to the project with less adverse effects and that 2) such activities, including proposed mitigation measures, will have no significant adverse impact on the wetland values protected by this chapter. The closer an activity is proposed to a resource area, the more scrutiny will be given to the potential impacts of a proposed project. 
(c)  No activity which will result in the alteration of land within the presumptive no disturb zone shall be permitted by the conservation commission with the following exceptions: 
(1)  Planting of native vegetation or habitat management techniques designed to enhance the wetland values protected by the bylaw; 
(2)  Construction and maintenance of unpaved pedestrian access paths not more than four feet in width; 
(3)  Maintenance of existing structures, utilities, stormwater management structures and paved areas; 
(4)  Construction and maintenance of water dependent structures and uses; 
(5)  Vista pruning and removal of dead and diseased vegetation consistent with conservation commission standards; 
(6)  Construction of new utility lines where the proposed route is the best environmental alternative; 
(7)  Septic system maintenance and, if a system has failed, repair/replacement meeting state/local standards where the maximum feasible buffer is maintained; 
(8)  Construction of accessory structures/uses associated with lawfully existing single-family houses where the conservation commission finds that alternatives outside the buffer area are not available; the size and impacts of the proposed structure/use have been minimized; and the structure/use is located as far from the resource as possible; 
(9)  Where a buffer zone is already altered such that the required buffer cannot be provided without removal of structures and/or pavement, this requirement may be modified by the conservation commission provided that it finds that the proposed alteration will not increase adverse impacts on that specific portion of the buffer area or associated wetland and that there is no technically demonstrated feasible construction alternative; 
(10)  Where a lot is located entirely within buffer area, the commission may permit activities within the buffer area when the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed work has been designed to minimize impacts to the buffer area. As mitigation, the commission may require the applicant to plant or maintain a naturally vegetated buffer of the maximum feasible width given the size, topography, and configuration of the lot. 
(Ord. No. 23-00, § 1, 12-19-00) 
Sec. 32-34. - Storm water and drainage requirements. 
    All work subject to review under this chapter shall conform to the storm water rules and regulations of the City of Peabody, and all federal, state, and local drainage regulations. 
(Ord. No. 23-00, § 1, 12-19-00) 
Sec. 32-35. - Rivers and streams. 
(a)  In the review of areas within 200 feet of rivers and streams, no permit issued hereunder shall permit any activities unless the applicant, in addition to meeting the otherwise applicable requirements of this chapter, has proved by a preponderance of the credible evidence that: 
(1)  There is no practicable alternative to the proposed project with less adverse effects; and that 
(2)  Such activities, including proposed mitigation measures, will have no significant adverse impact on the areas or wetland values protected by this chapter. 
(b)  The commission shall regard as practicable an alternative which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed property use, overall project purpose (e.g. residential, institutional, commercial, or industrial purpose), logistics, existing technology, costs of the alternatives, and overall project costs. 
(Ord. No. 23-00, § 1, 12-19-00) 
Sec. 32-36. - General wetland loss and replacement. 
(a)  Pursuant to this chapter, the conservation commission shall not permit wetland alteration except in the following circumstances: 
(1)  Water dependent uses and structures; 
(2)  Construction of new utilities and operation and maintenance of existing utility lines; 
(3)  Public projects. 
(b)  If the conservation commission finds that there is no feasible alternative to the proposed project, that the amount of wetland alteration is the minimum necessary to accomplish the goals of the project, and that acceptable mitigation has been provided to foster the values and interests protected by this chapter, the commission may permit limited wetland alteration. 
(Ord. No. 23-00, § 1, 12-19-00) 
Sec. 32-37. - 500 square foot wetland loss. 
    At its sole discretion, the commission may issue an order of conditions allowing work which results in the loss of a portion of freshwater wetlands when: 
(1)  Said portion has a surface area of less than 500 square feet; and 
(2)  Said portion extends in a distinct linear configuration (finger-like) into adjacent uplands; and 
(3)  In the judgment of the commission it is not reasonable to scale down, redesign or otherwise change the proposed work so that it could not be completed without the loss of said wetland.

b.  The term of any financial guarantee must be at least six months longer than the time an applicant has to complete a project. The commission, at its discretion, may allow partial or complete release of guaranteed funds as sections of a project are completed. The commission has the right not to release any part of the guaranteed funds until after the project is finished and a certificate of compliance is issued. 
c.  The commission has the right to reject the terms of a proposed financial guarantee, including the financial institution holding guaranteed funds if it is not a local bank, and to determine the amount of funds that must be guaranteed. The commission's only duty to secure release of guaranteed funds is to certify that required improvements have not been completed on time or to a satisfactory standard, as defined by the commission. 
d.  At the discretion of the commission, a joint financial guarantee may be used to comply with commission requirements and that of other agencies, boards, and commissions in the city, provided however that all relevant parties agree on the terms and the principal and that the guarantee is structured so that all relevant parties agree before any funds are released.

Sec. 32-60. - Generally. 
(a)  The conservation commission may, in its discretion, grant variances from the specific requirements of these regulations pursuant to this section. The conservation commission may grant a variance from these regulations when an overriding public interest is demonstrated or when it is necessary to avoid so restricting the use of the property as to constitute an unconstitutional taking without compensation pursuant to federal and state laws. The intent of this section is to ensure that reasonable use may be made of such property; however, the extent of use shall be limited in so far as is necessary to protect the wetland values protected by this chapter, and to ensure that there is no foreseeable danger to the public health or safety. In all cases, the burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate maximum feasible compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The conservation commission may require mitigation to offset adverse impacts to resource areas protected by this chapter. 
(b)  The commission may waive the application of any performance standard herein when it finds, after opportunity for a hearing that: 
(1)  There are no reasonable conditions or alternatives that would allow the project to proceed in compliance with these regulations; 
(2)  Mitigating measures are proposed that will allow the project to be conditioned so as to contribute to the protection of the wetland values protected by this chapter; and 
(3)  That the project is necessary to accommodate an overriding public interest or that it is necessary to avoid a decision that so restricts the use of property as to constitute an unconstitutional taking without compensation. 
(Ord. No. 23-00, § 1, 12-19-00) 
Sec. 32-61. - Procedure. 
    A request for a variance or waiver shall be made in writing and shall include, at a minimum, the following information: 
(1)  A description of the alternatives explored that would allow the project to proceed in compliance with the performance standards in these regulations and an explanation of why each is not feasible; 
(2)  A description of the mitigating measures to be used to contribute to the protection of the wetland values protected by this chapter. 
(3)  Evidence that an overriding public interest is associated with the project which justifies modifying one or more performance standards in these regulations, or evidence that the decision regarding the permit application would so restrict the use of the land that it constitutes an unconstitutional taking without compensation. 
(4)  In the event a taking claim is being made, the following additional information shall be submitted: 
a.  Documentation that the subject property is legally and/or equitably owned by the applicant, including the date of acquisition. Also, identification of all property in contiguous ownership, including contiguous properties in which the applicant has a present, future or past fee interest or beneficial interest and documentation of the assessed value of the said contiguous property. 
b.  Documentation of the assessed value of the property subject to regulation as well as documentation of acquisition costs, proceeds received to date, expected proceeds (including copies of purchase and sales agreements, expenditures, and any other financial and economic data relevant to the waiver/variance request). 
c.  Documentation of the value of the loss alleged to result from compliance with the relevant performance standards from which a waiver/variance is sought. 
(5)  The request for waiver/variance shall be sent to the commission by certified mail or hand delivered and a copy thereof shall at the same time be sent by certified mail or hand delivered to any other parties in interest. 
(6)  Within 21 days of the close of the public hearing, the commission shall issue a decision as to whether to grant the waiver/variance request. Such decision shall set forth the findings as required herein.

For these purposes, the erection, repair, alteration, reconstruction, height, number of stories, and size of buildings and structures, size and width of lots, percentage of lot area that may be occupied, size of yards, courts and other open spaces, density of population and location and use of buildings, structures and land in the City of Peabody as regulated as hereinafter provided.
1.4 APPLICABILITY
All buildings and structures hereinafter erected, reconstructed, altered, enlarged or moved, and the use of all premises in the City of Peabody shall be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. No building, structure or land shall be used for any purpose or in any manner other than is expressly permitted within the district in which such building, structure or land is located. Any use not specifically or generically enumerated in a district herein shall be deemed prohibited.
1.5 NONCONFORMANCE
1.5.1 Any existing nonconforming use of a structure or use of a structure and land in combination may be changed or extended, and, any existing nonconforming structure may be altered or extended provided that the special permit granting authority determines, after a public hearing, by the grant of a special permit that such change, extension or alteration:
(a) Is to a use or structure which existed or began with all appropriate permits or a building permit issued before the first publication of notice of a public hearing on this ordinance or any amendments thereto and is therefore lawful;
(b) For situations involving use of a structure or the use of a structure and land in combination:
(1) Includes adequate provision for off street parking;
(2) Complies with the provisions of section 6.2 of this ordinance.
(c) Is similar in:
(1) Character;
(2) Intensity of use;
(3) Size (structure only);
(4) Effect on adjacent property;
(5) Effect on public hearing, morals or safety.
As to be not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood, than the existing nonconforming use or structure or both.
Provided that in permitting such a change, alteration or extension, the special permit granting authority may require appropriate conditions, on time or use. Violation of such conditions as are made a part of the terms under which the special permit is granted shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance.
Provided further that any alteration or extension of a nonconforming structure shall not further violate the dimensional requirements of the existing ordinance or any amendment thereto.
7
Provided further that no special permit shall be required for the alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural change to a legally existing nonconforming single- or two-family residential dwelling when said alteration, reconstruction, extension or structural change does not increase the nonconforming nature of the dwelling. The Building Commissioner shall determine if the proposed alteration does not increase the nonconforming nature of the dwelling or if the proposed alteration or extension requires approval by the Zoning Board of Appeals only.
However, no special permit shall be granted for the purposes of increasing the number of residential units in a structure that is entirely residential with three (3) or more residential dwellings.
However, no special permit shall be granted for the purposes of increasing the number of residential units in a structure that is entirely residential when the increase will result in the expansion of the extension envelope of the building. (Ord. of 5-14-92, § 1) (Ord. of 12-08-16)
1.5.2 Each application to the special permit granting authority for a special permit involving a use of a structure or the use of a structure and land in combination under the provision of this section shall be accompanied by a site plan as described in section 6.2 of this ordinance.
1.5.3 The application for a special permit under this section and the costs of advertising related thereto and any other fees required by this ordinance shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
1.5.4 A structure or use of a structure and land in combination which does not conform to the regulations of the district in which it is situated, but, because it existed lawfully before this ordinance was adopted, may be rebuilt if damaged or destroyed, provided that a building permit is obtained within six (6) months of the damage or destruction and the rebuilding is completed within one (1) year of the damage or destruction unless extenuating circumstances exist in which case the special permit granting authority may grant an extension of up to two (2) years to complete the rebuilding.
1.5.5 Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is changed to a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the use regulations for the district in which such structure is located and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
1.5.6 A nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in combination may not be resumed after it has been abandoned for a period of two (2) years. (Ord. of 9-8-83, § 1(1.5))
1.5.7 Expansion or upgrading of nonconforming mobile home parks that existed prior to the adoption of this ordinance would be allowed through the grant of a special permit provided that such expansion or upgrading is within the existing bounds of the mobile home park and provided that such expansion or upgrading meets the requirements of the MH district. (Ord. of 10-11-84, § 1)
1.6 EXEMPTIONS
In accordance with Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40A, and notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, this ordinance shall not prohibit, regulate or restrict the use of land or structures for religious purposes or for educational purposes on land owned or leased by the Commonwealth, or any of its agencies, subdivisions or bodies politic or by a religious sect or denomination or by a nonprofit educational corporation; provided however, that such land or structure may be subject to reasonable regulations concerning the bulk and height of structures, yard size, lot area, open space, parking and building coverage requirements in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance.
8

5.2 SITE AND DESIGN CRITERIA
5.2.1 Purpose
The site and design review process for the B-C district seeks to encourage visual harmony, respect historic integrity, and encourage creative design solutions. These guidelines are not intended to dictate style but rather to provide a framework of common principles that foster design compatibility within the district. This section supplements the existing site plan review and applies only to the B-C district.
5.2.2 Applicability
The site and design guideline criteria within this section shall be applicable to all residential buildings, mixed use projects and non-residential developments within the district. The Peabody Downtown Design Standards, created in January 2016 and as may be modified, shall apply to any new construction, exterior renovation, signage or site improvements in the BC zoning district and portions of the GB, GBD, BN, BN2, R2 and R4
28
zoning districts in the vicinity of the Downtown as set forth in the Main Street Subdistrict, Walnut/Foster Street Subdistrict and Washington Street Subdistrict versions of said standards. The Community Development & Planning Department, in conjunction with the Building Department, will apply said standards, and the Building Commissioner shall enforce said standards. This includes any new building construction; a change in building use (adaptive reuse of an existing building) or a significant alteration of the existing building facades; work which results in the increase or decrease of floor area through improvements to the principal structure; addition of a new accessory structure, or significant change to an existing accessory structure; or any activity requiring a new curb cut or the addition of three (3) or more parking spaces. This section is part of the site plan review process (see Section 12) specifically for the BC District. (Amended 12/08/2016)
5.2.3 Framework for review process
The site design review process will use the following as a framework for consideration:
A. Architectural Character
1. Building façade and exterior architectural features
2. Building height and setbacks
3. Rooftop features and cornice lines
4. Exterior materials and colors
5. Exterior illumination
B. Urban Design Considerations
1. Building placement and orientation
2. Relationship to parking and adjacent uses
3. Relationship of building to sidewalk, public ways and open space

E. In large parking lots (20 or more spaces) provision for bicycle racks shall be provided in locations that are safely segregated from automobile traffic and parking.
5.2.6 Curb Cuts
Developments shall be designed in a manner that minimizes the number of curb cuts on primary streets. The Planning Board may deny a curb cut if the proposed development inconsistent with the following guidelines:
A. Curb cuts shall be limited to one unless the Board feels that due to large parcel size an additional cut is justified.
B. When access is available from a public alley the Board may deny a curb cut from a primary street.
C. Shared drives are encouraged between adjacent parcels when appropriate.
D. Curb cuts within 200 feet of an intersection are discouraged and subject to Site Plan Review.
E. Curb cuts greater than 30 feet (for commercial properties) and 22 feet (for residential properties) are subject to Site Plan Review. In no case shall a curb cut be the full length of the property.
5.2.7 Pedestrian and Bicycle Access
Provision for safe and convenient pedestrian access shall be incorporated into plans for new construction of buildings and parking areas and should be designed in concert with landscaping plans noted below. New construction should improve pedestrian access to buildings, sidewalks and parking areas and should be completed with consideration of pedestrian safety, handicapped access and visual quality. Where appropriate, applicants are encouraged to provide pedestrian and/or bicycle paths connecting their site with abutting areas in order to promote pedestrian and bicycle circulation and safety in the village. When parking is located in the rear, pedestrian access via a pedestrian-oriented alley or walkway through to the primary street is encouraged.
30
5.2.8 Landscaping
Landscaping shall be incorporated into new and redeveloped properties in such a way as to create visual relief and interest, provide shade for pedestrian areas and to screen parking and loading areas. Landscape plans shall be prepared by a design professional or, if in the Boards discretion the plans submitted are consistent with the intent of this regulation and meet the specific guidelines as set forth herein. Landscape plans shall show the location, type, and size of all proposed plantings as well as enough of the surrounding context such that the Board may determine the plans appropriateness.
A. Side Yard Treatment
1. Where the distance between structures on adjacent lots is 10 feet or less the side yard shall be screened by a solid fence, wall or landscape treatment of evergreen plantings at a height not to exceed 3 feet.
2. Where the distance between structures on adjacent lots is greater than 10 feet landscaping shall consist of a combination of materials sufficient to break up the view into the side yard but, for safety reasons, in no case should this planting be impermeable.
3. Side yards may, in the alternative, be established as pedestrian walkways to access parking areas to the rear of the building. Such walkways shall be landscaped and lighted for safety.
B. Parking Areas
1. Large parking areas shall be relieved by landscaped islands of a minimum of 8 feet in width, equal in depth to the depth of a typical parking space and located such that there is one island per 10 continuous spaces.
2. Alternatively, at least 5% of the interior area of the lot shall be devoted to landscaping. Areas described in the above shall have at a minimum one shade tree with a minimum caliper of 2½ inches diameter breast height (DBH). Trees planted in such locations shall be planted in protected pervious areas which have a minimum dimension of 5 feet.
3. Where lots abut public rights of way, shade trees with a minimum caliper DBH of 2½ inches, shall be provided within a planting strip no less than 4 feet in width and at a rate of one tree per every 6 continuous spaces.
C. Trash and Service Areas
1. All service, loading and trash storage areas viewable from a public right of way or from an adjacent residential area shall be screened by one or a combination of masonry, wood or evergreen plantings to reduce their visual impact.
2. Loading and service areas shall not face any residential area unless no other location is possible.
5.3 INTENSITY OF USE WITHIN THE B-C DISTRICT
5.3.1 Location and Distribution of Uses
The ground floor of a commercial building or mixed use building (any combination of retail, office, and residential) shall be occupied by commercial uses only.
31
5.4 DESIGN GUIDELINES
5.4.1 Orientation
Buildings shall be oriented parallel to the front setback line to preserve a consistent façade line with the street. Primary building entrances should easily identified and be oriented to the street. The primary entry should be clearly visible from the public street which provides the buildings main orientation. The buildings address is where orientation shall apply.
5.4.2 Articulation
New and redeveloped buildings should reinforce the character of the existing streetscape by creating visual interest and reinforcing pedestrian scale. The apparent bulk and large wall expanses of multi-story buildings as well as single story buildings of 15 height or more should be minimized by incorporating one or preferably a combination of the following:
? Windows
? Architectural Details
? Canopies
? Overhangs
? Indented Bays
? Change of Building Materials
The top of such buildings should display a distinct profile or outline incorporating such elements as a projecting parapet, cornice, upper level setback or pitched roofline. When immediately adjacent a building with such articulation, new and redeveloped buildings should provide a treatment that is respectful, such as providing a consistent cornice line where possible.
Large expanses of blank walls are prohibited for commercial and mixed-use buildings.
5.4.3 Transparency
For commercial and mixed- use buildings, a minimum of 60% of the building façade oriented to the street must be comprised of clear windows that provide views to indoor retail space, dining space or product areas when applicable. Where parking occupies the ground floor the same solid to void ratio must be achieved utilizing techniques such as half-walls, grillwork, or landscaped trelliswork or their equal.
32
5.4.4 Doors and Entrances
A. Buildings must have a primary entrance facing a public street or way and should be visually prominent.
B. In buildings with multiple ground floor tenants entries should provide a coordinated design theme i.e. a common canopy, architectural projection or awning design.
5.4.5 Pedestrian Spaces and Comfort
For the purpose of providing a pedestrian friendly environment in the B-C District, new and redeveloped buildings should provide for outdoor seating areas, scaled to the size and demands of the proposed use, where feasible. For example, a large, multi-story project should provide a patio or small plaza area located near the front entry with multiple benches and landscaping. A mixed-use project with ground floor retail such as a restaurant may provide an area for outdoor dining which extends the indoor dining space for seasonal use. A ground floor use may provide a sidewalk bench where there is sufficient width.
Such pedestrian areas are best located when they take advantage of southern exposure and provide space that affords visual connectivity but is setback from major pedestrian flow and vehicular ways and is appropriate to the location.
Outdoor sales and display areas should be well organized and located such as not to impede pedestrian circulation if located on a public walk or way.
The following guidelines should be considered in the design and location of pedestrian spaces:
? Flexible design to allow for flexible use
? Buffering from major vehicular areas such as parking lots or main traffic ways
? Lighting for nighttime comfort and safety
? Appropriate street furnishingi.e. benches, trash receptacles
? A focal element where appropriate such as a water feature, special landscape feature or public art installation
? Decorative paving and seasonal planting
? South facing locations
? Visual connectivity, especially to important views such as an historic structure
? Appropriately scaled to the development
? Must maintain adequate width access as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
5.4.6 Outdoor Dining
The purpose of this section is to provide for the licensing of outdoor dining areas of appropriate design, configuration and appearance that will serve as an amenity to the City during the spring, summer and fall. The City Council may issue annual outdoor dining area licenses which shall be for the period from April 1 through October 31. Licenses shall be valid for one season, and must be reapplied for annually. The City Council shall impose such conditions on each license as it determines to be appropriate and in the best interest of the City. License fees shall be established by the City Council. The City Council may also make such regulations governing such licenses as it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.
A. Outdoor dining areas containing nine (9) or more seats shall be separated from their surroundings by a perimeter fence or barrier. No such fences or barriers may damage the public sidewalk. Perimeter treatments, umbrellas, furniture and trash receptacles shall be supplied by the applicant and shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary manner by the applicant. All trash receptacles shall
33
be covered and trash removed nightly. All perimeter treatments, umbrellas, furniture and trash receptacles must be removed at the end of each season. All furniture must be secured during the hours not in use.
B. In no event shall the placement of outdoor dining furniture, umbrellas, perimeter fences or barriers create a pedestrian or wheelchair passage width of less than four (4) feet. Restaurants shall have an accessible path of travel through the dining area at least thirty-six (36) inches wide.
C. Outdoor food preparation shall not be allowed unless approved by the Board of Health in accordance with their procedures and regulations.
D. Approval of an outdoor dining area license shall not be construed as an approval of any other license or an approval for the alteration or extension of premises where alcoholic beverages are served. The serving or consumption of alcohol outside of premises duly licensed to serve alcohol is expressly prohibited unless approved by the City Council.
E. Due to the seasonal and temporary nature of an outdoor dining area, the seating within an outdoor dining area will not be considered an increase in the number of seats serving a restaurant and will not be counted toward any off-street parking requirement.
F. Application for outdoor dining area licenses shall be made to the City Council, with copies required to be submitted to the Building Inspector, Board of Health, Fire Department and Police Department for their review. Each application will include the name, address and telephone number of the restaurant owner, the proposed dates and times of operation, and a plan meeting the following requirements: a neatly drawn scaled plan and twelve (12) copies depicting the precise dimensions and location of the outdoor dining area; the arrangement of outdoor dining furniture, perimeter fencing, umbrellas and any other obstruction; and the width of sidewalk available for pedestrian and wheelchair passage. The plan shall also include a written description of the colors and materials to be used in the outdoor dining area. Photographs or samples of proposed furniture and materials shall be provided upon request of the City Council.
G. The licensee shall carry or require that there be carried workers compensation insurance for all employees and those of its contractors and/or subcontractors engaged in work at the dining facility, in accordance with the state workers compensation laws. The licensee shall, prior to the issuance of the license, furnish a certificate of insurance to the City evidencing coverage for workers compensation insurance. In addition, the licensee shall carry comprehensive public liability and property damage liability insurance and, if applicable, liquor liability insurance, to cover the licensee and its contractors and subcontractors against claims due to accidents which may occur or result from operations under the license. Such insurance shall cover the use of all equipment related to the provision of sidewalk dining services. The comprehensive general liability policy shall insure against all claims and demands for bodily injury and property damage with respect to the sidewalk dining facilities and services and shall be in such form and amount as determined by the City Council. The City shall be named as an additional insured in all policies for such insurance. The licensee (and their heirs, successors and assigns in interest) shall also agree to hold harmless, defend and indemnify the City of Peabody and its employees and agents from any responsibility, liability and claims arising out of or related to the operations under the license. Where such insurance is renewed or replaced, the licensee shall furnish the City with a certificate of insurance evidencing same.
5.4.7 Utilities
Underground utilities for new and redeveloped building are required unless physically restricted or blocked by existing underground obstructions.
5.4.8 Lighting
34
Site lighting, security lighting and architectural/landscape lighting should provide the user with illumination
levels appropriate for the designed activity (i.e. parking, walking, outdoor dining) while meeting minimum
requirements. Illumination levels should also be reasonably uniform throughout the site and strive to minimize
glare.
Provide adequate lighting levels in all pedestrian areas, including building entries, along walkways, parking areas,
and other public areas. Provide the following in lighting plans:
A. An overlapping pattern of light at a height of about 10-15 feet in lighted areas.
DO
DONT
B. Lighting at consistent lumens with a gradual transition to unlighted areas. Highly contrasting pools
of light and dark can be temporarily blinding and should be avoided.
C. In each lighted area, design lighting levels that will allow pedestrians to identify a face 15 yards away
(generally, a minimum of 4 foot-candles). Adequate lighting reduces anonymity and gives pedestrians
an opportunity to choose another route.
D. Adequate lighting at all building entrances, exits and corridors between buildings, at least 4 foot
candles during active use, especially where doors are recessed.
E. Confine site lighting to the project site; use shields or other methods to eliminate glare on adjacent
properties.
F. Place light posts and standards so that they do not create hazards for pedestrians or vehicles.
G. Indicate specific lighting levels in each lighted area.
5.4.9 Quality of site furnishings
Provide for the following site plan elements:
A. High-quality materials in site furnishings and features, such as durable and easily maintained walls
and paving.
B. Site features and furnishings that discourage vandalism. Furnishings that are easily removed or do
not convey an image of care invite misuse.
C. Safety materials, such as non-slip walkway surfaces
D. Recycled plastics or similar material are encouraged.

6.3 CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS
6.3.1 Definition: Single detached one-family dwellings may be constructed on certain lots in a cluster development in the following zones: R-1, R-1A, R-1B, R-2, R-3, and R-4 as hereinafter defined and limited, although such lots have less area or frontage, or both, than normally required. For this purpose, a cluster development is a division of not less than five (5) acres of land into lots used, or available for use as building sites, where said lots are clustered together and where there is provision of open space in common or public ownership. The City Council shall be the special permit granting authority for the cluster permit.
6.3.2 Purpose: The purposes of this provision of the ordinance allowing cluster developments are as follows:
A. To promote efficient subdivision of land, in harmony with its natural features and with minimal excavation and earth removal activities.
B. To preserve in their unaltered state unique or unusual natural features of the land to be developed especially where such features are not afforded protection under some other local, state or federal regulation or private deed restriction. Such natural features include but are not limited to: Scenic vistas and scenic road views; woodlands and site vegetation, especially where such natural vegetative cover serves to buffer new developments from established neighborhoods; slopes over 15% and
37
rock outcroppings; natural drainageways, stream banks, wetlands, and floodplains; aquifer recharge areas for public or private water supplies; wildlife habitat and vegetation, especially of rare or endangered species.
C. To provide suitable open space and facilities for active or passive recreation.
D. To provide open space as a buffer, where desirable and appropriate, between new developments and established neighboring uses.
E. To promote affordable housing in the city.

A. Maximum number of lots in a cluster development shall be determined by taking total land area of the subdivision, exclusive of existing and proposed roads and other land areas not available to the developer for building because of local, state, or federal regulations or private deed restrictions, and dividing by the minimum lot size of the underlying zoning district.
B. Every individual lot shall have frontage of at least one-half of the frontage required in the district or fifty (50) feet, whichever is greater, measured as hereinafter provided, except that any lot abutting an existing or proposed major or through secondary street (as defined in the planning board's subdivision regulations or indicated on said board's future street system plan) shall have frontage on such street no less than the amount normally required in the district.
C. Except as provided in Section 6.3.3.D and Section 6.3.3.E of this ordinance, the special permit granting authority shall have the right to waive up to 50% of the minimum requirements in the district for setbacks, side yards and rear yards upon review of the locations of each dwelling and accessory building on a cluster lot.
D. Special provisions for cluster lots abutting other property:
1. Purpose. The intent of the provision, below, is to provide for a minimum width of vegetated, unoccupied area, left in its natural state, between the periphery of a residential cluster and adjacent land uses. The purpose of this provision is to benefit both the cluster and noncluster landowners and land uses.
2. Provision. Individual lots in the cluster development which abut property that is not part of the cluster shall have as their setback dimension of their abutting yard(s) the same as that required in the district underlying the cluster development. If there is undeveloped intervening common land or public open space between said yard and the abutting property this area may be included in the required dimensional setback for the subject cluster. However, in no case can the sum of the lot setback and the width of the buffer, be less than that required for the district underlying the cluster, or thirty-five (35) feet, whichever is more.
E. Every individual lot in the cluster development shall have an area of at least two-thirds of the minimum area per dwelling unit required in the district, or six thousand six hundred (6,600) square feet (whichever is larger), the balance, if any remaining in common land. The special permit granting authority shall have the right to further waive minimum lot area requirements up to one-half (50%) of the minimum required in the district provided that all the following apply:
1. Such waivers result in a more efficient lot layout which affords protection of more natural features of the site or otherwise directly furthers the achievement of the purposes (Section 6.3.2) of this ordinance. When such a waiver is granted, a specific finding has to be made in the written decision of the special permit granting authority describing how such waiver complies with this provision of the ordinance; and
2. Such a waiver shall not increase the number of lots allowed in the cluster beyond the number allowed under Section 6.3.3.A of this ordinance; and
3. No lots smaller than six thousand (6,000) square feet are created by means of such a waiver.
F. The total area of common land within the development equals or exceeds the sum of the areas by
38
which any individual lots are reduced below the minimum lot area normally required in the district. The total area of common land may usually range from 20% to 50% of total land area within the development, exclusive of areas not available for development per Section 6.3.3.A.
G. All common land hereunder shall be held in common ownership by the owners of lots within the development. In the case of ownership by a separate legal entity, the developer shall include in the deed to the owners beneficial rights in said common land. Maintenance shall be the responsibility of the owners. A permanent conservation easement shall be conveyed to the City of Peabody prohibiting development of said common land and the erection thereof any structures other than for the noncommercial, recreational use of the residents of the cluster development. All common or public open space land shall have adequate access to a public way.
6.3.4 Review criteria: In reviewing the application for a special permit for a cluster development, the special permit granting authority shall consider the following in its decision.
A. The extent to which the plan for the cluster development is consistent with the purposes of this section of the ordinance.
B. The extent to which unique or environmentally important features of the development site, especially those not afforded protection under some other local, state or federal regulation as set forth in Section 6.3.2.B of this ordinance, have been adequately described in the site plan submitted with the special permit application and have been incorporated, to the maximum extent feasible, as permanent open space of the cluster.
C. Individual lots, buildings, and streets are designed and situated to minimize alteration of the natural site features and the need for excavation, cut and fill, or other types of earth moving operations.
D. That the location and quantity of any portion of the common land intended for active or passive recreational uses, as those uses may be set forth by the special permit granting authority, is adequate in terms of size, topography, drainage, public access, quality and other pertinent site characteristics.
E. The need for preservation of open space for scenic value shall be determined by the special permit granting authority based on its knowledge of the site of the proposed cluster development and comments received by the authority during the plan review and public hearing process. The special permit granting authority may impose restrictive covenants protecting such scenic areas or allowing access to such areas. The suitability of common land intended for scenic value shall be determined by the following criteria:
1. Its visibility from a significant number of buildings or length of private or public streets; or
2. The vistas such common land affords of significant or unusual:
a. Landforms,
b. Cityscapes,
c. Historical sites, or
d. Buildings.
F. The need for provisions of common land to act as an open space buffer, insulating existing developments from the cluster development, shall be determined by the special permit granting authority based on the purposes of this ordinance and upon its knowledge of the site and comments received during the plan review and public hearing process. The suitability of common land intended for such buffers shall be determined by the special permit granting authority based on its consideration of a variety of factors, including:
1. The viewing distance and slope between the new buildings of the proposed cluster and the existing buildings of abutting properties; and
2. The width and quality of intervening buffer land; and
3. The height of post development trees, shrubs, fences or other man-made screens all as proposed by the developer or as may be required by the special permit granting authority.

6.6 DESIGNATED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (DDD)
6.6.1 Purposes
The designated development district and uses created herein are intended to:
A. Encourage a regional node and cohesive community of compatible mixed uses including office, research and development and light manufacturing supported by hotels, restaurants, retail shopping, and recreational facilities within the designated development district.
B. Establish incentives to encourage desirable land uses and coordinated land assembly for development.
C. Reduce the number of regulations to a small set of essential standards for density, dimensions, and parking.
D. Establish design and development guidelines to clarify city goals, assist developers, and result in coordinated signage and lighting, compatible architecture, and site work throughout the district.
E. Establish development plan review to ensure quality and intent of proposed projects.
F. Establish site specific performance standards to regulate impacts to the carrying capacity of the land and municipal facilities.
6.6.2 Reviewing authority
The community development authority will be responsible for development plan review and approval in the designated development district. The community development department will serve as professional staff to the authority, assisting the authority in all informal project review (including the pre-application conference) and coordination of all comments and recommendations from city agencies, including the public services department, board of health, building inspection, conservation commission, planning board, fire chief and police chief.
Development of all buildings and site improvements will be in accordance with the design and development guidelines prepared and adopted by the community development authority. The guidelines may be amended as necessary by the authority. The objectives of the design standards are to obtain consistency and quality in design, to protect and enhance values in the district, and to provide a high quality development area that will contribute positively to land values and the environmental quality of the surrounding area and the City of Peabody. It is intended that a basic design compatibility and harmony will result among the district buildings and site work.
The design and development guidelines will be used by the community development authority to set conditions for development plan approval, and as a basis for granting project approval.
Applicants can anticipate the city's concerns and comments by careful review of the guidelines prior to development plan submittals.
The building inspector will withhold a building permit for the construction, alteration or moving of any building or structure until a final development plan is approved in compliance with these district regu-lations. The CDA approval does not relieve the applicant of any of the provisions of MGL Chapter 143.
6.6.3 Development plan review
A. Pre-application conference. An applicant seeking to obtain development plan approval should request a pre-application conference with the community development department prior to submitting an
42
application for preliminary development plan review. At the pre-application conference, the community development department will familiarize the applicant with the process for obtaining development plan approval and will explain to the applicant issues to be considered in planning the project.
At this conference, the applicant may present the community development department with basic data regarding the proposal, such as development program, map showing the important existing and man-made features in and around the site, and/or sketch plan showing the major features of the proposed development. This information will enable the applicant and the community development staff to discuss and clarify site-specific planning and process issues related to the project in an informal manner.
B. Preliminary development plan review. A preliminary development plan may be submitted for community development authority review during the early stages of the project, prior to the submission of a final development plan. The purpose of the preliminary development plan is to elicit comments and recommendations from city agencies during the schematic design phase in which the general scope, scale, and relationship of project components are illustrated. It is strongly recommended that a preliminary development plan be filed in every case in order to incorporate agency and community concerns, and to identify major digressions from the intent of the designated development district before significant financial resources are committed by the applicant.
The preliminary development plan submittal should be prepared at a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals forty (40) feet unless another scale is requested and found suitable by the planning or engineering department.

f. Functional relationships including entranceways, parking areas, service loading areas, and
43
open space;
g. Design objectives and environmental determinants;
h. Preliminary landscaping plan, including types and numbers of plants proposed, and other site amenities.
C. Final development plan review. A final development plan should be submitted for community development authority review during the design development phase of the project, in which the size and character of the entire project is fixed and described. The purpose of the final development plan review is to confirm that the intent of the proposed project as illustrated in the preliminary development plan is being carried out, and to confirm that the proposed project is in conformance with the intent and regulations of the designated development district.
The final development plan submittal should be prepared at a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals forty (40) feet by a registered land surveyor, and a registered architect, registered professional engineer, and/or registered landscape architect and should include the general information as specified under preliminary development plan review.
Architectural and site design and documentation should establish the final scope, relationship, form, size, and appearance of the project through:
1. Architectural plans, sections and elevations;

The city clerk will transmit a copy of the submittal package to the planning board, community development department, board of health, department of public services, conservation commission, police department, fire department, and community development authority.
The agencies receiving copies of the development plan should submit to the community development department written recommendations on the proposed project within fifteen (15) days of filing. Failure to comment will be deemed lack of objection.
Within thirty-five (35) days of the filing of the development plan, the community development department should submit to the community development authority, accompanied by the agency comments, a report discussing the feasibility of the project and its consistency with the purposes of the designated development district.
44
The community development authority should within sixty (60) days of filing certify in writing to the applicant that the application is approved as submitted or approved subject to modification. Failure to take action within the said sixty-day period will be deemed to be a grant of development plan approval unless an extension is requested by the applicant and such requests approved by the authority.
Final development plan approval granted under this section will lapse within two (2) yeas if a substantial use has not commenced or if construction has not begun. The community development authority may grant an extension for good cause, and should grant an extension if the delay has been caused on account of the need to obtain other local, state, and federal permits.

This does not include any supporting framework or bracing.
11.3.2 Calculation of Height
The height of a sign shall be calculated as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot be reasonably determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of the public street along which the lot has frontage or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower.
11.3.3 Calculation of Area of Façade
The area of a façade shall be calculated by means of the smallest rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the wall behind which the business or establishment is located.
11.4 GENERAL REGULATIONS APPLICABLE IN ALL ZONING DISTRICTS
All signs must meet the following restrictions regardless of zoning district.
11.4.1 Sign Location
Signs shall be located so as not to detract from a buildings architecture. A sign shall not be placed such that it covers the view of architectural elements such as cornices, columns, arches, details, or other such building features or ornamentation. Signs may not extend above the buildings roofline and/or the wall upon which the sign is located, and may not exceed maximum sign height. A business wall sign may only be placed on the building in which the advertised business resides.
111
11.4.2 Style and Design of Sign
Lettering, shape, and color employed in a sign shall be compatible with the form, color, and materials of the building that the sign identifies.1 Letters shall be carefully formed and properly spaced, to be neat and uncluttered. This section shall be used as a guide.
11.4.3 Signs for Different Businesses
Signs for different businesses within the same building, or for a collection of buildings that form a retail, commercial, or industrial center, shall be of similar style and design, but not necessarily the same color scheme.
11.4.4 Sign Message
A signs message should clearly and simply identify a business. A sign should include lettering and symbols to indicate such primary information as name, function and/or the address of a business. If space permits, secondary information may be included in the sign message. Secondary information may include but is not limited to: service or facility conducted on the premises, the year the business was established, a slogan, hours of operation, website address, and time and temperature, provided that the sign meets all requirements provided in this section.
11.4.5 Trademark
The use of pictorial symbols or logos is encouraged. However trademarks may occupy no more than 30% of the area of a sign, unless sale of the specific product is the major business conducted on the premises, in which case 100% of the sign can be occupied by the trademark.
11.4.6 Illumination
Signs may be illuminated either internally through the use of some sort of translucent materials with lights behind or with neon tubing or externally through mounting of incandescent or fluorescent lamps on the building directed at the sign, provided that the type of illumination employed does not distract from the buildings architecture and that the sign is not one specifically prohibited by section 11.8. Colored lighting, open flame, or bare bulbs shall not be used. All lighted signs shall be lighted by continuous light and contain a factory-applied label supplied to the manufacturer and controlled by an approved testing agency.
11.4.7 Nonconforming Signs
Any nonconforming temporary or permanent sign may continue as nonconforming until such time as the sign is altered in any way. However, upon change of use, removal, or closing of any commercial or industrial use, any nonconforming sign existing related to that use, either on the premises or off, shall be eliminated and new signs erected by a succeeding use shall be conforming.
11.4.8 Electronic Message Board Signs
1 It is important to note that color is often most effective when used simply. The use of too many colors on any sign is often confusing. The single most significant factor in sign color is often the degree of contrast between the sign message and the sign background.
112
All electronic message board signs, whether free standing or wall mounted, shall be approved by Special Permit. (AMENDED 09/12/2013)
Cross references-Projecting signs permit required, Code 3-1; construction of projecting signs, etc., to be in accordance with requirements of building inspector, Code 3-7; banners, flags, etc., not to be suspended across public ways without permit, Code 3-4.

Fees shall be based on fair market value of such expertise and shall be paid directly from applicants to the consulting expert unless otherwise established by the Planning Board at the meeting.
The Board may require the payment of the consultant fee at any point in its deliberations prior to a final decision. If a revolving fund for consultant expenses and fees is authorized by the Board, City Council, or by any general or special law, the applicants fee shall be put into such revolving fund, and the Board may draw upon that fund for specific consultant services approved by the Board at one of its public meetings. Any unused portion of the consultant fee shall be returned to the applicant unless the Board decides at a public meeting that additional services will be required.
The exercise of discretion by the Board in making its determination to require the payment of a consultant fee shall be based upon its reasonable finding that additional information available only through outside consultants is necessary to make an objective decision. Any applicant aggrieved by the imposition of, or size of, the consultant fee, or any act related thereto, may appeal according to the provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws.

PURPOSE
These subdivision regulations are adopted for the purpose of protecting the safety, convenience and welfare
of the inhabitants of the City of Peabody by "regulating the laying out and constructions of ways in
subdivisions providing access to the several lots therein, but which have not become public ways, and
ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions and in proper cases, parks and open areas". The powers of the
Peabody Planning Board and of the Board of Appeals under the Subdivision Control Law shall be exercised
with due regard for the provision of adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be
safe and convenient for travel; for lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent public ways; for
reducing danger of life and limb in the operation of motor vehicles; for securing safety in case of fire, flood,
panic and other emergencies; for insuring compliance with the applicable Zoning Ordinance; for securing
adequate provision for water, sewerage, drainage, underground utility services, fire, police and other similar
municipal equipment, and street lighting and other requirements where necessary in a subdivision; and for
coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other and with the public ways in the City and with the
ways in neighboring subdivisions.
It is the intent of the Subdivision Control Law (under which these regulations are adopted) that any
subdivision plan filed with the Peabody Planning Board shall receive the approval of such Board if said plan
conforms to the recommendation of the Board of Health and to the reasonable Rules and Regulations of the
Peabody Planning Board pertaining to subdivisions of land; provided, however, that such Board may, when
appropriate, waive, as provided for in Section 81-R, such portions of the Rules and Regulations as is
deemed advisable. (Section 81-M of Chapter 41, M.G.L.)

projects from which they were collected. Accrued interest may also be spent for this purpose. At
the completion of the Board's review and inspection of a project, any excess amount in the account,
including interest, attributable to a specific project, shall be repaid to the applicant or the applicant's
successor in interest. A final report of said account shall be made available to the applicant or the

Plan shall be as set forth in Chapter 41, Section 81-U of the Mass. General Laws, as
amended. The Board, after receiving the plan and profiles, will review the same to
determine whether they are in compliance with its Rules and Regulations and with the
Zoning Ordinance. Failure of the lots to comply with zoning shall be adequate grounds for
disapproval of the Definitive Plan.
The Peabody Planning Board may, by vote, extend the period permitted by statute between
submission of a Definitive Plan and action thereon upon written request of the applicant
(See Form Q, Extension of Time, Appendix Q). The Board may grant such extension of
time when:
a. The Developer wishes the opportunity to provide further information or redesign to

the reasons for its action and shall rescind such disapproval when the plan has been
amended to conform to the Rules and Regulations and recommendations of the Peabody
Planning Board.
Final approval, if granted, shall be subject to the construction specifications contained
herein and shall be endorsed on the original drawings of the Definitive Plan by the
signatures of a majority of the Peabody Planning Board after the City Clerk has notified the
Peabody Planning Board that no notice of appeal has been filed with that office.
After the Definitive Plan has been approved and endorsed, the Board shall return one
original to the applicant. The applicant in tum shall provide the Board with nine full sets of
the signed plans (dark line on white background contact prints).
Approval of the Definitive Plan does not constitute the laying out or acceptance by the City
of streets within a subdivision and does not signify that the subdivision may be constructed
before all safety and health standards have been met.
The original copy of the recorded covenant shall be returned, following recording, by the
Registry of Deeds, to the Peabody Planning Board. Upon receipt thereof, the Board will
mail a copy of said covenant to the applicant.

contingent on the completion of such improvements within two (2) years of the
date of the approval of the Definitive Plan.
The money may be forfeited or the term may be extended at the discretion of the
Peabody Planning Board. If extended, the Peabody Planning Board may, at its
discretion, request an increase or decrease of the amount deposited to insure
sufficient bonding to cover the costs to complete the improvements.
The applicant will file a construction bond for the total estimated amount, plus a
thirty (30%) percent contingency to complete construction. In addition, the
applicant will file a complete set of plans and specifications, with cross sections,
according to Massachusetts General Laws that would be used by the City for
public bid in case of default by the applicant. If the applicant does not file a
complete set of specifications the amount of the bond will be the total estimated
amount to complete the project, plus a one hundred (100%) percent contingency.
The contingency will cover city expenses to develop specifications, the public bid
process, and complete construction of the project. The contingency will also
include any work designated by the Peabody Municipal Light Plant and the

deposited, shall be accompanied by an appropriate and duly executed agreement
prepared in the manner of Form F, Performance Agreement, Appendix F, or such
other form as the Board may require, and approved as to form and manner of
execution by the City Solicitor and shall be contingent on the completion of such
improvements no later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of the
Irrevocable Letter of Credit.
In the event that the said improvements are not completed by the completion date
specified in the Performance Agreement (Form F), and no new Irrevocable Letter
23
of Credit has been issued in an amount then detennined by the Peabody Planning
Board to be sufficient to cover the cost of all or any part of the improvements then
remaining to be completed and not covered by a covenant under "b" hereof, then
said Irrevocable Letter of Credit shall be forfeited and shall become the sole
property of the City of Peabody as liquidated damages.
Such Irrevocable Letter of Credit shall be payable at sight upon receipt of an
attested copy of a vote of the Peabody Planning Board that said Irrevocable Letter
of Credit shall be forfeited. The Irrevocable Letter of Credit shall be subject to the

time to time, be reduced by the Peabody Planning Board and the obligations of the
parties thereto released in whole or in part. Upon the request of an applicant and
upon the approval by a majority of the Peabody Planning Board, the Board,
through its Chairman, may issue an estoppel letter to the drawer of the letter of
Credit that its obligation thereunder has been reduced as then determined by the
Peabody Planning Board to be sufficient to cover the improvements then
remaining to be completed.
The use of an Irrevocable Letter of Credit shall not relieve the applicant from the
maintenance bond requirement contained in Section II hereof. In the event that the
improvements have been completed but the maintenance bond has not been posted
by the thirtieth (3Qth) day prior to the expiration date of the Letter of Credit, then
such Letter of Credit may be forfeited upon the vote of a majority of the Peabody
Planning Board and the proceeds thereof held by the City of Peabody and used to
satisfy the maintenance bond requirements in accordance with the provisions of
Section II.
d. Off:.site Improvements
All off-site improvements must be completed prior to any construction within the
subdivided property. A cash bond or letter of credit covering all off-site
improvements plus a thirty percent (30%) contingency is to be posted prior to
construction. This bond may be reduced in all or in part as the off-!'!ite
improvements are constructed.
e. Damage Bond
Prior to any construction (on-site or off-site), the applicant shall post a bond with
the Planning Board to cover any and all on-site or off-site damages relating to the
subdivision. This bond shall be not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the total
project roadway costs including utilities. This fund may be used by the Planning
24
Board to repair, clean, and/or maintain any on-site or off-site conditions (whether
public or private property) relating to the subdivision, whether or not arising out of
reaction or inaction of the applicant, its contractors, agents, or assigns.
10. Reduction of Bond Surety
The amount of any deposit held under clause "9a" above may, from time to time, be
reduced by the Peabody Planning Board and the obligations of the parties thereto released
by said Board in whole or in part. If release is by reason of covenant, a new plan of the
portion to be subject to the covenant may be required by the Board.
11. Release of Performance Guarantee
Upon completion of improvements required and the submission of approved reproducible
"As Built" drawings under Section V, security for the performance of which was given by
Certified Check, or upon the performance of any covenant with respect to any lot, the
applicant may send by registered or certified mail to the City Clerk and the Peabody
Planning Board a written statement that the said construction or installation in connection
with which such certified check was posted has been completed in accordance with the
requirements contained under Section V; such statement to contain the address of the
applicant. If the Peabody Planning Board determines that said construction or installation
has been completed, it shall return to the person or persons who furnished same; or, in the
case of covenant, it shall issue a written release of the covenant on a properly executed
Form H, Release Form, Appendix H.
However, ten to twenty five percent (10% - 25%) of the construction costs of the
improvements specified in Section V pertaining to the subdivision shall be posted by the
applicant, or in the event surety was given pursuant to Section III.C.8.a., shall be retained
by the City to insure maintenance of the streets, easements and right of ways, and
municipal services for up to three (3) years after completion of construction and
installation, or until the streets are accepted by the City, whichever comes first; after which
date the City shall return the remainder of the bond, if any, to the applicant.
Approximately sixty (60) days before the expiration of the three (3) years, the Department
of Public Services shall inspect said street or way or portion thereof to determine whether
or not it should recommend the release of the remaining bond.
Upon expiration of the period for which the applicant is responsible for maintenance of
said way, and if said developer has complied with all the requirements of the Subdivision
Control Law and the Peabody Planning Board Rules and Regulations as set forth in an
inspection report of said way, any monies held by said Board for the maintenance of said
way shall be returned forthwith to the applicant.
Prior to releasing the City's interest in a performance bond or deposit or releasing the
covenant, the Peabody Planning Board shall receive from the applicant an Acceptance Plan
(See Paragraph 12).

If the Peabody Planning Board determines that said construction or installation has not
been completed, it shall specify to the applicant, in writing by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, the details wherein said construction and installation shall have
failed to comply with requirements contained under Section V. Upon failure of the
Peabody Planning Board to act on such application within forty five days (45) after the
receipt of the application by the City Clerk and the Peabody Planning Board, all obligations
under the bond shaJI cease and terminate by operation of law; and deposit shall be returned
and any such covenant shall become void.
In the event that said forty five ( 45) day period expires without such specifications or
without the release and return of the deposit or release of the covenant as aforesaid, the
City Clerk shaJI issue a certificate to such effect, duly acknowledged, which may be
recorded.
No lots in the subdivision may be released from the covenant until the Developer has
shown thaJ such lots are served by a paved way, granite curbing, a sidewalk, and that
utilities are in place and shown on an "As-Built" plan.
12. Acceptance by the Citv
The applicant shall file with the Peabody Planning Board a final plan (Acceptance Plan)
drawn with India Ink on tracing cloth (or another method suitable for reproduction) of
completed street or streets and any easements together with proper legal descriptions for
initiating the acceptance of the ways by the City Council (See Section V.A.8.), and upon
acceptance by the City shall grant a deed or easement to the City of the streets as contained
in the Definitive Plan; said deed or easement to be recorded by the City Clerk upon

a. All streets in the subdivision shall be designed so that: they will accommodate
pedestrian and vehicular traffic; they will allow satisfactory access for passenger,
emergency, sanitation, and other vehicles; they will drain naturally with no
drainage pockets; and they will obtain the maximum safety and amenity for future
residents of the subdivision.
b. The proposed streets shall compose a convenient system to ensure free circulation
of traffic throughout the entire roadway network.

as a condition of approval that such adequate access be provided by the developer,
and/or that the developer make physical improvements to and within such a way in
accordance with the provisions of these regulations from the boundary of the
subdivision to a public way.
d. Where the physical condition or width of a public way from which a subdivision
has its access is considered by the Board to be inadequate to carry the traffic
expected to be generated by such subdivision, the Board may require the developer
to dedicate a strip of land for the purpose of widening the abutting public way to a
width at least commensurate with that required within the subdivision, and to make
physical improvements to and within such public way to the same standards
required within the subdivision. Any such. work performed within such public way
shall be made only with permission of the governmental agency having jurisdiction
over such way, and all costs of any such widening or construction shall be borne
by the developer.
2. Location
a. The proposed streets shall conform in location, so far as practicable, to: any
existing plans of the Peabody Planning Board; to the Master Plan or parts thereof
adopted by the Peabody Planning Board; and, where required by the Peabody
