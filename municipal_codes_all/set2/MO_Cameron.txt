PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Cameron, Missouri of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1970 Code, as amended, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the city Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 4 is numbered 4-1 and the third section of Chapter 7 is 7-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 7-1 and 7-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 7-1.1, 7-1.2 and 7-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 4 and 5, it will be designated as Chapter 4.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Milt E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Robert L. Irvin, City Manager, and Mr. R. Michael Poland, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

State Law reference- Severability of statute provisions, RSMo 1.140. 
Sec. 1-8. - Supplementation of Code.

A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In the preparation of a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _______ to _______" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-9. - General penalty. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsections (b), (d), and (e) of this section, whenever in this Code or in any other ordinance of the city any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or whenever in such Code or in such other city ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or of any other ordinance of the city shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment for a period of not exceeding three (3) months or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
(b)  Whenever any provision of the Revised Statutes of Missouri or other statute of the state limits the authority of the city to punish the violation of any particular provision of this Code or other city ordinance to a fine of less amount than that provided in subsection (a) of this section or imprisonment for a shorter term than that provided in subsection (a) of this section, then the violation of such particular provision of this Code or other city ordinance shall be punished by the imposition of not more than the maximum fine or imprisonment so authorized or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
(c)  Each day any violation of this Code or any other city ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense, unless otherwise provided. 
(d)  Minor traffic violations. 
(1)  Minor traffic violations are defined in RSMo 479.350 and include traffic ordinance violations that do not involve an accident or injury, that do not involve the operation of a commercial vehicle, and for which no points are assessed by the department of revenue or the department of revenue is authorized to assess one (1) to four (4) points to a person's driving record upon conviction. Minor traffic violations include amended charges for any minor traffic violation. The definition of minor traffic violations does not include violations for exceeding the speed limit by more than nineteen (19) miles per hour or a violation occurring within a construction zone or a school zone. 
(2)  Fines. A person convicted of or who pled guilty to a minor traffic violation shall not be assessed a fine, if combined with the amount of court costs, totaling in excess of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) for a minor traffic violation. 
(e)  Municipal ordinance violations.

Sec. 3-174. - Payment of costs; insurance proceeds from damage or loss. 
(a)  Tax bills issued under section 3-172 of this article, shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the bill, the doing of the work and the liability of the property for the damages stated in the bill and shall be collected if default should occur by suit brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by the city counselor on behalf of the city. Judgment in any such suit shall be special and against the property owner and shall be satisfied by sale of the property or so much thereof as is necessary to satisfy the judgment and the costs of the sale or by any other means available under law or equity. 
(b)  If there are proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a covered claim payment made for damage or loss to a building or other structure caused by or arising out of any fire, explosion, or other casualty loss, and if the covered claim payment is in excess of fifty (50) percent of the face value of the policy covering a building or other structure, then the following procedure shall apply: 
(1)  The insurer shall withhold from the covered claim payment twenty-five (25) percent of the covered claim payment, and shall pay that amount to the city to deposit into an interest bearing account. Any named mortgagee on the insurance policy shall maintain priority over any obligation under this section. If a special tax bill or assessment is issued by the city for the expenses of demolition of such building as a dangerous building, the monies held by the city shall be applied toward payment of special tax bill or assessment. If there is any excess, it shall be paid by the city to the insured or as the terms of the policy, including any endorsement thereto, provide. 
(2)  The city shall release the proceeds and any interest which has accrued on such proceeds received under subsection (a) of this section to the insured or as the terms of the policy and endorsements thereto provide within thirty (30) days after receipt of such insurance monies unless the city has instituted legal proceedings under the provisions of this article. If the city has proceeded under this article, all monies in excess of that necessary to abate the nuisance and to comply with the provisions of sections 3-171 and 3-172 of this article for such abatement shall be paid to the insured. 
(3)  The city may certify that, in lieu of payment of all or part of the covered claim payment under this section, it has obtained satisfactory proof that the insured has or will remove debris and repair, rebuild or otherwise make the premises safe and secure. In this event, the city shall issue a certificate within thirty (30) days after receipt of proof to permit covered claim payment to the insured without deduction. It shall be the obligation of the insured or other person making the claim to provide the insurance company with the written certificate provided for in this subsection. 
(4)  No provision of this section shall be construed to make the city a party to any insurance contract. 
(c)  When the city takes bids from independent contractors for demolition of a building, bidders shall deduct any salvage value the materials in the building or structure may have from the cost of demolition in arriving at their bid amount. Should city employees do the demolition, the actual net cash received by the city from the salvaged materials shall be deducted from the special tax bill for such demolition. In no case will the net cost of demolition be increased in order to effect salvage of materials.

ARTICLE X. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE 
DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSES 

Sec. 3-221. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in RSMO 77.260 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Cameron, Missouri ordains as follows: 
(Ord. No. 5660, § 1, 4-19-11) 
Sec. 3-222. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of Cameron, Missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  General Causes of the Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 5660, § 1, 4-19-11) 
Sec. 3-223. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in division 1, section 3-222(1); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(b) by applying the provisions of this ordinance to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard. 
(Ord. No. 5660, § 1, 4-19-11) 
Secs. 3-224-3-234. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 3-235. - Lands to which ordinance applies. 
    This ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Cameron, Missouri identified as unnumbered A zones, on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Clinton County maps dated April 4, 2011 on map panels 29049C0025D, 29049C0050D, 29049C0125D, and 29049C0150D, as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this ordinance, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit, granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in division 4.

(Ord. No. 5660, § 1, 4-19-11) 
Sec. 3-239. - Interpretation. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 5660, § 1, 4-19-11)

Sec. 3-269. - Specific standards. 
(1)  In all areas of special flood hazard, once base flood elevation data is obtained, as set forth in article 4, section A(2), the following provisions are required: 
(a)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial-improvement of any residential structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above base flood level. 
[*The FEMA, Region VII office recommends elevating to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation to accommodate floodway conditions when the floodplain is fully developed.] 
(b)  Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial-improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in division 3, section 3-255(7)(c). 
[*The FEMA, Region VII office recommends elevating to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation to qualify for flood insurance rates based upon floodproofing.] 
(c)  Require, for all new construction and substantial-improvements, that fully enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
i.  A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and 
ii.  The bottom of all opening shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(3)  In all areas of special flood hazard, once floodway data is obtained, as set forth in division 4, section 268(2), the following provisions are required:

DIVISION II. - APPLICATIONS 

Sec. 4-131. - Adoption. 
    The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Policies and Guidelines for Application and Application Procedures are hereby adopted as fully set out herein and the city manager is hereby authorized to implement the following procedures and to make such additional changes and clarifications that shall be deemed advisable and in the best interest of city. 
(Ord. No. 4432, § 1, 7-16-96) 
Sec. 4-132. - General policy. 
(a)  It is the policy of the city to consider the use of TIF for those projects which demonstrate a public benefit by constructing public improvements in support of developments that will, by creating new jobs and retaining existing employment; eliminate blight, strengthen the employment and economic base of the city, increase property values and tax revenues, reduce poverty, create economic stability, upgrade older neighborhoods, facilitate economic self sufficiency, and implement the comprehensive plan and economic development strategy of city. 
(b)  Care will be exercised in the use of TIF to evaluate each TIF project to ensure that the benefits which will accrue from the approval of the project are appropriate for the costs which will result, and that they are equitable to the city as a whole. 
(Ord. No. 4432, § 1, 7-16-96) 
Sec. 4-133. - Policy guidelines. 
    The following criteria are to be used by the city's staff to evaluate TIF applications: 
(1)  Each TIF application must demonstrate that "but for" the use of TIF, the redevelopment area would not reasonably be anticipated to be developed. 
(2)  All TIF Applications requesting the issuance of bonds or notes will be required to demonstrate that the payments in lieu of taxes and/or the economic activity taxes expected to be generated by the TIF Project will be sufficient to provide a sufficient debt coverage factor as determined by the city in its sole discretion. This limitation shall not apply to infrastructure projects which involve the redevelopment of existing structures or the assembly and clearance of land upon which existing structures are located. 
(3)  In considering the total amount of TIF assistance to allocate for project costs for industrial, manufacturing, office, retail, commercial, and existing residential TIF applications, an evaluation of the amounts of TIF assistance as a percentage of the total project costs shall be made in order to determine whether the benefits which will accrue are appropriate for the costs. 
(4)  TIF will generally be reserved for projects for which the city deems TIF assistance to be the preferred method of economic development incentives. 
(5)  Each TIF Application must include evidence that the applicant: 
a.  Has the financial ability to complete and operate the TIF project. 
b.  Will contribute equity of at least fifteen (15) percent of the total cost of the project. Projects with equity contributions from the developer in excess of fifteen (15) percent will be viewed more favorably. 
c.  Has thoroughly explored alternative financing methods. 
(6)  The projected term of the TIF will be a factor, with shorter terms being viewed more favorably than longer terms. 
(7)  All TIF Applications must clearly comply with the requirements of the TIF statute. 
(8)  TIF applications which include the establishment of business areas, or the redevelopment of existing business areas, should include information as to the business type of the major tenants of the TIF area. In addition, a thorough market analysis should be completed which identifies: 
a.  The population areas that will be drawn from; and 
b.  The businesses of similar types which would be competing with the TIF area businesses. 
(9)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, TIF applications which do not meet any of the above-referenced criteria will be viewed favorably by the city if the application clearly demonstrates that the project is of vital interest to the city and will significantly assist the city in the elimination of blight, financing desirable public improvements, strengthening the employment and economic base of the city, increasing property values, reducing poverty, creating economic stability, upgrading older neighborhoods, or facilitating economic self sufficiency. Additionally, nothing herein shall prevent the city from approving a TIF project according to terms determined by the city in its sole discretion which terms and provisions satisfy the statutory requirement of the TIF statute. 
(Ord. No. 4432, § 1, 7-16-96) 
Sec. 4-134. - Accountability. 
    TIF Applications are expected to include the following: 
(1)  If the TIF application is being recommended based upon job creation criteria, language will be included in the TIF Redevelopment Plan which stipulates that the city's obligation to the developer may be reduced periodically if satisfactory evidence is not shown that the indicated number and quality of jobs have been generated. 
(2)  If businesses are to be relocated from other areas of the city, sufficient justification will be included to indicate why this relocation should be considered. 
(Ord. No. 4432, § 1, 7-16-96) 
Sec. 4-135. - Method of financing. 
    TIF applications may request that TIF assistance be provided in the form of special obligation bond or note financing. 
(Ord. No. 4432, § 1, 7-16-96) 
Sec. 4-136. - Certain economic activity taxes. 
    Only local option sales taxes will be considered for purposes of the tax increment derived from TIF economic activity taxes. Economic activity taxes shall not include utility franchise taxes collected either from private utilities or as payments in lieu of taxes from publicly owned utilities to the extent such exclusion is permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 4432, § 1, 7-16-96) 
Sec. 4-137. - Term. 
    The maximum period for which a TIF can be used is established by the TIF statute at twenty-three (23) years.

However, vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
b.  Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal shown alone or in combination with another indication may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.

b.  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 7-132, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown, and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Steady red indication. 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except as provided in subsection (3)b. of this section. 
b.  The driver of a vehicle which is stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience to a red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection, except that the state highways and transportation commission, with reference to an intersection involving a state highway, and local authorities, with reference to an intersection involving other highways under their jurisdiction, may prohibit any such right turn against a red signal at any intersection where safety conditions so require, and such prohibition shall be effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof. 
c.  Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in section 7-132, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway. 
(4)  Placement at other than intersection. If an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature can have no application.

(1)  Flashing red; stop signal. When a red lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(2)  Flashing yellow; caution signal. When a yellow lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution.

(a)  Driveway paving within the street right-of-way. Said portion of any driveway, constructed, reconstructed, or modified in any manner following the date of enactment of this section, which is located within the street or alley right-of-way (ROW), shall be permanent pavement. Portland cement concrete shall constitute permanent type of pavement. Permanent pavement shall extend at least from the edge of the improved surface of the street or alley, to the sidewalk, or to any other portion of the driveway within the public right-of-way. Driveways shall be well maintained to ensure that no damage to or deterioration of the public pavement is caused by the condition of a driveway. If a driveway connects with an unpaved street, road or alley, stabilized material of at least as high a standard as the roadway shall be required to the right-of-way line. 
(b)  Temporary access. Temporary access may be granted to underdeveloped/undeveloped property if access is needed for construction or preliminary site access. Temporary accesses are subject to removal, relocation, or re-design upon completion and for approval of final development plan, or construction is complete. Unimproved accesses and access modifications made without a permit shall be considered "temporary" and subject to the provisions of this section. 
(c)  Construction standards. All driveways shall meet the city's Standard Specifications for Street Construction and Construction Standards. Actual construction standards and related facility construction details for improvements, not specifically addressed assume the use of the latest version of the Kansas City Metropolitan Chapter of the American Public Works Association's Standard Specifications and Design Criteria. The city's Standard Specifications for Street Construction and Construction Standards may be updated periodically to incorporate new construction techniques, updated research and to meet local needs and conditions. For the purpose of all distance measurements, the flares are considered to be part of the driveway. 
(d)  Corner clearance. This is the distance between a driveway and an intersection. A minimum of forty (40) feet is required between the edge of the driveway and an intersecting corner on any street, measured from crossroads intersection at the edge of the street or back of curb, to the edge of the driveway. When these requirements cannot be met due to lack of frontage, the driveway may be located such that the driveway begins at the farthest property line, conditional upon meeting determined safety criteria. For the purpose of all distance measurements, the flares are considered to be part of the driveway. 
(e)  Driveway spacing. Driveways shall not be spaced closer than one hundred and fifty (150) feet, measured from the edge of the proposed driveway, to the edge of the adjacent driveways, except that each lot, or each property if not subdivided, shall be entitled to at least one (1) driveway.

Final size shall be determined by city staff at time of construction. 
(g)  Waivers. The director of public works may approve waivers from these access standards if he determines that the requested waiver will not create a serious detriment to the safety or operation of traffic on the street, roadway or alley. Factors determining waivers regarding the location, size, etc. of driveway access include but are not limited to: The characteristics of the proposed land use; the existing traffic flow conditions and the future traffic demand anticipated on the development and the adjacent street system; the location of the property; the size of the property; the orientation of structures on the site; the number and location of driveways on existing adjacent and opposite properties; the location and carrying capacity of intersections; the proper geometric design of driveways; the spacing between opposite and adjacent driveways; the internal circulation between driveways; and, the speed of the adjacent roadway. For the purpose of all distance measurements, the flares are considered to be part of the driveway. 
(h)  Street structures. No driveway shall interfere with municipal facilities such as streetlights or traffic signal poles, signs, fire hydrants, cross walks, bus loading zones, utility poles, fire alarm supports, drainage structures, or other necessary street structures. A minimum of two (2) feet is required between the edge of the driveway and any of the above listed structures. The public works director is authorized to order and effect the removal or reconstruction of any driveway, which is constructed in conflict with street structures. The cost of reconstructing or relocating such driveways shall be at the expense of the abutting property owner. 
(i)  Permits. No construction, grading, excavation, repair or reconstruction of any street, alley, curb or gutter, sidewalk, driveway, or any other type of work in the right-of-way shall commence without first obtaining a right-of-way permit from the city. A written right-of-way permit for a new development shall not be issued or required. Approval of driveway location and design for new properties and other developments on a building plan or site plan shall be considered the permit for driveway installation. 
(j)  That portion of a driveway within the street right-of-way shall be natural concrete gray tone in color and shall have a uniform, broom finish texture. No cobblestone, stamped or other irregular finish shall be permitted.

(3)  Centered on lot lines or entirely within the rear yards of a single row of lots or parcels. 
(4)  In each of the foregoing cases, a drainage easement with sufficient width to facilitate maintenance and design flow shall be provided and shown on the plat. 
a.  Whenever the plans call for the passage and/or storage of storm water runoff along lot lines, the grading of all such lots shall be prescribed and established for the passage and/or storage of waters, and no structure of vegetation which would obstruct the flow of storm water shall be allowed, nor shall any change be made to the prescribed grades and contours for the specified storm water channels. 
b.  All utility sewer manholes constructed in an area designed for the storage or passage of storm water, shall be provided with either a water-tight manhole cover or be constructed with a rim elevation of a minimum of one (1) foot above the high water elevation of the design storm. 
General design procedure for storage routing. 
(1)  Inflow hydrographs for all selected design storms. 
(2)  Stage-storage curve for proposed storage facility. 
(3)  Stage-discharge curve for all outlet control structures. 
Stage-storage curve. Stage storage curve defines the relationship between the depth of water and storage volume in a reservoir. 
Stage-discharge curve. A stage-discharge curve defines the relationship between the depth of water and the discharge or outflow from a storage facility: The stage-discharge curve should take into account the discharge characteristics of both the principal and emergency spillways. 
General procedure. 
Step 1: Compute inflow hydrograph for runoff from the fifty (50) percent, ten (10) percent, and one (1) percent design storms. Both pre- and post-development hydrographs are required for the fifty (50) percent and ten (10) percent design storms. Only the post-development hydrograph is required for runoff from the one (1) percent design storm. 
Step 2: Perform preliminary calculations to evaluate detention storage requirements for the hydrographs from step 1. If storage requirements are satisfied for runoff from the fifty (50) percent and ten (10) percent design storms, runoff from intermediate storms is assumed to be controlled. 
Step 3: Determine the physical dimensions necessary to hold the estimated volume from step 2, including freeboard. The maximum storage requirement calculated from step 2 should be used. From the selected shape determine the maximum depth in the pond. 
Step 4: Select the type of outlet and size the outlet structure. The estimated peak stage will occur for the estimated volume from step 2. The outlet structure should be sized to convey the allowable discharge at this stage. 
Step 5: Perform routing calculations using inflow hydrograph from step 1 to check the preliminary design using the storage routing equations. If the routed post-development peak discharges from the fifty (50) percent and ten (10) percent design storms exceed the pre-development peak discharges, or if the peak stage varies significantly from the estimated peak stage from step 4, then revise the estimated volume and return to step 3. 
Step 6: Consider emergency overflow from runoff due to the one (1) percent design storm and established freeboard requirements. 
Step 7: If necessary, evaluate the downstream effects of detention outflow to ensure that the routed hydrograph does not cause downstream flooding problems. The exit hydrograph from the storage facility may need to be routed through the downstream channel system to the confluence point to where the drainage area being analyzed represents ten (10) percent of the total drainage area. 
Step 8: Evaluate the control structure outlet velocity and provide channel bank stabilization if the velocity will cause erosion problems downstream. 
The ten (10) percent storm volume will determine the size of the pond while the fifty (50) percent storm peak control need will determine the size of a minimum outlet structure. Thus the pond is sized for the ten (10) percent storm. Then the fifty (50) percent storm is routed through the pond and the fifty (50) percent outlet structure is sized. 
(f)  Section 5609.8 required information for plan and profile sheets (supersedes). 
(1)  Calculate and label the total disturbed area and clearly identify all areas within the site which will be included in the land disturbing activities. 
(2)  An anticipated starting and completion date of the various stages of land disturbing activities and the expected date the final stabilization will be completed. 
(3)  At the discretion of the municipality, for all portions of the drainage system which are expected to carry between fifty (50) and one hundred fifty (150) cfs for the one (1) percent storm, show and label the one (1) percent plus one (1) foot flood elevation limits. The municipality may determine if one (1) of the following conditions exist. 
a.  The estimated runoff would create a hazard for adjacent property or residents. 
b.  The flood limits would be of such magnitude that adjacent residents should be informed of these limits. 
(4)  For all portions of the drainage system which are expected to carry one hundred fifty (150) cfs or more for the one (1) percent storm, the one (1) percent plus one (1) foot flood elevation analysis shall be completed and flood limits shall be shown on the storm water management plans. 
(5)  Restriction on easements shall include prohibiting all fences and structures which would interfere with access to the easement areas and/or the maintenance function of the drainage system. 
(6)  To improve the aesthetic aspects of the drainage system, a landscape plan for all portions of the drainage system shall be part of the storm water management plan. This landscape plan shall address the following: 
a.  Tree saving and planting plan. 
b.  Types of vegetation that will be used for stream bank stabilization, erosion control, sediment control, aesthetics and water quality improvement. 
c.  Any special requirements related to the landscaping of the drainage system and efforts necessary to preserve the natural aspects of the drainage system. 
(7)  To improve the water quality aspects of the drainage system, the storm water management plan shall include best management practices to control the water quality of the runoff during the land disturbing activities and during the life of the development. This requirement is in addition to the requirements of the department of natural resources storm water pollution prevention permit. 
(8)  The storm water management plans shall include all engineering calculations needed to design the system and associated structures including pre- and post-development velocities, peak rates of discharge, and inflow and outflow hydrographs of storm water runoff at all existing and proposed points of discharge from the site. 
(9)  If the storm water management plan and/or design report indicates that there may be a drainage or flooding problem at the exit to the proposed development or at any location between the exit point and the ten (10) percent downstream point, the municipality may require: 
a.  Water surface profiles plotted for the conditions of pre- and post-development for the ten (10) percent design storm; 
b.  Water surface profiles plotted for the conditions of pre- and post-development for the one (1) percent design storm; 
c.  Elevations of all structures potentially damaged by ten (10) percent and/or one (1) percent flows. 
(10)  The storm water management plan shall not be considered approved without the written documentation of approval by the City of Cameron Director of Public Works. The approval is solely an acknowledgement of satisfactory compliance with the requirements of these regulations. The approval does not constitute a representation or warranty to the applicant or any other person concerning the safety, appropriateness or effectiveness of any provision, or omission from the storm water management plan. 
(11)  Approved storm water management plans remain valid for two (2) years from the date of an approval. Extensions or renewals of the plan approvals will be granted by the municipality upon written request by the person responsible for the land disturbing activity. No fee will be assessed for extension or renewal, provided there are no changes to the approved storm water management plans, site conditions, or the storm water management code. 
(g)  Section 5101.4 designer qualifications (this replaces section 5101.4). The design and plan preparation for erosion control drawings and written sequence shall be completed by, or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer.

Secs. 10-258, 10-259. - Reserved. 
Sec. 10-260. - Plan water quality criteria. 
(a)  To improve the water quality aspects of the drainage system, the storm water management plan shall include best management practices to control the water quality of the runoff during the land disturbing activities and during the life of the development. This requirement is in addition to the requirements of the department of natural resources storm water pollution prevention permit. 
    Following are the criteria related to using storm water management facilities for water quality purposes. 
(b)  Ponds, lakes and reservoirs. 
(1)  When the land disturbing activity consists of the construction of a pond, lake or reservoir which is singly built and not part of a permitted land disturbing activity, the following procedures will apply: 
a.  A storm water management plan will not be required if the pond, lake or reservoir is permitted under the State Dams and Reservoirs Safety Act or has received a certificate of exemption from the State Dams and Reservoirs Safety Act. Best management practices should be used to minimize the impact of erosion and sediment. 
b.  A storm water management plan will be required for the construction of all ponds, lakes or reservoirs not meeting the conditions in subsection (b)(1)a., above, that otherwise meet the size requirements for storm water management plan approval. 
(2)  When ponds are used for water quality protection, the ponds shall be designed as both quantity and quality control structures. Sediment storage volume shall be calculated considering the clean out and maintenance schedules specified by the designer during the land disturbing activity. Sediment storage volumes may be predicted by the universal soil loss equation or methods acceptable to the municipality. 
(3)  Storm water runoff and drainage to a single outlet from land disturbing activities which disturb ten (10) acres or more shall be controlled during the land disturbing activity by a sediment basin where sufficient space and other factors allow these controls to be used until the final inspection. The sediment basin shall be designed and constructed to accommodate the anticipated sediment loading from the land-disturbing activity and meet a removal efficiency of eighty (80) percent suspended solids or one-half (0.5) ML/L peak settable solids concentration, whichever is less. The outfall device or system design shall take into account the total drainage area flowing through the disturbed area draining to the basin. 
(4)  Other practices may be acceptable to the municipality if they achieve an equivalent removal efficiency of eighty (80) percent for suspended solids or one-half (0.5) ML/L peak settable solids concentration, whichever is less. The efficiency shall be calculated for disturbed conditions for the ten-year 24-hour design storm event. 
(5)  Permanent water quality ponds having a permanent pool shall be designed to store and release the first one-half (1/2) inch of runoff from the site over a 24-hour period. The storage volume shall be designed to accommodate, at least, one-half (1/2) inch of runoff from the entire site. 
(6)  Permanent water quality ponds, not having a permanent pool, shall be designed to release the first inch of runoff from the site over a 24-hour period. 
(7)  The use of measures other than ponds to achieve water quality improvement are recommended on sites containing less than ten (10) disturbed acres. 
(c)  Infiltration practices. 
(1)  Permanent infiltration practices, when used, shall be designed to accept, at a minimum, the first inch of runoff from all impervious areas. 
(2)  Areas draining to infiltration practices must be established and vegetative filters established prior to runoff entering the system. Infiltration practices shall not be used if a suspended solids filter system does not accompany the practice. If vegetation is the intended filter, there shall be at least a 20-foot width of vegetative filter prior to storm water runoff entering the infiltration practice. 
(3)  The bottom of the infiltration practice shall be at least two (2) feet above the seasonal high water table, whether perched or regional, determined by direct piezometer measurements which can be demonstrated to be representative of the maximum height of the water table on an annual basis during years of normal precipitation, or by the depth in the soil at which mottling first occurs. 
(4)  The infiltration practice shall be designed to completely drain of water within seventy-two (72) hours. 
(5)  Soils must have adequate permeability to allow water to infiltrate. Infiltration practices are limited to soils having an infiltration rate of at least thirty-hundredths (0.30) inches per hour. Initial consideration will be based on a review of the appropriate soil survey, and the survey may serve as a basis for rejection. On-site soil borings and textural classifications must be accomplished to verify the actual site and seasonal high water table conditions when infiltration is to be utilized. 
(6)  Infiltration practice greater than three (3) feet deep shall be located at least ten (10) feet from basement walls. 
(7)  Infiltration practices designed to handle runoff from impervious parking areas shall be a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet from any public or private water supply well. 
(8)  The design of infiltration practice shall provide an overflow system with measures to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow along its length and at the outfall. 
(9)  The slope of the bottom of the infiltration practice shall not exceed five (5) percent. Also, the practice shall not be installed in fill material as piping along the fill/natural ground interface may cause slope failure. 
(10)  An infiltration practice shall not be installed on or atop a slope whose natural angle of incline exceeds twenty (20) percent. 
(11)  Clean outs will be provided, at a minimum, every one hundred (100) feet along the infiltration practice to allow for access and maintenance.

Sec. 10-261. - Professional registration requirements. 
    Storm water concept and storm water management plans and design reports that are incidental to the overall or ongoing site design shall be prepared, certified, and stamped/sealed by a qualified registered professional engineer, land surveyor or landscape architect, using acceptable engineering standards and practices. All other storm water concept and storm water management plans and design reports shall be prepared, certified, and stamped/sealed by a qualified registered professional engineer, using acceptable engineering standards and practices. 
    The engineer, surveyor, or landscape architect shall perform services only, in areas of his/her competence, and shall undertake to perform engineering or land surveying assignments only when qualified by education and/or experience in the specific technical field. In addition, the engineer, surveyor, or landscape architect must verify that the plans have been designed in accordance with this article and the standards and criteria stated or referred to in this article.

(Ord. No. 4571, 2-3-97) 
Sec. 10.5-23. - General guidelines and requirements. 
(a)  Purpose; goals. The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this article are to: 
(1)  Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; 
(2)  Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites; 
(3)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
(4)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and 
(5)  Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently. 
(b)  Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
(c)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the building/zoning officer an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one-quarter (1/4) mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The building/zoning officer may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority, provided, however that the building/zoning officer is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
(d)  Minimizing number of towers. Each applicant agrees to cooperate with the governing authority and other applicants hereunder to accomplish the purpose and goals of this article. 
(e)  Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this subsection 10.5-23(e) shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive those requirements if it determines that the goals of this article are better served thereby. 
(1)  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
(2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
(3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(4)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, building/zoning officer may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the use and enjoyment of surrounding and nearby property. 
(f)  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owners' expense. 
(g)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the building/zoning officer concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. 
(h)  Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas, provided, however, that the governing authority may reduce the standard setbacks and separation requirements if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby. 
(1)  Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower plus twenty (20) feet from any residential structure. 
(2)  Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
(3)  In zoning districts other than M-1 zoning districts, towers over ninety (90) feet in height shall not be located within one (1) mile from any existing tower that is over ninety (90) feet in height. 
(i)  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. 
(j)  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive such requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby. 
(1)  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential areas; standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four (4) feet wide on the residential side of the compound. 
(2)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer. 
(Ord. No. 4571, 2-3-97) 
Sec. 10.5-24. - Administrative approvals. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  The building/zoning officer may administratively approve the uses listed in this section provided that all such uses shall comply with section 10.5-23 of this article and all other applicable ordinances. 
(2)  Each applicant for administrative approval shall apply to the building/zoning officer, providing the information set forth in subsections 10.5-25 (b) and (d) of this article. 
(3)  The building/zoning officer shall respond to each such application within sixty (60) days after receiving it by either approving or denying the application. 
(4)  In connection with any such administrative approval, the building/zoning officer may, in order to encourage shared use, administratively adjust any zoning district setback requirements by up to ten (10) percent. 
(5)  If an administrative approval is denied, the applicant may appeal said denial in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance concerning appeals of administrative decisions. 
(b)  Specific administratively approved uses. The following uses may be approved by the building/zoning officer after conducting an administrative review: 
(1)  Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or antenna, in any M-1 zoning district; provided, however, that such tower shall be set back from any existing offsite residence a distance equal to the height of the tower plus twenty (20) feet; 
(2)  Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other freestanding nonresidential structure), so long as such addition does not add more than twenty (20) feet to the height of the existing structure; 
(3)  Installing an antenna on an existing tower of any height, including a preexisting tower and further including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as the addition of said antenna adds no more than twenty (20) feet to the height of said existing tower. 
(Ord. No. 4571, 2-3-97) 
Sec. 10.5-25. - Conditional use permits. 
(a)  General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of conditional use permits: 
(1)  If the tower or antenna is not permitted to be approved administratively pursuant to section 10.5-24, then a conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts. 
(2)  In granting a conditional use permit, the governing authority may impose conditions to the extent the governing authority concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. 
(3)  Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer. 
(b)  Information required. Each applicant shall submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information deemed by the governing authority to be necessary to assess compliance with this article. 
(c)  Factors considered in granting conditional use permits. The governing authority shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit, although the governing authority may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one (1) or more of these criteria if the governing authority concludes that the goals of this article are better served thereby. 
(1)  Height of the proposed tower; 
(2)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
(3)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
(4)  Surrounding topography; 
(5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
(6)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
(7)  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
(8)  Availability of suitable existing towers and others structures as discussed in subsection 10.5-255(d). 
(d)  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures.

    No water service meter shall be allowed in service which has an incorrect gear ratio or dial train or is mechanically defective or shows an error in measurement in excess of five (5) percent when registering water at stream flow equivalent to approximately one-tenth and full normal rating under the average service pressure. When adjustment is necessary, such adjustment shall be made as accurately as practical for average rate of flow under actual conditions of installation. Tests for accuracy shall be made with a suitable testing device in accordance with the best modern water meter practice and at rates of flow which properly will reflect the accuracy of meters over each meter's range of minimum to maximum flow. 
(Code 1970, § 24-62) 
Sec. 12-120. - Adjustment of bills for defective meters. 
    If on test of any water meter by the city, such meter shall be found to have a percentage of error greater than five (5) percent, the following provisions for the adjustment of bills shall be observed: 
(1)  Fast meters. When a meter is found to have a positive average error, i.e., is fast, in tests made at the request of the customer, the city shall refund to the customer an amount equal to the excess charged for the water incorrectly metered for a period equal to one-half of the time elapsed since the previous test but not to exceed six (6) months. No part of the minimum charge shall be refunded. 
(2)  Slow meters. When a meter is found to have a negative average error, i.e., is slow, in tests made at the request of the customer, the city may make a charge to the customer for the water incorrectly metered for a period equal to one-half of the time elapsed since the previous test but not to exceed six (6) months. If a meter is found not to register for any period, the city shall estimate the charge for the water used by averaging the amounts registered over similar periods preceding or subsequent thereto or over corresponding periods in previous years.

(b)  No connections shall be installed or maintained whereby an auxiliary water supply may enter a public potable or customer's water system unless such auxiliary water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the city and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. 
(c)  No water service connection shall be installed or maintained to any premises in which the plumbing system, facilities, and fixtures have not been constructed and installed using acceptable plumbing practices considered by the city as necessary for the protection of health and safety. 
(Ord. No. 3977, § 2, 8-21-90) 
Sec. 12-168.4. - Survey and investigations. 
(a)  The customer's premises shall be open at all reasonable times to the city or its authorized representative for the conduction of surveys and investigations of water use practices within the customer's premises to determine whether there are actual or potential cross connections to the customer's water system through which contaminants or pollutants could backflow into the public potable water system. 
(b)  On request by the city or its authorized representative, the customer shall furnish information on water use practices within his premises. 
(c)  It shall be the responsibility of the water customer to conduct periodic surveys of water use practices on his premises to determine whether there are actual or potential cross connections to his water system through which contaminants or pollutants could backflow into his or the public potable water system. 
(Ord. No. 3977, § 2, 8-21-90) 
Sec. 12-168.5. - Type of protection required. 
    The type of protection required by this division shall depend on the degree of hazard which exists, as follows: 
(a)  An approved air gap separation shall be installed where the public potable water system may be contaminated with substances that could cause a severe health hazard. 
(b)  An approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principal backflow prevention device shall be installed where the public potable water system may be contaminated with a substance that could cause a system or health hazard. 
(c)  An approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principal backflow prevention device or an approved double check valve assembly shall be installed where the public potable water system may be polluted with substances that could cause a pollution hazard not dangerous to health. 
(Ord. No. 3977, § 2, 8-21-90) 
Sec. 12-168.6. - Where protection is required.

all other applicable regulations and standards as established as part of the
City Code, including, but not limited to, building codes, zoning requirements,

2. Non-Conforming Uses:
A. The lawful use of a building existing on February 21, 1966 may be continued,
although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter.
Whenever a non-conforming use has been changed to a conforming use,
such use shall not thereafter be changed to a non-conforming use.
B. The lawful use of land, open storage and junkyards in any district and
advertising signs and bulletin boards in any R district which do not conform
to the provisions of this Chapter shall be discontinued within three (3) years
from date the ordinance is adopted. The use of land, signs and bulletin
boards which become non-conforming by reason of a subsequent change in
this Article shall also be discontinued within three (3) years from the date of
the change.
3. Conditions: The following conditions shall govern the continuance of nonconforming
uses:
A. Non conforming use shall not be enlarged, increased, extended or moved
unless the use is changed to one permitted pursuant to the provisions of this
ordinance.
B. Whenever the use of a building becomes non-conforming through a change in
this Chapter or district boundaries, such use may be continued. A nonconforming
use shall not be changed except to a use permitted under the
applicable district regulations.
C. In the event that a non-conforming use of any building or premises is
discontinued or its normal operation stopped, for a period of one (1) year, the
use of the same shall thereafter conform to the use regulations in the district
in which it is located.
D. A non-conforming use occupying only a portion of a building may be extended
throughout the building, if the building has been lawfully acquired and actually
devoted to such use previous to the adoption of this ordinance or to any
affecting amendments thereof.
E. No building or premises devoted to a use not permitted by this Chapter in the
district in which such building or premises is located, except when required to

replacement cost, it may be restored if the Board of Adjustment finds some
compelling necessity requiring the continuance of the non-conforming use and the

monopoly. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide such calculation
estimates, or other evidence necessary to determine the replacement cost.

1 Updated September 5, 2000
ARTICLE 28. BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT
1. General: The Board of Adjustment is primarily a quasi-judicial body rather than an
advisory or legislative one. Its role in zoning administration is specifically limited to
two types of tasks:
A. The appeal of an administrative decision or interpretation.
B. The granting of variances for cases of hardship.
In the first case, the responsibility of the Board of Adjustment is to rule on the
interpretation of the zoning regulations whenever there is an ambiguous provision or an
alleged error. Variances are granted for unusual physical constraints, and the role of
the Board of Adjustment is to determine if a variance should be granted in a manner
which is consistent with the intent of the zoning ordinance and fair to the applicants.
The Board of Adjustment is not involved in administering the subdivision regulations.
2. Establishment, Composition and Operation of Board of Adjustment:
A. A Board of Adjustment is hereby established and is composed of five (5)
citizen-members, all of whom shall be appointed by the Mayor and approved
by the City Council and shall include a member of the Planning and Zoning
Commission and four (4) citizens of the City of Cameron.
B. The term of office for citizen-members of the Board of Adjustment shall be for
five (5) years; except that the membership of the first Board of Adjustment
appointed shall serve respectively for terms of one (1) for one year, one (1)
for two (2) years, one (1) for three (3) years, one for four (4) years, and one
(1) for five (5) years. Thereafter, citizen-members shall be appointed for
terms of five (5) years each. Three (3) alternate members may be appointed
to serve in the absence or disqualification of the regular members. Vacancies
shall be filled for the unexpired term only. Members and alternates shall be
removed for cause by the Mayor and City Council upon written charges and
after public hearing.
3. Election and Term of Officer, Promulgation of Rules and Regulations: The
Board of Adjustment shall elect its own chairman and vice-chairman who shall
serve for one (1) year. The Board of Adjustment shall adopt from time to time
such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary to carry into effect the
provisions of this chapter.
4. Meetings and Records: Meetings of the Board of Adjustment shall be held at
the call of the Chairman and at such other times as the Board may determine.
Such Chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths
and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board of
Adjustment shall be open to the public. The Board of Adjustment shall keep
Article 28
2 Updated September 5, 2000
minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each
question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep
records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be
immediately filed in the office of the Board of Adjustment and shall be a public
record.
5. Appeals to Board:
A. Appeals to the Board of Adjustment on any matter over which the Board is
specifically granted jurisdiction in this chapter may be taken by any person
aggrieved, or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the City affected
by any decision of the Building/Zoning Officer. Such appeal shall be taken
within thirty (30) days of such decision by filing with the Building/Zoning
Officer and with the Board of Adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the
grounds thereof. The Building/Zoning Officer shall forthwith transmit to the
Board of Adjustment all the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from is taken.
B. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the Building/Zoning Officer certifies to the Board of Adjustment after
the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts
stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to
life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than
by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment, or
by a court of record on application or notice to the Building/Zoning Officer and
on due cause shown.
C. The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the
appeal, give not less than ten (10) days notice thereof in a newspaper of
general circulation, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide
the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may appear
in person or by agent or by attorney.
D. The Zoning Officer shall place a sign, not less than three (3) square feet per
face, upon the front yard, or as close as practicable thereto, of the subject
property. Said sign shall contain the message Zoning Action Pending; shall
show the telephone number of City offices; and shall be placed not less than
ten (10) days prior to the public hearing. Unauthorized removal, damage, or
vandalism to said sign shall not invalidate the notification provision of this
article.
6. Powers Generally: The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
A. Powers Relative to Errors: To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Building/Zoning Officer in the enforcement of this chapter.
Article 28
3 Updated September 5, 2000
B. Powers Relative to Variations: When, by reason of exceptional
narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property on date
ordinance is adopted, or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions or
other extraordinary or exceptional situation or conditions of a specific piece of
property, which condition is not generally prevalent in the neighborhood, the
strict application of the area regulations of this chapter would result in peculiar
and exceptional practical difficulties or exceptional and undue hardship upon
the owner of such property, the Board of Adjustment is hereby empowered to
authorize, upon an appeal relating to such property, a variation from such
strict application so as to relieve such difficulty or hardships.
C. Powers Relative to Exceptions: Upon appeal, the Board of Adjustment is
hereby empowered to permit the following exceptions:
1) To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot of record in single ownership.
2) To permit the reconstruction of a non-conforming building which has
been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God or the public enemy, to
the assessed value when the Board of Adjustment shall find some
compelling public necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming
use, but in no case shall such a permit be issued if its
primary function is to continue a monopoly.
3) To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises in
any location for a public service corporation or for public utilities
service.
4) To add to the permitted uses in the C Commercial and M Industrial
Districts when the Board of Adjustment has determined that a use is
comparable to those already permitted in such district.
5) To interpret the provision of this Chapter where the street layout
actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the
district map.
6) To vary parking regulations of this Chapter whenever the character of
use of the building is such as to make unnecessary the full provisions
of parking facilities or when such regulations would impose an
unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted with
merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
7. Actions Authorized on Appeal: In exercising the powers specified in this Article,
the Board of Adjustment may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
Article 28
4 Updated September 5, 2000
determination appealed from and make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made and to that end shall have all the powers of the
officer from whom the appeal is taken. In considering all appeals to this chapter, the
Board of Adjustment shall, before making a finding in a specific case, first determine
that the proposed change will not constitute a change in the district map and will not
impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, increase congestion
in public streets, increase the danger of fire, materially diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area or in any other respect impair the public
health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the City. Every change granted or
denied by the Board of Adjustment shall be accompanied by a written finding of fact
based on sworn testimony and evidence specifying the reason for granting or
denying the variation. The decision of the Board of Adjustment shall be made a part
of any building permit in which variation is allowed.
8. Vote Necessary to Take Actions: The concurring vote of four (4) members of the
Board of Adjustment shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision
or determination of the Building/Zoning Officer to decide in favor of the applicant on
any matter upon which is it required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any
variation in this chapter.
9. Appeals from Board of Adjustment Departments, etc.
A. Any person jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the Board of
Adjustment or of any officer, department, board or bureau of the City may
present to the Circuit Court of the County having jurisdiction a petition, duly
verified, stating that such decision is illegal in whole or in part, specifying the
grounds of the illegality and asking for relief therefrom. Such petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in
the office of the Board of Adjustment.
B. Upon the presentation of such petition, the court may allow a writ of certiorari
directed to the Board of Adjustment for review of the data and records acted
upon or it may appoint a referee to take additional evidence in the case. The
court may reverse or affirm or may modify the decision brought up for review.
C. Costs shall not be allowed against the Board of Adjustment, unless it shall
appear to the court that it acted with gross negligence or in bad faith or with
malice in making the decision appealed from.

least disruptive to the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties. These regulations
are further intended to require that adult entertainment establishments shall not be
permitted to locate in such concentration that their operational features may
establish the dominant character of any commercial or industrial area.
These regulations are further intended to protect and balance lawful rights of
expression which other lawful rights to the enjoyment and use of property. Adult
entertainment uses are recognized as having serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly if several such uses are concentrated, thereby having a
deleterious effect upon adjacent areas, and could contribute to blight and
degradation of the surrounding neighborhood. The special regulation of adult
entertainment establishments is necessary to ensure that the adverse affect of such
uses will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of surrounding
neighborhoods whether residential or on-residential by location or concentration and
to ensure the stability of such neighborhoods.

made of land or water within any zone established by this Ordinance in such a manner as
to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication
between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport
lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in
the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or
interfere with the landing, take-off, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the
airport.
A. Marking and Lighting of an Existing Nonconforming Structure Or Tree:
Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this Section, the owner of any existing
nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation,
operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed
necessary by the Governing Body to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity
of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall
be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of the appropriate governing
body, agency, or owner.
6. Permits:
Article 34
5 Created 3/1/2010 Ordinance 5576
A. Future Uses: Except as specifically provided in 6.A.1), 6.A.2) and 6.A.3) hereunder,
no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or
otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a
permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a
permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree
would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the
affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the
provisions of this Ordinance shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in
accordance with section 6.D.
1) In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no
permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or
topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits
prescribed for such zones.
2) In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones but at a horizontal distance
of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be
required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the
height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
3) In the area lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of
the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree
or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would
extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or
intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree
in excess of any of the height limits established by this Ordinance.
B. Existing Uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or
creation of any obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to
become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this
Ordinance or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit
is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
C. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed: Whenever the Governing Body
determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than
80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted
that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or
otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
Article 34
6 Created 3/1/2010 Ordinance 5576
D. Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or
permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations
prescribed in this ordinance, may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance
from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a
determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the
proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of
navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a
literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary
hardship, and that relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not
create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justices, and will be in
accordance with the spirit of this Ordinance. Additionally, no application for variance
to the requirements of this Ordinance may be considered by the Board of Adjustment
unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Governing Body for advice
as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Governing Body does not respond
to the application within 15 days after receipt, the Board of Adjustment may act on its
own to grant or deny said application.
E. Obstruction Marking and Lighting: Any permit or variance granted may be so
conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install,
operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be
necessary. If deemed proper by the Governing Body, this condition may be modified
to require the owner to permit the County, at its own expense, to install, operate, and
maintain the necessary markings and lights.
