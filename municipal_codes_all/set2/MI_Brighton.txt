PREFACE 
    This Code, as originally published, constituted a complete recodification of the ordinances of the Township of Brighton of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Code, as supplemented through March, 2000, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the township board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Compiled Ordinance General Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    This 2012 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. No. 239, and was accomplished under the supervision of Zanne Ebersole, Editor, and Aline True, Quality Control Specialist. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the tenth section of Chapter 22 is 22-10. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 7-4 and 7-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 7-4.1, 7-4.2 and 7-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 11 and 12, it will be designated as Chapter 11.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The original publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Allen Z. Paul, Supervising Editor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ann Bollin, Township Clerk and John Harris, Township Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active 
law of the township readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the township's affairs.

    and all such ordinances are hereby recognized as continuing in full force and effect to the same extent as if set out at length in this Code. Such ordinances are on file in the township clerk's office.

Sec. 1-7. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)	By contract or by township personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the township board. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)	In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)	When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code.

Sec. 1-8. - Severability. 
    Should any provision or section of this Code be held unconstitutional or invalid, such holding shall not be construed as affecting the validity of any of the remaining provisions or sections, it being the intent of the township board that this Code shall stand, notwithstanding the invalidity of any provision or section thereof. The provisions of this section shall apply to the amendment of any section of this Code, whether or not the wording of this section is set forth in the amendatory ordinance. 
Sec. 1-9. - General penalties and sanctions for violations of Code and township ordinances; continuing violations; injunctive relief. 
(a)	Unless a violation of this Code or any ordinance of the township is specifically designated in this Code or within any ordinance as a municipal civil infraction, the violation shall be deemed to be a misdemeanor. 
(b)	The penalty for a misdemeanor violation shall be a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) (plus costs of prosecution) or imprisonment not exceeding ninety (90) days or both, unless a specific penalty is otherwise provided for the violation by this Code or any ordinance.

a.	Committed by a person within any six-month period (unless some other period is specifically provided by this Code or any ordinance); and 
b.	For which the person admits responsibility or is determined to be responsible. Unless otherwise specifically provided by this Code or any ordinance for a particular municipal civil infraction violation, the increased fine for a repeat offense shall be as follows: 
1.	The fine for any offense which is a first repeat offense shall be not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), plus costs. 
2.	The fine for any offense which is a second repeat offense or any subsequent repeat offense shall be not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00), plus costs. 
(d)	A "violation" includes any act which is prohibited or made or declared to be unlawful or an offense by this Code or any ordinance; and any omission or failure to act where the act is required by this Code or any ordinance. 
(e)	Each day on which any violation of this Code or any ordinance continues constitutes a separate offense and shall be subject to penalties or sanctions as a separate offense. 
(f)	In addition to any remedies available at law, the township may bring an action for an injunction or other process against a person to restrain, prevent or abate any violation of this Code or any township ordinance.

ARTICLE IV. - ELECTRIC AND GAS SUPPLY FRANCHISE 

Sec. 7-100. - Scope, purpose and intent. 
(a)	Pursuant to section 29 of article 7 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, use of the highways, streets, alleys and other public places for operation of a public utility requires the consent of the township and the transaction of local business in the township by public utility requires that a franchise first be obtained.

Secs. 17-53-17-65. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - DESIGN LAYOUT STANDARDS 

Sec. 17-66. - Guide for applicants. 
    The subdivision design layout standards set forth under this division are development guides for the assistance of the applicant. All final plans must be reviewed and approved by the township board. 
(Ord. No. 238, 7-2-07, eff. 7-24-07)
Sec. 17-67. - Streets. 
    Streets shall conform to at least all minimum requirements of the general specifications and typical cross sections as set forth in this division, and other conditions set forth by the township board and the Livingston County road commission. 
(1)	Location and arrangement. 
a.	The proposed subdivision shall conform to the various elements of the master plan and shall be considered in relation to the existing and planned major thoroughfares and collector streets, and such part shall be platted in the location and the width indicated on such plan. 
b.	The street layout shall provide for continuation of collector streets in the adjoining subdivisions or of the proper projection of streets when adjoining property is not subdivided; or conform to a plan for a neighborhood unit drawn up and adopted by the planning commission. Where adjoining vacant areas are zoned or planned for development similar to the proposed subdivision, streets shall be extended to the boundary line of the tract to make provision for the future street connections. The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed stub street is in a reasonable location for extension into the adjacent lands, in consideration of such factors as grades, water bodies, wetlands and lot configuration. A temporary cul-de-sac shall be provided unless the length of the stub street only abuts one (1) lot on either side. Temporary cul-de-sacs are required by the LCRC at all dead ends and must be in a dedicated right-of-way. A sign shall be placed at the end of the stub street or cul-de-sac with a sign face on both sides stating "Future Street Extension." Stub roads for future road extensions shall be improved to the parcel line. 
c.	The street layout shall include minor streets so laid out that their use by through traffic shall be discouraged, except where a continuation of streets to adjoining properties is deemed desirable by the township. In determining the need for such connections, the township shall consider the need for adequate access and response time for emergency vehicles, the impacts such connections may have on reducing congestion along arterials, the projected traffic volumes and the compatibility with adjacent developments. 
d.	Streets shall be aligned to maximize the preservation of natural features and existing grades to the extent feasible. Streets should follow natural topography to minimize grading. 
e.	Should a proposed subdivision border on or contain an existing or proposed major thoroughfare, the planning commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation and reduction of traffic hazards. 
f.	Should a proposed subdivision border on or contain a railroad, expressway, or other limited access highway right-of-way, the planning commission may require the location of a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the development of an appropriate use of the intervening land such as for parks in residential districts. Such distances shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for approach grades to future grade separation. 
g.	Half streets shall be prohibited, except where absolutely essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, and where the planning commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is developed. Wherever there exists adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, a dedicated or platted and recorded half street, the other half shall be platted. 
h.	Where a subdivision incorporates existing public streets or private roads that are not in conformance with current standards, such facilities shall be reconstructed as necessary to improve the road to the extent required by the Livingston County road commission for public roads. 
(2)	Right-of-way widths. Street right-of-way widths shall conform to at least the following minimum requirements: 
Street Type Right-of-Way Widths Major thoroughfareIn conformance with the standards of the Livingston County Road Commission and the Master Rights-of-Way plan, but at least a minimum of 66 feet. Collector streets86 feetIndustrial service streets
Multiple-family residential streets where platted
Minor (single-family residential) streets66 feetMarginal access streets50 feetTurnaround (loop) street120 feetAlley26 feetCul-de-sac streets, turnarounds-Industrial75-foot radius (or as approved by the Brighton Fire Department)Cul-de-sac streets, turnarounds-Residential and others75-foot radius (or as approved by the Brighton Fire Department) 
(3)	Street pavement widths. All newly constructed streets shall comply with the standards listed below. The township board may allow a reduction in these standards subject to approval by the Livingston County road commission. 
Street Type Pavement Width

(measured from back-to-back of curb) Major ThoroughfareIAW standards and specifications of the LCRC. This width is generally a minimum of 31 feet. Collector Streets31 feetIndustrial and Commercial Streets30 feetMultiple-Family Residential Streets30 feetLocal Residential Streets31 feetLocal Residential Streets with lots greater than two (2) acres and open ditch drainage22 feet with two four-foot shouldersMarginal Access Streets30 feetTurn-around (Loop) StreetsNot less than 80 feet in diameter at terminating loop-36 feet wide pavementAlley20 feetCul-de-sac Streets Turn-arounds54-foot radius with curb and gutter (or as approved by the Brighton Fire Department) 
(4)	Cul-de-sac length. Maximum length for residential cul-de-sac streets shall generally be seven hundred fifty (750) feet measured from the centerline of the street to the center point of the cul-de-sac, unless a longer street is necessitated by topography or other natural features, existing conditions or other circumstances as may be approved by the township board, based upon recommendation of planning commission, the fire department, the township engineer, and the Livingston County road commission. In all cases, however, at least two (2) means of access shall be provided to serve a cul-de-sac having more than twenty (20) single family lots or uses which would result in more than two hundred (200) trips per average weekday, based on the most recent edition of Trip Generation, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. In no case shall a dead end street be permitted. A temporary cul-de-sac may be utilized for a stub street where future access to an adjacent site is planned. 
(5)	Street grades. For adequate drainage, the minimum street grade shall not be less than one-half (0.5) percent. The maximum street grade shall be five (5) percent. In extraordinary circumstances a grade more extreme may be permitted where it will minimize the need for grading and tree removal, with approval of the Livingston County road commission. 
(6)	Curb and gutter. All roads shall be constructed with curb and gutters, in accordance with details and specifications prescribed by the Livingston County road commission. Roadways with gravel shoulders and open ditch drainage may be permitted for developments with lots greater than two (2) acres, with approval from the township board and the Livingston County road commission. 
(7)	Street geometrics. Standards for maximum and minimum street grades, vertical and horizontal street curves and sight distances shall be established by the Livingston County road commission. 
(8)	Street intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible to ninety (90) degrees. Curved streets, intersecting with major thoroughfares and collector thoroughfares shall do so with a tangent section of centerline fifty (50) feet in length, measured from the right-of-way line of the major or collector thoroughfare. 
(9)	Grading and centerline gradients. Per plans and profiles approved by the Livingston County road commission. 
(10)	Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided. Block lengths shall not be less than two hundred fifty (250) feet for safety reasons per the LCRC. 
(11)	Spacing of intersections along major thoroughfares. Streets intersecting along major thoroughfares shall be spaced at least three hundred (300) feet from the intersection of another platted street on the same side of the street, and spaced at least six hundred sixty (660) feet where possible. In addition, streets crossing major thoroughfares shall cross in direct alignment. Where direct alignment is not possible, streets on opposite sides of a major thoroughfare shall be off-set no less than three hundred (300) feet to each other, unless the planning commission and township board determine that a lesser offset is justified because of numerous existing streets or the difficulty of providing adequate site distance with a different alignment. For streets which will potentially have average daily traffic volumes of over two thousand (2,000) trips during an average day or two hundred (200) trips during a peak hour, major entrances should be limited to the half mile or quarter mile points along major thoroughfares where there is potential for traffic signalization in the future. Deviations from this standard shall be permitted if needed to provide adequate sight distance or if a modification is supported by a traffic impact study provided by the applicant. 
(12)	Acceleration-deceleration lanes. Streets that intersect with major or secondary thoroughfares shall be provided with paved acceleration and deceleration lanes. Center left turn passing lanes shall be provided if warranted based upon Livingston County road commission standards. Such lanes shall be provided in keeping with the standards approved by the township engineer and Livingston County road commission for this type of improvement. 
(13)	Street names. Street names shall be sufficiently distinct from other street names in Livingston County to avoid confusion, particularly for emergency service providers. Proposed street names shall be accepted by the township and approved by the Livingston County road commission as a part of the preliminary plat approval process. Any proposed roadway that is an extension of, or in a direct line with, an existing street shall carry the name of the street that is in existence at the time the proposal is made. 
(14)	Signs. The developer shall be responsible for placement of street name signs at all street intersections in accordance with the requirements of the Livingston County road commission for private roads. Where roads are proposed to be dedicated to the county, the Livingston County road commission will install the signs at the developer's expense. The developer shall also be responsible for placement of pavement markings and regulatory street signs (such as no parking signs, stop or yield signs, speed limit signs, and warning signs) as requested by the township, the Livingston County road commission or the MDOT; these must be placed after the site has been restored to avoid damaging the signs. All regulatory signs shall be in conformance with the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, most current edition. Street name signs shall be installed prior to issuance of any building permits. 
(15)	Phasing. Each phase of the plat shall be designed to meet the street requirements above, regardless of whether future phases are constructed. 
(Ord. No. 238, 7-2-07, eff. 7-24-07)
Sec. 17-68. - Sidewalks, bike paths, and pedestrian through-block connectors. 
(a)	Requirement. Sidewalks or bike paths shall be required for any subdivision plat, where required by the zoning ordinance and the pathway master plan. 
(b)	Through-block connectors. Pedestrian through-block connectors may be required in the middle of any block over one thousand (1,000) feet in length to obtain satisfactory pedestrian circulation within the subdivision, to provide access to parks or open space, to provide links with an adjacent subdivision, or to provide access to an activity center. Where such pedestrian through-block connectors are required, an easement at least twenty (20) feet wide shall be provided. The township may require placement of a fence along the easement to ensure the location is visible and to protect the adjacent property owners. 
(c)	Performance guarantee. A performance guarantee, in lieu of sidewalk/pathway construction, may be allowed by the planning commission in instances where significant site constraints such as water features or significant grade changes to adjacent undeveloped property or when utility and other infrastructure improvements are planned for the site in the next two (2) years. Under these circumstances, the sidewalk/pathway shall be constructed once the site constraint can be eliminated. 
(d)	Construction standards. The following construction standards shall apply to all pedestrian facilities: 
(1)	All sidewalks shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wide concrete and constructed to the specifications set by the township engineering standards. 
(2)	All bike paths shall be at least ten (10) feet wide asphalt and constructed in accordance with the specifications set by the township engineering standards. 
(3)	All other pathways located within open space areas or are designated pedestrian through-block connectors shall be at least five (5) feet wide asphalt and constructed in accordance with the specifications set by the township engineering standards. The township board may approve stone paths or wooden boardwalks in areas with sensitive environmental features. 
(4)	Sidewalks and bike paths shall be installed by the developer within the dedicated street right-of-way or private road access easements. Special easements shall be established where grades or other factors prevent placement within the right-of-way or access easement. 
(5)	Any yard that abuts a pedestrian easement shall provide the required minimum building setback, as applicable, from the easement. 
(6)	Grades shall be clearly illustrated on the plans to insure proper connection to sidewalks and bike paths on adjacent lands. 
(7)	Crosswalk pavement markings and signs may be required by the township. Crosswalks shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Livingston County road commission and the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devises, current edition. 
(8)	An inclined approach shall be required where sidewalks and bike paths intersect curbs for barrier free access. The inclined approach shall comply with the grades established by MDOT. 
(e)	[Required sidewalks.] Required sidewalks may be installed along the residential lot's frontage following construction of the dwelling unit. In this instance, a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until the sidewalk is installed along that individual lot's frontage. 
(Ord. No. 238, 7-2-07, eff. 7-24-07)
Sec. 17-69. - Blocks. 
    Blocks within subdivisions shall conform to the following standards: 
(1)	Sizes. 
a.	Maximum length for blocks shall not exceed one thousand four hundred (1,400) feet in length. The township board, upon recommendation from the planning commission, may approve a plat which varies from these dimensions if there is documented evidence that significant natural features will be preserved or stub streets to connect to vacant land are being provided, which will result in a conforming condition in the future, and the Livingston County road commission approves the layout. 
b.	Widths of blocks shall be determined by the condition of the layout and shall be suited to the intended layout. 
c.	Blocks shall be so designed as to provide two (2) tiers of back-to-back lots, except where lots back onto a major thoroughfare, railroad, natural feature or subdivision boundary. 
(2)	Easements. 
a.	Location of utility line easements shall be provided as necessary for utility lines. Easements shall give access to every lot, private or public, and shall be a total of not less than twelve (12) feet wide, outside and parallel to the right-of-way or subject to approval by the township engineer. When located along a side or rear yard such easements shall be a minimum of six (6) feet from each parcel or subject to approval by the township engineer. Utility line easements located in the front yard shall be adjacent to the street right-of-way, roadway easement, or private road. Easements for the conveyance of storm water drainage outside public rights-of-ways shall be as follows: for open drainage swales (ditches), a minimum of thirty (30) feet. For enclosed drains, a minimum of twenty (20) feet. Additional width may be required dependent on cross section of the ditch or depth of the enclosed drain. 
b.	Recommendations on the proposed layout of telephone and electric company easements should be sought from all of the utility companies serving the area. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to submit copies of the preliminary plat to all appropriate public utility agencies. 
c.	Easements three (3) feet in width shall be provided where needed along side lot lines so as to provide for street light dropouts. Prior to the approval of the final plat for a proposed subdivision, a statement shall be obtained from the appropriate public utility indicating that easements have been provided along specific lots. A notation shall be made on the final plat indicating: "The side lot lines between lots (indicate lot numbers) are subject to street light dropout rights granted to the (name of utility company)." 
(Ord. No. 238, 7-2-07, eff. 7-24-07)
Sec. 17-70. - Lots. 
    Lots within a subdivision shall conform to the following standards: 
(1)	Sizes and shapes. 
a.	Lot areas and widths and building setback lines shall conform to at least the minimum requirements of the appropriate zoning district, and lot size, width, depth and shape shall be appropriate for the location and type of development contemplated. 
b.	Corner lots in residential subdivisions shall be platted at least ten (10) feet wider than the minimum width permitted by the zoning ordinance. 
c.	Excessive lot depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A depth-to-width ratio of three (3) to one (1) shall be considered a maximum. 
d.	Areas of the subdivision plat that contain ponds, lakes, creeks or similar bodies of water shall be recorded as acreage, but shall not be platted as subdivision lots nor calculated as a portion of the minimum lot area as required by the zoning ordinance. 
e.	Lot area as defined in the township zoning ordinance.
f.	Lots intended for purposes other than residential use shall be specifically designed for such purposes, and shall have adequate provisions for off-street parking, setbacks, and other requirements in accordance with the zoning ordinance. 
(2)	Arrangement. Unless a variance is granted, subject to section 17-151, lots created within a subdivision shall be arranged in the following manner: 
a.	Each lot shall have frontage on a public street or upon a road which complies with township requirements for private roads. 
b.	Corner lots shall have a driveway access to the lesser traveled roadway.
c.	Side lot lines shall be either at right angles from the centerline of a road or shall be generated radially on a curve-linear street or cul-de-sac. Each side lot line shall be linear from its point of generation for a minimum distance sufficient to enclose an adequate building envelope for the given zoning district and further to enclose an area which encompasses all setback areas (front, side and rear) and which meets the minimum lot area as required within the township zoning regulations for the district in which the lots are located. 
d.	Through lots (lots with frontage on two (2) parallel streets) are prohibited, except in the case of a reverse frontage lot that abuts a major thoroughfare where access to such major thoroughfare is prohibited, as required below. 
e.	Newly created residential lots that abut an existing county primary road or other major thoroughfare shall be platted with reverse frontage lots or with side lot lines parallel to the road and shall prohibit direct vehicular access to the road. In the review of the subdivision design, the township board may waive the requirement for the reverse frontage and may substitute a marginal access road if all of the following conditions are met: 
1.	A natural greenbelt area is maintained along the thoroughfare equal or exceeding the width of the right-of-way of the thoroughfare. 
2.	The marginal access road meets all construction standards of the township.
3.	The applicant demonstrates that the marginal access road minimizes curb cuts to the county primary road or thoroughfare. 
f.	Lots shall have a front-to-front relationship across all streets, except for corner lots or for lots abutting a cul-de-sac. If a proposed subdivision abuts existing lots, yard relationships with the contiguous lots shall be compatible (rear yards shall abut rear yards, side yards shall abut side yards). 
g.	For corner lots or lots whose configuration makes the front lot line difficult to define, the front of the lot shall be clearly designated on the plat. Where lots border upon bodies of water, the front yard may be designated on the plat as the waterfront side of such lot provided that the lot has sufficient depth to provide adequate setback on the street side to maintain a setback for all structures equal to the front setback on the street side as well as on the waterfront side. 
h.	Lots facing a three-way T-intersection shall be designed to prevent on-coming headlight glare into the living area of the building envelope. 
i.	If the plat extends into an adjacent community, boundaries for individual lots shall be within one (1) community to the extent feasible. In no case shall a building envelope result in a situation where a home crosses a community or school district boundary. 
(3)	Number of divisions allowed. 
a.	Divisions of unplatted parcels. The proposed land divisions comply with all the requirements of the State Land Division Act and this chapter and shall not result in more than the number of parcels allowed under Section 108 of the State Land Division Act, incorporated herein by reference.

DIVISION 4. - SOIL EROSION CONTROL 

Sec. 17-281. - Soil erosion control measures. 
    The developer's engineer shall include soil erosion control measures both temporary and permanent on the construction plans submitted for approval. The proposed methods of erosion control shall conform to the requirements of Act No. 347 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1972 (MCL 282.101 et seq.), as amended. Specific measures of erosion control as outlined in the "Michigan Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Guidebook" are contained in the copy of the "Michigan Unified Keying System" which is printed at the end of this article. Both the name and code number of erosion control measures should be included on the approved construction plans. 
(1)	It is necessary to protect all off-site facilities and lands from erosion or sediment resulting in the disturbing and developing of a site. Straw berms, buffer zones, diversion ditches and gravel filters should be used to provide this protection as needed for temporary erosion control. These shall remain in place until permanent erosion control measures are provided. 
(2)	The disturbed areas on site should be kept to a minimum and restoration of these areas should be performed as soon as practicable. Protection of new or existing on-site improvements may be necessary such as sediment traps or gravel filters at catch basins. 
(3)	Permanent soil erosion control measures include provisions for stormwater collection and control by use of ditches and enclosed culverts and pavement as outlined elsewhere in this specification. Other specific methods of permanent erosion control include topsoiling, seeding and mulching any disturbed earth or landscape areas. Topsoil and sod are required on all slopes greater than two (2) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical. Sod is also required, in all ditches that have slopes greater than 3:1 ratio to within one (1) foot above the bottom. Ditches with bottom slopes greater than five (5) percent shall be lined with rip-rap to one (1) foot above the bottom. Ditches with bottom slopes greater than seven (7) percent are not permitted and enclosed culverts shall be used. Rip-rap shall be provided at all locations where an enclosed culvert discharges into an open ditch or retention/detention pond, including the discharge of the retention/detention pond into a drainage course. In special instances, stakes or screen netting may be required to ensure stability of a sodded area. Also, ditch checks consisting of rip-rap in the flow channel may be required to reduce the velocity of stormwater flow in ditches.

Sec. 22-07. - Connection to public sewer system. 
(a)	At such time as a public sewer becomes "available" as defined below, to a property served by a private sewage disposal system that has failed, as determined by the health department, a direct connection shall be made to the Public Sewer in compliance with this chapter, and any septic tanks, cesspools and similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be abandoned for sanitary use and filled with a suitable material. The public sewer shall be considered "available" when all of the following conditions are met: 
(1)	The structure or buildings where sewage originates is on property which is contiguous to the right of way or easement within which the public sewer is located; 
(2)	The public sewer and the system have sufficient capacity to reliably treat the additional sewage flows from the connection; 
(3)	The public sewer pressure within the low-pressure sanitary sewer or the forcemain will accommodate connection to the system. 
The property owner of a structure or buildings where sewage originates, shall connect to the public sewer within ninety (90) days after an application for a permit for a private sewage disposal system is denied by the health department. If the property owner does not connect to the public sewer within the ninety (90) days, the property owner will be responsible for paying all user charges, with the first quarterly sewer use bill being levied to the property, prorated to the 91st day after the denial of the permit. Additionally, legal action will be implemented for the property owner to connect to the public sewer. 
If vacant property is contiguous to a right of way or easement within which the public sewer is located, that vacant property must connect to the public sewer upon construction of a structure or building. 
(b)	No person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof, without first obtaining a sewer permit from the township. No building sewer service line shall be covered or backfilled until after it has been inspected and approved by the township. 
(c)	The property owner or his/her agent shall make application for a sewer permit on a form furnished by the township. The sewer permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information required by this ordinance or considered pertinent in the judgment of the township. All sewer connection fees and/or sewer tap fees, in amounts established by action of the township board, shall be paid to the township treasurer at the time the application is filed. If a street opening is required to make the lead connection, an additional Livingston County Road Commission (LCRC) permit, as an attachment to the sewer permit, must be obtained. 
(d)	All cost and expense associated with the installation, connection and maintenance of the building sewer to the system shall be borne by the property owner. The property owner shall pay all costs associated with any plumbing modifications, installing the sewer service lead to the public sewer as measured from the ROW, pumping out any existing septic tank, and decommissioning any existing septic tank. 
(e)	All liabilities associated with the installation, connection and maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by property owner. The property owner shall indemnify and save harmless the township from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. This liability shall include, but not be limited to, damage or loss due to water intrusion, settlement, lightning or other acts of God. Consequential damage due to any of the above causes is the responsibility of the property owner. 
(1)	The property owner shall be responsible for the total maintenance, cleaning and repair of the Private Sewer Lines as defined in section 22-02 Definitions, Private Sewer Lines. 
(2)	The township, is responsible for all repairs of the public sewer only, and has no responsibility of any sort for the private lines. The township also has no responsibility to clean the sewer service leads. 
(3)	In the case of a bona fide dispute as to whether needed maintenance, cleaning or repair of a portion of sewer line is the responsibility of the property owner or the township under the provisions of this ordinance, it shall be the duty of the property owner to establish that the obstruction disrepair or defect has occurred in that portion of the line for which the township is responsible. If the property owner fails to establish the township responsibility, it shall be the property owner's responsibility to perform the necessary maintenance as provided in this chapter. If the township responsibility is established, the township shall perform the necessary maintenance and shall reimburse the property owner for reasonable expenses, excluding attorney fees, incurred in locating the defect in the line or in otherwise establishing the township responsibility. 
(4)	Any property owner who shall violate the provisions of this ordinance shall be liable to the township for all costs and damages incurred in correcting the defect, including any consultant fees and/or attorney fees. Violation of this ordinance shall also constitute a misdemeanor. If any property owner fails to maintain a private sewer line as required by this ordinance, in addition to the other penalties prescribed herein, the sewer may be declared a public nuisance by the health department and the defect may be corrected by the township. Any costs so incurred, including consultant fees and/or attorney fees, shall be assessed against the property and become a lien on the property if not timely paid. 
(f)	When two (2) or more buildings in residential districts occupy the same parcel, each of which is connected to the public sewer, the following shall apply. If one or more building(s) is considered an accessory use to the main building it may be connected to the private sewer lines serving the main building. If, on the other hand, the building(s) are used as independent living units, each shall have its own direct connection to the system. 
In non-residential districts each building requiring sanitary sewage service shall have its own connection to the system. The manager may waive this requirement in non-residential districts when the accessory building is such that it may not be split off and sold to another entity. 
(g)	Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the township, to meet all requirements of this ordinance. All costs incurred by the township in making this determination, including consultant fees and/or attorney fees, shall be borne by the property owner requesting same. 
(h)	The grinder pump location on each property will be coordinated by appointment with the property owner or his/her designee during the installation. An easement within the property will be required for the installation, operation and maintenance of the grinder pump, sewer lead from the grinder pump to the public sewer, control/alarm panel and the electrical line to the grinder pump. The property owner shall execute the necessary documents to establish the easement. 
(i)	The building sewer or sewer service lead shall be constructed in accordance with the township's engineering standards. The township reserves the right to specify and require the encasement of any sewer pipe with concrete, or the installation of the sewer pipe in concrete cradle if the foundation and construction are such as to warrant such protection in the written opinion of the manager. 
(j)	The size and slope of the building sewer shall be in accordance with the township's engineering standards but in no event shall the diameter be less than six (6) inches. The slope of pipe, the diameter of which is six (6) inches or more, shall be not less than one-eighth (1/8) inch per foot unless otherwise permitted. 
(k)	Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three (3) feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade. The line shall be straight or laid with properly curved pipe and fittings. Changes in direction greater than forty-five (45) degrees shall be provided with cleanouts accessible for cleaning. 
(l)	In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by artificial means approved by the current applicable building and plumbing codes, and discharge to the building sewer. 
(m)	All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight. All joints shall meet the requirements of the township engineering standards. 
(n)	No sewer connection will be permitted unless there is capacity available in all downstream sewers, lift stations, force mains and the sewage treatment plant, including capacity for treatment of BOD and suspended solids. 
(o)	All newly constructed building sewers shall have a properly sized cleanout at the head of said sewer that is accessible at all times. This cleanout shall allow access of sewer cleaning equipment of a size equivalent to the size of the building sewer. The location and number of cleanouts shall be in accordance with applicable building and plumbing code requirements. 
(p)	All sewers shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the latest edition of the Great Lakes-Upper Mississippi River Board of State and Provincial Public Health and Environmental Managers' Recommended Standards for Wastewater Facilities (formally known as the 'Ten State Standards').

If the water softener backwash flows for buildings that existed prior to August 14, 2000, do not discharge into the public sewer, it shall be unlawful to re-route the water softener backwash flows into the public sewer. 
(b)	Specific pollutant limitations. 
(1)	Toxic pollutants and prohibited discharges. No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, any sewage or wastewater which contains the substances or possess the characteristics described in subsection 22-08(a) of this section, and which are normally considered toxic, and which may prevent the effective operation of the sewage treatment plant, be incompatible with or harm the sewage treatment facilities; or which are prohibited by any federal or state law, rule, regulation, permit requirement or standard which is applicable to sewage treatment facilities; or which the township shall have concluded will have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or otherwise endanger the health, safety and welfare of the public or public property, or constitute a nuisance. 
(2)	Conventional pollutants. Except as authorized by the township in writing, no person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the limits established in the approved basis of design of the system, as those limits may be modified from time to time; the current limits include, but are not limited to the following:

Should any other substances either individually or in combination with other substances interfere with the sewage treatment process or cause damage to the receiving waters or affect the sanitary or storm sewer system, the allowable concentration of these substances shall be reduced by written order of the manager. Should the township determine that the above limits can be raised without damage to the sewer system or the sewage plant exceeding the state or federal limits, then the township may raise the limits, and shall determine the individual concentrations depending on quantity of flow, equipment, capabilities, reliability of testing, etc. 
(4)	If any waters are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated above, or other substances, and which in the judgment of the manager may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the township may: 
a.	Reject the wastes.
b.	Require pretreatment to the level defined as "Normal Domestic Sewage".
c.	Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
d.	Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered using taxes or sewer charges. 
e.	Require new industrial users or industries with significant changes in strength or flow to submit prior information to the township concerning the proposed flows. 
If the township permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plant and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the township and shall be subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
(c)	National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Upon the promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards for a particular subcategory, the pretreatment standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter and shall be considered part of this chapter. The manager shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements. 
(d)	Existing users subject to new National Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall achieve compliance within three (3) years of the date the standard is promulgated, unless a shorter compliance schedule is specified in the standard. New sources subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall install, have in operating condition, and have started up all pretreatment equipment required to achieve compliance before beginning to discharge; and shall meet all applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time, but not to exceed ninety days after beginning to discharge. 
(e)	State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than Federal requirements and limitations or those in this ordinance. 
(f)	Township's right of revision. The township reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section 22-01 of this chapter. 
(g)	No user shall discharge or cause to be discharged any form of inflow or infiltration (stormwater, surface water, groundwater, water from footing drains, water from non-residential floor drains or roof water) to any sanitary sewer or sewer connection. Any property connected to a storm sewer shall comply with county, state and federal requirements as well as those of the township. 
Downspouts, non-residential floor drains and roof leaders shall be disconnected from sanitary sewers within six (6) months of the date of this chapter. If this is not done, the township may perform this work and bill the user or property owner as the case may be. 
Stormwater, groundwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designed as combined sewers or storm sewers. Discharge of cooling water or unpolluted process water to a natural outlet shall be approved only by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. 
(h)	Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand and other harmful ingredients. Interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious material capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of substantial construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable covers, which when bolted in place shall be gastight and watertight. 
(i)	Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the owner, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. 
(j)	The township may prohibit the admission into the public sewer system, any waters, wastewater, or wastes as follows: 
(1)	Containing any quantity of substances having the characteristics described in section 22-08(a)(1). or section 22-08(a)(2), or 
(2)	Having an average daily flow greater than two (2) percent of the average daily sewage flow of the township, or having a rate of flow (gallons per day) greater than ten (10) percent of the average daily township flow for a period of one hour or more, shall be subject to review and approval of the manager. 
(3)	Where necessary in the opinion of the township, the property owner or user shall provide at his expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to reduce the five (5) day BOD, suspended solids, phosphorus, and total ammonia nitrogen to concentrations given in section 22-08(b)(2); or to reduce objectionable characteristics of constituents to within the maximum limits provided for in section 22-08(b)(1), or control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes. 
(k)	Where the strength of sewage from an industrial, commercial or institutional establishment exceeds: 
(1)	260 parts per million of biochemical oxygen demand; or
(2)	300 parts per million by weight of suspended solids; or
(3)	6 parts per million by weight of phosphorus; or
(4)	35 parts per million by weight of total ammonia nitrogen; or
(5)	400 parts per million of chemical oxygen demand; or
(6)	100 parts per million by weight of fat, oil or grease; and
Where such wastes are permitted to be discharged to the sewer system by the manager, an added charge, as set by action of the township board, will be made against such establishment according to the strength of such wastes. The strength of such wastes shall be determined by composite samples taken over a sufficient period of time to insure a representative sample. The cost of taking and making of these samples shall be borne by the applicant. The cost of any subsequent sampling and testing shall be borne by the applicant. Tests shall be made by an independent laboratory approved by the township or at the township wastewater treatment plant. 
Added charges shall be determined by the township board. These charges shall be based on the cost of operation, maintenance, and equipment replacement for the sewage works. 
(l)	When required by the township, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the township. The manhole shall be installed by the property owner or user at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. Access to said manhole(s) shall be provided by the property owner or user without cost or inconvenience to the township. 
(m)	All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water to which reference is made in subsections (a) and (h) of section 22-08, shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition at the time of "Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Sewage," and shall be determined at the control manhole provided for in section 22-05(h), or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the system and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether grab samples should be taken. The responsibilities of industrial users are further defined below: 
(1)	An authorized representative from each industrial user shall be delegated the authority to be responsible for industrial wastes admitted to the municipal sewers. Such person would be involved with maintaining the pretreatment facility operations and assuring a continual high level of performance. In case no pretreatment is provided, such person would be involved with the prevention of accidental discharges of process wastes admitted to the sanitary sewer system. Such person must become aware of all potential and routine toxic wastes generated by their industry. Such person must also be informed of all process alterations which could, in any manner, increase or decrease normal daily flow or waste strength discharged to the sanitary sewers. 
(2)	This industrial user representative must catalog all chemicals stored, used, or manufactured by their industry. Such a listing should include specific chemical names, not manufacturer's codes. Those wastes admitted to the sanitary sewer are a prime concern; however, all discharges should be cataloged. An estimate of daily average flows and strengths must be made including process, cooling, sanitary, etc. Such a determination should separate the flows according to appropriate categories. The aforementioned flow and chemical listing is to be sent to the township manager on an agreed upon basis. 
(3)	The industrial user representative shall determine whether or not large process alterations will occur during the next few years; one year, two years, and five years. Management should be consulted to determine if such alterations are scheduled and forthcoming. A report shall be completed annually summarizing whether or not large process alterations will occur and if such alterations are scheduled and forthcoming. The annual report shall be submitted to the township manager by an agreed upon deadline each year. 
(4)	A sketch of the plant building(s) must be made, including a diagram of process and chemical storage areas. Location of any pretreatment equipment should be indicated and floor drains located near process and storage areas should be noted. Manhole and sewer locations at the industry's point of discharge into the municipal collection system should be included on the plant layout sketch. 
(5)	There must be separation of spent concentrations from the sanitary sewer to prevent toxic wastes from upsetting the wastewater treatment plant. Supervision and operation of the pretreatment equipment for spent concentrations as well as all toxic wastes and high strength organic wastes to an acceptable level as detailed in this chapter is the responsibility of the industrial representative. All sludge's generated by such treatment must be handled in an acceptable manner, such as designated areas of a sanitary landfill or by a licensed waste hauler. Adequate segregation of those waters and wastes to be pretreated to meet discharge limits is a vital portion of the industrial effort to prevent operational problems at the wastewater treatment plant. 
(6)	Throughout the industry, adequate secondary containment or curbing must be provided to protect all floor drains from accidental spills and discharges to the receiving sewers. Such curbing should be sufficient to hold one hundred fifty (150) percent of the total process area tank volume. All floor drains found within the containment area must be plugged and sealed. Spill trough and sumps within the containment area must be plugged and sealed. Spill trough and sumps within process areas must discharge to appropriate pretreatment tanks. Secondary containment should be provided for storage tanks which may be serviced by commercial haulers and for chemical storage areas. 
(7)	An adequate sampling vault or manhole must be provided in an accessible place for the wastewater treatment plant personnel to obtain samples and flow measurement data. The complexity of the vault will vary with the sampling requirements the township determines necessary to protect the treatment plant and receiving stream. Should, the township desire continual flow recording and long duration, twenty-four (24) hour composite sampling, then a more complex manhole would be mandatory, complete with 110 volt AC. Samples collected could be divided between the industry and township for analysis if so desired by the industry. The sampling vault should be located so as to give access by township personnel without entering the industrial property. 
(8)	Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests the information is classified as confidential on the basis of proprietary processes and the material would otherwise be exempt from public disclosure under any state or Federal act. When information is classified as confidential, the township shall provide proper and adequate facilities and procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of manufacturing processes, except that confidentiality shall not extend to waste products discharged to the waters of the state. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA or approved authority by request. 
Industrial cooling water containing such pollutants as insoluble oils or grease or other suspended solids shall be pretreated for removal of the pollutants and then discharged to a MDEQ approved drainage outlet. 
Agents of the township, health department, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, shall have the right to enter all properties for the purpose of inspecting, measuring, sampling and testing the wastewater discharge and copying applicable pretreatment records. 
(n)	To determine the sewage flow from any establishment, the Township may use one of the following methods: 
(1)	The amount of water supplied to the premises by the township, Livingston Community Water Authority, the City of Brighton, Fonda Island & Briggs Lake Joint Water Authority, or a private water company as shown upon the water meter if the premises are metered, or 
(2)	If such premises are supplied with river water or water from private wells, the REU Table may be applied, or 
(3)	If such premises are used for an industrial or commercial purpose of such a nature that the water supplied to the premises cannot be entirely discharged into the sewer system, the estimate of the amount of sewage discharged into the sewer system made by the township from either water processing measurements, associated electric supply or using the REU Table, or 
(4)	The number of gallons of sewage discharged into the sewer system as determined by flow measuring equipment or device approved by the township and measurements and samples taken at a metered manhole installed by the owner of the property served by the sewer system at his own expense in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit issued by the township pursuant to section 22-07, or 
(5)	A figure determined by the township by any combination of the foregoing or by any other equitable method. 
(o)	Excessive discharges. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the township or state. 
(p)	Accidental discharge. Where required, a user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. The township will evaluate, at least once every two (2) years, whether a user without said protection will be subjected to these requirements. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the township for review, and shall be approved by the township before construction of the facility. All required users shall complete such a plan within one hundred eighty (180) days after the adoption of this chapter. If required by the township, a user who commences contribution to the system after the effective date of this chapter shall not be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the township. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the manager of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(1)	Written notice. A user shall submit oral notice of an accidental discharge that exceeds applicable pretreatment requirements to the township within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the user becomes aware of the accidental discharge. Unless waived by the township, a written submission shall then be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the accidental discharge. The written submission shall contain a description of the discharge and its cause; the duration of the discharge, including exact dates and times, and, if the discharge has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the accidental discharge. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the system, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law. 
(2)	Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees of whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(q)	Upset provision. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense by users in unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or pretreatment requirements, provided it can be proved that: 
(1)	An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(2)	The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
(3)	A user shall submit oral notice of an upset that exceeds applicable pretreatment requirements to the township within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the user becomes aware of the upset. Unless waived by the township, a written submission shall then be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the upset. The written submission shall contain a description of the upset and its cause; the duration of the upset, including exact dates and times, and, if the upset has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the upset. 
(4)	In any enforcement proceedings, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(r)	Bypass provision. Bypass producing a discharge which violates applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or pretreatment requirements is prohibited, and the township may take enforcement action against a user for such bypass, unless: the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and the user submitted required notices. Severe property damage as used herein shall mean substantial physical damage to property, damage to the user's pretreatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which cannot reasonably be expected to occur in absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
If the user knows in advance of the need for bypass, a prior notice shall be submitted to the township at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass. The township may approve or disapprove this anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects. 
A user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment requirements to the township within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. Unless waived by the township, a written submission shall then be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
(s)	No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the township and any person, firm or corporation whereby waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the township, subject to payment therefore by the person, firm or corporation, provided such waste will not damage the sanitary sewer or storm sewer or wastewater treatment plant or the receiving waters.

Sec. 22-14. - Enforcement-Violations and penalties. 
(a)	Emergency suspension of service or permit. The township may suspend wastewater treatment services to any user when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the township, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, causes or may cause interference to the system, or causes or may cause the township to violate any condition of its NPDES Permit.

Further orders and directives as are necessary may be issued. 
(e)	Judicial proceedings. Following the entry of any order by the township board with respect to the conduct of a user contrary to the provisions of this chapter, the township may, following the authorization of such action by the township board, commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate local court. 
(f)	Publication of volations. The township will annually publish in a newspaper of general circulation, a list of the users which were in significant noncompliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the twelve previous months.

(Ord. No. 258, 12-16-13, eff. 12-26-13) 
Sec. 22-17. - User charge system 
(a)	Fees. Fees for the installation and use of the system shall be established by action of the township board to recover the costs of administration, construction, repairs, maintenance and operation of the system as necessary to preserve the system in good working order, to provide for the operation and replacement of the system, and to provide for the payment of any debt service obligations of Brighton Township as they become due. The fees shall be made against all users of the system. 
The fees for sanitary sewer service are to be established by action of the township board, and may be established separately from time to time as necessary to ensure sufficiency of revenues in meeting the expenses of the system. The township board may classify the system users according to the quantities and types of sewage received, and charge such fees to users in each class, as it may deem reasonable. 
The township board shall hold a public hearing thirty (30) days before any fees increases are to take effect. The proposed fee increase and notice for public hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the township at least fifteen (15) days before such public hearing. 
(b)	No free service. No free service shall be allowed for any user of the system. 
(c)	Billing. All fees for wastewater service shall be billed and collected in accordance with the township administrative policies, as revised from time to time, and adopted by the township board. 
The failure to receive a bill shall not excuse a failure to pay a bill and any penalty shall accrue thereon as though such bill had been received. All bills shall be payable on or before the due date without discount. Payments received by the township shall be applied for payment of any outstanding balance owed on the account prior to being applied to current charges. 
(d)	Billing appeals. All disputes with bills for wastewater service shall be submitted in writing to the township department responsible for utility billing. That department will consider the dispute and render a determination within thirty (30) days of receiving the written dispute. The sewer user may appeal that department's determination by submitting a written appeal to the township manager within fifteen (15) days of the department's determination. The manager shall render a final determination within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written appeal. Submittal of an appeal shall in no way relieve the affected user of payment of the bill. 
Further appeal of the manager's final determination shall be submitted to the township board. The appeal request shall be submitted to the township clerk within fifteen (15) days of the manager's final determination. The township board will convene a hearing on the matter and render a final determination within forty-five (45) days of receipt by the township clerk of the appeal. Submittal of an appeal shall in no way relieve the affected user of payment of the bill. 
(e)	Nonpayment. User charges that are not paid on or before the due date as indicated on the bill shall be considered delinquent and shall accrue a ten (10) percent penalty on the unpaid amount. 
(f)	Collection of delinquent accounts. Any and all charges, such as property owner's direct charges, O&M charges and debt service charges, special assessment charges, interest, penalties and all other charges whatsoever related to the operations under this chapter, shall be a personal obligation of the owner of the premises and shall become a lien against the premises until paid. Until all such charges are paid, the township may, at the option of the township board, proceed with a personal action against the owner or foreclose upon the aforesaid lien, or both, to the extent necessary to collect such amounts owed and all related costs of collection of said amounts that are incurred by the township. 
On the first day of September of each year, any and all balances that are past due for ninety (90) days or more, including the ten (10) percent penalty assessed in subsection (e). Nonpayment of the above shall be certified to the next township tax roll as a lien for collection against the premises served. Such lien shall be collected and enforced in the same manner as provided by law for township taxes assessed on the roll. Any and all charges certified for collection through the tax roll shall have added to them a ten (10) percent penalty on the entire amount of the lien in addition to previous charges. 
(g)	REU assignment appeals. 
(1)	Every owner has a right to an administrative appeal of the assignment of REUs to a property pursuant to the township's REU schedule as applied to a particular property. Claims of economic hardship shall not be considered grounds for an administrative appeal. 
(2)	A written appeal shall be submitted to the manager within fifteen (15) days of the assignment of REU's. The appeal shall identify the assigned REU's and how the owner feels they were incorrectly calculated. The manager shall submit his/her written decision within fifteen (15) days after receiving the written appeal by a written decision sent by regular mail to the owner. 
(3)	If the owner is dissatisfied with the manager's decision, a written appeal may be taken to the utilities committee by any user within thirty (30) days from the date of the order, requirement, decision or determination as to application or interpretation of the REU schedule as applied to a particular property, by filing with the manager a notice of appeal specifying the grounds for the appeal and the payment of the appeal fee, if such a fee is established by the township board. All provisions of the Open Meetings Act shall apply to the proceedings of the utilities committee. If no appeal is taken within the thirty (30) days, the order, requirement, decision, or determination shall be final. 
(4)	The utilities committee shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal and render a decision within sixty (60) days from the date of filing the notice of appeal, unless an extension of time is required by a decision of the majority of the members of the utilities committee present, whose decision shall state the reasons for the extension. 
(5)	Minutes of the appeal hearing shall be kept in accordance with the Open Meetings Act and contain the grounds of the determination made by the utilities committee. 
(6)	The utilities committee may reverse or modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination appealed from and shall make an order, requirement, decision, or determination as in the utilities committee opinion ought to be made. The utilities committee may impose conditions upon an affirmative decision on appeal. The concurring vote of a majority of the total members of the utilities committee shall be necessary to reverse an order, requirement, decision, or determination. 
(7)	Further appeal of the utilities committee determination shall be submitted to the township board. The appeal request shall be submitted to the township clerk within fifteen (15) days of the utility committee's final determination. The township board will convene a hearing on the matter and render a final determination within forty-five (45) days of receipt by the township clerk of the appeal. Further appeals shall be to the appropriate court. 
(8)	In ruling on an appeal, the township may consider the current REU schedule, evidence of actual maximum usage, whether actual metering is appropriate, the economic life of the system and the particular properties, uses or classes of uses involved, the history of the particular land use in the community and similar communities and the policies, fees and rates of similar communities, and any other data deemed relevant to make a determination. 
(h)	Metering option (non residential properties only). If the determination by the utilities committee in the administrative appeals section 22-17(g) above is not agreeable to the appellant, the following "metering option" may be used by the owner. 
All REU fees and quarterly user charges determined under section 22-17(g) above shall be paid to the township treasurer. The difference between the utilities committee's determination of the appropriate assignment of REUs and quarterly user charges for the property as established in section 22-17(g), less the number the user alleges is appropriate, shall be held in escrow with the township treasurer until final determination is made. The number the user alleges is appropriate shall be retained by the township. Upon a final determination of the appropriate number of REU's to be assigned to the property, any REU fees and quarterly user charges in escrow shall be apportioned between the township and the user per the final determination. 
The owner must put in an approved water meter. The water meter purchase, installation and meter reading process must be coordinated through, and approved by, the township. The meter location and installation shall be approved by the township and the owner shall obtain all applicable permits. 
The owner shall coordinate and pay all costs associated with the purchase and installation of the water meter, meter accuracy testing if required, and pay the township's cost of processing the meter readings to determine the REUs, 
Water meter readings shall be taken and logged daily. They shall be taken at nearly the same time each day to represent daily usage of water through the meter. A log of the meter readings shall be kept near the meter and shall be made available to an authorized township employee or contractor whenever requested. Request(s) by the township to review the log and read the meter may be made on an unannounced basis. 
The meter may be read during normal work days for the business excluding week-ends if that constitutes normal usage. If peak usage may occur during a week-ends, meter readings must be taken on the week-ends. 
The water meter readings shall continue for a minimum of twelve (12) months. 
This option is not to be used on partially occupied buildings. It may only begin after full occupancy. 
The maximum daily flow will be used in determining the REU assignment. The maximum daily flow during the total time monitored above shall be divided by two hundred (200) gallons per day to determine the number of REUs assigned by this option. Fractional REUs will be rounded up to the next higher whole number of REUs. 
If at any time during the monitoring period the number of REUs observed on any day exceeds the assigned number of REUs the higher REU figure will be considered as accurate and additional fees for those REUs shall be placed in escrow. 
(i)	REU assignments. 
(1)	A minimum of one (1) REU shall be assigned to any building hooking up to the system. Any fractional REU's shall be rounded up to the next whole number. 
(2)	Any expansion or change in a building use or intensity shall be cause for a reevaluation and/or reassignment of REUs. A change in a building use or intensity will not result in a reduction of REUs already assessed against a building. 
(3)	Each unit within a building developed pursuant to PA 1978, No. 59, the Condominium Act, shall be considered a separate structure and will be assessed REUs based on the use or intensity of each unit. 
(4)	The township, by action of the township board, may adopt policies for combining, splitting, reassigning and reassessing REUs. 
(Ord. No. 258, 12-16-13, eff. 12-26-13) 
Sec. 22-18. - Deferral of special assessment charges and waiver of user charges and debt service charges. 
(a)	Hardship cases. The township does not have the authority to waive any special assessment. The township board may determine that it is appropriate to grant the deferment of special assessments imposed for the township's system or any extensions thereto in certain circumstances in accordance with the authority set forth in Section 9a of Act 188, Public Acts of 1954, as amended. Any property owner who has property that is subject to a special assessment may, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 9a of Act 188, apply to the manager for deferment of all or part of the annual portion of the principal and interest coming due on a special assessment. The manager shall forward any such application to the utilities committee, established by the township board. Consideration of deferrals shall be based on guidelines adopted by action of the township board. 
(b)	Financial hardship. The utilities committee shall examine any application for a deferral of the annual portion of the principal and interest coming due on a special assessment. The utilities committee shall recommend granting a full or partial deferment of the amount coming due in that year if the applicant meets the township's then existing criteria for the deferral of special assessments as set by action of the township board. 
(c)	Conditions for deferment. All applications for deferrals must be submitted prior to the time that the annual special assessment installment is billed to the property owner. The township board shall establish, by appropriate action, the date by which such applications for deferrals must be submitted and the date by which the utilities committee shall make its final determinations. 
As a condition of granting the deferment, the amount deferred shall constitute a lien on the subject property, and the property owner or agent shall sign a document, in recordable form, that will provide notice of the lien on the property for the deferred amount. 
Any deferment granted by the township board shall not exceed the amount of the principal and interest on the special assessment that is scheduled to be billed to the property owner in the following December. 
The total sum of all annual deferments, both principal and interest, shall be paid in full at the time of any change in ownership of the subject property. If the total sum is not paid when due, the delinquent sum shall be placed on the tax bill for the property. No additional interest shall be due on the amounts deferred pursuant to this chapter. 
(d)	New septic systems. Owners of new septic systems are eligible, under certain circumstances, to receive a waiver of the O&M component of the quarterly usage charges that would normally apply to users of the township's system. In order to qualify for such a waiver, a property owner must have a "qualified new septic system." 
Qualified new septic system is new or replacement septic systems that were installed prior to a system being available to the property in question. The time period for the waiver, if any, will be determined at the time the future sewer district is created. 
An owner of a qualified new septic system may apply in writing to the manager and request a waiver of the O&M component of the quarterly usage charges (but not the debt service cost component of the quarterly usage charges) applicable for the township's system. 
Upon receiving an application for a waiver of the O&M charges, the manager shall verify whether the property owner has a "qualified new septic system," and if the property owner has a "qualified new septic system," the manager shall waive the O&M component of the quarterly usage charges (but not the debt service component of the quarterly usage charges). The manager shall issue his/her written decision within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request for a waiver. 
Any such waiver of the O&M component of the quarterly usage charges shall cease at such time as the "qualified new septic system" needs to be replaced, or ten (10) years from the date of waiver, whichever is later. 
(e)	Exceptions. Special assessment charge deferrals and waivers of O&M charges shall not be granted under the provisions of this section where a person applying therefore is causing a public nuisance or other injury to the general public, or is subject to a National Categorical Standard, and any such deferrals and/or waivers shown to have been granted under these circumstances shall be immediately terminated. Any deferral and/or waiver granted under the provisions of this section shall not be construed to relieve the person who shall receive it from any liability or penalties imposed by other law for the commission or maintenance of a nuisance.

    The provisions of this article are severable, and if any of the provisions, words, phrases, clauses or terms, or the application thereof to any person, firm or corporation, or to any circumstances, shall be held invalid, illegal, or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision or findings shall not in any way affect the validity, legality or constitutionality of any other provision, word, phrase, clause or term, and they shall continue in full force and effect. 
    All laws and parts of laws, all ordinances, codes and regulations which are inconsistent with or in conflict with or repugnant to any provisions of this article, shall be deemed not to apply; provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the adoption and enforcement of a law, ordinance, code or regulation which is more restrictive or establishes a higher standard than those provided in this article. Any reference to sewers in chapter 21, Water and Sewer System is deleted as the adoption of this chapter creates a new sewer ordinance and replaces the ordinance which is contained in chapter 21.

e.	The Property Tax Identification Number, street addresses and legal description of all affected parcels. The listing of affected parcels and their legal description shall be an "Exhibit" to a proposed restricted zone identified in or added to section 25-3. 
f.	The names, addresses (mailing and street), and phone numbers (if readily available) of all persons with an interest as owner, tenant, easement holder or mortgagee of all affected parcels. 
g.	The location, current status, and usage characteristics of all existing groundwater wells within the proposed restricted zone. 
h.	A detailed statement or description of the proposed regulation or prohibition of the use of existing and future wells, within the restricted zone, needed to adequately protect the public from the potential health hazards associated with the contaminated groundwater including a description of permissible uses of such wells, together with the written consent of the MDEQ to such uses of groundwater. 
i.	A description and time schedule for any actions the applicant will take to implement any remediation plan, mitigate the adverse impact of the restricted zone (e.g., providing substitute water service), and to properly close and abandon any existing wells subject to the use prohibition within the proposed restricted zone.

(a) I-I Industrial District. The I-1 Industrial District is intended to primarily
accommodate wholesale activities, warehouses, and industrial operations
whose external, physical effects are restricted to the area of the district and do
not have a detrimental effect on any of the surrounding districts and uses. The
I-1 District is structured to permit, along with any specified uses, the
manufacturing, compounding, processing, packaging, assembly, and/or
treatment of finished or semi-finished products from previously prepared
material. It is further intended that the processing of raw material for
shipment in bulk form, to be used in an industrial operation at another
location, not be permitted in locations where surrounding land uses could be
adversely affected. The general goals of this district include, among others,
the following specific purposes:
(1) To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations, to meet the needs of
the Township's expected future economy for a variety of manufacturing
and related uses.
(2) To protect abutting Residential Districts by separating them from
manufacturing activities, and by prohibiting the use of industrial areas for
new residential development.
(3) To promote manufacturing development which is free from danger of fire,
explosions, toxic and noxious matter, radiation, and other hazards, and

Sec. 01 Description and Purpose
NR Natural Resources District. The NR Natural Resources District is
designated with the recognition that the sand and gravel deposits within the
Township are unrenewable natural resources necessary and beneficial to
the
economy and welfare of the Township and the regional area. To provide for the
utilization of this resource in a manner compatible with nearby residential areas,
and to ensure complete restoration of the sand and gravel areas ready for another
land use at the conclusion of excavation and treatment, Natural Resources
District is hereby established. The land uses allowed in this district are subject to
depletion of the available natural resources for which they exist. For this reason,
this district is considered an interim zoning classification, with the operations of
the permitted uses eventually leading to other uses. The uses allowed in the NR
District, by their on-going operation, can create significant changes to the
environment, influencing the site, the surrounding land uses and long term
community planning efforts. These uses are monitored through a permit process
to ensure compliance with an approved restoration plan.
(Ord. #252, 11/18/11)
Sec. 8-02 Uses Permitted
(a) Land, buildings, and uses indicated in Table 8-02 are permitted by right and
are denoted by a P. The final column includes additional requirements that
apply to the use which are referenced in a footnote to Table 8-02.

OF Description and The purpose of this Article is to ensure that property is developed in a manner
consistent with its zoning designation, and the proposed physical elements are
designed and arranged to protect the priority resource protection areas both on the
site and in the vicinity of the site as identified by Brighton Township and
Livingston County. The Overlay District establishes procedures to enable the
applicant and Planning Commission to achieve the mutually compatible
objectives of reasonable use of land and protection of vital natural resources. It is
the intent of this Article to allow for development in a creative fashion that
protects vital natural features of a site while preserving the property owner's right
for reasonable use of their land. The use of a PUD option to achieve this purpose
is encouraged.
20
02 Applicability
(a) This Article shall apply to all land divisions and development plans requiring
site plan approval, subdivision plat approval, and condominium plan approval
that are located within the natural features protection areas as illustrated on the
25
Natural Features Protection Area Map. Development subject to this Article
shall be designed and arranged to ensure that disturbance to any natural
features in those areas as a result of development shall be minimized through
the use of natural area buffers, conservation easements or creative land
development techniques, as specified herein.
30
(b) The provisions of this overlay zoning district shall apply in addition to the
applicable regulations of the underlying zoning district. The lot area and bulk
requirements of the underlying zoning district shall be complied with, subject
to the requirements of this overlay zoning district. Where a conflict exists
35
between the requirements of this overlay zoning district and the underlying
zoning district, the more restrictive requirement(s) shall apply.

(a) Uses. A mixed use PUD shall include a mixture of uses that are considered by
the Planning Commission to be consistent with the Master Plan. A concept
plan shall be prepared for the PUD that divides the PUD into components for
various uses. Each use component of the PUD shall be designated with a
specific corresponding zoning district (e.g. RM-1, B-1, etc.), which shall
provide the basis for determining the uses permitted, dimensional standards,
and density. The Planning Commission shall determine the appropriate
mixture of uses and how much of the PUD land area shall be occupied by
residential uses, nonresidential uses, recreational area, or open space. The
Planning Commission shall make this determination based upon the concept
plans ability to provide an integrated mixture of uses, maintain compatibility
with surrounding uses, meet the intent of Section 12-01, and eligibility criteria
of Section 12-02. The list of permitted uses shall be established by the
Planning Commission in the PUD agreement.
(b) Residential Density. The residential density shall be based upon the zoning
district designation on the PUD concept plan. A density bonus of up to ten
percent (10%) may be granted by the Planning Commission for sites served by
both public sewer and water.
(c) Dimensional Requirements. All area and bulk dimensional standards shall
comply with that of the respective underlying zoning district. To encourage
flexibility and creativity consistent with the intent of the PUD, the Planning
Commission may permit specific departures from the requirements of this
Ordinance as a part of the approval process. Any regulatory modification
shall be approved through a finding by the Planning Commission that the
deviation shall result in a higher quality of development than would be
possible using conventional zoning standards.
(d) Open Space. A minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the site shall be
common open space. Such open space shall be dispersed throughout the site
and linked through greenway or pedestrian corridors or located along road
frontages. Parking lot landscaping and greenbelts required by Section 14-02
shall not count towards meeting the twenty-five percent (25%) open space
requirement.

13-16 Wireless (a) Purpose and Intent. The regulations of this Section are intended to conform
with federal laws and administrative rules governing facilities needed to
operate wireless communication systems and to set forth procedures and
standards for review and approval for the location of these facilities within
Brighton Township. It is the Townships intent to reasonably regulate the
location and design of these facilities to retain the integrity of neighborhoods
and the character, property values and aesthetic quality of the Township.
Given the increase in the number of wireless communication facilities
ARTICLE 13 13-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF BRIGHTON ZONING ORDINANCT
requested as a result of the new technology and the Federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the policy of the Township that all
users should co-locate on Attached Wireless Communication Facilities and
Wireless Communication Support Structures. Co-location is proposed in
order to assure the most economic use of land and to prevent the proliferation
of duplicative services. In recognition of the Township's concern that
technological advances may render certain Wireless Communication Facilities
obsolete or unnecessary in the future, requirements are set forth for the
removal of unused or unnecessary facilities in a timely manner and provide
security for removal.

facility, adequate provision shall be made for removal of all or part of the
facility by users and owners upon the occurrence of one (1) or more of the
following events:
(1) When the facility has not been used for one hundred eighty (180) days or
more. For purposes of this Section, the removal of antennas or other
equipment from the facility, or the cessation of operations (transmission
and/or reception of radio signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a
period of non-use.
(2) Six (6) months after new technology is available at reasonable cost, as
determined by the Planning Commission, which permits the operation of
the communication system without the requirement of the support
structure.
(3) The situations in which removal of a facility is required, as set forth in
paragraph (1) above, may be applied and limited to portions of a facility.
(4) Upon the occurrence of one (1) or more of the events requiring removal,
specified in paragraph (1) above, the property owner or persons who had
used the facility shall immediately apply or secure the application for any
required demolition or removal permits, and immediately proceed with
and complete the demolition/removal, restoring the premises to an
acceptable condition as reasonably determined by the Township Planner.
(5) If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has not been
lawfully completed within sixty (60) days of the applicable deadline, and
after at least thirty (30) days written notice, the Township may remove or
secure the removal of the facility or required portions thereof, with its
actual cost and reasonable administrative charge to be drawn or collected
and/or enforced from or under the security posted at the time application
was made for establishing the facility.

(1) Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the Township to minimize the
overall number of newly established locations for Wireless
Communication Facilities and Wireless Communication Support
Structures within the Township and to encourage the use of existing
structures for Attached Wireless Communication Facilities. If a provider
fails or refuses to permit co-location on a facility owned or controlled by
it, where co-location is feasible, the result will be that a new and
unnecessary additional structure will be required, in contradiction with
Township policy. Co-location shall be required unless an applicant
demonstrates that co-location is not feasible.
(2) Feasibility of Co-Location. Co-location shall be deemed "feasible" for
the purpose of this Section where all of the following are met:
a. The wireless communication provider or property owner where colocation
is proposed will accept market rent or other market
compensation for co-location and the wireless communication
provider seeking the facility will pay these rates.
b. The site on which co-location is being considered, taking into
consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is
able to provide structural support.
c. The co-location being considered is technically reasonable, e.g. the colocation
will not result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate
physical and other adjustments in relation to the structure,
antennas and the like.
(g) Nonconforming Facilities and Penalties for not Permitting Co-Location.
If a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility
fails or refuses to alter a structure to accommodate a proposed and otherwise
feasible co-location, that facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to
be a nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be altered, expanded or
extended in any respect. In addition, if a party refuses to allow co-location in
accordance with the intent of this Section, and this action results in
construction of a new tower, the Township may refuse to approve a new
wireless communication support structure from that party for a period of up to
five (5) years. Such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the Zoning
Board of Appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates
ARTICLE 13 13-33 GENERAL PROVISIONS
CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF BRIGHTON ZONING ORDINANCF
entitlement to variance relief which, in this context, shall mean a
demonstration that enforcement of the five (5) year prohibition would
unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent
wireless communication services, or that enforcement would have the effect
of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services.
(h) Variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals may consider a variance from the
requirements of this Section, based upon a finding that one (1) or more of the
following factors exist, as appropriate for the type of variance requested:
(1) Location. The applicant has demonstrated that a location within a district
or location in accordance with the requirements of this Section can not
reasonably meet the coverage or capacity needs of the applicant.
15 (2) No Co-Location. The applicant has demonstrated that a feasible colocation
is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs because
existing structures can not support the facility, that co-location would
result in unreasonable interference, or that reasonable financial terms are
not available for co-location.
20
(3) Setback. The applicant has provided engineering information that
documents that the tower is self collapsing and that the setback area
provided shall accommodate the structure should it fall or break and
provide a reasonable buffer in the event the structure fails.
(4) Height. The height requested is due to signal interference due to
topography, tall buildings, masses of trees, or other obstructions, or would
reduce the number of towers to the benefit of the Township.
(5) All. The applicant has proposed means to mitigate any negative impacts
through provision for future co-location, if found to be appropriate by the
Township, and special design of the facility and site.
(6) All. The wireless communication and accessory facilities shall be
designed to be compatible with the existing character of the proposed site,
neighborhood and general area such as a steeple, bell tower, or similar
form.

(Ord. #231, 12/27/05)
Sec. 14-02 Landscaping
(a) Intent. The intent of this Section is to promote the public health, safety and
welfare by establishing minimum standards for the design installation and
maintenance of landscaping, greenbelts and buffer zones. Landscaping,
greenbelts, and buffer zones are necessary for the continued protection and
enhancement of all land uses. Landscaping and greenbelts enhance the visual
image of the Township, preserve natural features, improve property values,
and alleviate the impact of noise, traffic, and visual distraction. Buffer zones
protect less intense uses from the noise, light, traffic, litter, and other impacts.
Specifically, the intent of these provisions is to:
(1) Improve the appearance of off-street parking area, vehicular use areas, and
property abutting public rights-of-way.
(2) Protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of the
neighborhoods which abut non-residential areas, parking areas, and other
intensive use areas.
(3) Integrate the various elements within a site and link a development with
the surrounding environment.
(4) Reduce soil erosion and depletion.

(6) Remove air pollutants, and control glare and reflection.
(7) Assist in directing safe and efficient traffic flow and prevent vehicular and
pedestrian circulation conflicts.
(8) Create a more
desirable microclimate.
(9) Provide natural
green space to allow infiltration of stormwater, minimize
erosion and filter sediments from runoff.
(b) Applicability
(1) The requirements of this Section shall apply to all projects subject to
administrative
review, site plan review, or condominium review. No site
plan, condominium, or land use permit shall be approved unless
landscaping consistent with the requirements of this Section is provided.
(2) The landscaping requirements shall be met prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy and shall be continuously maintained in a sound,
healthy, and vigorous growing condition.
(3) Creativity in landscape design is encouraged. The standards are
intentionally
flexible to encourage adaptability and creative design.
Required trees and shrubs may be planted at uniform intervals, at random,
or in groupings,
depending on the designer's desired visual effect and the
intent of the
Township to coordinate landscaping on adjacent properties.
Applicants are
encouraged to provide additional landscaping to improve
the function, appearance and value of their property.
(4) The requirements
herein, shall be independent of each other and shall not
be double counted to fulfill the requirements of different required
landscape elements.
(5) In any case where an existing building and/or parking area is being
increased by twenty-five percent (25%) or more over the original site plan,

the site shall be brought into full compliance with the landscape standards
herein.
(6) Where an increase in an existing building and/or parking area is less than
twenty-five percent (25%), the extent of new landscaping shall be equal to
four percent (4%) of compliance for every one percent (1%) of increase in
the building or parking footprint. For example, a ten percent (10%)
building expansion shall require forty percent (40%) compliance with
these landscape requirements.
(c) General Requirements
(1) Plant material shall be installed so that at maturity it does not obscure
traffic signs or lighting, obstruct access for emergency vehicles, interfere
with adequate sight distance for motorists or disrupt drainage patterns on
the site or on adjacent properties.
(2) Landscaped areas shall be covered by grass or other living ground cover.
(3) A minimum four (4) inches of topsoil shall be provided for all lawn areas,
ground covers and planting beds.
(4) Planting beds shall be maintained with woodchips or similar natural
material, non-stone, at a minimum depth of three (3) inches. Planting beds
shall be limited to the area immediately surrounding the plant material.
(5) Planting beds must be curbed or defined with steel edging.
(6) Trees and shrubs shall be set back ten (10) feet from the edge of a road
and five (5) feet from a vehicular access or pathway.
(7) The overall landscape plan shall not contain more than thirty-three percent
(33%) of any one (1) species. The use of trees native to the area and
mixture of trees from the same species association are encouraged.
(8) Ornamental trees may be used to fulfill the tree requirement, provided two
(2) ornamental trees shall be the equivalent of one (1) required tree.

their clones and cultivars) is not encouraged because they split easily, their
wood is brittle and breaks easily, their roots clog drains and sewers or they
are unusually susceptible to disease or insect pests. These plant materials
may be permitted to remain in their natural setting but cannot be
transplanted. The Planning Commission, however, may allow trees from
this list when associated with an appropriate ecosystem, such as a wetland
area.

(k) Modification of Landscape Requirements. The Planning Commission may
reduce or modify the location of the landscape requirements contained in this
Section based upon a determination that the landscaping required in this
Section will not be necessary or effective in meeting the intent of this Article.
In making such a determination, the following shall be considered:
(1) Topographic features or other unique features of the site create conditions
such that strict application of the landscape regulations would result in a
less effective screen than an alternative landscape design.
(2) Parking, vehicular circulation, or existing or planned land use are such that
required landscaping would not enhance the site or result in the desired
screening effect.
(3) The public benefit intended by the landscape requirements could be better
achieved with a plan that varies from the strict requirements of the
Ordinance.
(4) The intent to comply with the requirements has been demonstrated by the
applicant with alternatives considered by the applicant prior to the
Planning Commission consideration of modification to requirements.
(l) Installation and Maintenance. The following requirements shall be
observed where installation and maintenance of landscape materials is
required:
(1) Installation. Landscaping shall be installed in a sound, professional
manner to ensure the continued growth of healthy plant material.
(2) Protection from Vehicles. Landscaping shall be protected from vehicles
through use of wheel stops or other means. Landscape areas shall be
elevated above the pavement to a height adequate to protect the plants
from snow removal, salt, and other hazards.
(3) Maintenance. Required landscaping (including berms, greenbelts, buffer
zones, walls, woodlots, trees, lawns and ground cover) shall be maintained
in a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris.
All unhealthy and dead plant material shall be replaced in the next

apply to existing plant material:
(1) Utilization of Existing Elements in the Landscape Design. In instances
where healthy plant material exists on a site prior to its development, the
Planning Commission may permit substitution of such plant material in
place of the requirements set forth previously in this Section, provided the
substitution is in keeping with the spirit and intent of this Section and this
Article in general. Existing hedges, berms, walls, or other landscape
elements may be used to satisfy the requirements set forth previously,
provided that such existing elements are in conformance with the
requirements of this Section.
(2) Preservation of Existing Plant Material. Site plans shall show all
existing trees which are located in the portions of the site that will be built
upon or otherwise altered, and are six (6) inches or greater in diameter at
breast height. Trees shall be labeled "To Be Removed" or "To Be Saved"
on the site plan.
(3) In the event that healthy plant materials which are intended to meet the
requirements of this Article are cut down, damaged or destroyed during
construction, the removed plant material shall be replaced.

building permit, shall be required.
(2) Change in Use or Intensity. Whenever use of a building, structure, or lot

to prevent voluntary establishment of off-street parking facilities to serve
an existing use of land or buildings, provided all such parking is in
conformance with the regulations set forth herein, provided the amount of

finding by the Planning Commission that the required amount of parking
is excessive, provided that the area to meet the full parking requirement is
retained as open space. The site plan shall note the area where parking is
being deferred with a dotted parking lot layout. If within a two (2) year
period following issuance of a certificate of occupancy the Township
Planner determines based on observed use that the deferred parking is
needed, then the parking shall be constructed by the applicant within six
(6) months of being informed in writing by the Township Planner. The

road construction is complete, the applicant shall provide a performance
guarantee in an amount equivalent to the construction costs of the
remaining improvements yet to be completed on the private road. The
construction costs shall include the remaining costs associated with the
survey layout of the road, testing services, and inspection services during
the private road construction. The applicants engineer shall prepare the
construction cost opinion for the improvements to be covered under the
performance guarantee, which will be verified by the Township Engineer.
All necessary modifications encountered during construction that
significantly change the design of the proposed private road shall be
incorporated into revised construction plans and submitted to the
Township for review and approval. These changes must be approved by
the Township before they are constructed.
(b) Private Road Design Requirements. No permit shall be issued for a private
road unless the proposed construction is in conformance with the following
requirements:
(1) Access Easements. Easements shall give access from a public road or
roads to all parcels resulting from the proposed division not having road
frontage and shall be established for the joint use of owners of all resultant
parcels of the original property for ingress and egress and also for the
location of private or publicly-owned utilities serving the resultant parcels
(2) Access Easement Width. A minimum sixty-six (66) foot wide easement
shall be provided.
(3) Road Design. All private roads shall meet the public road base, pavement
width, surface, slope and drainage system requirements of the Livingston
County Road Commission, except as provided for in this Section. The
design of private roads shall be approved by the Township Engineer. A
private road serving no more than eight (8) lots or dwelling units in a
single family residential district may be constructed of eight (8) inches of
compacted MDOT 22 A gravel instead of asphalt or concrete.
(4) Curbing and Drainage. All private roads shall be constructed with

(5) Reduced Width for Private Roads. The minimum pavement width shall
be thirty (30) feet, measured back to back of curb. The pavement width
may be reduced to not less than twenty-six (26) feet wide, measured back
to back of curb. For residential roads with open ditch drainage, the
pavement width shall be twenty-two (22) feet with four (4) foot gravel
shoulders on both sides. The width reduction may be approved by the
Planning Commission and Township Board where significant natural
features will be preserved or the road will serve fewer than twenty (20)
dwelling units. Where the width of the road has been reduced, the road
shall be posted to prevent parking as necessary.
(6) Maximum Length, Cul-de-sac Turnarounds
a. The maximum length of a private road served by a single point of
access shall be seven hundred fifty (750) feet with a maximum twentyfour
(24) lots or dwelling units served by a single means of access.
Fire Code Standards for roads over seven hundred fifty (750) ft.
require special permission by the Fire Department. If the Fire
Department and Township Engineer agree that a road can extend
beyond seven hundred fifty (750) ft., no Zoning Board of Appeals
(ZBA) variance is required.
Roads longer than seven hundred and fifty (750) feet are permitted
where stub roads are provided to allow future road connections when
adjacent land is developed and cross access easements are granted.
The Planning Commission may allow cul-de-sacs longer than seven
hundred fifty (750) feet if all of the following apply:
1. The applicant demonstrates that there are no feasible options to
access the property.
2. The Fire Department has reviewed and approved the length of the
road.
3. The road does not access more than twenty-four (24) lots.

Planning Commission, based upon the recommendation of the Fire
Department and Township staff or consultants, provided there is a
finding that traffic impacts are adequately mitigated. A second means
of emergency access may be required by the Planning Commission
and/or the Fire Department having jurisdiction.
(7) Grade. Road grades shall not exceed ten percent (10%), with a maximum
grade of two percent (2%) for a minimum distance of thirty (30) feet from
its intersection with a public right-or-way or another private road.
(8) Compliance with AASHTO Requirements. Where no specific standard
is provided in this section, private road design plans shall meet the design
criteria outlined in the most recent edition of the American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Manual "A Policy
on Geometric Design for Highways and Roads."
(9) Horizontal Curve. The minimum horizontal curve shall be two hundred
thirty (230) feet in radius. The Planning Commission may reduce this
radius to not less than one hundred fifty (150) feet if the design would
accommodate expected vehicle speeds, as determined by the Township
Engineer, in cases where rolling terrain or a significant number of mature
trees would be preserved, or where the width of the parcel would not
accommodate wider radii. This radius may be further reduced where an
eye-brow bump-out is provided on the outer edge of the curve.
(10) Intersection Design Requirements
a. Private roads, which intersect with existing or proposed private roads
or public road rights-of-way, should intersect at a ninety degree (90°)
angle. Where constrained by environmental features or parcel
configuration, a reduced angle of intersection, but in no case shall the

Livingston County Road Commission.
(11) Vertical Clearance. In order to provide adequate access for emergency
vehicles, fifteen (15) feet of overhead tree clearance shall be provided
within the width of the gravel or pavement.
(12) Road Names. The road name shall be approved by the Planning
Commission, based upon recommendations from the Fire Department and
the Livingston County Road Commission. Proposed names will be
checked against other existing roads within the Township for potential
conflicts that may be confusing to emergency services. Any proposed
roadway which is an extension of, or in a direct line with, an existing road
shall carry the name of the road that is in existence at the time the proposal
is made.
(13) Signs. All signs within the private road or access easement shall be
identified on the site plan and be in accordance with the Michigan Manual
of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, unless the Planning Commission
approves another type of design for consistency with the character of the
development. Road signs shall be provided at all intersections. These
signs shall contrast in terms of color with public road signs with a white
background and green letting, and shall indicate the road is private.
(c) Final Acknowledgement. At the completion of the private road construction,

The intent of this Article is to regulate signs and to minimize outdoor advertising
within the Township to protect public safety, health and welfare; minimize
abundance and size of signs to reduce visual clutter, motorist distraction, and loss
of visibility; promote public convenience; preserve property values; and enhance
the aesthetic appearance and quality of life within the Township. The
requirements contained herein are intended to be content neutral. The following
objectives are accomplished by establishing the minimum amount of regulations
necessary concerning the size, placement, construction, illumination, and other
aspects of signs in the Township in order to:
(a) Protect the public right to receive messages, including religious, political,
economic, social, philosophical and other types of information protected by
the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
(b) Maintain and improve the image of the Township by encouraging signs of
consistent size which are compatible with and complementary to related
buildings and uses, and harmonious with their surroundings.
(c) Recognize that the proliferation of signs is unduly distracting to motorists and
non-motorized travelers, reduces the effectiveness of signs directing and
warning the public, causes confusion, reduces desired uniform traffic flow,
and creates potential for accidents.
(d) Recognize that the principal intent of commercial signs, to meet the purpose
of these requirements and serve the public interest, should be for identification
of an establishment on the premises, and not for advertising special events,
brand names or off-premise activities, as these can be advertised more
appropriately by other methods.

of the decision, in accordance with provision of the Township Zoning Ordinance.
If a party is seeking a variance for a sign proposal from the requirements of the
Ordinance, the ZBA shall have the authority to grant a variance where the strict
application of the regulations would result in peculiar or exceptional practical

upon the applicant, provided such relief may be granted without
substantially impairing the intent and purposes of this Ordinance. The ZBA shall
consider the following in arriving at a decision. In granting a variance the ZBA
may attach such conditions regarding the location, character, and other features of
the proposed sign as it may deem reasonable. In granting a variance, the ZBA
shall state the grounds and findings upon which it justifies granting the variance.
(a) Visibility. Conforming signs could not be easily seen by passing motorists
due to the configuration of existing buildings, trees, or other obstructions.
(b) Safety. Conforming signs could not be seen by passing motorists in sufficient
time to allow safe deceleration. In determining whether such circumstances
exist, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider the width of the road, the
number of moving lanes, the volume of traffic, and speed limits.
(c) Clutter. Existing signs on nearby parcels would substantially reduce the
visibility or advertising value of a conforming sign on the subject parcel.
(d) Natural Features. Construction of a conforming sign would require removal
20
or severe alteration to natural features on the parcel, such as but not limited to:
removal of trees, alteration of the natural topography, or obstruction of a
natural drainage course.
(e) Obstruction. Construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the vision of
25
motorists or otherwise endanger the health or safety of passersby.
(f) Enhancement. Variance from certain sign regulations would be offset by
increased building setback, increased landscaping, or other such
enhancements to the premises, so that the net effect is an improvement in
30
appearance, compared to the result that would be otherwise achieved with
construction of a conforming sign.
(g) Scale. A sign that exceeds the allowable height or area requirements of the
Ordinance would be more appropriate in scale because of the unusually large
35
size or frontage of the premises or building.

(b) Sketch Plan. Small scale projects and expansions or changes in use are
permitted to provide less detailed information than a full site plan review. The
level of information is intended to be proportionate to the extent of the change
and yet insure adequate review for compliance with applicable standards.
Sketch plans shall still undergo a formal review by the Planning Commission.
(c) Administrative Review. Select small scale projects and expansions or
changes in use to sites are required to provide a plan that describes the
proposed activity, and do not require review by the Planning Commission; but
instead shall undergo a formal review for approval by the Township Planner.
(d) Exempt. Select projects and activities are exempt from site review given
their relatively low level of impact on adjacent land uses, and given that
compliance with applicable zoning regulations can be addressed during the
building permit review process.

Special land uses are uses considered to be more intense, or potentially more
disruptive, compared to the various uses in a particular zoning district which are
permitted by right. The uses classified as special land uses vary by district and
are listed in the regulations of each zoning district. These provisions encourage
cooperation and consultation between the Township and the applicant to facilitate
development in accordance with the Township's land use objectives. An
approved special land use shall be considered a conforming use permitted in the
district at the specific site where it is located. The review procedures and
standards set forth herein are intended to accomplish the following purposes
(a) Accommodate uses which are needed and beneficial to the Township but need
to be carefully located due to their potential impacts.
(b) Provide a consistent and uniform method for review.

OF AND 21-01 Intent
(a) Nonconformities are lots, uses, structures, buildings, or site plans for
developed sites which do not conform to one or more provisions or
requirements of this Ordinance or to any subsequent amendment, but which
were lawfully established prior to the time of adoption of the Ordinance or
amendment. Such nonconformities are considered to be incompatible with the
current or intended use of land, buildings or structures in the district in which
they are located. This Article is intended to meet the objectives stated below
by establishing regulations that govern the completion, restoration,
reconstruction, extension, and/or substitution of non-conformities, and specify
the circumstances and conditions under which nonconformities shall be
permitted to continue.
20
(b) The intent of this Article are to eliminate, or bring into compliance, lots,
buildings, structures and uses which legally existed at the date of adoption of
this Ordinance, but do not meet the current standards of this Ordinance. This
Ordinance also has special provisions to permit certain non-conforming
situations considered to be less harmful to continue under certain conditions,
25
but to discourage their expansion, enlargement, or extension. The
requirement and standards of this Article are intended to accomplish the
following:
(1) Terminate and remove any use, building, accessory structure or any
combination thereof that was established after the effective date of this
Ordinance and in violation of this Ordinance. Such uses, buildings, or
accessory structures are classified as violations of this Ordinance and shall
not receive any of the rights, privileges or protection conferred by this
Article for non-conforming situations.
(2) Discourage the continuation of non-conforming uses that are more intense
than the uses permitted within the zoning district and are considered to be
incompatible with permitted uses, or encourage their redevelopment into a
more conforming use.

the Zoning Ordinance developed in compliance with the requirements at
the time of their construction, but which do not meet the site requirements
of this Ordinance.
(5) Encourage the combination of contiguous non-conforming lots of record
to create lots which conform or more closely conform to current
requirements, are compatible with other lots in the zoning districts in
which they are located, to promote the public health, safety and welfare
and to eliminate problems associated with the overcrowding of land.
Sec. 21-02 Applicability
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a
change in plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual
20
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance, upon which actual building construction has been
diligently continued and there is a valid building permit. Actual construction is
hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where demolition or removal of an
25
existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding such
work shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that such work shall be
diligently continued until completion of the building involved.
Sec. 21-03 Non-Conforming Uses
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, a lawful
use on open land, a lot(s), building(s) or accessory structure(s) exists that is made
non-conforming by this Ordinance or its amendments, such use may be continued,
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(a) Expansions. Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts
of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and
which existed at the effective date of this Ordinance. Except for single family
dwellings as permitted below, a non-conforming use shall not be enlarged,

(b) Accessory Uses and Structures. No new accessory use, building or structure
shall be established.
(c) Relocation. The non-conforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part
to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective
date of this Ordinance.
(d) Change in Use. If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use
of a building, or building and land in combination, may be changed to another
non-conforming use if the ZBA finds the proposed use is more appropriate to
the district than the existing non-conforming use. In permitting the change,
the ZBA may require conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose
and intent of this Ordinance. Where a non-conforming use of a structure,
land, or structure and land in combination is hereafter changed to a more
conforming use, it shall not thereafter be changed to a less conforming use.
(e) Removal. Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure and land in

Abandonment or Discontinuance. If the non-conforming use of land ceases
for any reason for a period exceeding one (1) year and the Township Planner
determines that the owner has established intent to abandon the nonconforming
use, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the
requirements specified by this Ordinance for the zoning district in which it is
located. A non-conforming use shall be determined to be abandoned if one (1)
or more of the following conditions exists, and shall be deemed to constitute
an intent on the part of the property owner to abandon the non-conforming
use:

permit that use may be expanded to occupy the floor area necessary for
living purposes.
(2) A single family dwelling and its accessory structures, in a zoning district
which does not permit that use may be continued, replaced, repaired or
remodeled if damaged by flood, fire, or vandalism, if approved by the
ZBA. Such approval requires a finding that the resulting building
footprint and floor area will be the same size or smaller than that of the
building before such change. Replacement of such non-conforming single
family building shall commence no sooner then receiving a valid building
permit and no latter than six (6) months of the date of damage. Work shall
be diligently pursued toward completion. The applicant may be required to
provide the Township with evidence, visual or otherwise demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the Township Planner that work is being diligently
pursued. Failure to complete replacement or diligently work toward
completion shall constitute abandonment and result in the loss of its nonconforming
status unless good cause for the delay is accepted at a hearing
before the ZBA.

building used as a single family residence, and its accessory
structures, may be continued, replaced, repaired or remodeled if damaged by
flood, fire, vandalism, accident or other natural disaster if approved by the
ZBA. Such approval requires a finding that the resulting building footprint

will be the same size or smaller than that of the building before such change
or that the building will become more conforming. Replacement of such a
non-conforming single family building shall commence within one (1) year of
the date of damage and work shall be diligently pursued toward completion.
Failure to complete replacement or diligently work toward completion shall

such repairs or improvements do not exceed the market value (as described in
paragraph (i) below) of the building or structure during any period of twelve
(12) consecutive months. This cost/value calculation shall not include any
costs associated with modernization of electrical, plumbing, heating or
cooling systems to meet Building Code requirements. Any such repairs,
improvements, and modernization shall not result in an enlargement of the
non-conforming structure. However, if a non-conforming building or a
structure containing a non-conforming use becomes physically unsafe,

safe and sound shall be permitted provided such repairs or improvements do
not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure (as

Official shall determine if a proposed alteration decreases the degree of
nonconformity.
(g) Permitted Expansions to Single Family Dwellings. An expansion (footprint
or floor area) of a non-conforming single family building or structure shall be

The following regulations shall apply to any non-conforming lot of record or nonconforming
lot described in a deed or land contract executed and delivered prior
to the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance or amendment thereto:
(a) Use of Non-Conforming Lots. Any non-conforming lot may be used only
for a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located. In any district
in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and
customary accessory building(s) may be erected on any single lot of record in
existence on the effective date of adoption or amendment thereto. This
provision shall apply even though the lot fails to meet the requirements for

in conformance with all other applicable yard setback, minimum floor area
and maximum height requirements for the district in which it is located.
(b) Variance from Area and Bulk Requirements. If the use of a nonconforming
lot requires a variance from the area or bulk requirements, then
the use shall be permitted only pursuant to a variance granted by the ZBA.
(c) Non-Conforming Contiguous Lots under the Same Ownership. To
develop a non-conforming lot(s) under the provisions of paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section, the applicant is required to submit evidence that ownership
of the lot is not under contiguous single ownership with other lots that could
be combined into a conforming or more conforming lot. The following

forth in this section. Variances and appeals shall not be granted solely upon
economic or financial considerations. The extent to which the following criteria
apply to a specific case shall be determined by the ZBA:
(a) Criteria Applicable to Appeals. The ZBA may reverse an order of an
enforcement official only if it finds that the action or decision appealed meets
one (1) or more of the following requirements:
(1) Was arbitrary or capricious.
(2) Was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact.
(3) Constituted an abuse of discretion.
(4) Was based on erroneous interpretation of the zoning Ordinance or zoning

(b) Criteria Applicable to Dimensional Variances
(1) Practical Difficulty/Substantial Justice. Practical difficulty must be
shown that compliance with the strict letter of the restrictions governing
area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk, density, or other dimensional
provisions would unreasonably prevent the use of the property. Granting
of a requested variance or appeal would do substantial justice to the
applicant as well as to other property owners in the district and is
necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property
right similar to that possessed by other properties in the same zoning
district and vicinity of the subject parcel.
(2) Public Safety and Welfare. The requested variance does not interfere
with the public safety and welfare, increase the hazard of fire, impair the
adequate supply of light and air, or create nuisances.
(3) Impact on Surrounding Neighborhood. The variance will not interfere
with or discourage the appropriate development, continued use, or value of
adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhood.
(4) Extraordinary Circumstances. There are exceptional circumstances or
conditions applicable to the property or the intended use that do not
generally apply to other properties or uses. The need for the variance was
not self-created by the applicant.
(c) Criteria Applicable to Use Variances. The zoning board of appeals may
grant a use variance only upon a finding that an unnecessary hardship exists.
A use variance is a variance that permits a use that is otherwise not provided
for in a zoning district. A 2/3rd vote of the members of the Zoning Board of
Appeals is required to grant a use variance. A finding of an unnecessary
hardship shall require demonstration by the applicant of all of the following:
(1) Unreasonable Current Zoning Designation. The applicant has
demonstrated that the site can not reasonably be used for any of the uses
allowed within the current zoning district designation. The ZBA may
require submission of documentation from real estate or market experts, or
a certified appraiser, to substantiate this finding.
(2) Unique Circumstances. The need for the variance is due to unique
circumstances peculiar to the property and not generally applicable in the

area or to other properties in the same zoning district. The applicant must
prove that there are certain features or conditions of the land that are not
generally applicable throughout the zone and that these features make it
impossible to earn a reasonable return without some adjustment. In those
situations where the difficulty is shared by others, the board may find that
relief should be accomplished by an amendment to the zoning ordinance,
not a variance.
(3) Not Self-Created. The problem and resulting need for the variance has
not been self-created by the applicant and/or the applicant's immediate
predecessor.
(4) Capacity of Roads, Infrastructure and Public Services. The capacity
and operations of public roads, utilities, other facilities and services will
not be significantly compromised.
(5) Character of Neighborhood. The use variance will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood nor be of detriment to adjacent properties.
(d) Record of Appeal. The ZBA shall prepare and retain a record of each appeal,
and shall base its decision on this record. This record shall include all of the
following:
(1) The relevant administrative records and the administrative orders issued
thereon relating to the appeal.
(2) The notice of the appeal.
(3) Such documents, exhibits, plans, photographs, or written reports as may be
submitted to the ZBA for its consideration.
(4) The written findings of fact, the decisions, and the conditions imposed by
the ZBA in acting on the appeal shall be entered into the official record,
after being signed by the chairperson of the ZBA, thereby effectuating the
decision and any conditions imposed thereon.
(5) Any approval granted by the ZBA may be made subject to such conditions
as the ZBA may require, including deed restrictions and performance
guarantees, to ensure that the applicable review standards are satisfied.

with the granting of any appeal or variance.
(e) Appeal of ZBA Decision to Court. Any appeal of a decision by the Zoning
Board of Appeals must be filed within thirty (30) days after the ZBA certifies
its decision in writing, signed by the chairperson, or within twenty-one (21)
days after the ZBA approves the minutes of its decision, whichever occurs

completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.
(b) Use Establishment. No order of the ZBA allowing the use of a building
premises shall be valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months unless
such a use is established within such period; provided, however, that where
such use permitted is dependent upon the erection or alteration of a building
or structure, such order shall continue in force and effect if a building permit
for said erection or alteration is obtained within such period and such erection

(f) Conditional Rezonings.
Conditional rezonings are a voluntarily offered contract from an applicant to a
municipality that offers a tightly packaged project that may not by itself be
harmonious with the surrounding properties. For a proposed rezoning, where
the applicant is proposing a specific use and a traditional rezoning may open
up future uses on a broader scale that may not be harmonious to surrounding
property, a conditional rezoning may be proposed. Conditional rezonings
allows negotiation between the applicant and the Township. The applicant
initially submits a conceptual conditional zoning agreement (CCZA) to the
Township and the Township reviews and either accepts or denies the proposal
based on the master plan for the Township. The conditions in the CCZA must
be voluntary and equally or more restrictive than the regulations that would
normally apply under the proposed zoning district. The applicant follows the
basic process that regular rezonings follow but includes a CCZA and a
conceptual site plan (CSP) as defined in Secs. (1) and (2) below.
An applicant requesting a rezoning shall voluntarily offer a CCZA and CSP
and application for rezoning prior to the public hearing for a proposed
rezoning. The conditions set forth in the CCZA must be voluntary and equally
or more restrictive than the regulations that would otherwise apply under the
proposed zoning district. The CCZA must be voluntarily offered by the
applicant and the Township shall not have the authority to require
modification to a CCZA without the consent of the petitioner; provided, the
Township shall not enter into a CCZA that is not found acceptable to the
Township Board. An election to submit a CCZA shall be pursuant to Section
405 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act P.A. 110 of 2006, as amended, and
this Article.
The CCZA shall meet the following requirements:
a. May include limitations on the uses permitted on the property in
question, specification of lower density or less intensity of
development and use, or may impose more restrictions on the location,

b. Shall not authorize uses or developments of greater intensity or
density, or which are not permitted in the proposed zoning district, but
may restrict the use of the property to only certain uses permitted in
the proposed zoning district.
c. Shall not permit variations from height, area, setback, or similar
dimensional requirements that are less restrictive than the proposed
zoning district, but may require more restrictive dimensional
requirements, unless variances have been granted by the Township
Board.
d. Shall include conditions that bear a reasonable and rational
relationship and/or benefit to the property in question. The conditional
zoning agreement may include conditions related to the use and
development of the property that are necessary to:
1. Serve the property with improvements, including but not
limited to, the extension, widening, or realignment of roads;
construction, or extension of utilities, or other infrastructure
improvements serving the site; or the construction of recreational
facilities;
2. Minimize the impact of the development on surrounding
properties and the Township overall; or,
3. Preserve natural features and open space beyond what is
normally required.
(1) Content of Conditional Conceptual Zoning Agreement (CCZA). In
addition to any limitations on use or development of the site, preservation
of site features or improvements described above, the CCZA shall also

agreement.

a. The CCZA and CSP must be submitted prior to the Planning
Commission public hearing. The CCZA shall be reviewed by the
Township Attorney to determine that it
conforms to the requirements
of this Section and the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act P.A. 110 of
2006, as amended, and shall confirm that the CCZA is in a form
acceptable for recording by the Livingston County Register of Deeds.
Revisions may be made to the CCZA following the public hearing in
response to issues discussed at the public hearing. Any revisions to
the CCZA must be reviewed by the Planning Commission prior to the
Planning Commission making its recommendation on the rezoning to
the Livingston County Planning Commission and the Township Board.
b. Following the public hearing for a proposed zoning amendment,
the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the
Livingston County Planning Commission and the Township Board
based upon the Criteria listed in Section 23-10(d). In addition, the
Planning Commission shall consider whether the proposed CCZA and
CSP:
1. Is consistent with the intent of this Ordinance and is clearly
in the public interest;
2. Is consistent with the recommendations of the Master Plan;
3. Bears a reasonable and rational connection or benefit to the
property being proposed for rezoning;
4. Is necessary to insure that the property develops in such a
way that protects the surrounding neighborhood and minimizes any
potential impacts to adjacent properties; and,
5. Leads to a development that is more compatible with
abutting or surrounding uses than would have been likely if the
property had been rezoned without a conditional zoning
agreement, or if the property were left to develop under the
existing zoning classification.

FCZA and PSP shall be incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an
inseparable part of the ordinance adopted by the Township Board to
accomplish the requested rezoning. The Township Clerk shall
maintain a listing of all properties subject to FCZA and shall provide
copies of the Agreements upon request. Per State law, the ordinance is
effective on the date stated herein.
(5) Expiration
a. The rezoning, PSP and FCZA shall expire two (2) years after
adoption of the rezoning, FCZA and PSP, unless substantial
construction on the approved project or phase of the project as outlined
in the FCZA occurs pursuant to building and other required permits
within the two (2) year period or has been extended by the Planning
Commission under subsection d below.
b. The FCZA shall specify that if substantial construction has not
commenced within two (2) years after the rezoning, the rezoning,
FCZA and PSP shall be void and of no effect.
c. Should the rezoning, FCZA and PSP become void, all
development on the subject property shall cease, and no further
development shall be permitted. The Township shall withhold permits
and certificates until action satisfactory to the Township is taken to
bring the property into compliance with the FCZA and approved site
plan. The Township shall also revoke permits, and certificates,
following notice to the applicant and giving the applicant an
opportunity to be heard, in addition to or in lieu of any other lawful
action to achieve compliance.
Notwithstanding the above, if the property owner applies in writing for
an extension of the rezoning, FCZA and PSP at least thirty (30) days
prior to the expiration date, the Planning Commission may grant an

(6) Reversion of Zoning. If the rezoning, approved site plan, and
FCZA become void as outlined above, then the land shall automatically
revert back to its original zoning classification as set forth in the Michigan
Zoning Enabling Act P.A. 110 of 2006, as amended. The Township Clerk
will advise the land owner, of, the reversion of zoning.
(7) Continuation. Provided that all development and use of the
property in question is in compliance with the FCZA approved site plan, a
use or development authorized may continue indefinitely, provided that all
terms of the FCZA continue to be met.
(8) Amendment. The approved PSP and FCZA may be amended by
the Township with the landowners consent. If the amendment is
considered a major amendment per Section 18-07, then the applicant must
proceed forward in the same manner as was prescribed for the original
rezoning, FCZA and PSP. If the amendment is considered a minor
amendment per Section 18-07, it can be handled administratively. The
approved amendment shall be submitted to the Livingston County
Register of Deeds for recording by the applicant after approval by the
Township Board.
(9) Violation of Agreement. Failure to comply with the approved site
plan and FCZA at any time after approval will constitute a breach of the
agreement and also a violation of this Ordinance and further use of the
property may be subject to legal remedies available to the Township.
(10) Subsequent Rezoning of Land. Nothing in the FCZA, nor any
statement or other provision, shall prohibit the Township from later
rezoning all or any portion of the property that is the subject of the FCZA
to another zoning classification. Any rezoning shall be conducted in
compliance with this Ordinance and the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act
