PREFACE 
    Part I of this volume contains the Charter of the City of Lake Charles, Louisiana, as amended, followed by a table of amendments thereto and their disposition. Part II contains the Code of Ordinances of the City of Lake Charles, being a revision and codification of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature of the City of Lake Charles, and the ordinances amendatory thereof and appropriate for inclusion, followed by a comparative table of ordinances and their disposition. 
    Part II of this volume is an entire new codification, and as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Special ordinances or those dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, changing street names, granting franchises, etc., are not included herein. For a more specific enumeration of the types of ordinances which are not included herein, see Section 6 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The Code has been republished in 2005 with the inclusion of ordinances received for codification subsequent to the publication of Supplement No. 66 to the 1970 publication through Ord. No. 13196, adopted Oct. 20, 2004. This republication constitutes a replacement volume to the prior Code. 
    The ordinances of the City have been classified as to subject matter, edited, revised and in many instances rewritten. It should be observed that the chapters have been arranged in alphabetical sequence and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also invited to the footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant state laws. 
    The source of a section is included in the history note enclosed in parentheses at the end of a section. The absence of a history note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of this Code. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the tenth section of Chapter 11 is 11-10. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections may be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections is to be added between Sections 2-2 and 2-3, they should be numbered as Sections 2-2.1, 2-2.2 and 2-2.3. 
    New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number, e.g., new material may be included between Chapters 12 and 13, by designating it as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same manner, or in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division, as the case may be. Sections have been reserved at the end of articles and divisions to allow for future expansion. 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
Charter CHT:1 Charter Comparative Table CHTCT:1 Code CD1:1 Code Appendix CDA:1 Code Comparative Tables CCT:1 Charter Index CHTi:1 Code Index CDi:1  
    A special feature of this volume to which the attention of the user is particularly invited is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, this volume may be kept up-to-date periodically. Amendments to the Charter of the City can be inserted after reprinting the pages affected, adding new pages or deleting pages in case of repeal. Likewise, amendatory ordinances, upon final passage by the City, can be edited and the page or pages affected reprinted for insertion in the Code. In such event, the new or reprinted pages then shall be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. To each amendment will be attached an amendment or editorial note explaining briefly the effect of the amendment upon the section or sections amended and the derivation of such amendment. Each such subsequent amendment when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided in Section 7 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    Each index entry has been placed under several headings, some being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which are intended as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. Additions, alterations and deletions in the index will be accomplished in the same manner as is provided for additions, alterations and deletions to the substantive provisions of this publication. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times depends largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it shall then become the responsibility of the holder to insert the amendments according to the accompanying instructions. It is earnestly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacement, and that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Honorable James E. Sudduth, Mayor, Mr. Charles Ware, Administrative Assistant, and Mr. Robert M. McHale, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance, for the interest shown by them in the preparation of the manuscript of this publication. Credit is gratefully acknowledged also to the members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout this project. 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and B. Meade White, Editor, of the editorial staff of Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida and is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Lake Charles, Louisiana. 
    The republication of the Code was under the direct supervision of Robert S. Hornyak, Editor, and credit is gratefully given to other members of the publisher's staff for their able assistance throughout the project.

ARTICLE III. - PURCHASING 

Sec. 2-28. - Procurements from small businesses; funds set aside therefor; preference to the disadvantaged. 
(a)  The mayor shall, for each fiscal year, designate and set aside for awarding to small businesses, an amount no less than ten per cent of the value of anticipated total procurements of goods and services excluding construction. The procurement so designated shall be divided into contract award units of economically feasible production runs in order to facilitate offers or bids from shall business. In making the annual designation of set-aside procurements, an attempt shall be made to vary the included procurements so that a variety of goods and services produced by different small businesses may be set aside each year. 
(b)  Awards of contracts for goods and services under this section exceeding those amounts mandating public bids, under the Public Bid Law, LSA R.S. 38:2211 et seq., or any subsequent legislation, shall be made by public bid by those businesses certified as small businesses or as businesses owned and operated by socially or economically disadvantaged persons. 
(c)  Before making a set-aside award, the mayor of the City of Lake Charles or his designee shall make a determination of whether a small business scheduled to receive the award is able to perform the set-aside contract. In making such a determination, the mayor or his designee shall include a determination of production and financial capacity and technical competence. 
(d)  At least ten per cent of the value of the procurements designated for set-aside awards shall be awarded, if possible, to businesses owned and operated by socially or economically disadvantaged persons. In the event small businesses owned and operated by socially or economically disadvantaged persons are unable to perform at least ten per cent of the set-aside awards, then the balance of the set-aside awards shall be awarded to other small businesses. 
(e)  In the event that the provisions of this section do not operate to extend a contract award to a small business, the award shall be placed pursuant to the existing solicitation and award provisions establishing by law, whereupon additional procurements corresponding in approximate value to the contract unable to be awarded pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be designated and set aside for small businesses. 
(f)  Determination of eligibility of small business status and small businesses owned and operated by socially or economically disadvantaged persons status shall be by self-certification, reserving to the mayor of the City of Lake Charles or his designee, the right to verify a self-certification, taking into consideration those criteria set forth in subsection (h) below. 
(g)  In the event that the mayor of the City of Lake Charles determines that a business is not a small business or one owned and operated by socially or economically disadvantaged persons, or in the event that the mayor determines that said business is unable to perform set-aside contracts, the small business or business owned by socially or economically disadvantaged persons may request a hearing to show cause why the certification should not be recognized or why said business is able to perform the set-aside contract. 
    The request for a hearing shall be made within ten days of the receipt of the written notice by the mayor or his designee. The request for hearing shall be in writing, directed to the mayor of the City of Lake Charles. The mayor, upon receipt of the request for a hearing, shall set the time, date and place of the hearing, which hearing shall be heard within ten days of the request for hearing.

Sec. 2-33. - Use of small businesses owned and operated by socially or economically disadvantaged persons subcontractors. 
(a)  The city has gone on record to encourage general contractors to provide opportunities for small businesses owned and operated by socially or economically disadvantaged persons to become involved as subcontractors. To that end, the city requires all general contractors to make good faith efforts to reasonably provide subcontracting opportunities of their subcontracted work in all city funded projects that are subject to the Louisiana public bid laws to small businesses owned and operated by socially or economically disadvantaged persons as defined in section 2-28(h).

(e)  Furthermore, the failure to carry out the requirements set forth herein after receipt of written notification by the city of the non-compliance and a reasonable period of time to correct the deficiency shall constitute a breach of contract, and in addition to any other corrective action allowed by law, contract, or city policy, may result in the rejection of the bid as non-responsive, termination of the contract, a deduction/withholding of all or any portion of payments due or to become due to the general contractor from the contract funds until the non-compliance is cured, liquidated damages, determination of non-responsibility, suspension for a period up to six months, or debarment of all future bids on any public procurement of the city for a period of one year, or other such remedy as the city deems appropriate after receipt of a written notice of the deficiency from the city and the general contractor was given an opportunity to be heard.

Sec. 2-108. - Hearing procedure. 
(a)  Prior to holding an administrative hearing for public health and environmental ordinance violations, or violation of any ordinance subject to administrative adjudication, the city department or agency having enforcement responsibility shall notify the person alleged to be responsible for the violation, and, where applicable, the property owner, of the violation alleged, a minimum of 20 days prior to a hearing date, and shall provide that if the described violation is abated within 15 days of delivery of the notice, the hearing may be canceled. 
    The notification shall state the time, date and location of the hearing, and shall describe the alleged violation. The notice shall state that the violator is entitled to legal representation, shall state the amount or nature of possible penalties, and provide information to permit the violator to communicate with the enforcement department prior to the hearing. The notice shall also state that failure to appear at the hearing shall constitute an admission of liability for the charged violation. However, the hearing officer may vacate any order issued on the basis of a failure to appear if in the officer's sound discretion the interest of justice requires a hearing, and shall do so upon the request of the director of the department of public works. 
(b)  The notice shall be served upon the alleged violator, and where applicable, upon the owner of the property, by certified mail, addressed to the alleged violator, and where relevant, to the owner of the address listed in the assessor's office, or may be personally served upon the alleged violator, or the owner of the property.

Any order compelling the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents may be enforced by the city court or the district court having jurisdiction over the witness. 
    The burden of proof shall be upon the city, and a finding that the violator did violate the ordinance as charged must be based upon a preponderance of the evidence. Where finding of a violation is based upon the violator's failure to appear at the hearing, the decision must nevertheless be based upon a prima facie showing of violation. 
(d)  The hearing officer shall issue a written order within five days, excluding legal holidays, of the hearing, stating whether or not the person charged is liable for the violation, and the amount of any fine, penalty, costs, or fee assessed against him, and a date by which the violation shall be corrected if such is ordered. The order may be served upon the violator either by personal service or by regular mail, or if the violator has counsel of record, by mailing or delivering the order to counsel. If the order requires that the violation be corrected, this order shall be an interlocutory order. If the order does not require abatement of the violation, this shall be the final order. If final, the order shall specify the penalties, costs, fees, and fines assessed, and shall notify the violator of his right to appeal. 
(e)  In addition to the remedy set out in R.S. 13:2575(B)(2), the city attorney or his/her designee is authorized to file a civil action in the city court or the district court to enforce the orders of the hearing officer if the violator fails to pay the fines, costs or penalties fixed by the hearing officer, or fails to correct the violation as ordered by the hearing officer within the time set by the hearing officer. 
(f)  Where the violator fails to abate the violation after being ordered to do so by the hearing officer, the department of public works may undertake to correct the violation, and the cost of such shall be made available to the hearing officer who may impose that amount upon the violator as a cost, and who shall issue a final order which shall set out all penalties, fees and costs imposed. The costs shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  Direct labor costs shall be calculated using the highest step of the rate schedule for the classifications of the employees performing the work in order to correct the violation as included in the pay plan for classified employees as adopted by the city council. Overtime labor costs will be calculated using time and one-half. In addition, an administrative overhead rate of 120 per cent shall be used to recover fringe benefits and other overhead costs. 
(2)  Equipment costs shall be calculated using the hourly rates in the schedule of equipment rates published by the Federal Emergency Management Administration. 
(3)  Any other costs for supplies or payments to contractors for correcting the violation shall be calculated at the actual cost of the supplies or at the actual cost of the contracts paid by the city. 
(4)  The final order shall be served upon the violator in the same manner in which the notice was served. 
(g)  Penalties, fees and costs shall be collected by the department of finance. 
(h)  The hearing officer, for good cause, may suspend all or a portion of his final order and may make any suspension contingent on the fulfillment of some reasonable condition.

Upon such a finding, as an alternative to denial of an initial or renewal application for an alcoholic beverages permit, the alcohol review board, mayor or city council may require owner or leasee to employ security as provided in subsection (9) as a condition to the issuance of the permit when in the best interest of the public to do so.

Disturbance-related activity: The operation of any premises of the applicant or permittee which may cause or which causes any disturbances to residents of normal sensitivities living in any neighborhood adjacent to the premises shall be a public nuisance. Police investigatory reports indicating that 12 disturbances did occur on or emanated from the premises and were quelled by police in 12 consecutive months shall constitute presumptive evidence that the permitted business is a public nuisance.

Upon such a finding, as an alternative to denial of an initial or renewal application for an alcoholic beverages permit, the alcohol review board, mayor or city council may require owner or leasee to employ security as provided in subsection (9) as a condition to the issuance of the permit when in the best interest of the public to do so. 
(9)  In accordance with their authority set forth herein, as an alternative to the suspension or revocation of alcoholic beverage permits, the alcohol review board, mayor or city council may require the owner to employ the necessary number of Louisiana post certified officer(s) or the necessary number of bonded and licensed security personnel on the premises. Any security business providing said personnel shall have an occupational license in the city. The sole job duty and responsibility of said officer(s) or security personnel shall be to maintain order and to ensure the safety and protection of all patrons and to patrol the exterior of the premises to prevent illegal activity and loitering. The alcohol review board, mayor or city council may designate any conditions necessary to facilitate the purpose of said officers or security personnel. 
a.  For just cause the alcohol review board, mayor, or the city council may review any complaint regarding the lack of effectiveness in connection with the requirement that the owner provide security to protect or prevent illegal activity or loitering on or in the immediate vicinity of the premises. If it is determined that such security is ineffective to provide for such safety purposes, the owner may be required to employ a specified number of Louisiana post certified officer(s) to adequately address issues or concerns involving illegal activity or loitering on the licensed premises. 
b.  Any permit holder who is aggrieved by a decision of the board, mayor or the city council regarding security or any other condition imposed on as an alternative to the suspension or revocation of alcoholic beverage permit shall be notified of his/her right to appeal such matter as provided for by the provisions of section 3 79 of this chapter.

    When an animal has been impounded for five full days, excluding weekends and holidays, and its owner has not appeared to reclaim it, it shall be disposed of by euthanasia unless the prospects of finding it a home or any other reason justifies detention for a longer period of time, all of which shall be at the discretion of the director or his designated agents. However, a diseased or injured animal may be destroyed immediately and prior to the expiration of five days, if in the opinion of the director or his designated agents and a licensed veterinarian, if possible, its condition is such that imminent destruction is necessary as a humane gesture and for the protection of other animals with which an animal may come in contact.

(c)  The hearing shall be conducted by the mayor or a health officer that he may designate. The burden shall be on the city to demonstrate by a preponderance of credible evidence that the colony or colonies have in fact been kept in violation of this article. If the hearing officer finds that the colony or colonies have been kept in violation of this article, then he may order that the bees be destroyed or removed from the city, within a period not to exceed 20 days, and that bees not thereafter be kept upon the tract for a period of two years. In instances where the hearing officer finds that the violations were not intentional and that the beekeeper has employed corrective actions that will probably be effective to cure the violations alleged, then he may at his discretion issue a warning in lieu of ordering the bees destroyed or removed. Upon failure of the beekeeper to comply with the order, the health officer may enter upon the property and cause the bees to be destroyed and the hive structures to be removed. In each instance in which a bee colony is destroyed all usable components of the hive structure that are not damaged or rendered unhealthy by the destruction of the bees shall upon the beekeepers request be returned to the beekeeper, provided that the beekeeper agrees to bear and pay, in advance all expenses associated with the destruction and/or removal of the bees and hive structure, and transportation expenses for their return. 
(d)  The decision of the hearing officer may be appealed to the City Council of the City of Lake Charles by filing a notice of appeal with the Clerk of the Council within ten days following the date that the hearing officer announces his decision, or if the decision is not announced at the conclusion of the hearing, then within 15 days following the date that the hearing officer places written notice of his decision in the mail to the beekeeper. An appeal shall stay the hearing officer's decision, pending the determination of the appeal. 
(e)  The provisions of this section shall not be construed to require the conduct of a hearing for the destruction of (1) any bee colony not residing in a hive structure intended for beekeeping, or (2) any swarm of bees, or (3) any colony residing in a standard or man-made hive, which by virtue of its condition, has obviously been abandoned by the beekeeper.

(c)  Standards for fire alarm receiving stations. Remote alarm receiving and transmitting stations shall comply with the requirements of NFPA 101, 2003 edition, and NFPA 72, 2003 edition. For purposes of NFPA 101, 2003 edition, and NFPA 72, 2003 edition, the authority having jurisdiction shall be the fire department, acting through the fire chief or chief of fire prevention. 
(d)  False alarms. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to reduce the number of false fire alarms received from automatic fire alarm transmitting equipment, to allow for the more efficient mobilization and allocation of the resources of the fire department to provide effective response to actual fire situations instead of false fire alarms, and to prescribe penalties for the repeated transmission of false fire alarms by automatic fire detection and alarm transmission equipment. 
(2)  Definition of false fire alarm. For the purpose of this section, any signal transmitted by automatic fire detection and alarm transmission equipment which falsely indicates a fire shall be considered a false fire alarm, whether caused by equipment malfunction, by human error, or by any other means. The determination as to whether a fire has occurred or is in progress at the location of the alarm system shall be made by the fire officer in charge at that location. 
(3)  Procedure for fire department response to and exit from location of false fire alarm. Immediately following dispatch of the fire department by a monitoring facility, the monitoring facility shall attempt to contact a designated representative of the property at the location of the alarm system to grant access to the fire department to the interior of any structures on the property. If no access is granted to the fire department, the fire officer in charge shall conduct, or have conducted under his supervision, a nondestructive exterior investigation of the property to look for signs that a fire has occurred or is in progress. If the chief fire officer in charge at the location of the alarm system determines that no fire has occurred or is in progress at that location, the chief fire officer shall leave written notification of an alarm dispatch at the front entrance of the location. After leaving such written notification, the chief fire officer and any other personnel of the fire department at the location of the alarm system may leave the location. 
(4)  Penalties: The owner of any automatic fire detection or alarm transmission equipment which transmits more than three false fire alarms from any one location in any consecutive 12-month period shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable as follows: 
a.  In any consecutive 12-month period, three false alarm signals shall be permitted without penalty. Upon receipt of the third false alarm within a consecutive twelve-month period, a letter shall be forwarded by the fire prevention division of the fire department to the owner of the premises, and to the alarm company which services the equipment if the company is known, which letter shall cite this section and give notice that there have been three false fire alarms within a consecutive 12-month period. 
b.  For the fourth false alarm signal in any consecutive 12-month period, the penalty shall be a fine of $100.00. 
c.  For the fifth false alarm signal in any consecutive 12-month period, the penalty shall be a fine of $200.00. 
d.  For the sixth or any subsequent false alarm signals in any consecutive 12-month period, the penalty shall be a fine of $300.00. 
(5)  Revocation of certificate of occupancy: If the fire prevention division of the fire department finds that any structure with a certificate of occupancy has experienced six or more false fire alarms in any consecutive 12-month period, and that such false fire alarms constitute lack of a sufficient fire alarm which renders the structure especially liable to fire or dangerous to life, the fire prevention division of the fire department may order the revocation of any and all certificates of occupancy previously issued for said structure. If a certificate of occupancy is revoked in such a case, a certificate of occupancy shall not be reissued for the structure until such time as the fire prevention division of the fire department finds that a sufficient fire alarm has been installed in and/or on the structure. 
(6)  Exceptions: 
a.  False fire alarms resulting from malicious acts by persons not under the control of the owner or occupant of the building, and false fire alarms which are a direct result of acts of God, shall be exempted from subsections (4) and (5) of this section and shall not be counted when computing the number of false fire alarms during any consecutive 12-month period. 
b.  Automatic fire detection and alarm transmission equipment which experiences undetectable mechanical problems resulting in the transmission of false fire alarms shall be exempted from subsections (4) and (5) of this section if the owner provides the fire prevention division of the fire department with verification from a service company specializing in such systems, which shall set forth the nature of the undetectable mechanical problem and the nature of the corrective measures being undertaken to address the problem. The exception established by this subsection shall only apply when the owner or occupant of the building in which a false fire alarm has occurred presents written proof to the fire prevention department, in a form approved by the fire prevention department, that the alarm system which transmitted the false fire alarm has been inspected and tested by a state-licensed fire alarm contractor, in accordance with applicable NFPA standards, within one year prior to the false fire alarm. 
(7)  Fire department standby fee: If any fire department unit is kept at any premises, waiting for employees of the premises to open the premises for inspection, for a period of time exceeding one hour, a standby fee shall be charged to the responsible party at the rate of $100.00 per hour for each succeeding hour or fraction thereof. 
(8)  Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the fire department, and the fire prevention division of the fire department, from requiring proof that any fire alarm has been fully tested by a state-licensed fire alarm contractor in accordance with applicable NFPA standards. The fire department, and the fire prevention division of the fire department, shall at all times have such authority. 
(9)  Nothing in this section shall require any personnel of the fire department to remain on the location of a fire alarm after the fire officer in charge at that location has determined that no fire has occurred or is in progress at that location. 
(e)  Violations and penalties. Whoever shall violate any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to the penalties set forth herein. 
(f)  Automatic transmission of alarms to central alarm station. 
(1)  Restricted. With the exception of hospitals or nursing homes, where central station monitoring is required by NFPA codes, only tamper switches, water flow switches or an indication of agent discharge for other types of automatic fire suppression systems will be permitted to transmit an alarm signal to the fire department. 
(2)  Hospitals and nursing homes. All components of the fire detection systems for hospitals and nursing homes which are required to be monitored at a central station shall be permitted. However, every component of the fire detection and alarm system must be compatible with the system and must be capable of operation on the primary and secondary source of power as per NFPA-71 without causing the transmission of a false fire alarm signal. 
(3)  Other premises. Where systems are not required by any code to be monitored and are monitored at a central alarm station, all components of the fire detection and alarm system must be compatible and must be capable of operation on a primary and secondary source of power without causing the transmission of a false alarm signal upon the interruption of the primary power supply for a minimum of 24 hours.

The gross receipts for a lump-sum contract are based on the actual amount of the contract, whereas, the gross receipts for a cost-plus contract are based on the actual cost of the contract to the owner including the amount added thereto as a fee. 
    Peddler. For the purpose of Article I of this chapter, a "peddler" means any person who for himself or any other person, goes from house to house, or place to place, or store to store, exposing and selling the merchandise which he carries with him and delivering the same at the time of or immediately after the sale or without returning to the base of business operation between the taking of the order and the delivery of the goods; however, any person who uses the same vehicle or a combination of one or more vehicles for the purpose of taking orders and delivering merchandise, regardless of the fact that the vehicle returns to the base of operations between the taking of the order and the delivery of the merchandise, shall be deemed a peddler, unless such person can show that the merchandise delivered is accompanied by an invoice or delivery ticket prepared at the base of operations and which conforms to the original order and that the person delivering the merchandise has permitted no deviation from the original order by allowing the purchaser to reject, cancel, increase or decrease the quantity at the time of delivery or to offset against such quantity any merchandise delivered at a prior time which is being returned. This extension of the meaning of the term "peddler" shall not be interpreted so as to prevent rejection or cancellation of bona fide orders or the return of inferior merchandise, but shall be construed so as to prevent persons peddling merchandise from escaping their tax liability by subterfuge through means of so-called "standing order" or blanket advance orders, increase and decrease in quantities at the time of delivery, arbitrary rejections and cancellations and offset of merchandise returned by reason of nonsale rather than obligation of warranty, all of which are hereby declared to be mere devices to prevent normal methods of operations so as to disguise the business of a peddler as an ordinary wholesale business. The term "peddler" shall include, but is not limited to, hawkers, itinerant vendors, and any retail dealers not having a fixed place of business. 
    Person. The term "person" includes an individual, firm, corporation, partnership, association or other legal entity. 
    Real estate broker. For carrying on each business of real estate broker, the license tax shall be based on gross income. "Gross income" for real estate brokers is defined as those fees from any source deposited into the real estate broker's agency's general fund account less escrow deposits, and less fees paid to cooperating real estate brokers. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the maximum amount paid by a real estate broker shall be $2,200.00. 
    Retail dealers to institutional consumers. For the purpose of this article a "retail dealer to institutional consumers' includes all business selling, at retail from a fixed place of business, merchandise to dairymen, cattlemen or farmers, to federal, state, parish or municipal governments or institutions, to educational or charitable institutions, to hospitals, manufacturers, public utility companies, processors, refiners, fabricators, contractors, severers of natural resources, carriers of freight or passengers, pipe lines, hotels and restaurants provided that such sales constitute the major portion of the business. 
    Return. The term "return" includes the document in the form prescribed by the collector setting forth the name, address, business class, gross receipts and other information required by the collector, to be filed with the collector prior to the date taxes become delinquent, and at the time of payment of the taxes due. 
    Separate location. As used in Article I of this chapter a separate location exists unless a similar or associated type of business is operated as a unit under a single roof or on the same contiguous tract of land. 
    Wholesale dealer. For the purpose of this article, except as specifically provided in this article, a "wholesale dealer" means any person who sells to other dealers who in turn resell.

Sec. 12-8. - Interest on unpaid taxes; penalties. 
(a)  When any taxpayer fails to pay any tax, or any portion thereof, due under the provisions of this chapter on or before the day when it shall be required by law to be paid, there shall be added to the amount of tax due, interest at the rate of 11/4 per cent per month from the due date until paid. If the term for which the interest is to be charged exceeds four years, the rate of interest for the period beyond four years shall be reduced to 1/2 of one per cent per month. Such interest shall be an obligation to be collected and accounted for in the same manner as if it were part of the tax due and can be enforced in a separate action or in the same action for collection of the tax. 
(b)  Any person who willfully fails to file any return or report required to be filed by the provisions of this chapter or who willfully files or causes to be filed with the tax collector any false or fraudulent return, report or statement or who willfully aids or abets another in the filing with the collector of any false or fraudulent return, report or statement, with the intent to defraud the city or to evade the payment of any tax, fee, penalty or interest or any part thereof which shall be due pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished as provided in section 1-8 of this Code. 
(c)  When the taxpayer files a return that is false or fraudulent or grossly incorrect and the circumstances indicate that the taxpayer had intent to defraud the city of any tax due under this chapter, there shall be imposed, in addition to any other penalties provided, a specific penalty of 50 per cent of the tax found to be due. 
(d)  If any taxpayer fails to make any return required by this chapter or makes an incorrect return, and the circumstances indicate willful negligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations, but no intent to defraud, there shall be imposed, in addition to any other penalties provided, a specific penalty of five per cent of the tax or deficiency found to be due, or $10.00 whichever is the greater. 
(e)  In the event a check used to make payment of a tax, interest or penalty due under this chapter is returned unpaid by the bank on which it is drawn because of insufficient funds in the account on which it is drawn, closure of account, stop-payment order, or any other similar reason, such shall constitute a failure to pay the tax, interest or penalty due and a specific penalty shall be imposed on the taxpayer in addition to all other penalties provided by law. The specific penalty imposed under this subsection shall be an amount equal to the greater of one per cent of the check or $5.00. The tax collector may require payment of the taxes, interest or penalties due by the taxpayer to be paid by certified check, money order or cash. 
(f)  The specific penalties set forth in this section shall be an obligation to be collected and accounted for in the same manner as if it were a part of the tax due, and can be enforced either in a separate action or in the same action for the collection of the tax. 
(Ord. No. 8471, § 1, 6-3-87) 
Sec. 12-8.1. - Waiver of penalty when return is not timely filed. 
    If the failure to make any return at the time such return becomes due is attributable, not to the negligence of the taxpayer, but to other cause set forth in written form and considered reasonable by the tax collector, the tax collector may remit or waive payment of the whole or any part to the specific penalty provided for such failure. 
(Ord. No. 8471, § 1, 6-3-87) 
Sec. 12-9. - Period used where gross receipts are the measure of the license tax. 
(a)  The basis for determining the amount of the annual license taxes provided by Article I of this chapter, where the tax is measured by gross receipts shall be as follows: 
(1)  If the business has been conducted previously by the same party, the annual gross receipts, gross fees or gross commissions earned, whether received or accrued, during the calendar year preceding the year for which the license tax is due shall be the basis for determining the amount of the annual license tax. 
(2)  If the business is begun during the calendar year for which the license tax is due, the license tax for the year of commencement shall be based on the gross receipts, gross sales, gross premiums, gross fees, or gross commissions earned, regardless of whether received or accrued, during the first 30 days of business, multiplied by the number of months, or major fraction thereof, remaining in the calendar year; however, any business which opens after June thirtieth of the year in question whose estimated gross receipts for the remainder for the year is less than one-half of the maximum gross receipts allowed in the minimum rate under the classification of the particular business, shall pay for the remainder of the year at one-half the minimum rate. 
(3)  If the business is begun less than 30 days before the end of the calendar year for which the license tax is due, the tax shall be based on the gross receipts, gross sales, gross premiums, gross fees or gross commissions earned, regardless of whether received or accrued, during the calendar year; however, 1/2 of the annual rate shall apply to such businesses whose gross receipts for the period operated during the calendar year is less than 1/2 of the maximum gross receipts allowed in the minimum rate under the classification of the particular business. 
(4)  The license tax of the business for the calendar year following that of commencement shall be based on the gross receipts, gross sales, gross premiums, gross fees, or gross commissions earned, regardless of whether received or accrued during the previous year, divided by the number of days in operation during the year of commencement, and multiplied by 365. 
(b)  The date of beginning business for the purposes of Article I of this chapter shall depend upon the type of business involved, and shall be governed by regulations promulgated by the tax collector according to law. 
(Ord. No. 8471, § 1, 6-3-87) 
Sec. 12-10. - Change of ownership or lease. 
(a)  The license tax receipt is issued in the name of the person making the return and paying the taxes and is not transferable or assignable. If at any time during the license tax year a change of ownership takes place, the license tax period is from January first, to the date of sale or change of lessee. A "change of ownership" occurs when a business is sold or leased, and does not include changes in partnership or corporate shares. 
(b)  The new owner or lessee shall pay another license tax, as the license tax receipt issued to the former owner or lessee is not transferable or assignable. The license tax period for the new owner or lessee covers the date of transfer of ownership or lease to December 31st of the license year. The collector shall be notified within ten days when a change is effected. 
(Ord. No. 8471, § 1, 6-3-87) 
Sec. 12-11. - Failure to pay tax; rule to collect taxes. 
    Failure to pay the tax levied by Article I of this chapter shall ipso facto, without demand or putting in default, cause the tax, interest, penalties, and costs to become immediately delinquent, and the collector is hereby vested with authority, on motion in a court of competent jurisdiction, to take a rule on the delinquent taxpayer to show cause in not less than two nor more than ten days, exclusive of holidays, why the delinquent taxpayer should not be ordered to pay the total amount due and owing under this article. This rule may be tried out of term and in chambers and shall always be tried by preference. If the rule is made absolute, the order therein rendered shall be considered a judgment in favor of the city. The collector may estimate the license tax due in the same manner as is provided by law or ordinance for collection of sales and use taxes, and assess the same, the assessment, when sworn to by the collector or his agent or designee, shall be presumed to be correct and the burden shall be upon the taxpayer to prove the contrary. 
(Ord. No. 8471, § 1, 6-3-87) 
Sec. 12-12. - Class of business. 
    In order to calculate the license tax for a business location at which business activities are carried on that fall under more than one tax basis schedule, gross receipts, fees or commissions for each group of activities falling under each schedule must be compared. The rate for the schedule which constitutes the major portion of the gross receipts, fees or commissions will be used. However, the total gross receipts, fees or commissions for all business activities carried on at the business location, minus any applicable deductions, are applied to the schedule to compute the tax. 
(Ord. No. 8471, § 1, 6-3-87) 
Sec. 12-13. - Special provisions.

(1)  In addition to observations by law enforcement officials, complaints of actions in violation of this section may be enforced by the filing of a written and verified affidavit with the appropriate law enforcement agency by any citizen affected by the prohibited acts. The provisions of this section do not preclude any aggrieved person from filing a lawsuit in a court of competent jurisdiction and venue against another for a civil cause of action. 
(2)  To aid in the enforcement of this section the police department may make impulsive sound measurements. Such measurements may be used by the trier of fact to aid in making a determination as to whether a violation has occurred. Indoor sound level measurements shall be taken at least three feet from any wall, floor or ceiling and all exterior doors and windows may, at the discretion of the investigator, be closed. When measuring total sound level, the configuration of the windows and doors shall be the same and all sound sources within the dwelling unit must be shut off (e.g., television, stereo). Measurements shall not be taken in areas which receive only casual use such as hallways, closets and bathrooms. Accordingly, for purposes of this provision the following guidelines shall be used:

Impulsive sound which repeats four or more times in any hour shall be measured as continuous sound. "dbC" means the sound level as measured using the "C" weighting network with a sound level meter reading the standards set forth in ANSI S1.4-1983 or its successors. The unit of reporting is dB(C). 
The "C" weighting network is more sensitive to low frequencies than is the "A" weighting network.

Sec. 18-21. - Processions, marches, parades or demonstrations-permits; liability; bond; exemptions; penalty. 
(a)  No group, association, or organization may conduct any procession, march, parade, or public assembly of any kind for whatever purpose on any city public roadway, or portion thereof, unless there has first been obtained a permit therefore in compliance with the provisions of this section. In all cases the person or the group, association, or organization to whom the permit is issued shall be liable for all damage to property or persons which may arise out of or in connection with any such procession, march, parade, or public assembly for which such a permit is issued. For purposes of this section, a public roadway includes the paved or traveled roadway surface which is maintained or designated for vehicular traffic or on-street parking, including adjoining roadway shoulders but excluding any sidewalk or neutral ground. 
(1)  No procession, march, parade, or public assembly of any kind as particularly described in section 18-21(a), shall be eligible for a permit, if such procession, march, parade, or public assembly prohibits public access to an actual church facility during any regularly scheduled Sunday church service(s) and there are no other reasonable route(s) for access to the actual church facility. 
(b)  The permit application must be submitted to the mayor, or his designee, for approval and include such information as may be required by the city to provide for traffic control and protective services and to otherwise meet the requirements of this section. Each such application shall specify the date, time, location, and approximate size and duration of the procession, march, parade, or assembly for which the permit is sought, and the application and permit shall be valid only for the individual date and time and place so specified. 
(c)  Permits may be granted by the mayor, or his designee, provided that the applicant shall pay a permit fee of $375.00 and furnish a policy of general liability insurance in the aggregate amount of at least $100,000.00 naming the city, its agents and employees as additional insureds for any damage or loss to the city or others which may occur as the result of or in connection with the procession, march, parade, or public assembly for which a permit is sought. A separate application shall be required for each date for which a permit is sought or required herein; provided, however, that the mayor may waive the required permit fee with respect to an event that is conducted on the boardwalk at the civic center and/or on Bord du Lac Drive and is less than one hour in duration. Not more than one permitted event may be held or scheduled at the civic center on any given day. 
(d)  In addition to the permit fee assessed by this article, processions, marches, parades, or assemblies organized that result in a cost to the city (security, barricades, clean up, etc.) of more than $5,000.00 will require approval from the city council. This projected cost is to be determined by an estimate provided by involved departments (law enforcement, police, fire, public works, etc.) and submitted to city administration along with the permit application. If the cost exceeds $5,000.00, an upfront payment of all or some of the amount exceeding $5,000.00 may be required. Requests for variances from this policy must be made to the city council at least 90 days prior to the event. It is highly recommended that nonprofit organizations applying for a permit submit, along with their application and insurance, proof of their IRS-designated nonprofit status, a certificate of incorporation from the Louisiana Secretary of State, and a statement stating which charitable organization will receive the event proceeds and what percentage of the event proceeds the organization will receive. 
(e)  In the event that inclement weather leads to the cancellation of the permitted event, permit fees or costs paid in advance toward the event may be eligible for a full refund if written notice of the cancellation is provided to the coordinating law enforcement agency at least 48 hours in advance and/or prior to the deployment of any city services. If written notice of the cancelation is provided to the coordinated law enforcement agency at least 24 hours in advance and/or prior to the deployment of any city services, a partial refund may be granted. 
(f)  The provisions of this section shall apply to all groups, associations, or organizations regardless of their race, creed, gender, national origin, or political beliefs or its members; provided, however, that the requirement for paying a permit fee and providing a certificate of insurance shall not apply to any parade or procession held or sponsored by the city. The city council may waive the requirements of this article by separate resolution or ordinance. 
(g)  Each organization agrees to defend, indemnify, save and hold harmless the city and/or its members of the city council, mayor, department heads, employees, volunteers, and/or agents for any and all claims, demands and liability arising out of injury or death to any person or damage to property that may occur or arise out of any act, omission, negligence, or strict liability to the organization or its members, except for those claims or demands arising out of the sole negligence or strict liability of the city and/or its members of the city council, mayor, department heads, employees, volunteers, and/or agents.

The slope of the building sewer shall in no event be less than 1/8 inch per foot for four-inch pipe. 
(h)  Elevation laying of sewer; changes in direction. Whenever possible the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to and within three feet of any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. 
(i)  Procedure where building drain too low. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer. 
(j)  Excavations generally; pipe laying and backfill. All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the plumbing inspector. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specification (C-12) latest revision, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected. 
(k)  Joints and connections. All joints and connections shall be made gas-tight and watertight. Cast-iron pipe joints shall be firmly packed with waterproof packing. No paint, varnish or other coatings shall be permitted on the jointing material until after the joint has been tested and approved. All joints in vitrified clay pipe or between VC pipe and cast-iron pipe shall be made with an approved bituminous jointing material or a compression joint meeting ASTM-C425 specifications. Where a hot-poured joint is used, the joint shall first be caulked with jute, hemp or similarly approved material. The bituminous material for hot-poured joints shall not soften sufficiently to destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit nor be soluble in any of the wastes carried by the drainage system. 
(l)  Connection of building sewer to public sewer generally. The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the property line, if a service branch is available at a suitable location. Where no properly located service is available a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer and a suitable wye or tee saddle installed to receive the building sewer. The invert of the saddle shall be in the upper quadrant of the main line of the public sewer. A net workmanlike connection shall be made and the saddle made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. 
(m)  Notification of readiness for inspection; supervision of connections.

(4)  To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge from the publicly owned treatment works; 
(5)  To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the publicly owned treatment works; and 
(6)  To enable the city to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the publicly owned treatment works is subject. 
    This ordinance shall apply to all users of the publicly owned treatment works. The ordinance authorizes the issuance of individual wastewater discharge permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; [and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein]. 
(b)  Administration. Except as otherwise provided herein, the control authority shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this ordinance. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon control authority may be delegated by the control authority to a duly authorized city employee. 
PART II. GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS 
    No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into any sewer the following described substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of the director that such wastes can harm the sewers, wastewater treatment plant processes or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property or constitute a nuisance. All categorical users and significant industrial users are to be in compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. The substances prohibited are: 
(a)  General prohibitions. A user may not introduce into the public sewer any pollutant(s) which may cause pass-through or interference. The general prohibitions and specific prohibitions of this section apply to each user introducing pollutants into the public sewer whether or not the user is subject to other National Pretreatment Standards or any national, state, or local pretreatment requirements. 
(b)  Discharge of stormwater, surface water to sanitary sewer prohibited. It is unlawful for any person to discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the control authority. 
(c)  Designation of sewers for discharge of stormwater, etc. In addition to other requirements of federal, state or local law stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged only to such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the plumbing inspector or the director of public works. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process water may be discharged, upon approval of the plumbing inspector or the director of public works, to a storm sewer or natural outlet. 
(d)  Materials prohibited in sewers. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged objectionable items or any of the following described waters or wastes to any public sewers:

Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius). Any liquid or vapor that causes the wastewater entering the sewage treatment plant to exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). The prohibitive discharge standard for these substances is zero discharge under all circumstances. Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Centigrade using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
(2)  Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquors, or gases in sufficient quantity (either singly or in interaction with other wastes), to contaminate the sludge of any municipal system, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the wastewater treatment plant. 
(3)  Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5 or higher than 9.0, or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and personnel of the sewage works. 
(4)  Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the proper operation of the sewage works such as, but not limited to, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, either whole or ground by garbage grinders. 
(5)  Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, COD, etc.) released in a discharge to a sewage treatment plant at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference in the sewage treatment plant either singly or by interaction with other pollutants. 
(6)  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass-through. 
(7)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
(8)  Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the City of Lake Charles Wastewater Division. 
(9)  Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes. 
(10)  Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by control authority in an individual wastewater discharge permit. 
(11)  Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail toxicity test. 
(12)  Any water or wastes containing fats, wax, grease or oil in a quantity sufficient to cause pass-through or interference, whether emulsified or not, or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32 degrees and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (zero and 65 degrees Celsius) or exceeds 100 mg/l. 
(13)  Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. 
(14)  Any waters or wastes containing strong acid, iron pickling wastes, or concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not.

(16)  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the director in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(17)  Waste discharges which exert or cause: 
a.  Unusual concentrations of suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries, and lime residues and organic materials) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, starch, sugar, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate). 
b.  Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent. 
c.  Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works. 
d.  Unusual flows or concentrations of wastes constituting "slugs" as defined herein. 
(18)  Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which that might cause excessive foaming in the POTW. 
(19)  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the process employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
(20)  Discharge of toxic materials or heavy metals shall be reviewed by the director of public works and special attention shall be given to those prohibited hazardous materials which are specified in the local limits. 
(e)  Action resulting from deposit of deleterious wastes. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) of this section, and which in the judgment of the director of public works, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the director of public works may (subject to the limitations of subsections (d) of this section): 
(1)  Issue a cease and desist order which shall order the immediate halt of such discharge; suspend the wastewater treatment service; reject the wastes; or physically sever the industry's connection to the public sewer. 
(2)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers. 
(3)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge. 
(4)  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes and sewer charges under the provisions of sections 21-96.1 and 21-97 of this division. If the director of public works permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plans and equipment shall be subject to his review and approval, and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and law. 
(f)  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with the categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471. 
(1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the control authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsection (f)(5) and (6). 
(2)  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the control authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
(3)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the control authority shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(4)  A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.15] 
a.  Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for are met). 
b.  Criteria. 
1.  Either (i) The applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or (ii) The industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters. 
2.  Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere. 
3.  Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this section. 
4.  Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW discharges. The city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result. 
(5)  When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the control authority. the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsection (f)(5)a.1. through 5., below. 
a.  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user must: 
1.  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit; 
2.  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
3.  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
4.  Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge; and 
5.  Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits. 
b.  An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must: 
1.  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
2.  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
3.  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the control authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 per cent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection (f)(5)a.3 of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the control authority will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
4.  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection (f)(5)a.1 of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
c.  When developing equivalent mass limits, the control authority: 
1.  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
2.  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
3.  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 21-75, Part II(j). The industrial user must also be in compliance with section 21-75.1 regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
(6)  The control authority may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the control authority. 
(7)  Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(8)  Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 
(9)  Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the control authority within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the control authority of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate. 
(g)  State pretreatment standards. Users must comply with state pretreatment standards codified at LAC 33; IX, Subpart 2, Chapter 61. 
(h)  Local limits. The control authority is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 CFR 403.5(c). 
    Local limits. The city has established local limits in accordance with the federal pretreatment regulations. The limits as listed in the tables below are either maximum industrial user headworks loading in lbs./day or maximum daily industrial user concentrations in milligrams per liter to each respective treatment plant. No industrial user will be allowed to discharge those pollutants limited by concentration (milligrams per liter) at daily maximum concentrations greater than values tabulated herein. 
    The local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. The control authority may impose mass limitations in addition to the concentration-based limitations below.

    Wastewater strength that is greater than the concentrations stated above shall pay an additional surcharge according to section 21-97. 
    The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this ordinance. 
    Where an industrial user is subject to categorical pretreatment standard(s) that control pollutants not enumerated above, or contain limitations that are more stringent than indicated above, the industrial user is subject to the requirements of the categorical pretreatment standard(s). 
(i)  The control authority may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits to implement local limits and the requirements of section 21-75, Part II(a)-(d). 
(j)  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The control authority may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(k)  Pretreatment facilities. All (categorical, significant, nonsignificant and small volume/quantity) users shall provide the installation of wastewater treatment, pollution control, or construction of appropriate containment devices as necessary to comply with this ordinance and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 21-75, Part II(a)-(d) of this article within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the control authority, whichever agent is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the users expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the control authority for review, and shall be acceptable to the control authority before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. 
(l)  Pollution prevention. The Pollution Prevention Act enacted in 1990 set forth a policy from which best management practice guidelines can be established in order to facilitate pollution prevention. Best management practices (BMPs) are inherently pollution prevention practices. The methodology involved in pollution prevention may include but is not necessarily limited to the following: 
(1)  Source reduction: 
a.  Good operating practices 
1.  Inventory control 
2.  Employee training 
3.  Spill control 
4.  Segregating waste streams 
5.  Efficient production scheduling 
b.  Input material substitutions 
c.  Product changes 
d.  Technology changes 
1.  Process changes 
2.  Equipment changes 
(2)  Recycling; 
a.  Reuse 
1.  Closed loop recycling 
2.  Other recycling 
b.  Reclamation 
(m)  Review and approval of certain wastes; preliminary treatment generally. The admission into the public sewers of any water or waste having: 
(1)  A five-day biochemical oxygen demand greater than 240 parts per million by weight (240 mg/l); or 
(2)  More than 240 parts per million by weight of suspended solids; or 
(3)  Any quantity of substances having the characteristics described in subsection (d); or 
(4)  An average daily flow greater than two per cent of the average daily sewage flow of the city's receiving wastewater treatment plant; shall be subject to the review and approval of the director of public works. Where necessary, in the opinion of the director of public works, the owner shall provide, at his expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to: 
a.  Reduce the biochemical oxygen demand to 240 parts per million and the suspended solids to 240 parts per million by weight; or 
b.  Reduce the objectionable characteristics or constituents to within the maximum limits provided for in subsection (d); or 
c.  Control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes. 
    Plans, specifications and any other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the health officer of the Louisiana State Board of Health, and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until said approvals are obtained in writing. 
(n)  Additional pretreatment measures. 
(1)  Screens shall be provided when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary to reduce the concentration of industrial wastes to acceptable levels. Screens shall be of a type and capacity approved by the director and shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Failure by the owner to properly clean and maintain these units shall be considered sufficient cause for disconnection of premises from the public sewer, or punitive actions as provided for in this article. 
(2)  Whenever deemed necessary, the control authority may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this division. 
(3)  The control authority may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure the equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(4)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(5)  Control manholes. The control authority may require an industrial user to install at its own expense a suitable control manhole to facilitate observation and sampling of industrial waste. Such manhole and any monitoring or measuring devices required shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the control authority. They shall be of such design and construction as to prevent infiltration by ground and surface waters, or introduction of slugs and solids to the sewer. The installation of screens with a maximum opening of one inch, but of sufficient fineness to prevent the entrance of objectionable slugs of solids to the sewer, may be required. The facilities shall be so maintained by the person discharging industrial waste that any authorized representative or employee of the city may readily and safely measure the volume or obtain samples of the flow at all times. 
(6)  New connections. New connections shall be properly designed and constructed in such a manner that sources of inflow will be prevented from entering the sewer system. 
(7)  Monitoring equipment. Industrial users may be required, at their own expense, to install, calibrate, use, and maintain monitoring equipment or methods necessary to determine compliance with pretreatment standards and requirements as specified by the control authority. 
(8)  Flow measurement. The control authority may require any industrial user to install, at the owner's expense, a suitable device for continuously recording the flow discharged to the city's sewer. The measuring device may be installed on the source of the water to the industrial plant if that quantity is to be used as the measurement for the sewage produced. If sufficient evidence is presented to the control authority that not all water used reaches the sewer, an estimate will be made by the control authority of the proper amount to be deducted to compute the sewage flow. 
(o)  Special agreements for unusual strength sewage. No statement contained in this division shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and industrial user whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength, concentration or character may be accepted by the city for treatment; subject to payment by the industrial user of agreed additional charges.

(8)  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the control authority to ensure compliance with this ordinance, and state and federal laws, rules, and regulations. 
(c)  Individual wastewater discharge permit duration. Upon recommendation of the director and approval of the city council an individual wastewater discharge permit shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years from the effective date of the permit. An individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued for a period less than five years, at the discretion of the control authority. Each individual wastewater discharge permit will indicate a specific date upon which it will expire, unless revoked. 
(d)  Individual wastewater discharge permit contents. An individual wastewater discharge permit shall include such conditions as are deemed reasonably necessary by the control authority to prevent pass-through or interference, protect the quality of the water body receiving the treatment plant's effluent, protect worker health and safety, facilitate sludge management and disposal, and protect against damage to the POTW. 
(e)  Permit issuance process. 
(1)  Public notification. The control authority will publish in an official government publication and/or newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice with the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, or on a Web page, a notice to issue a pretreatment permit for all significant users, at least 30 days prior to issuance. The notice will indicate a location where the draft permit may be reviewed and an address where written comments may be submitted. 
(2)  Permit appeals. Any person, including the user, may petition the control authority to reconsider the terms of an individual wastewater discharge permit within 30 days of notice of its issuance. 
a.  Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal. 
b.  In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the individual wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the individual wastewater discharge permit. 
c.  The effectiveness of the individual wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal. 
d.  If the control authority fails to act within 30 days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied.

(k)  The annual fee for industrial waste permits shall be determined by a schedule of fees fixed by the director which shall be revised annually and approved annually by the city council. In fixing the schedule of fees the director shall consider the actual costs of scientific/analytical testing, sample collection and on-site inspection. 
PART V. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
(a)  Baseline monitoring reports. 
(1)  Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (2), below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (2)b., below. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
(2)  Users described above shall submit the information set forth below. 
a.  All information required in section 21-75, Part III(f)(1)a., (2), (3) and (6). [Note: See 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1)-(7).] 
b.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The user shall provide the information required in section 21-75, Part III(f)(7)(a)-(d). 
2.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
3.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority; 
4.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with section 21-75, Part V(j). 
5.  The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; 
6.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
c.  Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized presentative as defined in section 21-71 and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
d.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in subsection (b) below of this ordinance. 
e.  Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with section 21-75, Part V(n)(1) of this ordinance and signed by an authorized representative as defined in section 21-71. 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by section 21-75, Part V(a)(2)d., of this ordinance: 
(1)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
(2)  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
(3)  The user shall submit a progress report to the control authority no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the control authority. 
(c)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the control authority a report containing the information described in section 21-75, Part III(f)(6) and (7) and Part V(a)(2)b., of this ordinance. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in section 21-75, Part II(f) [Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)], this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 21-75, Part V(n)(1) of this ordinance. All sampling will be done in conformance with section 21-75, Part V(k). 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  All significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the control authority submit no less than twice per year (June and December [or on dates specified]) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the control authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(2)  The city may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. [See 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2).] This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
a.  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
b.  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. See section 21-75, Part III(f)(8). 
c.  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
d.  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with section 21-71, authorized or duly authorized representative of the user, and include the certification statement in section 21-75, Part V(n)(1) [40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)]. 
e.  Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
f.  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the control authority must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the control authority for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
g.  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the control authority, the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement in section 21-75, Part V(n)(3) below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user. 
h.  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately: comply with the monitoring requirements of section 21-75, Part V(d)(1), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the control authority, and notify the control authority. 
i.  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(3)  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 21-75, Part V(n)(1) of this ordinance. 
(4)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(5)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the control authority using the procedures prescribed in section 21-75, Part V(k) of this ordinance, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(6).] 
(6)  Users that send electronic (digital) documents to the city to satisfy the requirements of this section must: 
a.  Documents must be an exact duplicate according to the industrial user permit; and 
b.  Must receive approval from the control authority prior to use. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the control authority of any significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change. 
(1)  The control authority may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 21-75, Part III(f) of this ordinance. 
(2)  The control authority may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit under section 21-75, Part IV(h) of this ordinance or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 21-75, Part IV(f) of this ordinance in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the control authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the control authority, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this ordinance. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (a), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(4)  Significant industrial users are required to notify the control authority immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(g)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the control authority as the control authority may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the city performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. If the city performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the city will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. [See 40 CFR 403.12(g) (2).] 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 21-75, Part V(e) of this ordinance. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of section 21-75, Part V(a), (c) and (d) of this ordinance. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the control authority, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the control authority or other parties approved by EPA. 
(k)  Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsections (2) and (3) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in section 21-75, Part V(a) and (c) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs section 21-75, Part V(d) [40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(l)  Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(m)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this ordinance, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices established under section 21-75, Part II(i). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the control authority. 
(n)  Certification statements. 
(1)  Certification of permit applications, user reports and initial monitoring waiver. The following certification statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit applications in accordance with section 21-75, Part III(h); users submitting baseline monitoring reports under section 21-75, Part V(a)(2)e.

[Note: See 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)(v).] 
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR ________ [specify applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of ________ [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under section 21-75, Part V(d)(1). 
PART VI. PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE 
(a)  The control authority shall publish annually in a newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, a list of industrial users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. For the purposes of this provision, a significant industrial user (or any industrial user) is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 per cent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1); 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 per cent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline-monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best management practices, which the POTW determines, will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
PART VII. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the control authority inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the control authority, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public without restriction. 
(Ord. No. 9414, § 1, 8-21-91; Ord. No. 9439, § 3, 9-18-91; Ord. No. 13196, §§ 1, 2, 10-20-04; Ord. No. 13366, §§ 2, 3, 5-4-05; Ord. No. 13495, § 1, 9-21-05; Ord. No. 13931, §§ 4-8, 10-4-06; Ord. No. 15522, § 2, 8-4-10) 
Sec. 21-75.1. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3), below, are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to [the superintendent] within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset [if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days]: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in the specific prohibitions in section 21-75, Part II(a) through (d) of this ordinance if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection. 
(3)  Bypass notifications: 
a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the control authority of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received with 24 hours. 
(4)  Bypass: 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take enforcement action against a user of a bypass, unless: 
1.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage. 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of this section. 
b.  The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (4)a. of this subsection. 
(Ord. No. 12063, § 2, 1-3-01; Ord. No. 15522, § 2, 8-4-10) 
Sec. 21-75.2. - Best management practices. 
    There exist small volume/quantity discharges that typically have reasonable potential for violating a pretreatment standard or requirement. Therefore, the implementation of best management practices, as stipulated by the City of Lake Charles, are required to control and reduce target pollution. The reduction of the target pollutants at many facilities will have a significant impact on the total contribution through the sheer number of facilities involved. When the City of Lake Charles determines it is necessary to regulate a group of small volume/quantity users, based on the pollutants of concern, the following minimum requirements are established to accomplish the goal: 
(1)  All small volume/quantity users within the specified grouping must either be regulated by the BMP guidelines or be permitted. 
(2)  Small volume/quantity users that are permitted are expected to comply with all of the pretreatment regulations pertaining to large volume and categorical SIUs. 
(3)  A list of small volume/quantity users being regulated under the BMP guidelines shall be maintained by the City of Lake Charles and the City of Lake Charles shall issue letters of authorization to each facility indicating the facilities intent to comply with the BMP guidelines. 
(4)  In the event that a small volume/quantity user fails to comply with the BMP guidelines, they will be permitted and expected to comply with all of the pretreatment regulations pertaining to large volume and categorical SIUs. 
(5)  The City of Lake Charles will require records from the small volume/quantity users, demonstrating compliance with the BMP guidelines, such as copies of maintenance records for silver recovery equipment or manifests for restaurants that have grease hauled, etc. 
(6)  Materials removed from pretreatment facilities including storage, handling, disposal and transportation of these wastes shall be done according to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations that pertain to the type and/or class of waste generated. 
(7)  When directed, the small volume/quantity user shall furnish documentation on a schedule established by pretreatment personnel certifying that all waste removed from the facility has been disposed of properly. The documentation shall include the date of the removal, firm or person who performed the service, method of disposal, amount and type of waste removed. 
(8)  The City of Lake Charles will conduct independent inspections to verify the information supplied by the industrial user to ensure compliance with the pretreatment standards or best management practices. These inspections will be a reduced number from the entire universe, such as a percentage of facilities regulated by the guidelines (the facilities inspected will change year to year to eventually allow for full coverage). 
(9)  When necessary, a sample shall be collected, at the owner's expense, to verify eligibility for best management practices program in lieu of an industrial user permit or to ensure compliance of an already established best management practices program. 
(10)  The BMP guidelines shall include, but are not limited to, methods such as: 
a.  General housekeeping and maintenance; 
b.  Proper handling of hazardous matter; 
c.  Employee training; 
d.  Proper labeling, segregation and storage of hazardous waste; and 
e.  Proper disposal of hazardous waste. 
(11)  When directed, the small volume/quantity user shall be required to submit reports and/or policies concerning hazardous material and waste practices that include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Communication and education; 
b.  Identification of sources; 
c.  Proper handling; 
d.  Recycling/disposal; and 
e.  Substitutes and alternatives. 
(12)  Eligibility for the Best Management Practices Program shall be evaluated either a minimum of every two years or if a significant change should occur that may adversely affect the sanitary sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 13366, § 4, 5-4-05; Ord. No. 13931, § 3, 10-4-06) 
Sec. 21-75.3. - Grease trap or interceptor. 
    Grease traps or interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the plumbing inspector or the pretreatment supervisor, they are necessary for the proper handling of waste containing grease in excess of the amounts defined herein as normal sewage concentrations and/or other material deemed harmful to the treatment plant and/or collection system. However, interceptors and traps are not required for private living quarters or dwellings. All interceptors and traps shall meet the standards prescribed in the rules and procedures established by the required regulatory agencies. All interceptors and trap basins shall be located so as to be readily and easily accessible for easy cleaning and inspection. Grease and oil interceptors shall be at a minimum size of 500 gallons and constructed of impervious materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of substantial construction and equipped with easily removable covers or grates. Where installed, the owner or occupant shall maintain all grease and oil traps or interceptors at his own expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. 
(a)  Waste manifests: The City of Lake Charles shall provide a waste manifest form, to the grease trap waste transporter, for a nominal fee for completion and signature by the grease trap waste generator, the grease trap waste transporter, and the grease trap waste disposal site for each load of waste. The transporter shall be allowed to generate an identical waste manifest form but must obtain approval from the City of Lake Charles prior to use. 
(b)  Responsibilities of grease trap waste generators:

e.  Date of delivery to transporter; 
f.  Name and signature of manager or owner. 
(2)  It shall be the responsibility of the generator to ensure that the generator section and the transporter section of the manifest are complete and accurate, with signatures. The fifth copy of the manifest shall be left with the generator. 
(3)  The generator must insure that the transporter provides the final original top copy of the manifest that includes the disposal facility's signature after the waste has been disposed of at the final disposal site. The generator shall receive this copy within 30 days of the grease trap cleaning. 
(4)  Generators shall retain, on site, the fifth copy and the final original top copy (that includes the legal disposal site) of the manifest for a period of three years from the date specified on the manifest as the date the waste was transported from the generator site. 
(5)  Generator shall ensure that the interceptor(s) are pumped out, removing all water, floating grease, and any other visible signs of grease anywhere within the grease trap, at a minimum of every three months. Any other schedule is subject to approval by the City of Lake Charles Pretreatment [Supervisor]. 
(6)  No generator shall allow a transporter to skim the waste in an interceptor(s). Interceptors shall be cleaned to the bottom at all times as per item (5). 
(7)  Upon request by an authorized representative of the City of Lake Charles [Wastewater] Pretreatment, the generator shall make any or all original generator copies of the waste manifest available for review. 
(8)  A generator of grease trap waste within the City of Lake Charles city limits shall have all liquid waste material picked up from his premises by a grease trap waste transporter who is licensed (or permitted) by the City of Lake Charles. One primary license will be issued to each transporter in the name of the owner, operator, or chief officer. It shall be the responsibility of the transporter to provide proof of this license to each generator. The grease trap waste shall be transported for disposal to a site approved by the appropriate local, state, and/or federal agencies. 
(9)  A generator of liquid wastes shall not have liquid waste in combination with hazardous waste removed from the premises by a liquid waste transporter who is not licensed for the transport of hazardous waste. 
(10)  A generator shall: 
a.  Install or provide collection device of size and type specified by the approval authority; 
b.  Maintain collection device in continuous proper operations; 
c.  Supervise proper cleaning of collection device;

e.  Clean up spills and accidents immediately and have all waste material properly disposed of by a licensed transporter. 
(11)  Penalties for generators. Failure to comply with the specifications of the BMP will result in the issuance of a wastewater discharge permit, which includes, but is not limited to, reporting requirements, and quarterly or semi-annual sampling of the final effluent of the grease trap. 
(c)  Grease trap waste transporter responsibilities: 
(1)  No person shall engage in hauling grease trap waste in the City of Lake Charles unless the owner/operator of such vehicle or vessel for grease trap waste hauling operations has applied for and been granted a grease trap waste transporter license (or permit) for such activities and has paid a permit fee so authorized by the City of Lake Charles Wastewater Pretreatment Division. 
(2)  All permits shall expire on December 31 of each year. Applications for renewal must be received no later than November 1 of each year in order to insure timely renewal. Initial applications received between January 1 and October 31 will receive a license for that year (January 1 through December 31); those initial applications received after October 31 will receive a license for the remainder of that year in addition to the next year. Hauler permits are effective only for the person and vehicle named therein and may not be transferred or assigned. 
(3)  The City of Lake Charles shall develop a vehicle registration system and shall issue a decal for each registered vehicle. All decals shall be prominently placed on the driver's side insuring the tag can be easily seen. These decals are not transferable from one vehicle to another. 
(4)  One primary license will be issued to each company in the name of the owner, operator, or chief officer. It shall be the responsibility of the owner to provide a copy of this license to each of the drivers, but each truck must have a separate tag. Each company will pay a minimum of $100.00 or $25.00 per truck, whichever is greater. 
(5)  It shall be the responsibility of the transporter to provide proof of the waste transporter license to each generator or customer. 
(6)  Before accepting a load of liquid waste for transportation, a grease trap waste transporter shall: 
a.  Determine the nature of the material to be transported; and 
b.  Ensure that the equipment is sufficient to properly handle the job without spillage, leaks, or that causes or could cause spillage or leaks of waste from the vehicle. 
(7)  A transporter shall ensure that all liquids and solids are completely removed from the grease trap and shall not return any material to the grease trap once the trap has been cleaned. 
(8)  Upon delivery of the waste to the grease trap waste disposer, the transporter shall inform the disposer of the nature of the waste. 
(9)  A transporter who holds a grease trap waste transporter license with the City of Lake Charles shall not transport hazardous materials in combination with grease trap waste in vehicle for disposal. 
(10)  A transporter is responsible for the proper disposal of all waste, both solid and wastewater that is removed from a grease trap. The liquid waste shall be transported for disposal to a site approved by the appropriate local, state, and/or federal agencies. Under no circumstances will a liquid waste transporter discharge any liquid waste into the municipal collection system. 
(11)  Waste manifests. A transporter who collects liquid waste within the jurisdiction of the City of Lake Charles must satisfy the liquid waste transport manifest system requirements. The City of Lake Charles Wastewater Pretreatment shall provide a waste manifest form to the transporter for a nominal fee. The transporter shall be allowed to generate an identical waste manifest form but must obtain approval from the City of Lake Charles prior to use. 
(12)  The transporter shall complete and sign the transporter and secondary transporter (when applicable) sections of the waste manifest form, as appropriate, when removing waste. These shall include: 
a.  Business name; 
b.  Business address; 
c.  Truck number; 
d.  Truck capacity; 
e.  Wastehauler permit number; 
f.  Total waste volume removed; 
g.  Waste description; 
h.  Name and signature of driver. 
(13)  No grease trap waste hauler shall remove grease trap waste from the site of a generator unless the generator, or his agent, completes and signs a grease trap waste manifest as required by this regulation. It shall be the responsibility of the transporter to ensure that the generator section and the transporter section of the manifest are complete and accurate, with signatures. The fifth copy shall be left with the generator. 
(14)  The transporter is responsible for the completion and signature by the generator, the transporter, the secondary transporter (when applicable) and the liquid waste disposal site for each load of waste. The transporter shall be required to submit completed copies of all food service facilities serviced in the Lake Charles city limits to the City of Lake Charles Wastewater Pretreatment personnel on a monthly basis. 
(15)  The transporter shall be responsible to provide the final original top copy of the manifest, with the disposal facility's signature, to the generator after the waste has been disposed of at the final disposal site. The transporter shall insure that the generator receives this copy within 30 days of the grease trap cleaning. 
(16)  Vehicle requirements for grease trap waste transporters. 
a.  A vehicle used for the transportation of grease trap waste shall be maintained in good working order. All hoses, tanks, pumps, pipes, valves and gauges shall be in good repair and free of any leaks which could cause a spillage or discharge of waste from the vehicle. 
b.  No vehicle shall be operated except by the owner/operators thereof or by a duly authorized agent and/or employee of the owner. 
c.  The City of Lake Charles shall have the authority to inspect any vehicle used for the transportation of grease trap waste at any time during normal working hours for the purpose of determining the condition or content of said vehicle. 
(d)  Enforcement plan for grease trap transporters: 
(1)  Written notice of violation. A written notice will be issued as a response to all violations except where the violation is recurring; and/or fines and criminal action (may) be taken. The written notice will list each violation of the grease trap waste transporter license and/or violation of the article individually and give a brief description of facts surrounding each violation. The written notice shall be served to the owner, operator or the chief officer personally and the written notice shall give a specific date (deadline) in order to bring the transporter in compliance. 
(2)  Citations and fines. Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit provided by written notice shall be issued a citation punishable by fines in the amount of $50.00 for the first violation, $100.00 for the second violation, and $200.00 for the third violation within a two-year period. Continuous violations shall result in an increase in penalty of $500.00 and may also result in termination of permit. Refusal to correct violation within five days of citation and/or failure to pay fines in the time frame specified on the citation shall result in the revocation of the permit issued to the violator and/or discontinuance of service. 
(3)  Violation categories. The different categories and number of violations allowed for each permit year are indicated below. Transporters that exceed the number of violations specified for each category shall be considered a habitual violator, which may result in the revocation of the permit issued to the violator and/or discontinuance of service. 
Upon revocation of a license, a grease trap waste hauler shall not be eligible to reapply for the same license for a period of six months to two years from the date of revocation for cause. 
a.  Permitting violations - two. 
1.  Transporting grease trap waste with an expired grease trap waste transporter license.

(4)  Show-cause order. The show-cause order will direct the transporter to appear before the control authority, explain its noncompliance and show why the City of Lake Charles should continue the grease trap waste transporter license. This order will be used after the transporter has been served with a fine and citations and said transporter has, within the time frame set out in the citation, failed to correct the noncompliance or if the transporter exceeded the number of violations allowed in one of the given categories. The show-cause hearing will be conducted before the control authority's attorney, the superintendent of the wastewater division, and the pretreatment coordinator. The transporter may be accompanied by his attorney and may call witnesses as well. The record of such hearings may be preserved by audiotape. Parties may at their own expense secure the services of a court reporter for preservation of the record. 
(5)  Illegal discharge. No transporter shall discharge or cause to be discharged to the sanitary sewer system any liquid or solids removed from a grease trap. Any unauthorized discharges of grease trap waste shall result in the imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties of at least $1,000.00 per day for each violation. The transporter shall also be liable to the city for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The city shall bill the violator for the cost incurred by the city for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. 
(6)  Transporting grease trap waste without a grease trap waste transporter license. Any grease trap waste hauler collecting waste from within the City of Lake Charles who has not been issued a grease trap waste transporter license is operating illegally. All transporters hauling grease trap waste illegally shall be issued a written warning to cease all grease trap waste hauling activity until a permit has been obtained. A transporter that continues collecting grease trap waste after a warning has been issued shall receive a $500.00 civil penalty per day. Any transporter who refuses to pay the fine and continues to transport grease trap waste shall have his vehicle impounded immediately by the appropriate law enforcement. 
(Ord. No. 13366, § 5, 5-4-05) 
Sec. 21-76. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
    In order to insure compliance with the requirements of the Code of Ordinance of the City of Lake Charles, this enforcement response plan is implemented by the City of Lake Charles. 
(1)  Notice of violation. 
a.  A notice of violation (NOV) will be issued as a response to all violations of the article, wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, except where the violation is recurring; then an appropriate administrative order, civil action, and/or criminal action (may) be taken. The NOV will list each violation of the permit and/or violation of the article individually and give a brief description of facts surrounding each violation. The NOV shall be served upon the industrial user personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) and the NOV shall give a specific date (deadline) in order to bring the I.U. into compliance. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the control authority. 
b.  Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the control authority to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(2)  Administrative orders. Other enforcement responses fall under the title of administrative orders (AO). Administrative orders for the City of Lake Charles's control authority's use are enforcement documents that direct industrial users to undertake or to cease specified activities. The control authority may use AOs to negotiate with industrial users. Also the control authority may use AOs as a second formal response to a significant noncompliance (unless judicial proceedings are deemed necessary), and may incorporate schedules and termination of service orders. For our specific purposes we will use the following administrative orders: 
a.  Show-cause hearing. 
1.  A show-cause hearing order will direct the I.U. to appear before the superintendent, explain its noncompliance, and show why more stringent enforcement actions against the user should not be instituted. This order will be used after the user has been served with a notice of violation, continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement and failed to correct the noncompliance. This order or hearing may also be used to investigate violations of previous orders. The show-cause hearing will be conducted before the city's attorney, the director of public works, the superintendent of the wastewater division, and the pretreatment coordinator. 
2.  Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. 
3.  The I.U. may be accompanied by his attorney and may call witnesses as well. The record of such hearings may be preserved by audiotape. Parties may at their own expense secure the services of a court reporter for preservation of the record. A show-cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
b.  Compliance orders. 
1.  The control authority will use compliance orders, which will direct the I.U. to achieve compliance by a date specified in the order. Such order will be issued when noncompliance cannot be resolved without construction, repair or process changes and for developing sufficient management plans, spill prevention programs or related pretreatment program requirements. Each order will list the proposed compliance plan, giving reasonable milestone dates for each major step and dates for any necessary reporting. The control authority will closely document and follow up all milestone dates prior to said deadlines. 
2.  The compliance order may also be employed when the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. 
3.  If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. The superintendent may also seek any and all remedies available, including civil and/or criminal penalties. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
c.  Cease and desist orders. 
1.  The cease and desist order will direct the noncomplying user to cease illegal or authorized discharges immediately or to terminate its discharge altogether. In situations where a discharge may cause interference or pass-through or some other emergency situation, this order (may) be used; or 
2.  When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the control authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
i.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
ii.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
This order may be issued immediately upon discovery of the problem or following a hearing. Should the I.U. fail to comply with this order, the control authority may halt the discharge by terminating service or blocking the user's connection point and/or take judicial action. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(3)  Administrative fines. 
a.  When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
b.  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days of timeframe specified on the administrative fine, be assessed an additional penalty of one percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue an additional rate of one percent for each month the fine is not paid. The unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall not exceed more than 90 days of the timeframe specified on the administrative fine. If the user should exceed 90 days, a lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
c.  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the control authority to reconsider the fine along full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the control authority may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The control authority may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
d.  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(4)  Emergency suspensions. 
a.  The control authority may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The control authority may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
b.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the control authority may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The control authority may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the control authority that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 21-76(5) of this article are initiated against the user. 
c.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the control authority prior to the date of any show-cause or termination hearing under sections 21-76(2)a. or (5) of this article. 
d.  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(5)  Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in section 21-75, Part IV(i) of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
a.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
b.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
c.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
d.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
e.  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 21-75 of this article. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 21-76(2)a. of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the control authority shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 9414, § 1, 8-21-91; Ord. No. 13931, § 9, 10-4-06; Ord. No. 15522, § 2, 8-4-10) 
Sec. 21-76.1. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may petition the city court of Lake Charles, Louisiana, through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the user. The control authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. Another avenue of the enforcement response plan is the use of civil action, which will be used to secure court-ordered action to correct violations and to secure penalties for violations, including the recovery of costs to the POTW of the noncompliance. The proceeding to recover any civil penalty shall be commenced by petition of the control authority calling upon the city attorney to maintain an action for injunction to cause correction of any such violation and for assessment and recovery of the civil penalty. Civil litigation, for the control authority's purpose, will be pursued when corrective action is costly and complex or when the I.U. is considered to be unwilling to cooperate. 
(1)  Every user who has violated or who shall continue any violation of any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The control authority may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. In addition, the said violator shall indemnify the control authority for all fines and penalties issued against the control authority for violation of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution. Criminal prosecution is another tool in the enforcement response plan which is a formal process charging individuals and/or corporate business with violations of the sewer use ordinance and which may result in the violator being found guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(1)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 30 days, or both. 
(2)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000.00, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than 30 days, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(3)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this ordinance, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this ordinance shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 30 days, or both. 
(4)  In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 30 days, or both. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this ordinance are not exclusive. The control authority may take any, all or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the control authority may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the control authority is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 13931, § 9, 10-4-06; Ord. No. 15522, § 2, 8-4-10) 
Sec. 21-76.2. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(a)  Liability insurance. The control authority may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this ordinance, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 
(b)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(Ord. No. 13931, § 10, 10-4-06) 
Sec. 21-77. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Right of entry: Inspection and sampling. The director of public works, his deputy, agent or representative, the plumbing inspector and other duly authorized employees shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this ordinance and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the control authority ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the control authority shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The control authority shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The control authority may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the control authority and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the control authority access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this ordinance. 
(b)  Search warrants. If the control authority has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, the control authority may seek issuance of a search warrant from the city court of the City of Lake Charles, Louisiana. 
(Ord. No. 9414, § 1, 8-21-91; Ord. No. 15522, § 2, 8-4-10) 
Sec. 21-78. - Penalties. 
(a)  Whoever shall knowingly make a false statement that is: 
(1)  Calculated to obtain from the plumbing inspector any approval or permit required under section 21-73(b) or 21-74(a); or 
(2)  Submitted in any information return, application, or other paper filed pursuant to section 21-73 or 21-74, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined in an amount not exceeding $100.00. Any person who has made a statement described in subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section while believing the statement to be true, but who subsequently learns of a material error therein, shall be deemed to have violated this section if he fails to notify the plumbing inspector within ten days of said discovery. 
(b)  It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly allow sewerage facilities to be used, or to place sewerage facilities in operation by connecting them, directly or indirectly, to liquid-carrying conduits, before a permit required by either section 21-73(b) or 21-74(a) hereof has been issued, and said misdemeanor shall subject any person convicted thereof to a fine of not more than $100.00. Each day in which a person allows facilities to be used in violation of this section shall be deemed a separate offense. 
(c)  Tampering with public sewers and equipment. No person, without lawful authority, shall do any of the following: 
(1)  Maliciously, willfully or negligently move, deface, damage, destroy, uncover or otherwise improperly tamper with any structure, appurtenance or wastewater equipment or device, sign, or signal, or any part of the device, sign, or signal that is part of the POTW. 
(2)  No unauthorized persons shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer, or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining written permission from the control authority. 
(3)  Knowingly move, damage, destroy, or otherwise improperly tamper with a manhole cover. 
(4)  Discharge wastewater into a public sewer system that causes damage to the POTW. 
    A minimum fee of $250.00 for first offense, up to $1,000.00 for reoccurring offenses, plus costs incurred by the city for the repair and replacement of its facilities shall be made for any illegal tampering. This fee is cumulative of all other remedies of the city, including the filing of criminal charges for tampering. 
(d)  Fats, oils, and grease (FOG). Organic polar compounds derived from animal and/or plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride molecules. These substances are detectable and measurable using analytical test procedures established in 40 CFR 136, as may be amended from time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as "grease" or "greases." 
    This ordinance was developed in an effort to curb the expense of sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) from fats, oils and grease accumulation in the sanitary sewer mains caused by the improper management of grease. 
    Once in the sewer system, the FOG can clog sewer lines as it collects and coats the pipes, eventually becoming as hard as concrete. Over time, sewer pipe flows can be restricted and the lines can even seal completely. The restricted flow can cause the sewer system to back up, resulting in a sanitary sewer overflow (SSO), where sewer water flows out of a manhole cover and along the ground. These overflows can contaminate the ground, local water bodies and any property that the sewerage contacts. 
    The improper management of FOG is not only a hazard to the environment and potentially the public's health, it also results in added financial burdens to both business establishments and wastewater treatment plants. Lines clogged with FOG deposits require cleaning by the establishment when it involves business-owned pipes and by the wastewater treatment plant operator for sewer system pipes. Operations at treatment plants can also be negatively impacted. 
    Any person, apartment complex, food service or business facility whose operations cause or allow excessive grease to discharge or accumulate in the City of Lake Charles wastewater collection and treatment system may be liable to the city for all costs. Failure to pay all service related charges may also be grounds for sewer service discontinuance. 
    The cost may include, but is not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Service calls for sewer line blockages. 
(2)  Line cleaning. 
(3)  Line and pump repair. 
(4)  Labor cost. 
(5)  Material and equipment. 
(6)  Cleanup. 
(7)  Disposal of said material. 
(8)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary. 
    Determination of fees. Excessive grease discharge or accumulation in the wastewater collection system, shall be determined based on the following amounts: 
(1)  Service calls for sewer line blockages. 
(2)  Line cleaning. 
(3)  Line and pump repair. 
(4)  Labor cost. 
(5)  Material and equipment. Costs shall be fixed in accordance with an annual price list provided by the vendor utilized by the city. 
(6)  Cleanup. 
(7)  Disposal of said material. 
(8)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary. 
    The city has the option to take additional action against any facility that has caused three or more sanitary sewer blockages in one calendar year due to excess grease accumulation.

Such best management practices may include, but not be limited to, the following measures: 
a.  Ensuring that existing vegetation is preserved where feasible and that disturbed portions of the site are stabilized as soon as practicable in portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or permanently ceased. Stabilization measures may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding, mulching, geotextiles, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, protection of trees, preservation of mature vegetation, and other appropriate measures; 
b.  Use of structural practices to divert flows from exposed soils, store flows, or otherwise limit runoff and the discharge of pollutants from the site to the extent feasible; 
c.  Minimization of the tracking of sediments off-site by vehicles, the generation of dust, and the escape of other windblown waste from the site; 
d.  Prevention of the discharge of building materials, including cement, lime, concrete, and mortar, to the city's storm drainage system or waters of the United States; 
e.  Providing general good housekeeping measures to prevent and contain spills of paints, solvents, fuels, septic waste, and other hazardous chemicals and pollutants associated with construction, and to assure proper cleaning and disposal of any such spills, in compliance with state, federal, and local requirements; 
f.  Implementation of proper waste disposal and waste management techniques, including covering waste materials and minimizing ground contact with hazardous chemicals and trash; 
g.  Timely maintenance of vegetation, erosion and sediment control measures and other best management practices in good and effective operating condition; and 
h.  Installation of permanent structural measures during the construction process to control pollutants in stormwater discharges that will occur after construction operations have been completed (post-construction). These structural measures should be placed on upland soils to the degree attainable. Such installed structural measures may include, but not be limited to, the following: stormwater detention structures (including wet ponds); flow attenuation by use of open vegetative swales and natural depressions; other velocity dissipation devices, infiltration of runoff on site; and sequential systems which combine several practices. Operators of construction sites are only responsible for the installation and maintenance of permanent stormwater management measures prior to final stabilization of the site, and are not responsible for maintenance after stormwater discharges associated with construction activity have terminated. 
(2)  Personnel (provided by the operator of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas of any construction site (meeting criteria of current LPDES permit) that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site in accordance with the current LPDES permit. All erosion and sediment control measures and other identified best management practices shall be observed in order to ensure that they are operating correctly and are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters and the city's storm drainage system. Based on the results of the inspections, best management practices shall be revised as appropriate, and as soon as is practicable. 
(3)  The city may require any plans and specifications that are prepared for the construction of site improvements to illustrate and describe the best management practices required by subsection (1) above that will be implemented at the construction site. The city may deny approval of any building permit, site development plan, or any other approval necessary to commence or continue construction, or to assume occupancy, on the grounds that the management practices described in the plans or observed upon the site inspection by the city are determined not to adequately control and reduce the discharge of sediment, silt, earth, soil, and other materials associated with clearing, grading, excavation, and other construction activities to the maximum extent practicable. 
(4)  Any owner of a site of construction activity, whether or not he/she is an operator, is jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the requirements in this section. 
(5)  Any contractor or subcontractor on a site of construction activity, who is not an owner or operator, but who is responsible under his/her contract or subcontract for implementing a best management practices control measure, is jointly and severally responsible for any willful or negligent failure on his/her part to adequately implement that control measure if such failure causes or contributes to causing the city to violate a water quality standard, the city's LPDES permit, or any other state-issued discharge permit for discharges from its city's storm drainage system. 
(6)  Based on the results of the inspections required by subsection (2), the site description and/or the pollution prevention measures shall be revised as appropriate, but in no case later than one calendar day following the inspection. Such modifications shall provide for timely implementation of any changes to the SWPPP within seven calendar days (per the state stormwater general permit for small construction activities) following the inspection. 
(7)  Upon final stabilization of the construction site, the owner or the duly authorized representative thereof shall submit written certification to the city that the site has been finally stabilized. The city may withhold an occupancy or use permit for any premises constructed on the site until certification of final stabilization has been filed and the city has determined, following any appropriate inspection, that final stabilization has, in fact, occurred and that any required permanent structural controls have been completed.

     In the event a wrecked vehicle is removed to the side of the public roadway, it shall be the owner's or specified representative's responsibility to have the wrecked vehicle removed in a period not to exceed two hours from the time of placement, and failure to do so will cause law enforcement officers to have it removed at the owner's expense by calling the answering service for the appropriate rotation list. 
(d)  All emergency auto wrecker drivers arriving at the place where any accident has occurred shall obey all lawful orders given them by any police officer of the city investigating such accident and shall not in any manner interfere with such police officer in the performance of his duty nor shall they interfere with the flow of traffic.

A violation of this section shall constitute the basis of cancellation of the license without further notice. 
(l)  If an EAW dispatched by the answering service at the request of a police officer arrives at the scene of an accident and the wrecker driver himself determines that he cannot move the vehicle, then the police officer shall request a heavy-duty EAW from the rotation list.

(3)  Curb cuts. No structure, except single-family residential structures, shall be constructed, built, moved, reconstructed, occupied, or used on any parcel of land unless access from the parcel to public roadways complies with the following standards: 
Definitions: 
Frontage - The distance between property lines as in Illustration 1. 
Number of curb cuts 
1.  Driveway entrance(s) to all building sites shall be limited to a maximum of two curb cuts per street frontage and shall be located in such a way as to maximize safety, and efficient traffic circulation, and minimize the impact on the surrounding area as determined by the city engineer or his designee. 
2.  The permissible number of driveways is governed by the road frontage of abutting private property. Frontages of more than 150 feet are limited to: 
a.  Two two-directional driveways with a minimum 20 feet and a maximum of 30-foot wide throat; or 
b.  Four one-directional driveways with a minimum of 12 feet or maximum of 14 feet wide throat; or 
c.  Combination of driveways in which two one-directional = one two-directional. 
Frontages of less than 150 feet are limited to: 
a.  One two-directional driveway with a minimum of 20 feet and maximum of 30-foot wide throat; or 
b.  Two one-directional driveways with a minimum of 12 feet and a maximum of 14 feet wide throat. 
Adjacent uses may share a common driveway provided that appropriate access easements are granted between or among the property owners. 
NOTE: 
1.  All measurements between two curb cuts shall be done inner edge to inner edge as seen in Illustration 2. 
2.  Curb cut widths are measured outer edge to outer edge as seen in Illustration 3. 
Safety Zone 
Between any two driveways, there shall be a safety zone of a minimum of 50 feet along the curb line measured from inner edge to inner edge (see Illustration 2). 
Corner Lot 
A development on a corner lot will be allowed two points of access. However, no more than one access shall be onto each street. No curb cut shall be located nearer than 150 feet to the projection of any intersecting street right-of-way line. If 150 feet is not available, then the curb cut shall be placed at the furthest practical point from the intersection. If a development fronts three or more streets, only two curb cuts will be allowed for the development as defined above. 
Radius of curb cut 
All driveways governed by this section, unless otherwise specified, shall have a radius of no less than ten feet and no greater than 30 feet. For any access where multi-unit vehicles, or single unit vehicles exceeding 30 feet in length, are intended to use the access on a daily basis, the radii of the access should be determined using the minimum turning path for the larger vehicle. 
Angle of intersection with roadway 
The angle formed by the intersection of the centerline of a two-way roadway and the centerline of a driveway shall not be less than 60 degrees, except that an access driveway for frontage abutting a one-way roadway may have an angle of not less than 45 degrees. 
Conform to state regulations 
Notwithstanding any other part of this Ordinance, all sites fronting a street or highway that is controlled by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development shall adhere to regulations for curb cut, and driveway connection permits as administered by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development. 
Alternative Designs 
Where natural features or spacing of existing driveways and roadways cause the foregoing access requirements to be physically infeasible, alternate designs may be approved through the various processes. 
Schools. Schools may have one additional access provided the additional access drive is limited to school bus use only. 
Existing Nonconforming Curbs. If an establishment does not currently meet the curb cut standard, the city may elect to reconstruct the curb to bring hazardous access points into compliance. Otherwise, that driveway will be classified as a non-conforming use. 
(4)  Calculation of permitted density. In calculating the amount of development permitted on a lot of land, density or intensity shall be based on the gross area of any lot, excluding installed on-site improvements, such as roads, provided, however, that the gross area of any lot of land shall be utilized for the calculation of permitted density or intensity in the event that on-site improvements have not been installed at time the application for development approval is filed. 
(5)  Corner lots. The front yard of a corner lot may be designated by the landowner in his application for development approval. In making such designation, consideration shall be given to the predominant front yards in the immediate vicinity. The minimum required yard on any other side of a corner lot which adjoins a public street shall be 1/2 of the minimum front yard required for the use proposed to be located on the lot by the particular provisions of Article V, Part 3, applicable to such use. 
(6)  Required front yard for developed areas. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Ordinance regarding required front yard setbacks, if 40 per cent or more of the block face is improved with buildings or structures with less than required setback front yard for the applicable district, the required front yard setback shall be the average setbacks of the front yards along the block face (See figure 4). 
(7)  Minimum building setback. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, no building or portion thereof shall hereafter be constructed, moved, reconstructed, or enlarged within a distance of ten feet from edge of the street or roadway surface of any public street or highway.

Temporary uses shall comply with Section 5-206. 
(9)  Setbacks-General. Driveways, parking surfaces, paved areas, and similar improvements shall not be closer than one foot to any property line unless a curb not less than three inches in height is provided which will prohibit water overflow onto the adjacent property. Joint use between adjacent parking areas or similar uses is allowed provided the joint or common area at the adjacent property lines does not exceed 40 feet in width. 
(10)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, it shall be a mandatory requirement that for all developments which front any street corridor designated as an arterial or collector corridor, or along any federal or state designated route, there shall be an additional five-foot setback from the existing right-of-way line. This includes parking lots, parking areas, buildings, and any other permanently installed improvements. 
(11)  No more than one motorized vehicle, boat, trailer, camper, etc. will be allowed in the front yard setback of all single-family and/or multifamily use in a residential, neighborhood, and mixed use zoning district unless located on a designated driveway with an improved surface of concrete, blacktop, gravel or equivalent contained by a border defining the driveway or placed behind the front building line in a side yard and screened by a wooden fence not less than six feet in height or equivalent type buffer. 
(12)  All motorized vehicles parked in private driveways in all single family and multi-family uses shall be kept clean of debris, shall be free of flat tires, shall not be stored on blocks or stands, and shall not possess any other condition that would objectively make the vehicle appear inoperable from a public right-of-way or in plain view. Only one vehicle parked on a private driveway will be allowed with a cover designed for the vehicle which is visible from a public right-of-way. If it is evident that a vehicle is inoperative, it must be removed from the driveway until it is returned to an operable condition. Otherwise, it must be screened from public view, stored under an approved structure, or removed from the property. 
(13)  Commercial vehicles as defined in Article II, Section 2-102, are prohibited in all single-family and multifamily uses.

(Ord. No. 12231, § 1, 8-16-01) 
Sec. 5-210. - Landscape requirements. 
(1)  Purpose. Landscaping is accepted as adding value to property and is in the interest of the general welfare of the city. Therefore, landscaping is hereafter required of new development. 
(2)  Scope and enforcement. 
(a)  The provisions of this section shall be administered by the director of planning or designee. The standards and criteria contained within this section are deemed to be minimum standards and shall apply to all new construction or any existing development which is altered by increasing the floor area by 30 per cent or more of the originally approved floor area, either by a single expansion or by the cumulative effect of a series of expansions. 
(b)  All existing structures which are a conversion or change in use requiring the expansion of or substantial improvements to meet parking standards shall upgrade landscaping on the site and meet these requirements to the extent practical. The director of planning or his designee shall have the ability to waive landscape requirements on a case-by-case basis if unique circumstances exist on the property that make application of these regulations unduly burdensome on the applicant. These regulations may be waived only if there will be no adverse impact on current or future development and will have no adverse impact on the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(c)  If at any time after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the approved landscaping is found to be in nonconformance to the standards and criteria as approved on the landscape plan, the director of planning or designee shall issue notice to the owner, citing the violation and describing what action is required to comply with this section. The owner(s), tenant(s), and/or agent(s) shall make reasonable progress within 30 days from date of said notice and shall have 90 days to completely restore the landscaping as required. A 30-day extension may be granted by the director of planning or designee if a hardship due to extreme seasonal conditions can be demonstrated by the owner(s), tenant(s), and/or agent(s). If the landscaping is not restored within the allotted time, such person shall be held in violation of this Ordinance. 
(3)  Permits. 
(a)  No permits shall be issued for building, paving, grading, or construction until a detailed landscape plan is submitted and approved by the director of planning or designee. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any building or structure, all screening and landscaping shall be in place in accordance with the landscape plan. 
(b)  In any case in which a certificate of occupancy is sought at a season of the year in which the director of planning determines that it would be impractical to plant trees, shrubs or grass, or to lay turf, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued, if a letter of agreement from the property owner is provided stating when the installation shall occur. All landscaping required by the landscape plan shall be installed within six months of the date of issuance of the temporary certificate of occupancy or the site shall be deemed to be in violation of this Ordinance and the temporary certificate of occupancy shall be revoked. 
(4)  Landscape plan. 
(a)  A landscape plan shall be shown as part of the site plan development review. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, paving, grading, or construction permit for any new use, a final landscape plan shall be submitted to the planning department. The director of planning or designee shall review such plans and shall approve same if the plans are in accordance with the criteria of these regulations and the approved site plan. If the plans are not in accord, they shall be disapproved and shall be accompanied by a written statement setting forth the changes necessary for compliance. 
(b)  Landscape plans shall be prepared by a person knowledgeable in plant material usage and landscape design (e.g. landscape architect, landscape contractor, landscape designer, etc.). Conceptual and final landscape plans shall contain the minimum following information: 
1.  Minimum scale of one inch equals 40 feet, or the same scale as the associated site plan; 
2.  Location, size, and species of all trees to be preserved (do not use "tree stamps" unless they indicate true size and location of trees); 
3.  Location of all plant and landscaping material to be used, including plants, paving, benches, screens, fountains, statues, earthen berms, ponds (to include depth of water), topography of site, or other landscape features (except that location of plants and landscaping materials may be generalized on a conceptual landscape plan); 
4.  Species, size, spacing, and quantities of all plant material to be used in a tabular form (except that conceptual landscape plans may provide general plant types in-lieu-of species); 
5.  Affidavit on the plan stating that irrigation, sprinkler, or water systems, including placement of water sources, shall be provided; 
6.  Person(s) responsible for the preparation of the landscape plan, including affidavit of their qualifications to prepare said plan; 
7.  Mark indicating North; 
8.  Date of the landscape plan, including any revision dates; 
9.  Planting details; per centage of total site in permanent landscaping; 
10.  Per centage of street yard in permanent landscaping; 
11.  Dimensions of all landscape areas; 
12.  Number of required trees and number of trees provided. 
(5)  General standards. 
(a)  The following criteria and standards shall apply to landscape materials and installation. For the purposes of this section, caliper shall be defined as the diameter measurement of a tree trunk. 
1.  Required landscaped open areas shall be completely covered with living plant material. Nonliving landscaping materials such as wood chips and gravel may be used only under trees, shrubs, and other plants. 
2.  Plant materials shall conform to the standards of the approved plant list for the City of Lake Charles (Appendix A). Grass seed, sod and other material shall be clean and reasonably free of weeds and noxious pest and insects. 
a.  Where specific conditions reduce the likelihood that any of these plant materials will survive, other plants on the list may be substituted. 
b.  Other plants not on the list may be substituted at the discretion of the director of planning. The applicant may be required to provide substantiation as to the hardiness, adaptability, and water demands of the plant when used in this area. 
c.  Applicants should maintain all required landscape materials in perpetuity. 
3.  Class 'A' trees shall be a minimum of three inches (3") in caliper as measured thirty-six inches (36") above the ground and seven feet (7') in height at time of planting. 
4.  Class 'B' trees shall be a minimum of one inch in caliper as measured 36 inches above the ground and five feet in height. 
5.  Shrubs or berms not of the dwarf variety shall be a minimum of two feet in height when measured immediately after planting. 
6.  Hedges, where installed for buffering purposes required by this section, shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid visual screen which will be three feet high within two years after time of planting. 
7.  Landscaping, except required grass and low ground cover, shall not be located closer than three feet from the edge of any parking space. 
8.  Grass areas shall be sodded, plugged, sprigged, hydro-mulched, or seeded, except that solid sod shall be used in swales, or when necessary to prevent erosion. Grass areas shall be established with complete coverage within a six-month period of time from planting, and shall be re-established, if necessary, to ensure grass coverage of all areas. 
9.  Ground covers used in-lieu-of grass shall be planted in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and reasonably completed coverage within one year of planting. 
(b)  All required landscaped open space shall be provided with an automatic underground irrigation system, except for required landscaping in single-family or two-family development. Said irrigation system shall be designed by a qualified professional and installed by a licensed irrigator after receiving a permit, as may be required under the construction code. 
(c)  No tree shall be planted closer than four feet to a right-of-way line nor closer than eight feet to a public utility line (water or sewer), unless no other alternative is available. Further, a landscaping area in which trees are to be provided shall not conflict with a utility easement, unless no alternative is available. 
(d)  No tree which has a mature height of twenty-five feet or greater shall be planted beneath an existing or proposed overhead utility line. 
(6)  Minimum landscaping requirements. 
(a)  For all non-residential and multiple-family at least 15 per cent of the street yard shall be permanent landscape area. The street yard shall be defined as the area between the front property line and the minimum front set back line. 
(b)  For all nonresidential and multiple-family parcels, a minimum of ten per cent of the entire site shall be devoted to living landscape which shall include grass, ground cover, plants, shrubs, or trees. 
(c)  Landscape setbacks on thoroughfares. 
1.  Landscape setbacks are required along all street rights-of-way. For all non-residential and multiple-family parcels, a minimum ten-foot landscape buffer adjacent to the right-of-way of any street is required. If the lot is a corner lot, all frontages shall be required to observe the ten-foot buffer. Slight variances may be allowed to the minimum ten-foot landscape buffer in unusual circumstances, as approved on the site plan. 
2.  If unique circumstances exist which prevent strict adherence with this requirement, the planning and zoning commission may consider a granting of a variance during the site plan approval process to reduce the minimum ten-foot landscape buffer, provided that site design considerations have been incorporated to mitigate the impact of the variance. Unusual circumstances include, but are not limited to: insufficient lot depth or size of the existing lot, existing structures and drives, and floodplain and existing trees to be preserved. A variance may be granted if: 
a.  Unique circumstances exist on the property that make application of this item unduly burdensome on the applicant, and 
b.  The variance will have no adverse impact on current or future development, and 
c.  The variance is in keeping with the spirit of the zoning regulations, and will have a minimal impact, if any, on the surrounding land uses, and 
d.  The variance will have no adverse impact on the public health, safety and general welfare, and 
e.  A financial hardship shall not be considered a basis for the granting of a variance. 
(d)  For all non-residential and multi-family parcels, developers shall be required to plant one Class 'A' tree or two Class 'B' trees per 40 linear feet, or portion thereof, of street frontage. Trees may be grouped or clustered to facilitate site design. 
(e)  Landscape areas within parking lots should generally be at least ten feet by 18 feet (180 square feet). 
(f)  No landscape area counting toward minimum landscaping requirements shall be less than 25 square feet in area or less than five feet in width. 
(g)  For all nonresidential and multi-family parcels, internal landscape areas shall: 
1.  have a landscaped area with at least one Class 'A' or two Class 'B' trees within 65 feet of every parking space; 
2.  have a minimum of one Class 'A' or two Class 'B' trees planted in the parking area for every ten parking spaces within parking lots with more than 20 spaces. 
(h)  Within parking lots, landscape areas should be located to define parking areas and assist in clarifying appropriate circulation patterns. A landscape island shall be located at the terminus of each parking row, and should contain at least one tree. All landscape areas shall be protected by a monolithic curb or wheel stops and remain free of trash, litter, and car bumper overhangs. 
(i)  All existing trees which are to be considered for credit shall be provided with a permeable surface (a surface which does not impede the absorption of water) within a minimum five-foot radius from the trunk of the tree. All new trees shall be provided with a permeable surface under the drip line a minimum two and one-half-foot radius from the trunk of the tree. 
(j)  Parking lots, adjacent to a public right-of-way, within the street yard shall be screened from public streets with evergreen shrubs planted three feet on center attaining a minimum height of three feet, an earthen berm of a minimum height of three feet, a low masonry wall of a minimum height of three feet, or a combination of the above with a minimum combined height of three feet. A wall used for parking lot screening should be accompanied with landscape planting in the form of low shrubs and ground cover to soften the appearance of the wall. 
(k)  A minimum of 50 per cent of the total trees required for the property shall be Class 'A' canopy trees as specified on the approved plant list. 
(l)  Necessary driveways from the public right-of-way shall be allowed through all required landscaping areas in accordance with city regulations. Shared drives shall be allowed through perimeter landscape areas. 
(m)  For all nonresidential and multifamily parcels, whenever an off-street parking area or vehicular use area abuts an adjacent property line, a perimeter landscape area of at least five feet shall be maintained between the edge of the parking area and the adjacent property line. 
(n)  Bufferyards: When a buffer is required under the provisions of Section 5-209, the minimum bufferyard and screening requirements must be provided along with the minimum of one Class "A" tree (minimum three-inch caliper measured 36 inches above the ground and seven feet in height at time of planting) or two Class "B" (minimum one-inch caliper measured 36 inches above the ground and five feet in height at time of planting) for every 40 linear feet or fraction thereof. 
(o)  Evergreen shrubs (acceptable for 6' screening) shall be provided around dumpster screening wall, and the plant materials must be a minimum of three feet in height at the time of planting, unless not visible from public right-of-way or a public use area. 
(p)  For all single-family and duplex parcels, builders shall be required to plant two Class 'A' trees per lot. At least one of the trees shall be located in the front yard. Existing quality trees of at least three inches caliper size located on the lot shall count to meet this standard. 
(7)  Tree preservation. 
(a)  Any trees preserved on a site meeting the herein specifications may be credited toward meeting the tree requirement of any landscaping provision of this section for that area within which they are located, according to the following table: 
Caliper of Existing Tree Credit Against Tree Requirement 6 inches to 8 inches 2 trees 9 inches to 15 inches 3 trees 16 inches to 30 inches 4 trees 31 inches to 46 inches 5 trees 47 inches or more 8 trees  
For purposes of this section, caliper measurement shall be taken at a height of 41/2 feet above the ground, and shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. 
(b)  Any tree preservation proposed shall designate the species, size, and general location of all trees on the conceptual or general landscape plan. 
(8)  Sight distance and visibility. 
(a)  The requirements set forth herein shall comply with Section 5-203(2) of this Ordinance. 
(9)  Maintenance. 
(a)  The owner(s), their transferee(s), tenant(s), and/or their agent(s), if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping. All required landscaping shall be maintained in a neat and orderly manner at all times. This shall include, but not be limited to: 
1.  Mowing (of grass of six inches or higher); 
2.  Edging; 
3.  Pruning; 
4.  Fertilizing; 
5.  Watering; 
6.  Weeding; and 
7.  Other such activities common to the maintenance of landscaping. 
(b)  Landscape areas shall be kept free of trash, litter, weeds, and other such material or plants not a part of the landscaping. All plant material shall be maintained in a healthy and growing condition as is appropriate for the season of the year. 
(c)  Plant materials used to meet minimum required landscaping provisions which die or are removed for any reason shall be replaced with plant material of similar variety and size, within 90 days. 
1.  If any tree which was preserved and used as a credit toward landscaping requirements is later removed for any reason, it shall be replaced by the number of trees for which it was originally credited. Replacement trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter of three inches measured 36 inches above the ground. 
2.  A time extension may be granted by the Director of Planning if substantial evidence is presented to indicate abnormal circumstances beyond the control of the owner, tenant, or his agent. 
(10)  Screening requirements for permanent stormwater detention and retention basin. Purpose: Due to their nature as service features, stormwater control features, detention and/or retention basins that front a street, alley or parking lot can have a negative visual impact where they are located as well as upon adjacent properties and the adjacent public realm. The purpose of this Ordinance is to mitigate the negative visual impact from certain stormwater control facilities by requiring screening from on-site and off-site views. 
(a)  Screening and amenity requirements. All permanent detention and retention basins shall require landscaping atop each side of retention and detention basins that front a street, alley or parking lot. 
1.  Such landscaping shall consist of trees, evergreen shrubs, and emergent plantings in accordance with the City of Lake Charles Zoning Ordinance Section 5-210, Landscape requirements. Furthermore, said permanent detention and retention barriers and screening shall be subject to the same front yard setbacks as provided for other structures in the underlying zoning district. 
2.  In situations where the detention and retention basin utilizes a fence, all vegetative material associated with screening the facility shall be located outside the fence; and the fence and gate shall be an ornamental type (non-chain-link) colored black, forest green, dark brown or similar dark color so as to recede from view, unless the fence is constructed of masonry, wood, or similar natural materials, in which case it may be left to weather naturally. 
3.  Screening used for detention and retention basins using vegetative screening materials shall not count towards other required landscaping credits. 
4.  Rock riprap or other "hard armoring" shall be limited to ten per cent or less of the entire surface area of the stormwater control facility above the low pool line. 
5.  Permanent stormwater retention ponds and detention basins shall incorporate features designed to reduce mosquito populations through provision of non-chemical mosquito mitigation measures, including but not limited to: cyclical alteration of the pond level, installation of aeration/agitation features to disrupt larval growth, providing nesting boxes for mosquito-predacious birds, or stocking ponds with mosquito-predacious fish. 
(b)  Plan submittal. The detention and/or retention basins screening shall be shown as part of the site plan development review. Plans shall be prepared by a person knowledgeable in plant materials usage and landscape design (e.g. landscape architect, landscape contractor, landscape designer, etc.). Plans are to be submitted in accordance with City of Lake Charles Zoning Ordinance Section 5-210, Landscape requirements, subsection (4) Landscape plan.

(vii)  Any other information the staff finds appropriate for the Downtown Development Authority to render a decision on the application. 
(b)  Standards for relocation. A decision by the Downtown Development Authority approving or denying a Design Review for the relocation of a building, structure, or object shall be guided by: 
(i)  Whether the structure is endangered in its original location. Relocation should not be considered without meeting this first standard;

(iv)  Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood or the city; 
(v)  Whether there are definite plans for use of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be; 
(vi)  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, site, tree, or object from collapse; and 
(vii)  Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value. 
(d)  No design review for demolition shall be issued unless the applicant has demonstrated that: 
(i)  It is not economically feasible to maintain the structure; 
(ii)  The applicant has explored preservation options, such as the sale of the structure to an individual or group interested in preserving the structure; 
(iii)  The applicant has posted on the premises of the structure, in a manner easily visible from the public way, notice of intended demolition for a period of six months prior to application for a Design Review; 
(e)  Emergency. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, where the building official determines that demolition or alteration of a structure is necessary to correct a condition that is dangerous to life, health or safety, a conditional use permit may be issued under the signatures of the building official, director of planning, and the mayor. 
(f)  Demolition by Neglect. No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a landmark or included within the downtown lakefront development district shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the judgment of the Downtown Development Authority, produce a detrimental effect upon the character of the district as a whole or the life and character of the property itself. 
Examples of such deterioration include: 
  Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports. 
  Deterioration of roof or other horizontal members. 
  Deterioration of exterior chimneys. 
  Deterioration or crumbling of exterior stucco or mortar. 
  Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roof, or foundation, including broken windows or doors. 
  Deterioration of any feature so as to create a hazardous condition which could lead to the claim that demolition is necessary for the public safety. Demolition by neglect will bar a property owner from raising an economic hardship claim. 
(g)  Limitations on approval of a Design Review. Within one year of the issuance of a Design Review, or such shorter time as may be established by an approved development schedule, if any, construction shall commence in accordance with the approved Design Review. Failure to commence construction within that period shall, unless a prior extension shall have been granted by the commission, automatically render the Design Review null and void. 
(h)  Enforcement. All work performed pursuant to a Design Review issued under this Ordinance shall conform to any requirements included therein. It shall be the duty of the building inspector to inspect periodically any such work to assure compliance. In the event work is not being performed in accordance with the Design Review or upon notification of such fact by the DDA and verification by the Building Officer, then the building inspector or building officer shall issue a stop work order and all work shall immediately cease. No further work shall be undertaken on the project as long as a stop work is in effect. 
(i)  The Downtown Development Authority and the Lake Charles City Council shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a property within the designated district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of the ordinance or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such property and district. 
(j)  Penalties. Work begun or completed without a Design Review can lead to the reversal of any unapproved alterations, permit delays and fines. Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Ordinance shall be deemed a violation and the violator shall be punishable by fine of not less than $10.00 or more than $25.00 for each and every day that such violation continues.

Article 3. Standards and Tables 
Table 1: Transect Zone Descriptions. This table provides description of the character of each Transect Zone. 
T3 The Sub-Urban Zone, consists of low density suburban residential areas, differing by allowing home occupations. Planting is naturalistic with setbacks relatively deep. Blocks may be large and the roads irregular to accommodate natural conditions. T4 The General Urban Zone consists of a mixed-use but primarily residential urban fabric. It has a wide range of building types: single, sideyard, and rowhouses. Setbacks and landscaping are variable. Streets typically define medium-sized blocks. T5 The Urban Center Zone consists of higher density mixed-use building types that accommodate retail, offices, rowhouses and apartments. It has a tight network of streets, with wide sidewalks, steady street tree planting and buildings set close to the frontages. T6 The Urban Core Zone consists of the highest density, with the greatest variety of uses, and civic buildings of regional importance. It may have larger blocks; streets have steady street tree planting and buildings set close to the frontages.  
Table 2: Building Types. This table approximates the location of the structure relative to the boundaries of each individual lot, establishing suitable building types for each Transect Zone. 
a. Edgeyard: Specific Types - Single family House, Cottage, Villa, Estate House, Urban Villa. A building that occupies the center of its lot with Setbacks on all sides. This is the least urban of types as the front yard sets it back from the frontage, while the side yards weaken the spatial definition of the public Thoroughfare space. The front yard is intended to be visually continuous with the yards of adjacent buildings. The rear yard can be secured for privacy by fences and a well-placed Backbuilding and/or Outbuilding. b. Sideyard: Specific Types - Charleston Single House, zero-lot-line house. A building that occupies one side of the lot with the Setback to the other side. The visual opening of the side yard on the street frontage causes this building type to appear freestanding. A shallow frontage Setback defines a more urban condition. If the adjacent building is similar with a blank party wall, the yard can be quite private. This type permits systematic climatic orientation in response to the sun or the breeze. c. Rearyard: Specific Types - Townhouse, Rowhouse, Live-Work unit, perimeter block. A building that occupies the full frontage, leaving the rear of the lot as the sole yard. This is a very urban type as the continuous Facade steadily defines the public Thoroughfare. The rear Elevations may be articulated for functional purposes. In its Residential form, this type is the Rowhouse. For its Commercial form, the rear yard can accommodate substantial parking. d. Courtyard: Specific Types - Patio House. A building that occupies the boundaries of its lot while internally defining one or more private patios. This is the most urban of types, as it is able to shield the private realm from all sides while strongly defining the public Thoroughfare. Because of its ability to accommodate incompatible activities, masking them from all sides, it is recommended for workshops, Lodging and schools. The high security provided by the continuous enclosure is useful for crime-prone areas. e. Specialized: A building that is not subject to categorization. Buildings dedicated to manufacturing and transportation are often distorted by the trajectories of machinery. Civic Buildings, which may express the aspirations of institutions, may be included.  
Table 3: Building Configuration. This table shows prescribed building heights for each Transect Zone. The vertical extent of a building is measured by number of stories, not including a raised basement or an inhabited attic. Heights are measured from the average grade of the frontage line to the eave of a pitched roof or to the surface of a flat roof. The term "tower" here refers to an attached or detached addition to a building, not to an entire building. 
Note- "N" stands for any stories above those shown, up to the maximum. Refer to metrics for exact minimums and maximums. 
Table 4: Private Frontages. The Private Frontage is the area between the building and the lot lines. 
a. Common Yard: a frontage wherein the Facade is set back substantially from the frontage line. The front yard created remains unfenced and is visually continuous with adjacent yards, supporting a common landscape. The deep Setback provides a buffer from the higher speed Thoroughfares. b. Porch and Fence: a frontage wherein the Facade is set back from the frontage line with an attached porch permitted to encroach. A fence at the Frontage Line maintains the demarcation of the yard. The porches shall be no less than 8 feet deep. c. Terrace or Light Court: a frontage wherein the Facade is set back from the Frontage Line by an elevated terrace or a sunken light court. This type buffers Residential use from urban sidewalks and removes the private yard from public encroachment. The terrace is suitable for conversion to outdoor cafes. d. Forecourt: a frontage wherein a portion of the Facade is close to the Frontage Line and the central portion is set back. The forecourt created is suitable for vehicular drop-offs. This type should be allocated in conjunction with other frontage types. Large trees within the forecourts may overhang the sidewalks. e. Stoop: a frontage wherein the Facade is aligned close to the Frontage Line with the first story elevated from the sidewalk sufficiently to secure privacy for the windows. The entrance is usually an exterior stair and landing. This type is recommended for ground-floor Residential use. f. Shopfront and Awning: a frontage wherein the Facade is aligned close to the Frontage Line with the building entrance at sidewalk grade. This type is conventional for Retail use. It has a substantial glazing on the sidewalk level and an awning that may overlap the sidewalk to the maximum extent possible. g. Gallery: a frontage wherein the Facade is aligned close to the Frontage Line with an attached cantilevered shed or a lightweight colonnade overlapping the sidewalk. This type is conventional for Retail use. The gallery shall be no less than 10 feet wide and may overlap the whole width of the sidewalk to within 2 feet of the Curb. h. Arcade: a frontage wherein the Facade is a colonnade that overlaps the sidewalk, while the Facade at sidewalk level remains at the Frontage Line. This type is conventional for Retail use. The arcade shall be no less than 12 feet wide and may overlap the whole width of the sidewalk to within 2 feet of the curb.

    Ancillary Unit: an apartment not greater than 600 square feet sharing ownership and utility connections with a Principal Building. An Ancillary Unit may or may not be within an outbuilding. Ancillary Units do not count toward maximum density calculations (see Tables 6 and 10). 
    Apartment: a dwelling unit sharing a building and a lot with other dwellings and/or uses. Apartments may be for rent or for sale as condominiums. 
    Attic: an interior space that occurs within the roof structure, whether conditioned or unconditioned. 
    Backbuilding: a single-story structure connecting a principal building to an outbuilding (see Table 10). 
    Block: the aggregate of private lots, passages, rear lanes and alleys, circumscribed by thoroughfares. 
    Block Face: the aggregate of all the building facades on one side of a block. The Block Face provides the context for establishing architectural harmony. 
    Building Configuration: the form of a building, based on its massing, private frontage, and height. 
    Building Disposition: the placement of a building on its lot (see Tables 2 and 8). 
    Building Function: the uses accommodated by a building and its lot. Functions are categorized as Restricted, Limited, or Open, according to the intensity of the use (see Tables 5 and 7). 
    Building Height: the vertical extent of a building measured in stories, not including a raised basement or a habitable attic. Height limits do not apply to masts, belfries, clock towers, chimney flues, water tanks, elevator bulkheads and similar structures. Building Height shall be measured from the average grade of the enfronting thoroughfare to the eave of a pitched roof or to the surface of a flat roof (see Table 3). 
    Building Type: a structure category determined by function, disposition on the lot, and configuration, including frontage and height. 
    By Right Permit: a proposal for a building or community plan that complies with this code and may thereby be processed administratively, without public hearing (see Warrant, Variance). 
    Civic: the term defining not-for-profit organizations dedicated to arts, culture, education, recreation, government, transit, and municipal parking. 
    Civic Building: a building designed specifically for a Civic Function. The particulars of their design shall be determined by Variance. 
    Civic Parking Reserve: parking structure or lot within a quarter-mile of the site that it serves. Space may be leased or bought from this Reserve to satisfy parking requirements. 
    Civic Space: an outdoor area dedicated for public use. Civic Space types are defined by the combination of certain physical constants including the relationship between their intended use, their size, their landscaping and their enfronting buildings. 
    Commercial: the term collectively defining workplace, Office and Retail functions. 
    Common Destination: An area of focused community activity defining the approximate center of a Pedestrian Shed. It may include without limitation one or more of the following: a Civic Space, a Civic Building, a Commercial center, a bus stop. A Common Destination may act as the social center of a Neighborhood. (See Section 2.7 Civic Function). 
    Cottage: an Edgeyard Building Type. A single-family dwelling, on a regular lot, often shared with an Ancillary Building in the rear yard. 
    Courtyard Building: a building that occupies the boundaries of its lot while internally defining one or more private patios. 
    Curb: the edge of the vehicular pavement detailed as a raised curb or flush to a swale. The Curb usually incorporates the drainage system. 
    Density: the number of dwelling units within a standard measure of land area, usually given as units per acre. 
    District: see Special District. 
    Downtown Development Authority: Part of the Planning Office, the DDA is established pursuant to Ordinance 11646 and has jurisdiction over the permitting of a project. 
    Driveway: a vehicular lane within a lot, usually leading to a garage. A Driveway in the First Layer may be used for parking if it is no more than 18 feet wide, thereby becoming subject to the constraints of a parking lot. 
    Edgeyard Building: a building that occupies the center of its lot with Setbacks on all sides. 
    Effective Turning Radius: the curved edge of a Thoroughfare at an intersection, measured at the inside edge of the vehicular tracking (accounting for parked cars). The smaller the Turning Radius, the smaller the pedestrian crossing distance and the more slowly the vehicle is forced to make the turn. (See Table 10.) 
    Elevation: an exterior wall of a building not along a Frontage Line. See: Facade (see Table 10) 
    Enfront: to place an element along a frontage line, as in "porches enfront the street." 
    Entrance, Principal: the main point of access of pedestrians into a building. 
    Estate House (Syn.: Country house, Villa): an Edgeyard Building Type. A single-family dwelling on a very large lot of rural character, often shared by one or more Ancillary Buildings. 
    Exterior Environmental Features: all those aspects of the landscape or the development of a site which affect the character of the property. 
    Facade: the exterior wall of a building that is set along a Frontage Line (see Elevation; Frontage Line). 
    Frontage Line: those lot lines that coincide with a public frontage. Facades along Frontage Lines define the public realm and are therefore more regulated than the Elevations that coincide with other Lot Lines (see Table 10). 
    Home Occupation: non-retail Commercial enterprises permitted in Zones T3-6. The work quarters should be invisible from the frontage, located either within the house or in an Outbuilding. Permitted activities are defined by the Restricted Office category (Tables 5 and 7). 
    House (Syn.: Single): an Edgeyard Building Type. A single-family dwelling on a large lot, often shared with an Ancillary Building in the rear yard. 
    Independent Building: a building designed by a different architect from the adjacent buildings. 
    Layer: a range of depth of a lot within which certain elements are permitted (see Table 10). 
    Liner Building: a building specifically designed to mask a parking lot or a parking garage from a frontage. A Liner Building, if less than 30 feet deep and two stories, shall be exempt from parking requirements. 
    Live-Work: a fee-simple dwelling unit that contains a Commercial component anywhere in the unit. (Syn.: Flexhouse.) (See Work-Live.) 
    Lodging: premises available for daily and weekly renting of bedrooms. The area allocated for food service shall be calculated and provided with parking according to Retail use. 
    Lot Line: the boundary that legally and geometrically demarcates a lot (see Frontage Line). Such lines appear graphically on Building Scale Plans. Codes reference lot lines as the baseline for measuring Setbacks (see Table 10). 
    Lot Width: the length of the principal Frontage Line of a lot. 
    Manufacturing: premises available for the creation, assemblage and/or repair of artifacts, using table-mounted electrical machinery and including their retail sale.

2.  Demolition or relocation of a historic structure; 
3.  Commencement of excavation for construction purposes; 
4.  A change in the location of advertising visible from the public right-of-way; or 
5.  The erection, alteration, restoration or removal of any buildings or other structure within a property or district, including walls, fences, steps and pavements, or other appurtenant features, except exterior paint alterations. 
    Meeting Hall: a building available for gatherings, including conferences. It should accommodate at least one room equivalent to a minimum of 10 square feet per projected dwelling unit within the pedestrian shed in which the meeting hall is located. A Meeting Hall shall be completed upon the sale of 75 per cent of the dwelling units.

Any adopted design guidelines and The Secretary of the Interior's Standards shall be made available to the property owners of historic landmarks or within historic districts. 
    In considering whether a Certificate of Appropriateness permitting exterior alterations shall be granted, the Historic Preservation Commission shall consider: 
(a)  The extent the alteration affects the distinctive character or architectural features of the structure, including consideration of the harmony of materials, details, height, mass, proportion, rhythm, scale, setback, shape, street accessories, and workmanship; 
(b)  The degree to which the proposed work would isolate the structure from its historical or architectural surroundings; 
(c)  The degree to which the proposed work is compatible with the original design concept of the structure or with the general design characteristics of the era which the structure represents; 
(d)  The degree to which the proposed building materials are compatible with the aesthetic and structural appearance of the structure including the texture, style, color of the materials and the proposed combination of materials such as brick, stone, concrete, shingle, wood, or stucco; 
(e)  The degree to which the proposed work is compatible with the design guidelines approved by the Historic Preservation Commission; and 
(f)  The degree to which the proposed work is compatible with the Department of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects, 36 C.F.R. Section 68.1 et seq. 
(g)  The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings: 
(i)  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(ii)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(iii)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
(iv)  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(v)  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
(vi)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
(vii)  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(viii)  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(ix)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(x)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(11)  Preapplication Conference. 
(a)  Request and scheduling. An applicant for a Certificate of Appropriateness is strongly encouraged to request at his option an informal conference with the Director of Planning or his designee prior to filing an application. 
(b)  Purpose of conference. The preapplication conference shall be informal and its purpose shall be to discuss the proposals, views and concerns of the applicant, to convey information about The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and the adopted design guidelines and to determine if any additional information will be required of the applicant. 
(c)  Letter of understanding. Within ten days after the preapplication conference, the Director of Planning or his designee may transmit a letter of understanding to the applicant setting forth the substance of the preapplication conference. No representation by the Historic Preservation Officer or any other city official or employee at the preapplication conference or at any other time shall be binding on the city with respect to any application subsequently submitted unless such representation is set forth in the letter of understanding or in a zoning certificate. 
(12)  Routine maintenance. Nothing in the Ordinance should be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature of a property designated as a landmark or within a historic overlay district. Ordinary maintenance shall be defined as any work that does not constitute a change in design, material or outward appearance of the structure, and it includes in-kind replacement or repair. The Director of Planning or his designee shall be in charge of making the decisions as to what is "ordinary maintenance." Routine maintenance does not require the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness. Certificates of Appropriateness are issued for all other projects. Any repair or replacement where there is a change in the design, materials, or general appearance is defined as an alteration and needs a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
(13)  Certificate of Appropriateness Application Procedure. Prior to the commencement of any work, the owner shall file an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness with the Director of Planning or his designee. The application shall contain such drawings, photographs, plans and documentation as may be required by the Director of Planning or Commission. Typical requirements shall include: 
(a)  Name, address, telephone number of applicant, and a detailed description of proposed work.

(h)  Any other information which the City Staff or Historic Preservation Commission may deem necessary in order to visualize the proposed work. 
    No building permit shall be issued for such proposed work until a Certificate of Appropriateness has first been issued by the Historic Preservation Officer or the Historic Preservation Commission. The Certificate of Appropriateness required by this act shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any building permit that may be required by any other ordinance of the City of Lake Charles. 
(14)  Minor exterior alterations (Minor Work) (Staff review). 
(a)  Minor Work projects are reviewed by the Director of Planning or his designee. If the Historic Preservation Officer determines that the applicant is seeking a Certificate of Appropriateness to authorize only minor exterior alterations, as defined in this section, the Director of Planning or his designee shall review the application to determine whether the proposed work complies with the regulations contained in this section and all applicable historic overlay district designation ordinances and approve or deny the application within five working days of its receipt. 
(b)  Minor exterior alterations include the installation of or alteration to awnings, gutters and downspouts; incandescent lighting fixtures, restoration of original architectural features that constitute a change from existing conditions (e.g., removing inappropriately installed aluminum windows and replacing with original wood windows); and additions and changes not visible from any street or public pathway which are located to the rear of the main structure or to an accessory structure. A Certificate of Appropriateness Checklist delineating Minor Work from Major Work is available upon request from the Director of Planning.

In general, major work projects involve a change in the appearance of a structure or site, and are more substantial in nature than routine maintenance or minor work projects. Examples include new construction additions or expansions of a building footprint, and requested changes in original materials. 
(b)  The Historic Preservation Commission shall review the Certificate of Appropriateness application at a regularly scheduled meeting within 30 days from the date the complete application is received. The timeline does not begin until after the application is deemed complete by the Historic Preservation Officer. An incomplete application will not be reviewed by the Commission. 
(c)  The Historic Preservation Commission shall hold a public hearing at which each proposed Certificate of Appropriateness is discussed. Notice of the hearing shall follow the procedures detailed in Section 4-201(4)(b). An opportunity will be provided for proponents and opponents of the application to present their views. 
(16)  Historic Preservation Commission Decisions. 
(a)  The Historic Preservation Commission shall approve, deny, or approve with modifications any Certificate of Appropriateness application, determining whether the proposed work is consistent with the regulations, standards, and guidelines contained in this Ordinance. 
(b)  All decisions of the Commission shall be in writing. The Commission shall state its findings pertaining to the approval, denial, or modification of the application. A copy shall be sent to the applicant. Additional copies shall be filed as part of the public record on that property and dispersed to appropriate departments, e.g., building inspection. 
(c)  In the event the Historic Preservation Commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The Commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may then resubmit the application at any time. 
    In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a Certificate of Appropriateness by the Commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
    An applicant for a Certificate of Appropriateness, or any City Council member, dissatisfied with the action of the Historic Preservation Commission relating to the issuance or denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness shall have the right to appeal to the City Council within 15 days after receipt of notification of such action. The City Council shall give notice, follow publication procedures, hold hearings, and make its decision in the same manner as provided in the general zoning ordinance of the city. In hearing an appeal, the City Council shall determine whether the proposed work is consistent with the regulations, standards, and design guidelines contained in this Ordinance. 
(17)  Demolition or relocation. A Certificate of Appropriateness is required, and a review shall be completed by the Historic Preservation Commission. The demolition or relocation of a historic structure is strongly discouraged and is only considered as a last resort. Both are defined as Major Work projects. The Director of Planning shall not forward the application to the Commission until it is complete. 
(a)  Required information. The following information must be supplied by the applicant before the application is considered complete: 
(i)  Information describing the condition of the structure; 
(ii)  Estimated cost of restoration or repair; 
(iii)  Demonstration that the adaptive use or restoration of the structure has been seriously considered; 
(iv)  Any available historic records of the building (drawings, photographs); 
(v)  Architectural drawings for any proposed new constructions which are intended to replace the historic structure; 
(vi)  Demonstration that the applicant has made a serious attempt for six months to sell the structure, at market value through a multiple listing agency, to an individual or group who would restore the property on site; and 
(vii)  Any other information the staff finds appropriate for the Commission to render a decision on the application. 
(b)  Standards for relocation. A decision by the Historic Preservation Commission approving or denying a Certificate of Appropriateness for the relocation of a building, structure, or object shall be guided by: 
(i)  Whether the structure is endangered in its original location. Relocation should not be considered without meeting this first standard; 
(ii)  The historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting; 
(iii)  Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be; 
(iv)  Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; and 
(v)  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure, site or object. 
(c)  Standards for demolition permit. A decision by the Historic Preservation Commission approving or denying a Certificate of Appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, sites, trees judged to be 50 years old or older, or objects shall be guided by: 
(i)  The historic, scenic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site, tree or object; 
(ii)  The importance of the building, structure, site, tree or object to the ambiance of a district; 
(iii)  The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, site, tree, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location; 
(iv)  Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood or the city; 
(v)  Whether there are definite plans for use of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be; 
(vi)  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, site, tree, or object from collapse; and 
(vii)  Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value. 
(d)  No Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition shall be issued unless the applicant has demonstrated that: 
(i)  It is not economically feasible to maintain the structure; 
(ii)  The applicant has explored preservation options, such as the sale of the structure to an individual or group interested in preserving the structure; 
(iii)  The applicant has posted on the premises of the structure, in a manner easily visible from the public way, notice of intended demolition for a period of six months prior to application for a Certificate of Appropriateness; and 
(iv)  The applicant has sought and been denied a conditional use permit for an alternate use, pursuant to Section 5-307(19). 
(18)  Emergency. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where the building official determines that demolition or alteration of a structure is necessary to correct a condition that is dangerous to life, health or safety, a conditional use permit may be issued under the signatures of the building official, Historic Preservation Officer, director of planning, and the mayor. 
(19)  Alternate uses. 
(a)  A conditional use permit may be approved, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 4-203(5), to permit a use not otherwise permitted in the underlying zoning district in a designated historic structure, subject to ratification by the Planning Commission, provided that the applicant has demonstrated that: 
(i)  The proposed alternate use will not alter the exterior appearance of the structure; 
(ii)  The presence of the alternate use will not establish a precedent which will change the character of the neighborhood; 
(iii)  The alternate use is economically necessary to preserve the structure; and 
(iv)  The structure has been offered for sale at market value through a multiple listing agency for its existing use for a period of six months and no bona fide offer at market appraised value has been received. 
(b)  No conditional use permit for an alternate use shall be issued for industrial or heavy commercial uses. 
(c)  In considering whether the applicant for an alternate use has demonstrated compliance with the standards in subsection (a), the historic preservation commission shall consider whether the structure for the proposed use is in a neighborhood, the characteristics of the neighborhood, whether the proposed use will irreversibly shift the character of the neighborhood, and whether the site can adequately accommodate any additional parking which may be required as a result of the change in use. 
(20)  Economic Hardship Application Procedure. 
(a)  After receiving written notification from the Historic Preservation Commission of the denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness, an applicant may commence the hardship process. No building permit or demolition permit shall be issued after a denial unless the Commission makes a finding that hardship exists. 
(b)  When a claim of economic hardship is made due to the effect of this Ordinance, the owner must prove that: 
(i)  The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return, regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable return possible; 
(ii)  The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a reasonable return; and 
(iii)  Efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and preserving it have failed. 
    The applicant shall consult in good faith with the Commission, local preservation groups and interested parties in a diligent effort to seek an alternative that will result in preservation of the property. Such efforts must be shown to the Commission. 
    The Historic Preservation Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application within 60 days from the date the application is received by the Historic Preservation Officer. Following the hearing, the Commission has 30 days in which to prepare a written recommendation to the building inspector and Historic Preservation Officer. In the event that the Commission does not act within 90 days of the receipt of the application, a permit may be granted. 
    All decisions of the Commission shall be in writing. A copy shall be sent to the applicant by registered mail and a copy filed with the city clerk's office for public inspection. The Commission's decision shall state the reasons for granting or denying the hardship application. 
    An applicant for a Certificate of Appropriateness dissatisfied with the action of the Commission relating to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall have the right to appeal to the City Council within 15 days after receipt of notification of such action. The City Council shall give notice, follow publication procedure, hold hearings, and make its decision in the same manner as provided in the general zoning ordinance of the city. In hearing an appeal, the City Council shall determine whether the proposed work is consistent with the regulations, standards, and design guidelines contained in this Ordinance. 
(21)  Demolition by Neglect. No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a landmark or included within a historic district shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the judgment of the Commission, produce a detrimental effect upon the character of the historic district as a whole or the life and character of the property itself. 
    Examples of such deterioration include: 
Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports. 
Deterioration of roof or other horizontal members. 
Deterioration of exterior chimneys. 
Deterioration or crumbling of exterior stucco or mortar. 
Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roof, or foundations, including broken windows or doors. 
Deterioration of any feature so as to create a hazardous condition which could lead to the claim that demolition is necessary for the public safety. Demolition by neglect will bar a property owner from raising an economic hardship claim. 
(22)  Amendments to Certificates of Appropriateness. A Certificate of Appropriateness can be amended, extended, varied or altered only pursuant to the standards and procedures for approval in subsections (14) or (15). An applicant who wishes to change any terms of the COA must receive prior approval from the Historic Preservation Commission, if a Major Work COA, or the Historic Preservation Officer, if a Minor Work COA. 
(23)  Limitations on approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness. Within one year of the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness, or such shorter time as may be established by an approved development schedule, if any, construction shall commence in accordance with the approved COA. Failure to commence construction within that period shall, unless a prior extension shall have been granted by the commission, automatically render the COA null and void. 
(24)  Enforcement. All work performed pursuant to a Certificate of Appropriateness issued under this Ordinance shall conform to any requirements included therein. It shall be the duty of the building inspector to inspect periodically any such work to assure compliance. In the event work is not being performed in accordance with the Certificate of Appropriateness, or upon notification of such fact by the Commission and verification by the Historic Preservation Officer, the building inspector or Historic Preservation Officer shall issue a stop work order and all work shall immediately cease. No further work shall be undertaken on the project as long as a stop work is in effect. 
    The Historic Preservation Commission and the Lake Charles City Council shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of the ordinance or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. 
(25)  Penalties. Work begun or completed without a Certificate of Appropriateness can lead to the reversal of any unapproved alterations, permit delays and fines. Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Ordinance shall be deemed a violation and the violator shall be punishable by fine of not less than $10.00 nor more than $25.00 for each and every day that such violation continues. 
(26)  Maps defining the boundaries. Maps defining the boundaries of the Charpentier Historical District and the Margaret Place Historical District are located in Exhibits C and D of Ordinance No. 11601 [15813]. 
(Ord. No. 11601, § 1, 5-19-99; Ord. No. 15813, § 2, 4-6-11; Ord. No. 16086, § 3, 11-2-11) 
Sec. 5-308. - Airport environs district. 
(1)  Purposes. It is the purpose of the Airport Environs District in this section to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city, by preventing the creation or establishment of airport hazards, thereby protecting the lives and property of the users of the public airport and of the occupants of the land in its vicinity and preventing destruction or impairment of the utility of the airport and the public investment therein in accordance with and as a part of any future comprehensive master plan of the airports of the city area. 
(2)  Applicability. The Airport Environs District is an overlay district and shall represent a mapped geographic area applied to the official zoning map. Unless expressly stated otherwise in this section, all lands encumbered by this district shall conform to all other applicable provisions of this Code. 
(3)  Land use and safety zones. Zones established in order to carry out the purpose of this section, as set forth above, and also in order to restrict those uses which may be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating to and from the airport and furthermore to limit population and building density in the runway approach areas, thereby creating sufficient open space so as to protect life and property in case of an accident, all of the land within 50,000 feet of the established airfield reference point is divided into height limiting zones, the boundaries of which and the height applicable thereto are shown on the zoning map, and hereby created and established are the following land use safety zones: 
(a)  Height limits. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no structure or natural growth shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in the height limiting zones described below to a height in excess of the height specified therefor or established for the zone. 
(i)  For the purpose of this section, the following height limits are established for each of the height limiting zones in question: 
Radial Conical Zone 
(Identify from Plan) Maximum Permissible Height 
(Feet) 10,000 ft. 150 11,000 ft. 200 12,000 ft. 250 13,000 ft. 300 14,000 ft. 350  
(ii)  An existing object, including a mobile object, is, and a future object would be, an obstruction to air navigation if it is of greater height than any of the following heights or surfaces: 
(aa)  500 feet above ground level (AFL) at the site of the object. 
(bb)  200 feet AFL or above the established airport elevation (EAR), whichever is higher, within three nautical miles of the established reference point (ARP) of the airport, and that height increases in the proportion of 100 feet for each additional nautical mile of distance from the airport up to a maximum of 500 feet. 
(b)  Imaginary surfaces. 
(i)  Precision runway approach zone. Slopes 50 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface for 10,000 feet upward. It extends an additional 40,000 feet at a slope of 40 feet outward for each foot upward. These areas begin with a width of 1,000 feet and end at a width of 16,000 feet. 
(ii)  Transition zones. Slopes seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above airport elevation. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. 
(iii)  Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation. 
(iv)  Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at 150 feet above airport elevation and extends horizontally 4,000 feet to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.

Sec. 5-309. - Traditional Neighborhood Development. 
1.  General. 
1.1.  Title. For brevity throughout these regulations, the term "TND" is used in place of "Traditional Neighborhood Development". 
1.2.  General Provisions-Purpose and Intent. 
1.2.1.  Purpose. The purpose of a Traditional Neighborhood Development is to encourage mixed-use, compact development that is sensitive to the environmental characteristics of the land and facilitates the efficient use of services. A TND diversifies and integrates land uses within close proximity to each other and provides for the daily recreational, civic, workplace and shopping needs of the residents. A TND is a sustainable, long-term community that provides economic opportunity and environmental and social integration for the residents. 
1.2.2.  Design. A TND is designed to ensure the development of land as a traditional neighborhood. A TND is characterized by the following design elements: 
1.  Neighborhoods that are limited in size and oriented toward pedestrian activity; 
2.  A variety of housing types, shopping, services, and public facilities; 
3.  Residences, shops, workplaces, and civic buildings interwoven within the neighborhood, all within close proximity; 
4.  A network of interconnecting streets and blocks that maintains respect for the natural landscape; 
a.  Natural features and undisturbed areas that are incorporated into the common open space of the neighborhood; 
b.  A coordinated transportation system with a hierarchy of appropriately designed facilities for pedestrians, bicycles, public transit, automotive vehicles, and delivery and emergency services; 
c.  Well-configured squares, plazas, greens, landscaped streets, preserves, greenbelts, and parks woven into the pattern of the neighborhood and dedicated to the collective social activity, recreation, and visual enjoyment of the residents and users of the TND; 
d.  Civic buildings, common open spaces, and other visual features that act as landmarks, symbols, and focal points for community identity; 
e.  Compatibility of buildings and other improvements as determined by their arrangement, bulk, form, character, and landscaping to establish a livable, harmonious, and diverse environment; 
f.  Private buildings that form a consistent, distinct edge and define the border between the public street space and the private block interior; 
g.  Architecture and landscape that are harmonious and respond to the unique character of the region; and 
h.  Provides an increased range of options that are allowed by conventional zoning. 
1.3.  Overview. 

1.3.1.  Size. A TND consists of an area generally of not less than twenty-five (25) contiguous acres. In this Ordinance, property is considered contiguous even if separated by a public roadway. TND "walkability" is defined as having a substantial majority of the TND within 2,000 feet (5 minute walk) of the Neighborhood Center. 
1.  In this Ordinance, there are two classifications of TND's based on acreage: 
a.  Minor TND: 25 to 50 acres 
b.  Major TND: Greater than 50 acres 
a.  For a TND greater than 50 acres it may be necessary to have more than one Neighborhood Center 
1.3.2.  Areas within the TND. A TND is divided into at least three types of areas. A TND shall have one Neighborhood Center Area (sometimes referred to as a town center or village center), at least one Mixed Residential Area, and common open space. A TND may also have a neighborhood edge area and civic spaces. 
1.  Neighborhood Center Area. A Neighborhood Center Area serves as the focal point of a TND, containing retail, commercial, civic, and/or public services, and, to a secondary extent, residential uses, to meet the daily needs of community residents. A Neighborhood Center Area is pedestrian-oriented, and is designed to encourage pedestrian movement. A square may be located in a Neighborhood Center Area. Retail and commercial uses should generally be located adjacent to a square. A Neighborhood Center Area uses include, but are not limited to, retail shops, restaurants, offices, medical facilities, banks, hotels, post office, governmental offices, churches, schools, community centers, and attached residential dwellings. 
2.  Mixed Residential Area. A Mixed Residential Area includes a variety of residential land uses including single-family detached, single-family attached, and multi-family. Residential scale retail and commercial uses are permitted within a Mixed Residential Area with architectural and land use controls. Retail and commercial uses in a Mixed Residential Area are required to blend into the residential character of the neighborhood. A Mixed Residential Area includes common open spaces such as small squares, pocket parks, community parks, and greenbelts. A Mixed Residential Area promotes pedestrian activity through well-designed and varied streetscapes that also provide for the safe and efficient movement of vehicular traffic. Mixed Residential Area uses include single-family homes, row houses, duplexes, townhomes, apartments, and condominiums. Nonresidential uses may be considered for approval in the Mixed Residential Area. 
Nothing shall preclude the imposition of restrictive covenants to limit or eliminate retail or commercial uses. Mixed Residential Areas often utilize alleys. Varying lot sizes are encouraged within the Mixed Residential Area. 
3.  Common open space. Common open space is a significant part of a TND design. 
These spaces serve as areas for community gathering, landmarks, and as organizing elements for the neighborhood. Common open space includes squares, plazas, greens, preserves, parks, detention basins, community gardens or urban farms, playgrounds, recreational facilities and greenbelts. A minimum of 20% of the total acreage of a TND shall be committed to common open space. 
4.  Neighborhood Edge Area. A Neighborhood Edge Area is the least dense portion of a TND, with somewhat larger lots and somewhat greater setbacks than the rest of the neighborhood. Alleys are encouraged but not required, and direct vehicular access to the street is permitted. Only single-family residential dwellings are permitted. A Neighborhood Edge Area is appropriate along the perimeter of the neighborhood. A portion of a TND that adjoins existing or platted conventional low-density housing shall be designated as a Neighborhood Edge Area. 
5.  Civic uses. Civic uses that are oriented to the general public are permitted throughout the TND. These uses are essential components of the social and physical fabric of a TND. Special attention should be paid to the location of government offices, libraries, museums, schools, churches, and other prominent public buildings to create focal points and landmarks for the community. The locations of these major public civic uses should be designated on the overall development plan at the time of approval. Civic spaces should be integrated into residential and commercial areas in the TND. 
6.  Streets and alleys. A TND is designed to be pedestrian-oriented. To accomplish this goal, street pattern and design is used to reduce vehicle travel speeds and encourage pedestrian activity. An interconnected network of streets and alleys is required. A network of paths and greenways is strongly recommended. Streets may be smaller than in conventional development and more varied in size and form to control traffic and give character to the neighborhood, but they cannot be designed in any way to impede emergency response access. Where streets or alleys prohibit garbage vehicle access, provisions must be made for a designated area for pick-up that is easily accessible. 
1.4.  Definitions. 
    Accessory Building: A subordinate building or a portion of the main building on a lot, the use of which is customarily incidental, secondary, or minor to that of the main or principal building. 
    Alley: A public or private roadway which affords only a secondary means of access to the rear of abutting property.

    Collector: A collector road is a low-to-moderate-capacity road which serves to move traffic from local streets to arterial roads. 
    Common Open Space: Shared use space not utilized for enclosed improvements, including squares, plazas, greens, preserves, parks, detention basins, community gardens or urban farms, playgrounds, recreational facilities and greenbelts, but excluding vehicular use areas. The only exception is the use of bio-swales or rain gardens to capture stormwater in parking lots, but only the surface area dedicated to bio-swales or rain gardens will be classified as common open space. 
    Community Gardens: An area set aside for residents to participate in community gardening. Such gardens will be credited as required common open space and to be managed under the auspices of the TND Property Owners Association. 
    Concept Plan: An informal map of a proposed subdivision or a site plan of sufficient accuracy to be used for the purpose of discussion and classification. 
    Curb Radius: The curved edge of streets at an intersection measured at the outer edge of the street curb. 
    Detention Basins: Stormwater management facilities that provide temporary storage of runoff, which is used to control the peak discharge rates generated by newly constructed impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots, and rooftops. 
    Encroachment: The act of building a structure which is in whole or in part on a neighboring property. Certain overhangs are permissible on a case by case basis. 
    Green: A common open space available for unstructured recreation, its landscaping consisting of grassy areas, trees, shrubs, and other landscaping. 
    Greenbelt: A series of connected common open spaces that may follow natural features such as bayous and coulees. 
    Line of Sight: The clear sight distance area at an intersection required by motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists and others to view a conflict, make a decision and react to that decision. 
    Lot Line: Any of the property lines bounding the lot. 
    Lot Width: The horizontal distance between side lot lines measured at the front setback. 
    Net Acre: An acre of land excluding street rights-of-way and other publicly dedicated improvements such as parks, common open space, and stormwater detention and retention facilities. 
    Park: A common open space, available for recreation, its landscape tending to consist of paths and trails, some open lawn, trees, open shelters, or recreational facilities. 
    Plaza: A common open space at the intersection of important streets, set aside for civic purposes and commercial activity, its landscape tending to consist of durable pavement and formal tree plantings. 
    Preserve: Common open space that preserves or protects a tract of land from development, including without limitations, floodplains, wetlands, protected habitats, environmental or natural features. 
    Principal Building: A building in which the primary use of the lot on which the building is located is conducted. 
    Reserve: A tract of land kept in reserve for future development. 
    Secondary Dwelling Unit: An additional dwelling unit located within the principal dwelling on the lot, in a freestanding building or above a residential garage. 
    Servitude: A right by which something, as a parcel of land, is subject to a specified use or enjoyment by another (servitude for utilities, access, construction, drainage, etc.). 
    Square: Common open space that may encompass an entire block, is located at the intersection of important streets, and is set aside for civic purposes, with landscape tending to consist of paved walks, lawns, trees, and civic buildings. 
    Streetscape: The area within a street right-of-way that contains sidewalks, street fixtures, landscaping, and/or trees. 
    TND: A compact, walkable, mixed-use neighborhood where residential, commercial and civic buildings are located within close proximity to each other. 
    TND Overlay: An unmapped zoning district whose standards are described in this Ordinance that may be established on lands that are designated as any current zoning excluding 'Industrial' and must be approved as a major conditional use. 
    TND Property Owners Association: The TND Property Owners Association is an organization that operates on behalf of all TND property owners. The association has a board of elected resident members that meet regularly and is charged with establishing and upholding architectural standards, covenants and deed restrictions as well as maintaining the common areas of the TND. The association is expected to charge maintenance fees in perpetuity. 
1.5.  Procedures. The submittal requirements in the City of Lake Charles Subdivision Regulations apply to the TND, except to the extent inconsistent with or augmented by this section and, in particular, the following: 
1.  A pre-application conference with the Planning and Zoning Department, Public Works Department, and Fire Department is required prior to submittal of a Concept Plan. At the pre-application conference, there will be consideration of densities of residential and commercial uses, common open space requirements, and other development related issues, including emergency services access. The applicant should hold the pre-application conference prior to conducting a charrette. 
2.  Application. An application for a TND Overlay for a major conditional use permit, shall be submitted to the Director of Planning in accordance with the provisions of the City of Lake Charles Zoning Ordinance No. 10598 Section 4-201(1)-(3). The TND must follow the requirements for a major conditional use outlined in Section 4-203(5). The Concept Plan must be submitted with the major conditional use application that indicates the areas proposed for the Neighborhood Center Area, Mixed Residential Area, common open space, Neighborhood Edge Area (if applicable), and civic use (if applicable). The Concept Plan does not have to be an official plat of survey. 
3.  Once a TND Overlay is approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, changes to the Concept Plan shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning Department.

6.  An application for preliminary plat approval of a TND may only be filed after the major conditional use has been approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
7.  An overall development plan must be submitted for a TND for approval by the Planning and Zoning Department. The overall development plan will be considered the preliminary plat. The overall development plan may be separated into phases for purposes of construction plan submittal and final plat approval. The overall development plan is intended to reflect the overall development concept, and in particular, the coordination of traffic, utilities and other improvements between phases. 
8.  Lots, streets, common open spaces, and other property divisions shall be platted as set forth in this TND Ordinance. 
9.  If a reserve tract is proposed, then the TND must provide for a temporary use until changed. Any change in the temporary use, including a change to a permanent use, must be approved by the Planning and Zoning Department. 
10.  Development Agreement. All TND's that have received preliminary plat approval according to the provisions stated herein shall be subject to a City of Lake Charles development agreement prior to or contemporaneous with submittal of construction plans to the Public Works Department and the Fire Department. This agreement is designed and intended to reflect the agreement with the City of Lake Charles and the applicant as to the development, including without limitation the phasing of construction to ensure the timely and adequate provision of public infrastructure improvements. This agreement is also intended to ensure balanced intensity of development to avoid overloading existing public facilities during the construction phase. This agreement will be individually negotiated for each phase, but should address the following issues: 
a.  Any agreement on cost sharing for the installation or over-sizing of major utility systems, lines or facilities. 
b.  Any agreement for encroachment of overhangs into servitudes. 
c.  Any agreement on cost sharing for the installation of interior or perimeter roadways or street network. 
d.  Any agreement as to a mandatory construction or dedication schedule for common open space areas or improvements, school site(s), landscaping or greenbelt development or other comparable items to be dedicated or constructed for each acre of property within the TND. 
e.  An agreement that relates to the creation of a TND Property Owners Association, which establishes and upholds architectural standards, covenants and deed restrictions, and maintains the common open spaces of the TND. The association is expected to charge maintenance fees in perpetuity. 
f.  Any conditions that limit Fire Department emergency services caused by such things as street width, accessibility, building height and water pressure/volume, which will result in higher insurance premiums, should be identified. 
11.  In order to ensure that the required common open space is allocated for the entire development, in a properly phased fashion as outlined in the development agreement, the Planning and Zoning Department staff may discontinue the issuance of building permits until the required common open space is constructed and/or dedicated.

(e)  Permit Holder is the individual, corporation, or other business association, which has been awarded a Work Force Temporary Housing permit. 
(f)  Portable modular quarters (PMQ) means a structure or container that is used as a sleeping room, that can stand alone or be integrated into a series, which, when prefabricated, is towed to or carried to the site, or when not prefabricated is assembled on site, but regardless of where it is manufactured or assembled, it is not designed as a permanent single or multiple family dwelling and such structure shall be placed upon a stand or other acceptable anchoring system, which shall not heave, shift or settle unevenly under the weight of the structure as a result of any poor drainage, vibration, or other similar forces, which provides an adequate base for anchoring the structure to secure it against any movement. 
(g)  Portable building may be allowed as an accessory use to the PMQs that can stand alone or be integrated into a series, which, when prefabricated, is towed to or carried to the site, or when not prefabricated is assembled on site, but regardless of where it is manufactured or assembled, it is not designed as a permanent on-site structure and such structure shall be placed upon a stand or other acceptable anchoring system, which shall not heave, shift or settle unevenly under the weight of the structure as a result of any poor drainage, vibration, or other similar forces, which provides an adequate base for anchoring the structure to secure it against any movement. 
(h)  Site Restoration. Upon expiration of the conditional use permit, or termination of use of the work force housing facility, if earlier, the applicant shall restore the site to pre-development condition or a more pristine state in accordance with an approved site closure and restoration plan.

(2)  In the event the plan contains variations from the approved preliminary development plan but remains in substantial compliance with the preliminary development plan, the planning commission may, after a meeting with the applicant, refuse to approve the final development plan and shall, within 30 days from the filing of the final development plan, so advise the applicant in writing of said refusal, setting forth in the notice the reasons why one or more of the variations are not in the public interest. 
(3)  In the event of such refusal, the applicant may file his application for final approval without the variations objected to by the planning commission. If the applicant shall fail to refile within 30 days, he shall be deemed to have refused to accept such requirements and final approval shall be deemed to have been denied. 
Sec. 5-418. - Final development plans that are not in substantial compliance with the approved preliminary development plan. 
(1)  In the event that the final development plan is not in substantial compliance with the preliminary development plan the planning commission shall, within 30 days of the date the application for final approval is filed, so notify the applicant in writing, setting forth the particular ways in which the plan is not in substantial compliance.

Sec. 5-420. - Enforcement of development schedule. 
    If no substantial construction has begun or no use established in the planned development within the time stated in the final development plan and construction schedule, the final development plan shall lapse upon written notice to the applicant from the director of planning and shall be of no further effect. In its discretion for good cause, and after a public hearing, the city council may extend for a reasonable time, not to exceed one year, the period for the beginning of construction or the establishment of a use. If a final development plan lapses under the provisions of this section, the director of planning shall remove the planned development permit from the official zoning map and shall file a notice of revocation with the recorded final development plan. 
    The zoning regulations applicable before the development was approved shall then be in effect.
