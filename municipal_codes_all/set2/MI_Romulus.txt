PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Romulus, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1999 Code and ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1999 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Francine King, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Ellen Bragg, City Clerk, and Mr. Kevin Watts, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Section 11.15. - Tax lien on property.

After the lapse of ninety (90) days after date that the City acquires title to any such property, Council may remove the same from the market by determining that such property is needed for and should be devoted to a public purpose, and naming such purpose, or may sell the same at a price that shall be not less than its market value as determined and certified to Council by the Assessor.

Such returns shall include all the additional assessments, taxes, fees, penalties and interest hereinbefore provided, which shall be added to the amount assessed in said tax roll against each property or person. Taxes thus returned shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes returned by the County Treasurer or collected, in accordance with law, and shall be and remain a lien upon the property against which they are assessed until paid.

Interest may be charged upon deferred installments at a rate not to exceed nine (9) percent per year payable annually. Under any installment plan adopted the whole or any deferred installments with accrued interest to date of payment may be paid in advance of the due dates established. 
Section 12.8. - Additional assessment. 
    When any special assessment roll shall prove insufficient to meet the cost of the improvement for which it was made, the Council may make an additional pro rata assessment, but the total amount assessed against any one parcel of land shall not exceed the benefits received by said lot or parcel of land. 
Section 12.9. - Refunds of assessments. 
    The Clerk shall, within sixty (60) days after the completion of each local or special public improvement, compile the actual cost thereof and certify the same to the Assessor who shall adjust the special assessment roll to correspond therewith. Should the assessment prove larger than necessary by five (5) percent or less, the same shall be reported to the Council which may place the excess in the City Treasury or make a refund thereof pro rata according to the assessment. If the assessment exceeds the amount necessary by more than five (5) percent, or five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) the entire excess shall be credited to owners of property as shown by the City assessment roll upon which such assessment has been levied, pro rata according to the assessment; provided, however, that no refunds of special assessments may be made which impair or contravene the provision of any outstanding obligation or bond secured in whole or part by such special assessments.

Section 12.12. - Reassessments for benefits. 
    Whenever the Council shall deem any special assessment invalid or defective for any reason whatever, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall have adjudged such assessment to be illegal for any reason whatever in whole or in part, the Council shall have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made, whether the improvement or any part thereof has been completed or not and whether any part of the assessment has been collected or not. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be made in the same manner as provided for in an original assessment. If any portion of the original assessment shall have been collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount reassessed shall have been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the persons making such payment. 
Section 12.13. - Delinquent special assessments. 
    Special assessments and all interest and charges thereon, from the date of confirmation of the roll, shall be and remain a lien upon the property assessed of the same character and effect as the lien created by general law for State and County taxes, and by this Charter for City taxes, until paid. From such date and after confirmation as shall be fixed by the Council, the same collection fees shall be collected on delinquent special assessments and upon delinquent installments of special assessment beginning on the following October 1st of each year, as provided by this Charter to be collected on delinquent City taxes. Such delinquent special assessments shall be subject to the same penalties and the land upon which the same are a lien shall be subject to sale therefor, the same as are delinquent City taxes and the lands upon which they constitute a lien. 
Section 12.14. - Lien not destroyed by judgment. 
    No judgment or decree, or any act of the Council vacating a special assessment shall destroy or impair the lien of the City upon the premises assessed, for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the same, or as by a regular vote or proceeding might have been lawfully assessed thereon. 
Section 12.15. - Special assessments: hearings and notice thereof.

Sec. 2-71. - Short title. 
    This division shall be known and cited as the "Code of Ethics Ordinance." 
(Code 1999, § 2-50; Ord. of 6-26-1995, § 1) 
Sec. 2-72. - Code of ethics for the city officials, city employees, boards and commissioners. 
(a)  Preamble. 
(1)  The citizens of Romulus are entitled to have fair, ethical and accountable local government that has earned the public's full confidence for integrity. 
(2)  Furthermore, the effective functioning of democratic government requires that city officials, city employees, boards and commissioners, both elected and appointed, comply with both the letter and spirit of the laws and policies affecting the operations of government; city officials, city employees, boards and commissioners must be independent, impartial and fair in their judgment and actions; public office must be used for the public good, not for personal gain; and public deliberations and processes must be conducted openly, unless legally confidential, in an atmosphere of respect and civility. 
(3)  To this end, the City of Romulus adopts this Code of Ethics for the City of Romulus officials, city employees, boards and commissioners, both elected and appointed to assure public confidence in the integrity of local government and its effective and fair operation. 
(b)  Code of ethics. 
(1)  Acts in the public interest. Recognizing that stewardship of the public interest must be their primary concern, city officials, city employees, boards and commissioners, both elected and appointed will work for the common good of the people of Romulus and not for any private or personal interest, and they will assure fair and equal treatment of all persons, claims, and transactions coming before the City of Romulus. 
(2)  Compliance with law. City officials, city employees, boards and commissioners, both elected and appointed shall comply with the laws of the federal government, the State of Michigan, and the City of Romulus in the performance of their public duties. These laws include, but are not limited to: the United States and Michigan constitutions; federal and state statutes; city ordinances; the Romulus City Charter; laws pertaining to conflicts of interest, contracts with public entities, election campaigns, financial disclosures, employer responsibilities, and open processes of government; and city ordinances and policies. 
(3)  Communication. City officials and city employees shall publicly share substantive information that is relevant to a matter under consideration by the city council, which they may have received from sources outside of the public decision-making process. 
(4)  Gifts, favors, and loans. 
a.  A city official, city employee, board and commissioner shall refrain from financial and business dealings that would tend to reflect adversely on the official impartiality, interfere with the performance of their public duties or exploit their official position. A city official, city employee, board and commissioner should not receive any services, goods or opportunity for personal gain that is not available to the public in general. 
b.  A city official, city employee, board and commissioner and any family member claimed as a dependent of the city official or cohabitating with, city employee, board or commissioner shall refrain from soliciting or accepting any gifts, loans, or favors except that a city official, city employee, board or commissioner and a family member claimed as a dependent or a cohabiter of the city official, city employee, board or commissioner may: 
1.  Accept a gift or honorarium, not exceeding a value of $100.00, for services rendered in the performance of their public duties or other activity devoted to the improvement of cities, communities and the lives of citizens. 
2.  Accept ordinary social hospitality; a gift, bequest, favor or loan from a relative; a wedding or engagement gift; a loan in the regular course of business from a reputable and traditional lending institution on the same terms as generally available to the public; and a scholarship, grant or fellowship awarded on the same terms as applied to other applicants. 
3.  Accept any other gift, favor or loan only if the donor is not a person or entity whose interests have come or are likely to come before the city council. 
4.  Solicit and accept campaign contributions as regulated by the State of Michigan campaign finance laws. 
(5)  Confidential information. City officials, city employees, boards and commissioners shall respect the confidentiality of information concerning the property, personnel or affairs of the city. They shall neither disclose nor divulge to an unauthorized person confidential information acquired in the course of their duties in advance of the time prescribed for its authorized release to the public without proper legal authorization, nor use such information to advance their personal, financial or other private interests. 
(6)  Use of public resources. Public resources, including city staff time, equipment, supplies, and facilities, not available to the public in general shall only be used for the benefit of the public and not for a city official, city employee, board or commissioner's personal or private use. 
(7)  Representation of private interests. In keeping with their role as stewards of the public interest, a city official, city employee, board or commissioner shall not appear on behalf of the private interests or third parties, including their spouses and family members within the third degree of consanguinity to the city official, city employee, board, commissioner or their spouse, before the city council or any board, committee, commission, or proceeding of the city. 
(8)  [Reserved.] 
(9)  [Reserved.] 
(10)  Personal interests. City officials, city employees, boards or commissioners shall not engage in any act or business transaction which may cause him or her or his or her immediate family or business, that he or she is associated with, to derive a personal profit or gain directly or indirectly as a result of his or her official position or authority to profit from a business transaction or act in an official capacity on matters in which he or she has a private financial interest clearly separate from that of the general public. 
(11)  Advocacy. City officials, city employees, boards and commissioners shall represent the official policies or positions of the city to the best of their ability when designated as delegates for this purpose. When presenting their individual opinions and positions, city officials, city employees, boards and commissioners shall neither state nor imply that they represent the opinions or positions of the city council or the City of Romulus. 
(12)  Policy role of members. 
a.  City officials, city employees, boards and commissioners shall respect and adhere to the structure of Romulus city government as outlined by the Romulus City Charter. In this structure, the city council determines the policies of the city with the advice, information, and analysis provided by the public, subordinate boards, committees and commissions, and city staff. 
b.  City officials, city employees, boards and commissioners therefore shall not interfere with the administrative functions of the city or the professional duties of city staff; nor shall they impair the ability of staff to implement city council policy decisions. 
(13)  Independence of boards and commissions . Because of the value of the independent advice of subordinate boards, committees, and commissions to the public decision-making process, members of the city council shall, except when the councilmember is a member of the public body, limit their participation in the proceedings of such subordinate public bodies to the communication of requested information and providing factual information relevant to the discussion at hand and shall not otherwise attempt to unduly influence the deliberations or outcomes of the proceedings. 
(14)  Positive workplace environment. 
a.  City officials, city employees, boards and commissioners shall support the maintenance of a positive and constructive workplace environment for city employees and for citizens and businesses dealing with the city. 
b.  Because city official, city employee, board, and commissioner member actions and comments contribute to the environment in which all city employees must work, in order to create and promote a positive work environment under no circumstances shall a city council member, either in public or private, intimidate, humiliate, or otherwise abuse a city employee. 
(15)  Compliance and enforcement. 
a.  This Code of Ethics for City of Romulus officials, city employees, boards and commissioners expresses standards of ethical conduct expected for city officials, city employees, boards and commissioners. City officials, city employees, boards and commissioners themselves have the primary responsibility to assure that they understand and meet the ethical standards expressed in this code of ethics and that the public can continue to have full confidence in the integrity of government. 
b.  Depending upon the employment status of the city official, city employee, board or commissioner or group concerned, and the nature of the action requested, all matters concerning the conflict of interest and ethical code shall be directed to either i) the mayor, the city council and the city attorney for elected and appointed officials, or ii) to the mayor and the city attorney for full and part-time employees. In matters concerning the mayor or city attorney, the mayor pro tem will assume the controlling authority position, for purposes of overseeing any action voted on by city council, in place of the affected official. When requested, these authorities shall take appropriate action upon any complaint, request for information, or otherwise resolve matters concerning conflict of interest and the ethical code policy of the city. The appropriate action to be taken in any individual case shall be determined by a majority city council vote which may include, but is not limited to, recommending appropriate disciplinary action, including recommendation to the governor of the State of Michigan for removal from office, removal from appointed position or employment in accordance with the City Charter, the City Code, state law, or the regulations or policies of the city, or the requirements of any collectively bargained agreement. 
c.  In addition, the city council shall annually review the Code of Ethics for City of Romulus officials, city employees, boards and commissioners. The review may include, but is not limited to, recommendations for revisions, additions, deletions, or other action city council shall deem appropriate from year to year. 
(16)  Implementation. 
a.  As an expression of the standards of conduct for city officials, city employees, boards and commissioners expected by the public, this code of ethics is intended to be self-enforcing. It therefore becomes most effective when city officials, city employees, boards and commissioners are thoroughly familiar with it and embrace its provisions. 
b.  For this reason, ethical standards shall be included in the regular orientations for newly elected or appointed city officials, city employees, boards and commissioners. Newly elected or appointed city officials, newly hired city employees, new members of boards and commissioners entering office shall sign a statement affirming that they have read and understand the code of ethics.

b.  If, upon completion of an inspection, the premises are found to be in violation of one or more provisions of applicable city ordinances and state codes, the department of building and safety shall provide the registered local agent and/or owner with written notice of such violations. The department of building and safety shall set a re-inspection date before which such violation shall be corrected. If such violation has been corrected within that period, the inspection required for issuance of a certificate of compliance shall be satisfied.

If the complaint is not of an emergency nature, the owner will have 14 calendar days to correct such violation, unless a longer period of time is granted by the department of building and safety, after which a re-inspection or written verification from owner and/or responsible local agent and complaining party that the violation has been corrected, will be required. If a violation is not corrected by the property owner as required by this article, the department may revoke the certificate of compliance. 
d.  If an inspection is initiated by a complaint and no violation is found to exist, no inspection fee will be assessed against the owner of the inspected rental unit in compliance. 
e.  If an inspection is scheduled and the owner or responsible local agent fails to appear, an inspection fee shall be assessed against the owner and/or the responsible local agent, and no inspection shall be completed until the inspection fee is paid in full.

ARTICLE XI. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 8-325. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood-hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property and health; safety hazards; disruption of commerce and governmental services; extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief; and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 13-189, § 5-187, 6-3-2013) 
Sec. 8-326. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property because of water or erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to flood, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(6)  Fulfill the above-stated purpose in accordance with the terms of the National Flood Insurance Program and the city' participation therein, as well as in accordance with other ordinances and resolutions of the city with regard to floodplain management and otherwise, and the Michigan Building Code and Appendix G thereto, as adopted by reference by the city.

(Ord. No. 13-189, § 5-201, 6-3-2013) 
Sec. 8-380. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in sections 8-330 or 8-358(8), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  All construction. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be: 
1.  Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
2.  Constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
3.  Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and 
4.  Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
In areas designated on the flood insurance rate map as Zone A or Zone AE, there shall be required adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
b.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the foundation of the building and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted practices to withstand flotation, collapse, lateral movement, erosion and scour, undermining, and the effects of water and wind acting simultaneously on all building components during the base flood. Buildings placed on fill shall meet compaction standard ASTM D-698 or equivalent. 
c.  For all new construction and substantial improvements of fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(2)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation plus one foot. 
(3)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation plus one foot or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood level plus one foot, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capacity of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official set forth in section 8-360(3). 
(4)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 8-330 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area because of the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments shall be prohibited unless certification by a professional registered engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments will not result in any increase in flood level during occurrence of the base flood discharge or unless drainage easements up to the new higher base flood level are secured from all affected property owners. 
b.  If subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
c.  The placement of any manufactured homes, except in an existing manufactured home park or existing manufactured home subdivision, shall be prohibited. 
(5)  Manufactured homes. 
a.  No manufactured home shall be placed in a floodway, except in an existing manufactured home park or existing manufactured home subdivision; 
b.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within areas designated on the flood insurance rate map as Zones A or AE, on sites: 
1.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
2.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
3.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; 
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation plus one foot, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within areas designated on the flood insurance rate map as Zones A or Zone AE, that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (5)b of this section, shall be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation plus one foot; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(6)  Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within areas designated on the flood insurance rate map as Zones A or AE, shall either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
c.  Meet the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in subsection (5)b of this section. 
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

In making its recommendation, the environmental protection board may identify reasonable conditions that the city council should impose on the design, construction and/or operation of the regulated facility, including requirements for financial assurance in accordance with section 20-11, as long as such conditions do not conflict with state or federal environmental laws, as the board deems are necessary or appropriate to assure that the regulated facility will conform with the intent, spirit, and requirements of this chapter and to otherwise mitigate or compensate the city and/or its residents for impacts or potential impacts that may be associated with the regulated facility or modification. If the board determines that the regulated facility is not likely to conform to the requirements of this chapter, it shall submit a written recommendation to the city council that the application be denied, with a copy to the planning commission. 
(e)  If the environmental protection board determines that the regulated facility will conform with the requirements of this chapter, with or without conditions recommended pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, but also determines that one or more permits, licenses or other approvals are or will be required under state or federal environmental laws for the construction or operation of the regulated facility, the board may recommend that the city council conditionally approve the environmental protection application. If the city council conditionally approves an application, it shall notify the applicant of the conditions that must be satisfied prior to issuing its final approval of the application. 
(f)  After the planning commission has completed site plan review as may be required by city ordinances, city council shall consider the recommendations of the environmental protection board and the planning commission, if any, and shall notify the planning commission, the building department, and the environmental protection board of actions taken on environmental protection applications. Approval of an environmental protection application shall not exempt the applicant from continued compliance with this chapter, or from compliance with any other city ordinances. 
(g)  The building department shall not issue a certificate of occupancy for a regulated facility until the city council has issued a final approval or final approval with conditions.

(a)  To ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter and any conditions imposed hereunder, the city council may require that a performance guarantee be deposited by an applicant with the city or other financial assurance instrument be established to assure the faithful performance or completion of those conditions and any improvements associated therewith. Such performance guarantees may be required in accordance with section 505 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (MCL 125.3505).

Environmental impairment liability insurance may be required to ensure the removal, cleanup and remediation (including restoration or other compensation for natural resource damages) caused by contamination on or off the site of the regulated facility or other anticipated or unanticipated environmental, property or public health damage resulting from a regulated facility or modification approved under this chapter. 
(c)  The performance guarantee or environmental impairment insurance may apply to those specific features and actions which the city council considers necessary to protect natural resources or the health, safety, or welfare of residents, project users, or the general public. A performance guarantee may not be required for the entire project. The guarantee is limited to those project components specifically required by the city council as conditions of its approval, pursuant to section 20-6. Environmental impairment insurance may be required to broadly cover the cost to remediate contamination or to repair environmental, property or public health damage resulting from an approved regulated facility or modification when such conditions are determined to pose a threat or potential threat to the public health, safety, welfare, or the environment. 
(d)  Any required performance guarantees or environmental impairment insurance shall meet the following general conditions: 
(1)  The performance guarantee or environmental impairment insurance shall be posted or provided at the time of issuance of the city council's approval of the regulated facility or modification. No building permit or other city permit shall be issued unless the building inspector is satisfied that any required guarantee is in compliance with this section. 
(2)  The performance guarantee shall be in the form of: 
a.  A cash deposit or deposit by certified check drawn on a bank authorized to do business in the state; 
b.  An irrevocable letter of credit issued on behalf of the city by a bank authorized to do business in the state; 
c.  A surety bond in a form and manner acceptable to the city attorney. The costs of the review of a surety bond by the city attorney shall be paid by the applicant as part of the issuance of a permit; 
d.  Evidence of the purchase of any required environmental impairment liability insurance provided in a form acceptable to the city attorney, and, if required by the city council, including the city as a beneficiary under the policy. 
(3)  The amount of the performance guarantee shall be sufficient to cover the estimated cost of the improvements for a regulated facility which has received approval under this chapter. The applicant shall provide an itemized listing of estimated costs and a proposed time schedule to complete all of the improvements determined to require a performance guarantee. The building inspector shall review the submitted costs and shall determine an accurate amount for the performance guarantee in consultation with the city engineer as necessary. In determining the amount, the building inspector may consider signed contracts or subcontracts or subcontracts supplied by the applicant or the building official may secure or require that the applicant secure or require that the applicant secure a sealed statement from a licensed architect or engineer verifying the estimates. 
(4)  In the case that environmental impairment insurance is required, the amount of the insurance coverage shall be determined by the city council based upon an evaluation of the scope and nature of the proposed regulated facility and a determination of the potential for environmental contamination or damage to result from the proposed facility and its related activities. 
(5)  Cash funds or a certified check made payable to the city shall be deposited by the city into an interest bearing account in a financial institution with which the city regularly conducts business. 
(6)  In the case of a guarantee exceeding $2,000.00, and by request of the applicant, the guarantee may be released to the applicant in an amount proportional to the work completed on various elements, provided that a minimum of ten percent shall be retained on each element until the satisfactory completion of the entire project. The amount of work completed shall be based upon an inspection and determination by the zoning official. 
(7)  An amount not to exceed the actual cost of the installation of landscape materials or wetland mitigation may be retained by the city for at least one year following the installation of said materials to ensure proper maintenance and, if necessary, replacement. This amount shall be released to the applicant upon certification by the building official that all landscape or mitigation materials are being maintained in good condition. 
(8)  Prior to the acceptance of a public improvement by the city and upon the recommendation of the city engineer, the building official shall require a maintenance bond for the public improvement in an amount not to exceed 35 percent of the total cost of the improvement to remain in effect for a period not to exceed three years. 
(9)  The unexpended balance of a performance guarantee, including interest accrued, shall be returned to the applicant following inspections by the appropriate city officials and a positive determination by the building official that the required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and that all other requirements of this section are met. 
(10)  When required improvements are not installed or maintained within the time stipulated or are not completed in accordance with the standards set forth within this chapter or as agreed upon between the applicant and the city council, the building official may order the improvements completed by the city or by an independent contractor, or may order that the site be returned to its original condition. 
(11)  The building official shall order the completion of the improvements and so notify the applicant by certified mail at least 14 calendar days prior to the undertaking of completion. During this time period, the applicant may seek an order from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the action by the city. All costs incurred by the city for the completion of the improvements or the restoration of the site, including direct administrative costs, shall be assessed against the performance guarantee including any interest accrued on any funds deposited in escrow. 
(12)  In the case that it becomes necessary to file a claim under environmental impairment insurance, the city council shall first make a determination that it is necessary to file a claim and shall direct the city attorney to initiate the necessary steps under the terms and provisions of the insurance policy.

At no time shall assigned city gas cards be used to fuel personally owned vehicles. Fleet gas card shall at no time be left in city vehicles. 
(Ord. No. 2014-001, 3-20-2014; Ord. No. 2015-012, § IV, 7-27-2015 ; Ord. No. 2018-007 , 11-5-2018) 
Sec. 39-13. - Procurement policy for state and federal grant awards. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the procurement of the goods and services being purchased for the performance of a federal grant, that the process is transparent and that they are obtained in a cost-effective manner and in compliance with the stricter of the Uniform Grant Guidance in Title 2 CFR Grant and Agreements, Part 200 Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Award and the city's purchasing ordinance and that the awards are being handled appropriately. 
(b)  Scope. This policy applies to any department employees authorized to initiate and/or approve purchases paid with federal grant funds. At no time can any section of this ordinance supersede the Federal Grant Procurement Requirements set by the grantor. Department employees will be responsible for reading and understanding all requirements of their grant and to work with the purchasing department to ensure compliance for all purchases. 
This policy does not address all aspects of the Code of Federal Regulations (2 CFR 200) or information required for the accounting portion of the grant money and any other stated requirements for procurement. 
(1)  Code of conduct. The stricter of the City of Romulus Code of Ethics for city officials, city employees, boards and commissioners and the following code of conduct shall govern the performance, behavior and actions of the city, including employees, directors, appointed or elected officials, volunteers, or agents who are engaged in any aspect of procurement, including, but not limited to, purchasing goods and services, awarding contracts and grants, and the administration and supervision of contracts: 
a.  No employee, director, appointed or elected official, volunteer, or agent of the city shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of contracts supported by a federal award if a conflict of interest is real or apparent to a reasonable person. 
b.  Conflicts of interest may arise when any employee, officer, or agent of the city, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a real or apparent financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a firm considered for the contract. 
c.  No employee, director, appointed or elected official, volunteer, or agent of the city shall do business with, award contracts to, or show favoritism toward a member of his or her immediate family, spouse's family or to any company, vendor, or contractor or parties to subcontractors who either employs or has any relationship to a family member; or award a contract or bid which violates the spirit or intent of federal, state and local procurement laws and policies established to maximize free and open competition among qualified vendors. 
d.  The city's employees, directors, appointed or elected officials, volunteers, or agents shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, gifts, consulting fees, trips, or anything having a monetary value in excess of $25.00 from a vendor, potential vendor, from the family or employees of a vendor, contractors or parties to subcontracts. 
e.  All employees, officers and agents of the city shall adhere to the city's ethics policies and the code of conduct for City of Romulus employees. 
(2)  Procuring federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property and whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs and when the cost is under $12,000.00 shall be utilized. 
(3)  Value engineering clauses may be used in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower cost. 
(4)  Contracts shall only be awarded to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources. 
(5)  Records will be maintained sufficient to detail the history of procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price. The clerk's office will be the repository for said records and shall be maintained for a period of not less than seven years. 
(6)  Time and material type contracts (open-ended) may be used only after a determination that no other contract is suitable. Time and material type contract means a contract where the cost to the city is the sum of the actual cost of materials and direct labor hours charged at fixed hourly rates that reflect wages, general and administrative expenses, and profit. Each time and material contract will set a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. A higher degree of oversight is required in order to obtain reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls. 
(7)  The city alone will be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the city of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. The federal awarding agency will not substitute its judgment for that of the city unless the matter is primarily a federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, state, or federal authority having proper jurisdiction. 
(c)  Competition. 
(1)  All procurement transactions must be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, and invitations for bids or requests for proposals will be excluded from competing for such procurements. Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include but are not limited to: 
a.  Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business; 
b.  Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding; 
c.  Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies; 
d.  Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts; 
e.  Organizational conflicts of interest; 
f.  Specifying only a "brand name" product instead of allowing "an equal" product to be offered and describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the procurement; and 
g.  Any arbitrary action in the procurement process. 
(2)  Procurements shall be conducted in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed state or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts state licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract. 
(3)  All solicitations will incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description must not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured and, when necessary, must set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a "brand name or equivalent" description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of procurement. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offers must be clearly stated. 
(4)  Bids and proposals shall identify all the requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals. 
(5)  All prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services must be current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition. Also, potential bidders shall not be precluded from qualifying during the solicitation period. 
(d)  Methods of procurement. One of the following procurement methods shall be used: 
(1)  Procurement by micro-purchases. Procurement by micro-purchase is the acquisition of supplies or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed $3,000.00 (or $2,000.00 in the case of acquisitions for construction subject to the Davis-Bacon Act). Requirements for making such purchases shall comply according to the appropriate city defined thresholds. 
(2)  Procurement by small purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000.00). All purchases in excess of $12,000.00 for the acquisition of goods and services and $30,000.00 for public improvements shall require that formal solicitations be sought in compliance with the city's more restrictive practices for making such purchases. 
(3)  Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are publicly solicited and a firm fixed price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for procuring construction, if the following conditions apply: 
a.  A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available; 
b.  Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively for the business; and 
c.  The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price. 
If sealed bids are used, the following requirements shall apply: 
a.  The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised at a minimum in the city's official newspaper and bids must be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient response time prior to the date set for opening the bids; 
b.  The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, must define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly respond; 
c.  All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids; 
d.  A firm fixed price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and 
e.  Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented reason. 
(4)  Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer, and either a fixed price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the following requirements apply: 
a.  Requests for proposals must be publicized at a minimum in the city's official newspaper and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals must be considered to the maximum extent practical; 
b.  Proposals must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources; 
c.  The following method for conducting technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting recipients shall be used: 
1.  After all proposals are opened and recorded, the purchasing department along with the requesting department shall determine if the proposals are responsive. A responsive proposal conforms in all material respects to the RFP. 
2.  Select the evaluation committee members. At a minimum, members should consist of the purchasing director and an end user with decision making authority. 
3.  Create a scoring matrix with weighted factors based on the evaluation criteria stated in the RFP. 
4.  Provide members with copies of the proposals and the scoring matrix. 
5.  Members individually review and score all proposals based on the criteria in the RFP. Include written justification for each scoring category. 
6.  Members submit scoring matrices and comments for each responsive proposal to the purchasing department. 
7.  The purchasing department compiles all the members' matrices to arrive at final scorings. 
8.  A meeting is scheduled with all members to discuss all aspects of the proposals and final scorings. 
9.  The members short-list the top candidates. 
10.  Schedule interviews, if necessary with top candidates. 
11.  Ask for best and final offers from top candidates (optional). 
12.  All members make a joint written recommendation. All scoring sheets, justification and rationale for the recommendation and any other variables that may have been considered are sent to the purchasing department. 
d.  Any response that takes exception to any mandatory items in this proposal process may be rejected and not considered; 
e.  Contracts must be awarded to the responsible firm whose proposal is most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered; and 
f.  Competitive proposal procedures may be used for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort. 
(5)  Procurement by noncompetitive proposals. Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source and may be used only when one or more of the following circumstances apply: 
a.  The item is available only from a single source; 
b.  The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation; 
c.  The federal awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes noncompetitive proposals in response to a written request from the non-federal entity; or 
d.  After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate. 
(e)  Contracting with small and minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area (a place of high unemployment) firms. 
(1)  All necessary affirmative steps will be taken to assure that minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible. Affirmative steps must include: 
a.  Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's business enterprises on solicitation lists; 
b.  Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources; 
c.  Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises; 
d.  Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, which encourage participation by small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises; 
e.  Using the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and 
f.  Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs a. through e. of this section. 
(f)  Procurement of recovered materials. The city and its contractors must comply with section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The requirements of Section 6002 include procuring only items designated in guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 247 that contain the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable, consistent with maintaining a satisfactory level of competition, where the purchase price of the item exceeds $10,000.00 or the value of the quantity acquired by the preceding fiscal year exceeded $10,000.00; procuring solid waste management services in a manner that maximizes energy and resource recovery; and establishing an affirmative procurement program for procurement of recovered materials identified in the EPA guidelines. 
(g)  Contract cost and price. 
(1)  A cost or price analysis shall be performed in connection with every procurement action in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000.00) including contract modifications. Analysis of all purchases in excess of $12,000.00 for the acquisition of goods and services and $30,000.00 for public improvements shall be in compliance with the city's more restrictive practices for making such purchases. The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, independent estimates shall be made prior to receiving bids or proposals. 
(2)  Profit shall be negotiated as a separate element of the price for each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration must be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work. 
(3)  Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under the federal award are allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices would be allowable for the city under Subpart E-Cost Principles of Part 200-Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards. The city may reference its own cost principles that comply with the federal cost principles. 
(4)  The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used. 
(h)  Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity review. 
(1)  The city shall make available, upon request of the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity, technical specifications on proposed procurements where the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity believes such review is needed to ensure that the item or service specified is the one being proposed for acquisition. This review generally will take place prior to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation document. However, if the city desires to have the review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may still review the specifications, with such review usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase. 
(2)  The city will make available upon request, for the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity pre-procurement review, procurement documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, or independent cost estimates, when: 
a.  Procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part; 
b.  The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000.00) and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; 
c.  The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000.00), specifies a "brand name" product; 
d.  The proposed contract is more than the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000.00) and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement; or 
e.  A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000.00). 
(3)  The city is exempt from the pre-procurement review in subsection (2) of this section if the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this part. 
a.  The city may request that its procurement system be reviewed by the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity to determine whether its system meets these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, these reviews must occur where there is continuous high-dollar funding, and third party contracts are awarded on a regular basis; 
b.  The city may self-certify its procurement system. Such self-certification must not limit the federal awarding agency's right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, the federal awarding agency may rely on written assurances from the city that it is complying with these standards. The city must cite specific policies, procedures, regulations, or standards as being in compliance with these requirements and have its system available for review. 
(i)  Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the city's threshold ($30,000.00), the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the city provided that the federal awarding agency or pass-through entity has made a determination that the federal interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements must be as follows: 
(1)  A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The "bid guarantee" must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified; 
(2)  A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A "performance bond" is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract; and 
(3)  A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A "payment bond" is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. 
(j)  Contract provisions. Contracts and solicitations must contain the applicable provisions described in Appendix II to Part 200-Contract Provisions for non-federal Entity Contracts under Federal Awards. 
(1)  Appendix II to Part 200-Contract Provisions for Non-Federal Entity Contracts Under Federal Awards. In addition to other provisions required by the federal agency or non-federal entity, all contracts made by the non-federal entity under the federal award must contain provisions covering the following, as applicable. 
a.  Contracts in excess of the City's bid thresholds, $12,000.00 for the acquisition of goods and services and $30,000.00 for public improvements must address administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide tor such sanctions and penalties as appropriate. 
b.  All contracts in excess of $10,000.00 must address termination for cause and for convenience by the non-federal entity including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. 
c.  Equal employment opportunity. Except as otherwise provided under 41 CFR Part 60, all contracts that meet the definition of "Federally assisted construction contract" in 41 CFR Part 60-1.3 must include the equal opportunity clause provided under 41 CFR 60-1.4(b), in accordance with Executive Order 11246, "Equal Employment Opportunity" (30 FR 12319, 12935, 3 CFR Part, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339), as amended by Executive Order 11375, "Amending Executive Order 11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity," and implementing regulations at 41 CFR part 60, "Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor." 
d.  Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 3141-3148). When required by Federal program legislation, all prime construction contracts in excess of $2,000.00 awarded by non-federal entities must include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141-3144, and 3146-3148) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5, "Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts Covering Federally Financed and Assisted Construction"). In accordance with the statute, contractors must be required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than the prevailing wages specified in a wage determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors must be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The non-federal entity must place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of Labor in each solicitation. The decision to award a contract or subcontract must be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage determination. The non-federal entity must report all suspected or reported violations to the federal awarding agency. The contracts must also include a provision for compliance with the Copeland "Anti-Kickback" Act (40 U.S.C. 3145), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 3, "Contractors and Subcontractors on Public Building or Public Work Financed in Whole or in Part by Loans or Grants from the United States"). The Act provides that each contractor or subrecipient must be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which he or she is otherwise entitled. The non-federal entity must report all suspected or reported violations to the federal awarding agency. 
e.  Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701-3708). Where applicable, all contracts awarded by the non-federal entity in excess of $100,000.00 that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers must include a provision for compliance with 40 U.S.C. 3702 and 3704, as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). Under 40 U.S.C. 3702 of the Act, each contractor must be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than one and a half times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week. The requirements of 40 U.S.C. 3704 are applicable to construction work and provide that no laborer or mechanic must be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence. 
f.  Rights to inventions made under a contract or agreement. If the federal award meets the definition of "funding agreement" under 37 CFR § 401.2 (a) and the recipient or subrecipient wishes to enter into a contract with a small business firm or nonprofit organization regarding the substitution of parties, assignment or performance of experimental, developmental, or research work under that "funding agreement," the recipient or subrecipient must comply with the requirements of 37 CFR Part 401, "Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements," and any implementing regulations issued by the awarding agency. 
g.  Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387), as amended-Contracts and subgrants of amounts in excess of $150,000.00 must contain a provision that requires the non-federal award to agree to comply with all applicable standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671 q) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387). Violations must be reported to the Federal awarding agency and the Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
h.  Mandatory standards and policies relating to energy efficiency which are contained in the state energy conservation plan issued in compliance with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6201). 
i.  Debarment and Suspension (Executive Orders 12549 and 12689)-A contract award (see 2 CFR 180.220) must not be made to parties listed on the government-wide Excluded Parties List System in the System for Award Management (SAM), in accordance with the OMB guidelines at 2 CFR 180 that implement Executive Orders 12549 (3 CFR Part 1986 Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR Part 1989 Comp., p. 235), "Debarment and Suspension." The Excluded Parties List System in SAM contains the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, as well as parties declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory authority other than Executive Order 12549. 
j.  Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352)-Contractors that apply or bid for an award of $100,000.00 or more must file the required certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 U.S.C. 1352. Each tier must also disclose any lobbying with non-federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any federal award. Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the non-federal award.

(Ord. No. 2016-011 , § VI, 11-28-2016; Ord. No. 2018-007 , 11-5-2018) 
Sec. 39-15. - Insurance coverages. 
    All vendors/contractor with the city shall maintain during the time period of their purchase order or contract the following minimum insurance coverages unless purchased goods will be shipped to the city and vendor/contractor will not be on city property, the course of providing any services in which case this insurance coverage requirement does not apply. The administration, along with the applicable department heads, may increase or decrease the amount of the coverage required in specific situations where, in the administration's, along with the applicable department heads', discretion, it deems a different amount is appropriate based on the services to be performed, risk, prior experience or other special circumstances. To protect the interests of the city, it shall be the responsibility of the requesting department to ensure that all necessary insurances and appropriate limits of liability are required of vendors and approved by corporate counsel. 
(1)  Commercial general liability (CGL). Insurance services office form GC 00 01 covering CGL on an "occurrence" basis, including products and completed operations, property damage, bodily injury, and personal and advertising injury with limits no less than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence. If a general aggregate limit applies, either the general aggregate limit shall apply separately to this contract or the general aggregate limit shall be twice the required occurrence limit. 
(2)  Umbrella or excess liability. Policy in an amount not less than $3,000,000.00.

Chapter 48 - SIGNS 

Sec. 48-1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to regulate signs within the city. The regulations and standards of this chapter are intended to be content neutral and are considered the minimum amount necessary to achieve a substantial government interest for public safety, aesthetics, and protection of property values. These objectives are accomplished by establishing the minimum amount of regulations necessary concerning the size, placement, construction, illumination, and other aspects of signs in the city so as to: 
(1)  Protect the public right to receive messages and information protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution; 
(2)  Recognize that the principal intent of commercial signs is for identification of an establishment on the premises, and not for advertising off-premises activities; 
(3)  Recognize that the proliferation of signs unduly distracts motorists and non-motorized travelers, reduces the effectiveness of signs directing and warning the public, causes confusion, reduces desired uniform traffic flow, and creates potential for accidents; 
(4)  Prevent signs that are potentially dangerous to the public due to structural deficiencies or disrepair; 
(5)  Enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities without excessive difficulty and confusion by restricting the number and placement of signs; 
(6)  Prevent placement of signs which will conceal or obscure signs of adjacent uses; 
(7)  Prevent off-premises advertising signs from conflicting with land uses; 
(8)  Preserve and improve the atmosphere of the city by encouraging signs of consistent size which are compatible with and complementary to related buildings and uses, and harmonious with their surroundings; 
(9)  Prohibit most portable commercial signs in recognition of their significant negative impact on traffic safety and aesthetics; and 
(10)  Preserve the spirit and intent of the master plan of the city.

Sec. 48-6. - General standards for permitted signs. 
(a)  General provisions; surface of front. No nails, tacks or wires shall be permitted to protrude in or from the front of any sign. This shall not exclude, however, the use of block letters, electrical reflectors or other devices that may extend over the top and in front of the advertising structure. 
(b)  Measurement of signs. 
(1)  Sign area. 
a.  Sign area shall be measured as the square footage of the sign face. 
b.  When a sign consists of lettering or other sign elements printed, painted or mounted on a wall or a window, the sign area shall be measured by enclosing the edges of the sign elements (i.e., letters, logos) within a parallelogram or rectangle. 

(2)  Sign height. 
a.  The permitted height of all signs supported by the ground shall be measured from the level of the ground, finished surface, adjacent to the sign. 

b.  Sign height shall not be measured from an area of the ground that has been built-up or constructed in a manner that would have the effect of allowing a higher sign height than permitted by these regulations (e.g., the height of signs erected on a berm shall be measured from the finished grade adjacent to the berm). 
(3)  Setback and distance measurements. The following shall be used to determine compliance with setback and distance measurements: 
a.  Front yard. All signs, unless otherwise provided for, shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from any public or private street right-of-way line or access drive in all districts. This distance shall be measured from the nearest edge of the sign structure, measured at a vertical line perpendicular to the ground to the right-of-way. 
b.  Side yard. Side yard setbacks for signs shall be the same as that required for the principle structure or building, provided that all business signs shall be set back at least 100 feet from any residential district. 
c.  Clear vision area. No sign shall be located within, project into, or overhang the triangular area formed at the intersection of any two road right-of-way lines (existing or proposed) by a straight line drawn between said right-of-way lines at a distance along each line of 30 feet from their point of intersection. For driveways, a 25 foot clear vision area shall be maintained from the intersection of the right-of-way lines and the driveway. 

(c)  Design and construction standards. 
(1)  Number, date and voltage to be on sign. Every sign hereafter erected shall have placed in a conspicuous place thereon, in letters not less than one-half inch in height, the date of erection, the permit number, the voltage of any electrical apparatus used in connection therein and the name and current telephone number of the person owning, erecting or operating the sign. 
(2)  Materials. All signs, as permitted, shall be designed to be compatible with the character of the principle building's materials and the site's landscaping to promote an overall unified and aesthetic effect in accordance with the standards set forth herein. 
(3)  Compliance with codes. Signs shall be constructed in a safe and stable manner in accordance with the city's ordinances and any adopted building, fire, electrical, or other applicable codes. All electrical wiring associated with a freestanding sign shall be installed underground. 
(4)  Screening of supports. All signs shall be designed so that the supporting framework is contained within or behind the face of the sign or within the building to which it is attached so as to be totally screened from view. 
(5)  Clearance from utilities. All signs, including any cables, guy wires, or supports shall have a minimum clearance of four feet from any electric fixture, street light, or other public utility pole. 
(d)  Illumination. 
(1)  Unless otherwise permitted, signs shall be illuminated only by steady, stationary, shielded light sources directed solely at the sign (i.e., front lit signs) or internal to it (i.e., back lit signs). 
(2)  The background of front lit signs may be any color, provided they are not reflective at night. However, such signs may use light reflecting lettering and messaging. 

FRONT LIT ILLUMINATION EXAMPLE

(Ord. of 7-28-2008, § 1(29-7)) 
Sec. 48-8. - Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  Nonconforming signs are those signs that do not comply with the size, placement, construction or other standards or regulations of this chapter, but were lawfully established prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. The intent of this chapter is to encourage eventual elimination of nonconforming signs in a timely manner. This objective is considered as much a subject of public health, safety, and welfare as the prohibition of new signs in violation of this chapter. Therefore, the purpose of administering this chapter is to remove illegal nonconforming signs while avoiding any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights. 
(b)  No nonconforming sign shall be altered or reconstructed, unless the alteration or reconstruction is in compliance with this chapter, except that nonconforming signs shall comply with the following regulations: 
(1)  Repairs and maintenance. Normal maintenance shall be permitted, provided that any nonconforming sign that is destroyed by any means to an extent greater than 50 percent of the sign's pre-catastrophe fair market value, exclusive of the foundation, shall not be reconstructed. Normal maintenance shall include painting of chipped or faded signs; replacement of surface panels provided the new panels are no larger than the existing panels; or repair or replacement of electrical wiring or electrical devices. 
(2)  Nonconforming changeable message signs. The message on a nonconforming changeable message sign or nonconforming bulletin board sign may be changed, provided that the change does not create any greater nonconformity. 
(3)  Substitution. No nonconforming sign shall be replaced with another nonconforming sign. 
(4)  Modifications to the principal building. Whenever the principal building on a site on which a nonconforming sign is located is modified to the extent that site plan review and approval is required, the nonconforming sign shall be removed. 
(5)  Discontinuance. A nonconforming sign shall not be re-established after the activity, business, or use to which it related has been discontinued for 90 days or longer. 
(6)  Continued use of nonconforming sign structure. 
a.  Where the city's building code official determines that a nonconforming sign structure and frame are in good condition and can be reused by a new occupant in a leased or rented building, the building owner shall not be required to remove the sign structure and frame in the interim periods when the building is not occupied. 
b.  If the building is unoccupied for less than 30 days, the previous business' sign information may be retained. 
c.  If the building is unoccupied for more than 30 days, the previous business' sign information must be removed. In such cases, the sign must be maintained in good condition and any openings must be covered with appropriate panels. 
(7)  Application of building ordinance and other adopted codes. 
a.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supplant or supersede the requirements of chapter 8, any state, national, or international code adopted by the city, or any other ordinance setting forth requirements or procedures pertaining to the use, repair, or demolition of the principal building or other structure on which a nonconforming sign is located. 
b.  To the extent any such principal building or structure is demolished pursuant to any applicable city ordinance or adopted code, any nonconforming sign thereon or on the premises shall likewise be demolished or otherwise removed and shall not be replaced in any nonconforming fashion. 
(Ord. of 7-28-2008, § 1(29-8)) 
Sec. 48-9. - Dangerous, unsafe, abandoned and illegally erected signs. 
(a)  Dangerous signs. Notwithstanding subsection (e) of this section, any sign constituting an immediate hazard to health or safety shall be deemed a nuisance and may be immediately removed by the city and the cost thereof charged against the owner of the property on which it was installed. 
(b)  Unsafe signs. Any sign that becomes insecure, in danger of falling, or otherwise unsafe but not considered an immediate danger by the building code official to the health or safety of the public shall be removed or repaired according to the process outlined in subsection (e) of this section. 
(c)  Abandoned signs. Any sign that advertises a business that has been discontinued for at least 90 days or that advertises a product or service that is not longer offered shall be deemed abandoned. Permanent signs applicable to a business temporarily suspended by a change in ownership or management shall not be deemed abandoned unless the structure remains vacant for at least six months. An abandoned sign shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the premises. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign, the building code official shall initiate the process noted in subsection (e) of this section. 
(d)  Illegally erected signs. The building code official shall order the removal of any sign erected illegally in violation of this chapter, according to the process outlined in subsection (e) of this section. 
(e)  Process for enforcing violations. For violations of this chapter the building code official shall send notice, by certified mail addressed to the property owner and to the owner of the sign if not the property owner, at their last known address. The notice shall describe the violation and allow seven days for removal. Should the sign not be removed or repaired within the time specified, the building code official shall have the authority to remove the sign, and the property owner shall be liable for the cost thereof, in addition to the penalties described in section 1-15. 
(Ord. of 7-28-2008, § 1(29-9)) 
Sec. 48-10. - Administration. 
(a)  Sign permits. Except where otherwise noted, sign permits shall be required for signs as indicated in Table 48-7. Where required, permits shall be processed according to the following: 
(1)  Application. Applications for sign permits shall be made upon forms provided by the building code official, and shall contain or have attached thereto the following information: 
a.  Name, address, telephone number and copy of both sides of driver's license of the applicant; 
b.  Location of building, structure or lot to or upon which the sign or other advertising structure is to be attached or erected; 
c.  Position of the sign or other advertising structure in relation to nearby buildings or structures; 
d.  Two blueprints or ink drawings or the plans and specifications and the method of construction and attachment to the building or in the ground; 
e.  Copy of stress sheets and calculations showing the structure is designed for dead load and wind pressure in any direction in the amount required by this and all other laws and ordinances of the city; provided that where the building code official deems it advisable, he may require the approval of the structural design by a registered engineer; 
f.  Name of the person erecting the structure; 
g.  Written consent of the owner as to where the sign is to be erected on vacant land; 
h.  Color renderings including lettering, graphics, logos, etc.; 
i.  Details for sign components, including mechanical and electrical systems; 
j.  Such other information as the building code official shall deem necessary to show full compliance with this and all other laws and ordinances of the city. 
(2)  Fee. Every applicant, before being granted a sign permit, shall pay to the city treasurer a permit fee as shall be established by resolution of the city council from time to time. 
(b)  Appeal to the zoning board of appeals. 
(1)  Any party who has been refused a sign permit for a proposed sign may file an appeal with the zoning board of appeals in accordance with this chapter and article 22 of the zoning ordinance. In determining whether a variance is appropriate, the zoning board of appeals shall study the sign proposal, giving consideration to any extraordinary circumstances, such as those listed below, that would cause practical difficulty in complying with the sign standards. The presence of any of the circumstances listed may be sufficient to justify granting a variance; however, the zoning board of appeals may decline to grant a variance even if certain of the circumstances are present. 
(2)  In granting a variance, the zoning board of appeals may attach such conditions regarding the location, character, and other features of the proposed sign as it may deem reasonable. In granting a variance, the zoning board of appeals shall state the grounds and findings upon which it justifies granting the variance. 
a.  Permitted signage could not be easily seen bypassing motorists due to the configuration of existing buildings, trees, or other obstructions. 
b.  Permitted signage could not be seen bypassing motorists in sufficient time to permit safe deceleration and exit. In determining whether such circumstances exist, the zoning board of appeals shall consider the width of the road, the number of moving lanes, the volume of traffic, and speed limits. 
c.  Existing signs on nearby parcels would substantially reduce the visibility or advertising impact of a conforming sign on the subject parcel. 
d.  Construction of a conforming sign would require removal or severe alteration to natural features on the parcel, such as but not limited to: removal of trees, alteration of the natural topography, filling of wetlands, or obstruction of a natural drainage course. 
e.  Construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the vision of motorists or otherwise endanger the health or safety of passers-by. 
f.  Variance from certain sign regulations would be offset by increased building setback, increased landscaping, or other such enhancements, so that the net effect is an improvement in appearance of the parcel, compared to the result that would be otherwise achieved with construction of a conforming sign. 
g.  A sign which exceeds the permitted height or area standards of this chapter would be more appropriate in scale because of the large size or frontage of the parcel or building. 
(c)  Waivers. Nothing in this chapter shall restrict the granting of sign waivers within a planned development area (PDA), where deemed appropriate by the planning commission. 
(d)  Review of application and issuance of permits. 
(1)  Building code official review. The building code official shall review the sign permit application for any sign proposed on a site or existing building where no other new construction is proposed. 
(2)  Issuance of a permit. Following review and approval of a sign application by the building code official, the building code official shall have the authority to issue a sign permit. 
(3)  Exceptions. A sign shall not be enlarged or relocated except in conformity with the provisions set forth herein for new signs, nor until a proper permit has been secured. However, a new permit shall not be required for ordinary servicing or repainting of an existing sign message, cleaning of a sign, or changing of the message on the sign where the sign is designed for such changes (such as lettering on a marquee or numbers on a gasoline price sign). 
(e)  Inspection and maintenance. 
(1)  Inspection of new signs. 
a.  All signs for which a permit has been issued shall be inspected by the building code official when erected. Approval shall be granted only if the sign has been constructed in compliance with the approved plans and applicable city ordinances and adopted codes. 
b.  In cases where fastenings or anchorages are to be eventually bricked in or otherwise enclosed, the sign erector shall advise the building code official when such fastenings are to be installed so that inspection may be completed before enclosure. 
(2)  Inspection of existing signs. The building code official shall have the authority to routinely enter onto property to inspect existing signs. In conducting such inspections, the building code official shall determine whether the sign is adequately supported, painted to prevent corrosion, and so secured to the building or other support as to safely bear the weight of the sign and pressure created by the wind. 
(3)  Correction of defects. All dangerous, unsafe, poorly maintained, improperly constructed or defective signs shall be corrected as outlined in section 48-9.

Sec. 54-90. - Streets and alleys. 
    The specifications set forth in this section are to be the standards adopted for the width and location of all highways, streets, and alleys that may hereafter be platted or accepted within the city. The standards for county roads are intended to be in harmony with road and right-of-way standards and policies of the county department of roads. 
(1)  Layout. The layout of proposed streets shall provide for the continuation of existing streets in surrounding areas or shall conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved by the planning commission in cases where topographical or other conditions preclude the continuation of existing streets. In general, such streets shall be of a width as great as that of the street so extended. Local residential streets shall be laid out as to discourage their use by through traffic. 
(2)  Major thoroughfares. Where the subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major thoroughfare, the planning commission shall require the construction of marginal access streets or reverse frontage of lots with provision of screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property lines with a minimum width of 15 feet, or with side lot lines parallel to the major thoroughfare. 
(3)  Private streets and alleys. Private streets and alleys shall not be permitted, but rather all streets and alleys shall be dedicated to the public. 
(4)  Access to property. A plat shall not be approved that is isolated from or isolates other lands from existing public streets, unless suitable access is provided. 
(5)  Intersections. Intersecting streets shall be laid out so that the intersection angle is as nearly as possible to 90 degrees. Streets convening at one point shall be reduced to the least practicable number. 
(6)  Half streets. Half streets shall not be permitted where a subdivision adjoins developed property, except for major streets over 60 feet in right-of-way width as may be recommended in the comprehensive development plan or by the county department of roads. They shall be permitted only when the planning commission considers the use of a half street essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in accordance with the intent of these regulations and where the commission finds it practicable to require the dedication of the other half of the right-of-way when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever there already exists a dedicated and recorded half street or half alley on an adjoining plat, the other half shall be dedicated on the proposed plat to make the street or alley complete. A one-foot public reserve may be required to be placed between half streets and subdivision boundaries. These reserves shall be deeded in fee simple to the city for future street purposes. 
(7)  Dead-end streets. When adjoining areas are not platted, the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall be extended to the boundary line of the tract to make provision for the future projection of streets into adjacent areas. A one-foot public reserve may be required to be placed between stub streets and subdivision boundaries. These reserves shall be deeded in fee simple to the city for future street purposes. 
(8)  Alleys. Alleys shall not be permitted in residential areas, but may be permitted or required in commercial or industrial areas for the purpose of service access, such as for off-street parking and loading. 
(9)  Street names. Street names shall not be permitted that might cause confusion for purposes of assessing, mail delivery, or locating by the public with names of existing streets in or near the city. Streets that will be continuations of existing streets shall be called by the same names as such existing streets. 
(10)  Building lines and setback lines. Building lines shall conform to the requirements of the zoning ordinance. 
(11)  Street alignment. 
a.  Minimum horizontal centerline radii of curvature shall be: 
1.  Major thoroughfares, 700 feet radius;

d.  All sewers shall be subjected to air, infiltration or exfiltration tests, or a combination of same, prior to acceptance by the county agency. All sewers over 24 inches diameter shall be subjected to infiltration tests before initial start-up. All sewers of 24 inches diameter or smaller, where the groundwater level above the top of the sewer is over seven feet, shall be subjected to infiltration tests. All sewers of 24-inch diameter or less, where the groundwater level above the top of the sewer is seven feet or less, shall be subjected to air tests or exfiltration tests. If an exfiltration test is performed, the maximum exfiltration rate shall be the same as that permitted from infiltration. For the purpose of exfiltration testing, the internal water level shall be equal to the external water level plus seven feet as measured from the top of pipe, and the elevation must be at least as high as the highest house service. 
e.  Maximum allowable infiltration shall not exceed 200 gallons per inch of diameter per mile of pipe between manholes per 24 hours for any section of the system and shall include the infiltration from all manholes and other appurtenances. 
f.  The procedure for air testing of sewers shall be as follows: 
1.  All house leads shall be properly plugged and blocked to withstand the air pressure. The sewer line shall be tested in increments between manholes. The line shall be cleaned and plugged at each manhole. Such plugs shall be designed to hold against the test pressure and shall provide an airtight seal. One of the plugs shall have an orifice through which air can be introduced into the sewer. An air supply line shall be connected to the orifice. The air supply line shall be fitted with suitable control valves and a pressure gauge for continually measuring the air pressure in the sewer. The pressure gauge shall have a minimum diameter of 31/2 inches and range of 0-10 PSIG. The gauge shall have minimum divisions of 0.10 PSIG and an accuracy of 0.04 PSIG. 
2.  The sewer shall be pressurized to 4.0 PSIG greater than the greatest back pressure caused by groundwater over the top of the sewer pipe. At least two minutes shall be allowed for the air pressure to stabilize between 3.5 and 4.0 PSIG. If necessary, air shall be added to the sewer to maintain a pressure of 3.5 PSIG or greater. 
3.  After the stabilization period, the air supply control valve shall be closed so that no more air will enter the sewer. The sewer air pressure shall be noted and timing for the test begun. The test shall not begin if the air pressure is less than 3.5 PSIG, or such other pressure as is necessary to compensate for groundwater level. 
4.  The time required for the air pressure to decrease 1.0 PSIG during the test shall be in accordance with the standards of the county agency. 
5.  Manholes on sewers to be subjected to air tests shall be equipped with a one-half inch diameter galvanized capped pipe nipple extending through the manhole wall, three inches into the manhole and at an elevation equal to the top of the sewer pipe. Prior to the air test the groundwater elevation shall be determined by blowing air through the pipe nipple to clear it and then connecting a clear plastic tube to the pipe nipple. The tube shall be suspended vertically in the manhole and the groundwater elevation determined by observing the water level in the tube. The air test pressure shall be adjusted to compensate for the maximum groundwater level above the top of the sewer pipe to be tested. After all tests are performed and the sewer is ready for final acceptance, the pipe nipple shall be removed and the hole in the manhole wall shall be plugged with hydraulic cement. 
6.  If a sewer fails to pass any of the previously described tests, the contractor shall determine the location of the leaks, repair them and retest the sewer. The tests shall be repeated until satisfactory results are obtained. 
(2)  Pumping systems. Tests shall be conducted to verify performance curves of each pumping device installed in the system. 
(3)  Force mains. 
a.  When practicable, tests shall be made on sections between valves, or sections not exceeding 2,000 feet in length. Dead ends, bends and other fittings shall have a firm foundation and be securely blocked against the trench walls before testing or completing the backfill as specified. 
b.  Before applying test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe. If necessary to accomplish this, taps shall be made at the points of highest elevation, and such openings subsequently closed, prior to test, with tight threaded brass plugs. 
c.  Test pressure shall be maintained at 50 pounds per square inch, by pumping water into the pipe, for a period of at least one hour, and for such longer time as may be required to permit a thorough examination to be made of all exposed joints in the section of main being tested. 
d.  Leakage, as measured by the quantity of water pumped into the pipe to maintain the test pressure of 50 pounds per square inch during the test period, shall not exceed a rate of 50 U.S. gallons per inch of diameter of main per mile of pipe in 24 hours.

(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 2.01)) 
Sec. 62-140. - Pretreatment requirements. 
(a)  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
(1)  The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards found in 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405-471, as amended are hereby incorporated into this article and made a part hereof. 
(2)  Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with the most stringent of this article, federal pretreatment standards, as established by 40 CFR chapter N, subpart I, state standards and permit conditions, and shall achieve compliance with all National Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations, and with any other pretreatment standards by applicable deadlines. 
(3)  Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the county agency for review, and shall be approved by the county agency before construction of the facility. The review and approval of plans and operating procedures does not relieve the industrial user from complying with the provisions of this article and permit conditions. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and approved by the county agency prior to the industrial user's initiation of the changes. 
(b)  New source compliance deadline. New sources shall install and have in operating condition and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
(c)  Conversion of mass limitations. 
(1)  When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the county agency may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. 
(2)  Equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c)(3) and (c)(6) shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of section 307(d) of the Act and 40 CFR 403. Industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 2.02)) 
Sec. 62-141. - Dilution prohibited. 
    Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard, local discharge limits or requirement. The county agency may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards, local discharge limits or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

Sec. 62-142. - Spill prevention and slug control plan. 
(a)  Industrial users shall provide protection from accidental discharge of substances which may cause interference at the wastewater treatment plant by developing spill prevention plans. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharges shall be provided and maintained at the discharger's expense. Spill prevention plans shall be approved by the county agency prior to construction. 
(b)  County review and approval of such plans in no way relieves the discharger of any liability associated with the efficiency or inefficiency of the facilities. 
(c)  The county agency shall evaluate each significant industrial user at least once every two years, and other industrial users as necessary, to determine whether a slug control plan is needed. If the county agency decides a slug control plan is needed, plans for such a plan shall be submitted to the county for approval. Approval of such plans shall not relieve the industrial user from complying with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to the use, storage or transportation of hazardous substances. Slug control plans shall contain at least, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges. 
(2)  List of chemicals stored. 
(3)  Procedures to immediately notify the county of slug discharges, including any discharges prohibited in section 62-139, with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days. 
(4)  Provisions for preventing adverse impact from accidental spills, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of chemicals, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, containment structures, procedures for containing toxic organic pollutants and emergency response measures and equipment. 
(d)  Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the discharger's premises, advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference with the POTW or a pass-through. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 2.04))

(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of the Michigan Administrative Code R 323.2303(3) are met. 
(3)  In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(4)  The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards and/or local limits upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(f)  Notification of bypass. 
(1)  An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not violate any pretreatment standards, requirements or local limits, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (f)(2) and (3) of this section. 
(2)  Notice. 
a.  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the county agency, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. 
b.  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards, requirements or local limits to the county agency within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass.

The written report shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The county agency may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(3)  Prohibition of bypass. 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the county agency may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
3.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (f)(2)b of this section. 
b.  The county agency may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the county agency determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (3)a of this section.

Sec. 62-235. - Compliance date report. 
    Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to the county agency a report containing the information described in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(4)-(6), as amended. Where equivalent mass or concentration limits are established by the county agency for a user, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. Where a user is subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production, the report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 5.02)) 
Sec. 62-236. - Periodic compliance reports. 
    The reports required by this section shall be based on the users self-monitoring, performed during the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with section 62-145. 
(1)  Categorical industrial users. 
a.  Any user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the county agency, on a quarterly basis, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the county agency, a report indicating the nature and concentration, of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. 
b.  The county agency may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection (1)a of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the county, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. 
c.  For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the county agency in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), as amended, the report required by 40 CFR 403.6(e)(1) shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by 40 CFR 403.6(e)(1) shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. 
(2)  Significant non-categorical industrial users. Significant non-categorical industrial users shall submit to the county agency once per quarter, on dates specified in the wastewater discharge permits, a report detailing the nature, concentration, flow of the pollutants and other pertinent information as requested by the county agency. The report shall be submitted on a form provided by the county agency. 
(3)  More frequent monitoring. If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements in this section monitors or samples any pollutant or parameter more frequently than required by the county agency using the procedures prescribed in section 62-145, the results of this monitoring shall be included in any report submitted to the county agency pursuant to this section. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 5.03))

(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 5.04)) 
Sec. 62-238. - Self-monitoring. 
(a)  Significant industrial users may be required to perform self-monitoring of their wastewater discharge. Any required self-monitoring program shall be described in the user's discharge permit and shall include designation of the sampling location, frequency of sampling, number of samples, types of samples, type of analysis required, standards for testing and increased reporting schedules. A self-monitoring program may also be the result of enforcement action taken by the county against the user, and shall be a part of any subsequent conciliation agreement or administrative orders. 
(b)  A user subject to the self-monitoring requirements of this section shall also be required to make notification and resample upon becoming aware of a violation in accordance with section 62-143. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 5.05)) 
Sec. 62-239. - Timing.

Subdivision V. - Enforcement 

Sec. 62-257. - Notification of violation. 
    Upon determination of a violation of this article or wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, the county shall take the appropriate enforcement action which may include a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt from the county agency of a written notice of violation by a user, the user shall submit to the county agency, an explanation of the violation and a plan for satisfactory correction and prevention of the cause of the violation. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any previous or future violations. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 6.01)) 
Sec. 62-258. - Notice of noncompliance. 
(a)  If the county agency finds that a discharger is in significant noncompliance, as defined in article I of this chapter, with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, permit requirements and/or the city, the county agency may serve or cause to be served upon that discharger a written notice either personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt required, stating the nature of the alleged violation. The notice shall set forth a time, date and location for a conciliation meeting. 
(b)  The county agency shall also forthwith notify the city of that meeting and shall request that its representatives attend. The discharger shall attend the meeting and present a corrective plan of action to resolve the noncompliance. The corrective plan of action and related compliance schedule may be set forth in a mutually agreed upon conciliation agreement to be signed by the discharger and the county agency. 
(c)  If however, a mutual agreement cannot be reached or the discharger refuses to sign the conciliation agreement, the county agency may issue a unilateral administrative order to force timely compliance with specified requirements and/or permit limitations. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 6.02)) 
Sec. 62-259. - Compliance schedule progress report. 
(a)  A discharger subject to a compliance schedule resulting from any enforcement actions, or as a condition of its wastewater discharge permit, shall submit a progress report to the county agency no later than 14 days following each increment milestone date specified in the compliance schedule. This report shall disclose whether the user complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date, the reason for delay if the date was not met, and the steps being taken to return to the original compliance schedule. 
(b)  In no event, however, may more that nine months elapse between progress reports. If a user acts in full accordance with a compliance schedule, as approved and adopted in accordance with this section, that user is deemed to be in compliance only for the parameters affected by the compliance schedule. Exceedences of additional parameter limitations shall be considered violations and subject to enforcement action. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 6.03)) 
Sec. 62-260. - Administrative orders. 
(a)  Show cause order. The county may order any user which causes or contributes to violation of this article, wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive, general partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as noticed, enforcement action may be pursued as appropriate. The hearing may be closed to the public at the request of the user for good cause shown. Request to close the meeting shall be made in writing and received by the county at least 24 hours in advance. Failure to comply with a show cause order shall constitute a further violation of this article and subject the user to further enforcement action. 
(b)  Consent order. As a result of the show cause order and subsequent hearing, a consent order may be issued by the county. The user assumes responsibility for its noncompliance and is willing (in good faith) to correct the cause of the noncompliance. The order is an agreement, mutually acceptable to both the county and the user, which contains a compliance schedule, stipulated fines, penalties or remedial actions and signatures of both parties. This order prohibits future violations and shall provide for corrective actions by the user. 
(c)  Compliance order. When the county finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this article or a permit or order issued thereunder, the county may unilaterally issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, further enforcement action shall be taken unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated, and compliance is achieved. Orders may also contain stipulated fines or penalties, compliance schedules subject to the provision of section 62-259, and other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices. The stipulated penalties shall be in such amounts as are determined necessary to compensate the public for damages difficult to quantify related to injury to the environment and for the recovery from the violator of economic benefits realized by noncompliance and for the purpose of deterring future violations or noncompliance. 
(d)  Cease and desist orders. When the county determines a user has violated or continues to violate this article, a discharge permit or an order issued hereunder, the county may issue an order to cease and desist all illegal or authorized discharges immediately. 
(1)  In instances of an emergency, including, but not limited to imminent danger to the public health, POTW, or environment, the order to cease and desist may be given by telephone. This action shall be followed by a written order to cease and desist. 
(2)  In non-emergency situations, the cease and desist order may be used to suspend or permanently revoke wastewater discharge permits. 
(3)  The cease and desist order may order the industrial user to take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 6.04)) 
Sec. 62-261. - Emergency suspension of service and discharge permits. 
(a)  The county agency may, for good cause, suspend the wastewater treatment service and the wastewater discharge permit of a discharger if the county agency finds that an actual or threatened discharge presents or may present an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to the environment, or an interference or pass-through. A discharger who is notified of the suspension of wastewater treatment service and/or the discharger's wastewater discharge permit, shall within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the county agency, cease all discharges. 
(b)  If a discharger fails to comply voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the county agency shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving waters, or endangerment to any individuals. The county shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the county's satisfaction that the endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings are initiated against the user. 
(c)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a full report to the county agency within five days of the incident. This report shall be a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. The information in this report shall be considered during any related action by the county agency. 
(d)  The city whose wastewater is transported or treated by the facilities of the county agency may join with the county agency in enforcement action and take such other action to effectuate the ordinance. 
(e)  Failure of the contracting community to join in the enforcement action shall not limit the county's authority to enforce this article and the provisions of this section as to any discharger. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 6.06)) 
Sec. 62-262. - Revocation of wastewater discharge permit. 
(a)  The county may, with written notice revoke the discharge permit for the following reasons: 
(1)  Violation of the terms and conditions of the permit, local ordinances, state and federal laws, statutes and regulations. 
(2)  Failure to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of the discharge. 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in wastewater constituents and characteristics. 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the permittee premises by county personnel for the purpose of inspection or monitoring. 
(5)  Failure to pay fines, penalties or costs incurred by the county, pursuant to this article II, division 6 of this chapter. 
(b)  Noncompliant industrial users shall be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater discharge permit and be given an opportunity to show cause under section 62-260 why the proposed action should not be taken. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 6.07))

    A list of all users which were determined to be in significant noncompliance with any provisions of this article or any permit or order issued hereunder during the period since the previous publication shall be annually published by the county agency in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality in which the county agency is located. All users identified in a proposed publication shall be provided a copy of that proposed notice at least 30 days before publication and provided with an opportunity to comment as to its accuracy. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 6.08)) 
Sec. 62-264. - Affirmative defenses. 
    A user shall have an affirmative defense in any action brought against it alleging a violation of the prohibitions pursuant to Michigan Administrative Code R 323.2303(3), where the user can demonstrate that it meets the criteria set forth in both the following: 
(1)  It did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference. 
(2)  A local discharge limit designed to prevent pass-through or interference was developed in accordance with 40 CFR 403.5(c) for each pollutant in the user's discharge that caused pass-through or interference, and the user was in compliance with each local discharge limit directly before and during the pass-through or interference, or if a local limit designed to prevent pass-through or interference has not been developed in accordance with 40 CFR 403.5(c) for the pollutant that caused the pass-through or interference, the user's discharge directly before and during the pass-through or interference did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge activity when the publicly owned treatment works was regularly in compliance with its national pollutant discharge elimination system permit requirements and, in the case of interference, applicable requirements for sewage sludge use or disposal. 
(Ord. of 6-25-2001, § 37-4(art. V, § 6.09)) 
Sec. 62-265. - Judicial proceedings. 
    The county may, through its office of corporation counsel, commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the county circuit court, in any instances of conduct contrary to the provisions of this article. Nothing in this section is intended to supersede any applicable actions or penalties by the state or USEPA or to prevent the county from enforcing the requirements of other sections of this article. 
(1)  Injunctive relief; public nuisance. 
a.  Whenever an industrial user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this article or permit or order issued hereunder, the county, through its office of corporation counsel may petition a court of legal jurisdiction for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the industrial user. 
b.  Nothing contained in this article shall be construed as limiting in any manner the powers of the county health officer, and if any unsanitary conditions exist, the same is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and shall be abated in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. 
(2)  Municipal civil infractions. 
a.  Violation; municipal civil infraction. Except as provided by section 62-266, a person who violates any provision of this article (including, without limitation, any rules, regulations, licenses, permits, orders, agreements or determination issued, adopted or entered by the county under this article) is responsible for a municipal civil infraction, subject to payment of a civil fine of not less than $500.00 per day for each infraction and not more than $27,500.00 per day for each infraction, plus costs, expenses and other sanctions; except that a person who violates any of the following sections of this article shall be subject to payment of a civil fine of not less than $1,000.00 per day and not more than $27,500.00 per day for each infraction, plus costs, expenses and other sanctions:

Sec. 62-366. - Sewer rates and charges. 
(a)  Generally. The rates and charges for services rendered by, and the benefits derived from, the sanitary sewer system, shall be assessed against, and payment for such services shall be collected from each user served on the following basis: 
(1)  Sewage disposal rate. The sewage disposal rate shall be determined by resolution of council from time to time. 
(2)  Sewage service only. For any user connected with the sanitary sewage disposal system who has no water connection, a special rate shall be determined by council by resolution from time to time. 
(3)  Connection, disconnection, and re-connection charges. There shall be a charge for any connection, disconnection or re-connection of sewer facilities. Such charge will be computed on the basis of the actual cost to the city. 
(b)  Sewer service installation charge. All connections to any of the sewers of the sewer system shall be made by the department of public works or a qualified contractor, except as hereinafter provided. At the time a sewer service installation is requested, the following installation charge shall be paid. Such charges are to be paid prior to the installation. 
(1)  The basic service installation charge for up to a six-inch diameter connection shall be an amount established by resolution of council from time to time. 
(2)  The charge for all sewer service installations larger than six inches in diameter, irrespective of its intended use, shall be in an amount as may be determined by council by resolution from time to time. 
(3)  All taps other than those outlined in subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be catalogued into one of the following categories and indicated on a set of master sanitary sewer plans which shall be maintained on file in the department of public works. The categories and charges shall be as follows: 
a.  A city-operated sanitary sewer is available to the premises in question and a sewer service installation will be provided to the nearest available property line to the sewer by the city for basic sewer service installation charge except in those cases where the provision of subsection (b)(2) of this section applies. 
b.  A city-operated sanitary sewer can be made available to the premises in question when the following criteria for eligibility to receive sewer services installation are met: 
1.  An available sewer main must be located within 120 feet of any property line of a proposed new customer or user; providing, however, if it should be necessary to bring the existing sewer line across any hard surfaced road (defined as asphalt and/or concrete) over 24 feet in width, then the service shall only be provided at the sole expense of the affected property owner. 
2.  The available main must have adequate capacity to accommodate the increased flow which will result from the proposed sewer service installation. 
3.  If the available sewer main is of inadequate depth, then it shall be the responsibility of the proposed customer or user to submit engineering detail of a proposed lift station and/or other information to the department of public works demonstrating the acceptability of the proposed tap. In such event, the cost of engineering or equipment required shall be paid in advance by the proposed customer or user. 
c.  A sanitary sewer operated by an agency other than the city can be made available to the premises in question, provided the necessary permits can be obtained from the agency. However, such connection was not anticipated in the development of the city's sewer program or the establishment of the sewer service installation charge: therefore, the charge for such an installation shall be in an amount as may be established by council by resolution from time to time. 
d.  A sanitary sewer operated by either the city or another agency is located in the area. However, due to existing conditions, it is not practical to make a sewer service installation. 
(4)  In those instances where, with the consent of the department of public works, an applicant elects to install the entire sanitary sewer house lead, from the sanitary sewer to the property line at his own expense, the sewer service installation charge may be waived and a special inspection charge as may be established by resolution of council from time to time shall be assessed. The council may establish from time to time by resolution sewer reconnection inspection charges. 
(c)  Sewer service installation for low income residents. Upon application by the owner of the residence in question, the water and sewer billing department shall have the power to approve that the sewer service installation charge as authorized in subsection (b) of this section be paid by a down payment which may be established by council by resolution from time to time and the remainder in 20 equal payments commencing with the next regular billing. This action shall not be taken until the water and billing department has found: 
(1)  That the applicant and his dependents residing with him do not have a combined average monthly gross income for the past 12 months in excess of the amounts established by council by resolution from time to time. 
(2)  That the applicant is residing in the premises for which the low income resident sewer service installation charge is requested. 
(d)  Sewer debt and capital replacement charges. In addition to all other applicable charges as specified in this article, the following rates shall be collected from each premises hereafter connecting to any of the sewer lines of the sewer system: 
(1)  For each single-family residence making an allowable minimum water connection as approved by the city's public works department, the sewer debt charge shall be determined by resolution of council from time to time and payable in one lump sum at the time of application. Prior to the transfer of ownership, the seller shall pay the balance of the debt service charge in full at or before the time of closing and the entire debt service charge of every residence constructed under this section will remain a lien upon the land unless so discharged and otherwise, and chargeable as such to seller and/or buyer. For any nonresident of the city connecting the charge shall be payable at the time of application. For each single-family residence constructed as part of a subdivision or development for the purpose of resale, the charge shall be payable at the time of application. 
(2)  The sewer debt charge, where a water meter is in excess of three-quarter-inch size, shall be payable at the time of application and shall be determined by council by resolution from time to time based upon the size of the water meter. 
(3)  For each unit in a motel, hotel, apartment project or each pad in a mobile home park, there shall be a sewer debt rate charge which shall be determined by resolution of council from time to time. 
(4)  Any business, commercial or industrial unit, including schools or any other public facility, shall pay the larger amount of either: 
a.  The amount determined by the meter size in subsection (d)(l)b of this section; or 
b.  The amount determined by multiplying the debt rate for a one-inch water meter times the number of acres up to five acres of the applicant's land as herebefore defined in this article and an additional amount over five acres which may be established by council by resolution from time to time per acre thereafter. 
(e)  Sewer maintenance service charge collected. In addition to the above-specified rates, there shall be collected from users having any connection to the sewer lines of the sewer system, a sewer maintenance service charge in accordance with the following: 
(1)  For any residence or business unit including commercial, industrial, school or other public facility, served with a three-quarter-inch water meter, hereafter connected to the system, the sewer maintenance service charge shall be established from time to time by resolution of council. 
(2)  For any residence or business unit, including commercial, industrial, school or other public facility, served with a water meter in excess of three-quarter-inch size and connecting to the sewer system, the sewer maintenance service charge shall be an amount as shall be established from time to time by resolution of council.

(a)  Required use of public sewers. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit, or permit to be placed or deposited in an unsanitary manner upon public or private property within the city or in any area under the jurisdiction of the city, except in the pursuit of a normally accepted farming or gardening practice, any human or animal excrement, garbage or other objectionable waste. 
(2)  It shall be unlawful to discharge into any natural outlet within the city, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the city, any sewage, industrial wastes, or other polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with this article. 
(3)  Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful to construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool or other facility intended or used for the disposal of sewage. 
(4)  The owners of all houses or other buildings used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purpose situated within the city and abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is now located or shall in the future be located a public sanitary or combined sewer of the city, is hereby required at his expense to install toilet facilities therein, in conformity with law, and to connect such facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this article. If the director of public works and services deems it necessary for reason of public health, a connection shall be made within one year after the date of official notification that the sewer is available; provided that, if a house or building be declared by the city council to be included in a plan of imminent acquisition by the city or by an agency thereof, the city council may, in such case, extend the time within which a connection be made until the land is acquired, the plan terminated or the further order of the city council; and provided, further, in the case of an imminent public health hazard, a connection shall be made within six months after the date of official notice to do so, provided that the public sewer is within 100 feet of the property line. 
(b)  Private sewage disposal. 
(1)  Where a public sanitary sewer is not available under the provisions of subsection (a)(4) of this section the building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal system complying with the requirements of the county department of health and any requirements which the city may by ordinance or resolution deem necessary to protect the public health. Temporary use of privies or privy vaults meeting the requirements of the county department of health may be allowed on construction projects with the approval of the city. 
(2)  The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, at no expense to the city. 
(3)  At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private sewage disposal system, as provided in subsection (b)(1) of this section a direct connection shall be made to the public sewer in compliance with this article and any septic tanks, cesspools and similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with clean bank-run gravel or other suitable material. The connection is to be made within the time provided in subsection (b)(4) of this section. 
(4)  No statement contained in this section shall be construed to conflict with any more stringent requirements that may now or hereafter be imposed by the county department of health or any state regulation.

If the city determines that an excessive amount of groundwater leakage is entering a footing drain, the director of public works and services shall forthwith notify the user of the property of such determination, and the user shall forthwith abate such excessive leakage in a manner approved by the city. In no case shall excavation for footings or basements be drained into a sanitary sewage system. The house lead and building drain, immediately upon being placed, shall be tightly capped and thoroughly leaded, and all interior stacks and openings shall remain in this condition until the basement floor and walls have been laid to grade and exterior footing excavations backfilled to grade. It is anticipated that this requirement will necessitate the use of a temporary sump from which groundwater will be pumped to proper disposal. It is the intent of this requirement that no sand, clay or foreign matter be permitted to reach the city sanitary sewer system or the connections thereto. 
(2)  Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged upon approval of the city, county drain commissioner and other lawful authorities to such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet.

f.  Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odor-producing substances in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the city or county board of public works as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal or other public agencies having jurisdiction of such discharge to the receiving waters; 
g.  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the city or county board of public works in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations; 
h.  Any wastes or waters having a pH in excess of 9.5; 
i.  Materials that exert or cause: 
1.  Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids, such as, but not limited to, Fuller's earth, lime slurries, and lime residues, or of dissolved solids, such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate; 
2.  Excessive discoloration, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions; 
3.  Unusual B.O.D., chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works; 
j.  Waters or wastes containing substances that are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment plant only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
(5)  If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (c)(4) of this section, and which in the judgment of the city may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city may: 
a.  Reject the wastes; 
b.  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge; 
c.  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; 
d.  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes and charges.

Sec. 62-399. - Building sewers and connections. 
(a)  Permits and connection requirements. No person shall lay, alter or repair any building sewer or house lead, or make any connections whatsoever with any lateral sewer, trunk sewer, or building drain or do any kind of work connected with the laying of building sewers or house leads or make any repairs, additions or alterations to any drain or sewer connected with or designated to be connected with the sanitary sewer system without first obtaining a written city permit therefor. 
(1)  Application for permit shall be made on the application forms furnished by the division of water and sewer of the department of public works and services. All applications for permit, other than a homeowner's permit, shall be made by a contractor who is registered with the city and who is bonded and insured to perform such water/sewer work; such bond and insurance to be as provided in subsection (b)(2) of this section. Each application for a permit shall be assessed an application and inspection fee to defray the cost of processing the application and the subsequent inspections of construction or installation. Should conditions require more than two inspections or should a full-time inspector be required, an additional inspection fee will be charged for all additional time, over and above the normally anticipated two inspections. In the case of commercial, multiple dwelling or industrial developments, a review fee may be charged if the complexity of the waste disposal facilities warrant specific review of the details and plans by the division of water and sewer. 
(2)  Application for a permit by a homeowner shall be made on the homeowner's permit form furnished by the city. Homeowners who are not contractors registered to do work in the city may obtain a permit for the laying of building sewers or house leads on premises occupied or to be occupied by the applicant as his residence upon payment of the application and inspection fee and the filing of the proper application forms; provided that the applicant obtains a bond in the amount of $5,000.00 as a financial guaranty for any damage and complies with the other provisions of this article, including, but not limited to, the payment of any additional inspection or review fees, the connection and laying of the building sewer in accordance with the rules and regulations of the division of water and sewer and the department of public works and the final inspection and approval of the building sewer prior to the covering of the installation. 
(3)  The application and inspection fee, the additional inspection fee and the review fee shall be prescribed from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
(4)  In addition to the application and inspection fee, the additional inspection fee and the review fee all applicants for a sewer connection permit shall be required to pay the applicable capital charge, front-foot charge, connection charge and any other charge provided by city ordinance or by subsequent resolution of the city council. 
(5)  No openings shall be made into the sewer system without first obtaining a sewer connection permit as specified under subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this section. The removal of the cookie or stopper or any other type of connection to the sanitary sewer system shall be performed only in the immediate presence of the department of public works and services inspector. Upon failure to comply with this requirement, the contractor or any other person responsible for the work shall be served with a notice of violation as provided for under sections 62-403 and 62-404. Any contractor who shall knowingly neglect or refuse to comply with the requirements of this article, other rules and regulations hereinafter established or with the conditions of the permit shall be subject to the immediate revocation of his registration by the city, in addition to the other penalties set forth in this article. Any violation by agents, servants or employees of a contractor under the terms of these regulations shall be deemed to be a violation by the contractor in whose name the permit is issued. 
(6)  It shall be unlawful for any person, performing work under a permit for the laying of building sewer, to cover any portion of a building sewer until such time as it has been inspected and approved by the department of public works inspector or his authorized agent. Such person shall give the city written notice when the work is ready for inspection and shall leave the premises in a condition convenient for inspection by the inspector. The licensee shall remove and replace all rejected work, restore all public streets and alleys to a similar condition as existed prior to excavation, and shall make all adjustments necessary to fully meet the requirements under this article, other rules and regulations hereinafter established and the conditions of the permit to the reasonable satisfaction of the city. 
(7)  Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the city, to meet all requirements of these regulations. 
(b)  License, insurance and bonds. 
(1)  Each person or company other than a homeowner applying for sewer connection permits shall be registered with the city. This registration shall contain the following information:

b.  The type of ownership of the company; 
c.  The principals of the company; 
d.  The legal address and business phone number of the person or company; 
e.  The name, address and state plumbing license number of the principal licensed master plumber in the company; 
f.  The name, address and phone number of an individual in responsible charge who can be contacted in the event of an emergency on the project. 
(2)  Each person or company acting as principal contractor in the installation, alteration or repair of any building sewer or house lead shall, prior to commencing work, place on file with the division of water and sewer of the department of public works and services, evidence of the following insurance and bonds. All such insurance shall be written with an insurance company licensed to do business and maintaining an office within the state, which office shall have the authority to process and settle claims. 
a.  Employer's liability and worker's compensation insurance for all employees to be engaged in work on the project, as provided by the Michigan Workman's Compensation Law. 
b.  Contractor's public liability insurance in an amount not less than $100,000.00 for injuries to each person and $300,000.00 for each occurrence, and contractor's property damage insurance in an amount not less than $50,000.00 for each occurrence and $100,000.00 aggregate.

Such insurance shall include the so-called explosion, collapse and underground hazards coverage. 
e.  Each such person or company shall procure or cause to be procured insurance coverage as provided in subsection (b)(2)a through d of this section with respect to each subcontractor with whom it contracts. 
f.  A license bond in favor of the city in an amount of not less than $5,000.00. The license bond shall be prepared on the form prescribed by the department of public works and services and shall be renewed at least once each year. It is the intent of the bond to guarantee that the contractor shall faithfully observe and honestly comply with such ordinances, rules and regulations, and amendments thereto as may apply to the installation, alteration or repair of any building sewer or house lead and, further, that the contractor shall keep all work undertaken within the period of the bond, whether done by himself or by someone for him, free of defects due to faulty workmanship or defective materials, for a period of one year from completion of work. This work shall be done at no expense to the city. The city shall give the contractor written notice of corrections needed on the project and in the event the contractor fails to undertake the correction of the work, as indicated in the notice, within one week, after the date of such notice, the city may cause the corrections to be made and charge all expenses therefor to the contractor or the surety. 
g.  A security cash deposit in the amount of $100.00 shall be deposited with the city by each person or company. The cash deposit shall be a security deposit for indemnification arising from minor surface damage to adjacent lands. If there is damage, the city shall give the contractor written notice of corrections needed on the project and if the contractor fails to undertake the correction of the damage, as indicated in the notice, within one week, after the date of such notice, the city may cause the corrections to be made and deduct all expenses therefor from the security cash deposit. If the security cash deposit falls below $50.00, the contractor will be required to renew the cash deposit to the full $100.00 amount before additional sewer connection permits will be issued to him. 
(c)  Use regulations requiring separate building sewer or house lead. As provided in the county board of public works regulations, the state department of health regulations and the state plumbing code, there shall be a separate building sewer or house lead, independent of that for any other building, for every building connected to the sanitary sewer system, except for those instances where the city determines that one of the following conditions prevails, in which case a multiple connection may be allowed: 
(1)  Where one building stands in the rear of a residential building on an interior lot and no sewer is available or can be made available for the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway and where both buildings are under common ownership. 
(2)  Where a complex of commercial establishments or multiple dwelling units are situated under a common roof and share common interior walls. The interconnection of adjacent units by companionways or underground utility tunnels does not constitute sufficient physical connection to allow the use of a single building sewer or house lead. 
(3)  Where an industrial complex consists of several adjacent buildings that are an integral part of an industrial process or production sequence and where all portions of the complex are under a common ownership. If there is a sale of a portion of the complex, a separate and independent building sewer or house lead will be required for each portion of the divided complex. 
(d)  Building sewer or house lead construction methods, materials and standards. The city council may adopt by resolution from time to time such rules and regulations relating to building sewer or house lead construction methods, materials and standards as it may deem advisable, which rules and regulations shall be published and copies of which shall at all times be available at the department of public works and services.

Sec. 62-400. - Sanitary sewer and storm drain extensions. 
(a)  Use regulations requiring public sanitary extensions. Except in those instances provided for in section 62-399(c), all sanitary sewers serving more than one building shall be public sanitary sewers. 
(b)  Sanitary sewer extension procedure. All public sanitary sewers installed within the city shall be constructed under contract awarded by the city council. When a person wishes to sponsor the construction of public sanitary sewers, he shall proceed as follows: 
(1)  The project sponsor shall submit preliminary plans to the department of public works and services for their tentative approval (approval in principle). 
(2)  Upon the giving of tentative approval, the department of public works and services shall refer construction plans to the city engineer for technical review. 
(3)  Prior to each review by the city engineer, the project sponsor shall remit to the department of public works and services a sanitary sewer review fee based on the cost of construction as estimated by the city engineer. This remittance is to cover the cost of examination and preliminary engineering work required to determine the adequacy of the plans, the obtaining of the necessary permits from the county board of public works and the state department of health, and the division of water and sewer administration. The schedule or amount of the sanitary sewer review fee shall be prescribed from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
(4)  When the department of public works and services, upon the advice of the city engineer shall have declared the plans adequate and all the necessary permits have been obtained, the project sponsor shall submit a complete set of reproducible original drawings for the project along with the evidence of all necessary permits, other than those listed under subsection (b)(3) of this section. 
(5)  The department of public works and services shall, upon receipt of the drawings and permits, refer the project to the city council, together with their recommendations regarding construction of the project. 
(6)  At such time as the city council may elect to establish a date for receipt of bids, the project sponsor shall be directed to remit to the city or to deposit or secure in such manner as is acceptable to the city council an amount equal to the entire project cost, including construction contingencies, field supervision, staking, inspecting and administration as estimated by the city engineer. 
(7)  Upon receipt of the full remittance as defined under subsection (b)(6) of this section, the city clerk shall cause an advertisement for bid to be placed in the appropriate trade publications and direct the city engineer to prepare the necessary bid documents for use by the prospective bidders. 
(8)  Following the receipt and tabulation of bids, but prior to the award of a contract, the project costs shall be reviewed to determine if the construction funds previously deposited with the city are adequate to construct the project. If the construction deposit exceeds the adjusted project cost, the surplus shall be refunded to the project sponsor. If the construction deposit is less than the adjusted project cost, the project sponsor shall be given the option of either remitting sufficient additional funds to the city to cover the difference or directing that the bids be rejected, in which case an amount of money equal to the actual administrative, engineering and publishing cost incurred by the city in bidding the project, but in no case less than $100.00, will be charged to the project sponsor by the city council. 
(9)  The city council shall act on the formal award and signing of the contract or the rejection of bids as outlined in subsection (b)(8) of this section. 
(10)  Upon completion of the project, the project costs shall be audited and all surplus funds returned to the project sponsor. 
(c)  Alternate procedure. In lieu of the procedure set forth in subsection (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the project sponsor may elect to request the department of public works and services to handle the entire project. In this case, the project sponsor shall remit to the department of public works and services ten percent of the estimated project cost as a good faith deposit. The department of public works and services shall cause engineering drawings to be prepared and the necessary approvals and permits obtained. If the sponsor elects not to proceed with the project, the deposit, or so much as is necessary, shall be used to defray engineering and administrative costs incurred and the balance if any shall be refunded to the sponsor. 
(d)  Sewer construction methods, materials, standards and permit procedures. The city council may adopt from time to time such rules and regulations relating to sewer construction methods, materials and permit procedures as it may deem advisable.

(b)  Because the storm sewers, drains and outlets possess unique characteristics that do not lend themselves to categorical regulation, it is hereby required that specific plans and specifications be submitted to the department of public works and services setting forth the design criteria and construction details. The department of public works and services shall then alter, amend or approve plans and issue a permit therefor.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 64-1-64-18. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - TREE AND WOODLAND PRESERVATION 

Sec. 64-19. - Short title.

(Code 1999, § 38-21; Ord. of 5-24-1999, § 1) 
Sec. 64-20. - Findings. 
(a)  The city finds that protection of natural resources is a matter of paramount public concern as provided by article IV, section 52 of the Constitution of the state and the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (MCL 324.101 et seq.); the removal of trees constitute destruction of a natural resource and may be protected from removal under the aforesaid Act; rapid growth and the spread of development have had the effect of encroaching upon, despoiling and eliminating many trees, woodlands and other forms of vegetation within the city with a significant consequential effect on other natural resources; and, such growth and development has clearly emphasized the need for regulatory control to achieve harmonious integration of improvements to land with these natural resources in order to maximize preservation of such natural resources. 
(b)  The city further finds that trees and woodlands protect public health through the absorption of air pollution and contamination, by conserving water quality, by the reduction of noise, and the mental and physical damage related to noise pollution, and through their cooling effect in the summer months; that trees contribute to public safety through the prevention of soil erosion, siltation and flooding; and that trees, woodlands and the wildlife habitat that they provide promote the general welfare by maintaining natural beauty, recreation and education opportunities, natural visual screening of land uses and improvements thereon, and represent an irreplaceable heritage for existing and future residents of the city. 
(Code 1999, § 38-22; Ord. of 5-24-1999, § 3) 
Sec. 64-21. - Intent and purpose. 
    The intent and purpose of this article is to promote feasible and prudent alternatives to the destruction and removal of trees and woodlands consistent with promotion of the public health, safety and welfare in light of the paramount public concern for the protection of natural resources from impairment or destruction; to provide for the protection and preservation of trees and woodlands in order to minimize destruction and disturbance to them, the wildlife habitat that they provide and other consequential effects on other natural resources; to protect and preserve trees and woodlands for their economic support of local property values, natural beauty, wilderness character, and ecological significance. The intent of this article is not to be excessively restrictive nor prohibitive but to provide for the submission and evaluation of feasible and prudent alternatives to the destruction and removal of trees and woodlands in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth herein prior to such action being taken.

Sec. 38.2.2. - Reemployment of Participant. 
    If a Participant terminates employment with the City and thereafter is reemployed by the City, he shall recommence participation in the Plan on the date of his resumption of employment. An employee who was not a Participant at the time he terminated employment with the City and who is thereafter reemployed by the City, must satisfy the requirements for eligibility in section 38.2.1 above as if he had never previously been employed by the City. 
Sec. 38.2.2.A. - Reemployment of Participant-intervening military service.

Upon such Employee's reemployment by the City of Romulus or 34th District Court within the period prescribed by USERRA, the employee shall be treated as having received the compensation and hours of service that would have been paid or credited to the employee as an active employee for the entire period of the employee's armed service. 
Sec. 38.2.3. - One-time election. 
    The ability to decline to participate previously provided under this section 38.2.3, was repealed effective July 1, 1993. 
Sec. 38.2.4. - Transfers. 
    An Employee or Participant who transfers from one category of Employee or Participant (for example, but not by way of limitation, from a unit of employees covered by one collective bargaining agreement to a different unit) shall not be treated as having terminated employment, and his participation in the Plan on and after the date of such transfer shall be governed by the provisions of this Plan which apply to such Employee's or Participant's new category on and after the date of such transfer. 
Sec. 38.2.5. - Participation in MERS.

(c)  September 1, 2004 - union and non-union 34th District Court Participants.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Participant Contributions made to the Trust prior to October 7, 1990, shall be treated as mandatory after-tax contributions for all purposes under this Plan.

The Committee shall adopt such rules governing the time and manner for making the election, and the number of elections which may be made in a Plan Year, as it deems advisable in its discretion. 
Sec. 38.3.4. - Time for making contributions. 
    The City shall pay to the Trustee the City Contribution hereunder each pay period, and in any event not later than 30 days following the date on which the Participant receives the Compensation on which the City Contribution is based.

(1)  A Participant's rollover account shall be distributed at the same time and in the same manner as provided in Article V of this Plan. 
(2)  Amounts in a rollover account shall be available for loans as provided in section 38.5.9 and in accordance with the Plan's loan rules. 
Sec. 38.3.6. - Exclusive benefit of employees. 
    All contributions made pursuant to the Plan shall be held by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of this Plan and the Trust Agreement (if any) for the exclusive benefit of those employees who are Participants under the Plan, including former employees and their beneficiaries, and shall be applied to provide benefits under the Plan and to pay expenses of administration of the Plan and the Trust, to the extent that such expenses are not otherwise paid. At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to such Employees and their Beneficiaries shall any part of the Trust Fund (other than such part as may be required to pay administration expenses and taxes), be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of such Employees and their Beneficiaries. However, without regard to the provisions of this section:

    Upon the retirement of a Participant at or after his Normal Retirement Date, the Committee shall notify the Trustee in writing of the Participant's retirement and shall direct the Trustee to make payment of the Adjusted Balance of the Participant's Accounts as of the Valuation Date coinciding with or immediately preceding the date distribution is made to the Participant. A Participant who attains his Normal Retirement Date and continues to be an Employee shall continue to share in the allocation of City Contributions and Participant Contributions, and may continue to make After-tax Contributions. 
Sec. 38.5.2. - Payments on death. 
(a)  Upon the death of a Participant, the Committee shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of the Participant's death and the name of his Beneficiary (or spouse, if applicable) and shall direct the Trustee to make payment of the adjusted balance of the Participant's Accounts (reduced by any security interest held by the Plan by reason of a loan outstanding to a Participant as of the date of his death pursuant to section 38.5.9) as of the valuation date coinciding with or immediately preceding the date distribution is made to his Beneficiary or spouse. 
(b)  Each Participant shall have the right to designate in writing on a form provided by the Committee a person or persons or entity as Beneficiary to receive the death benefit provided under this section 38.5.2. Successive designations may be made, and the last designation received by the Committee prior to the death of the Participant shall be effective and shall revoke all prior designations. If a designated Beneficiary shall die before the Participant, the Beneficiary's interest shall terminate, and, unless otherwise provided in the Participant's designation if the designation included more than one Beneficiary, such interest shall be paid in equal shares to those Beneficiaries, if any, who survive the Participant. A Participant to whom this subsection applies shall have the right to designate different Beneficiaries to receive the adjusted balance of his Accounts under the Plan and shall have the right to revoke the designation of any Beneficiary without the consent of the Beneficiary. 
(c)  If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary, if such designation is for any reason illegal or ineffective, or if no Beneficiary survives the Participant, his death benefits otherwise payable pursuant to subsection (b) shall be paid: 
(i)  To his spouse; 
(ii)  If there is no spouse, to his descendants (including legally adopted children or their descendants) by right of representation; 
(iii)  If there is no spouse nor surviving descendants, to the Participant's estate. 
(d)  The Committee may determine the identity of the distributees of any death benefit payable under the Plan and in so doing may act and rely upon any information it may deem reliable upon reasonable inquiry, and upon any affidavit, certificate, or other paper believed by it to be genuine, and upon any evidence believed by it sufficient. The Committee's determination of death and the right of any person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(e)  As provided in section 38.4.6(c), effective with respect to deaths occurring on or after January 1, 2007, the survivors of a Participant who dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Code Section 414(u)) are entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under the Plan as if the Participant had resumed and then terminated employment with the Employer on account of his death. 
Sec. 38.5.3. - Payments on disability. 
    Upon the termination of a Participant's employment with the City by reason of a disability, the Committee shall notify the Trustee in writing of the disability termination, and shall direct the Trustee to make payment of the adjusted balance of the Participant's Accounts (reduced by any security interest held by the Plan by reason of a loan outstanding to the Participant as of the date of disability retirement) as of the valuation date coinciding with or immediately preceding the date a distribution is made to the Participant. For purposes of this section, "disability" means a physical or mental condition which is expected to render the Participant permanently unable to perform his usual duties or any comparable duties for the City. The determination of the existence of such disability shall be made by the City and shall be final and binding upon the Participant and all other parties. The City may require the submission of such medical evidence as it may deem necessary in order to arrive at its determination. The City's determination of the existence of a disability will be made with reference to the nature of the injury without regard to the period the Participant is absent from work. 
Sec. 38.5.4. - Payments on termination for other reasons. 
(a)  Upon the termination of a Participant's employment with the City for any reason other than retirement on or after his Normal Retirement Date, death, or permanent disability, the Committee shall notify the Trustee in writing of the termination and shall direct the Trustee to make payment of the adjusted balances of his Participant Contribution Account and his After-tax Contribution Account and the vested portion of the Adjusted Balance of his City Contribution Account (less the unpaid balance of any outstanding loan pursuant to section 38.5.9) as of the date of distribution. The vested portion of a Participant's City Contribution Account shall be determined in accordance with section 38.4.6. The non-vested portion, if any, of the adjusted balance of his City Contribution Account shall be deemed a forfeiture on the earlier of (i) the date of distribution of the Participant's vested Accounts or (ii) the end of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which termination of employment occurs, if earlier, and shall be applied to pay administrative expenses of the Plan or reduce the City Contribution for that Plan Year. 
    Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the provisions of this section 38.5.4(a) and section 38.5.5 shall apply to vested terminated Participants who have not received the distribution of their entire pension benefits as of the date of the initial adoption of this ordinance. 
(b)  If a Participant who has terminated employment with the City and received a distribution pursuant to this section returns to employment with the City, any amount forfeited pursuant to (a) above shall be reinstated to his City Contribution Account upon repayment by the Participant of the amount of the distribution. Such repayment must be made before the first anniversary of the date on which the Participant is reemployed by the City. Upon a subsequent termination of employment or retirement, the Participant's vested interest shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing vesting schedule as if no termination of employment had occurred. 
(c)  Restoration of a forfeiture shall be made from the following sources in the order listed: 
(i)  Forfeitures which have become available to reduce City Contributions pursuant to paragraph (a) above; and 
(ii)  A contribution made by the City for such purpose. 
(d)  A Participant who at the time of his termination of employment does not have any vested interest in his City Contribution Account shall be deemed to have received a distribution of his entire City Contribution Account. 
Sec. 38.5.5. - Methods of payment. 
(a)  Payment for reasons other than death.

(2)  In installments payable in substantially equal amounts commencing within a reasonable time after termination of the Participant's employment and continuing over a period that complies with section 38.5.6, but in no event over a period exceeding ten years in the case of a Participant whose termination occurs prior to age 65.

(E)  Any other form of annuity requested by the Participant which can be purchased from a commercial insurance company. 
(ii)  If a Participant does not elect a method of payment pursuant to this subsection (a), then payment of the Adjusted Balance of his Accounts will be made to him in a lump sum. 
(iii)  For purposes of this subsection (a), the term "election period" means the 90-day period ending on the date payments commence to the Participant. Any election pursuant to this paragraph (a) may be modified or revoked during the election period and shall be automatically revoked if the Participant dies before payment commences.

(d)  Time of payment. Payments shall be made or commence as follows: 
(i)  A Participant who terminates employment with the City prior to his Normal Retirement Date may elect to have the vested portion of the adjusted balance of his Accounts paid either (A) as soon as administratively feasible after the date which coincides with or immediately follows the date on which he terminated employment or (B) at any time thereafter, up to the time he would have reached his Normal Retirement Date had he continued in employment with the City. 
(ii)  Payments to a Participant who terminates employment with the City on his Normal Retirement Date shall commence on such date or as soon thereafter as is administratively feasible, and, if the payment is in a form other than a lump sum, shall be retroactive to the Participant's Normal Retirement Date. 
Sec. 38.5.6. - Age 701/2 and Other Distribution Rules under Code Section 401(a)(9). 
(a)  General Rules: 
(1)  Precedence. The requirements of this section 38.5.6 will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan.

All distributions required under this section 38.5.6 will be determined and made in accordance with Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, including the incidental death benefit requirements of Section 401(a)(9)(G) and the Treasury regulations under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act ("TEFRA") and the provisions of the Plan that relate to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and Manner of Distribution. 
(1)  Required Beginning Date. The Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later than the Participant's Required Beginning Date (as hereinafter defined). 
(2)  Death of Participant Before Distributions Begin. If the Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
(A)  If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary (as hereinafter defined), distributions to such surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age seventy and one-half (70-1/2), if later. 
(B)  If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then, distributions to such Designated Beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died. 
(C)  If there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Participant's death. 
(D)  If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (A) above, shall apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant. 
    For purposes of subsections (b) and (e), unless the preceding subparagraph (D) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant's Required Beginning Date. If subparagraph (D) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under the preceding subparagraph (A). If distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the Participant before the Participant's Required Beginning Date (or to the Participant's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under the preceding subparagraph (A)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(c)  Forms of Distribution. As of the first distribution calendar year, distributions will be made in accordance with subsections (d) and (e) of this section unless the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date. If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and Treasury regulations thereunder. 
(d)  Required Minimum Distributions During Participant's Lifetime. 
(1)  Amount of Required Minimum Distribution for each Distribution Calendar Year. During the Participant's lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year is the lesser of: 
(A)  The quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's age as of the Participant's birthday in the Distribution Calendar Year; or 
(B)  If the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary for the distribution calendar year is the Participant's spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and spouse's birthdays in the Distribution Calendar Year. 
(2)  Lifetime Required Minimum Distributions Continue Through Year of Participant's Death. Required minimum distributions will be determined under this subsection (d) beginning with the first Distribution Calendar Year and up to and including the Distribution Calendar Year that includes the Participant's date of death. 
(e)  Required Minimum Distributions After Participant's Death. 
(1)  Death On or After Date Distributions Begin. 
(A)  Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the longer of the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant or the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant's Designated Beneficiary, determined as follows: 
(i)  The Participant's remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
(ii)  If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death using the surviving spouse's age as of the spouse's birthday in that year. For Distribution Calendar Years after the year of the surviving spouse's death, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated using the age of the surviving spouse as of the spouse's birthday in the calendar year of the spouse's death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year. 
(iii)  If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the Designated Beneficiary's remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Beneficiary in the year following the year of the Participant's death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
(B)  No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant's death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the Participant's remaining Life Expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
(2)  Death Before Date Distributions Begin. 
(A)  Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant's Designated Beneficiary, determined as provided in the preceding subsection (e)(1). 
(B)  No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, distribution of the Participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Participant's death. 
(C)  Death of Surviving Spouse Before Distributions to Surviving Spouse are Required to Begin. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin, the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under the preceding subsection (b)(2)(A), this subsection (e)(2) will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.

For distributions beginning before the Participant's death, the first Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the Participant's Required Beginning Date. For distributions beginning after the Participant's death, the first Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin under the preceding subsection (b)(2). The required minimum distribution for the Participant's first Distribution Calendar Year will be made on or before the Participant's Required Beginning Date. The required minimum distribution for other Distribution Calendar Years, including the required minimum distribution for the Distribution Calendar Year in which the Participant's Required Beginning Date occurs, will be made on or before December 31 of that Distribution Calendar Year.

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of subsections (b)(2) and (e)(2) to the contrary, if the Participant dies before distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, distribution to the Designated Beneficiary is not required to begin by the date specified in subsection (b)(2), but the Participant's entire interest will be distributed to the Designated Beneficiary by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death if the Participant or Beneficiary so elects under the following subsection (h). If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to either the Participant or the surviving spouse begin, this election will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.

Participants or Beneficiaries may elect on an individual basis whether the five-year (5-year) rule in the preceding subsection (g) or the life expectancy rule in the preceding subsections (b)(2) and (e)(2) applies to all distributions after the death of a Participant who has a Designated Beneficiary. The election must be made no later than the earlier of September 30 of the calendar year in which distribution would be required to begin under preceding subsection (b)(2), or by September 30 of the calendar year which contains the fifth anniversary of the Participant's (or, if applicable, surviving spouse's) death. If neither the Participant nor Beneficiary makes an election under this Section, distributions will be made in accordance with the preceding subsections(b)(2) and (e)(2). 
(i)  The requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the provisions of the Plan relating thereto shall, subject to the following rules, not apply for calendar year 2009: 
(1)  In the case of a Participant who otherwise would receive a distribution equal or substantially similar to the amount that Code Section 401(a)(9) would require the Plan to distribute for the 2009 calendar year ("the 2009 RMD"), the Plan shall permit the Participant to elect whether to receive the 2009 RMD. This election by the Participant shall not affect the right of the Participant to receive any amount available under the Plan other than the 2009 RMD. If the Participant fails to make an election, the Plan shall not distribute the 2009 RMD to the Participant. 
(2)  For purposes of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the provisions of the Plan relating thereto: (1) the required beginning date with respect to any individual will be determined without regard to this Paragraph 13 for purposes of applying Code Section 401(a)(9) for calendar years other than 2009, and (2) if the five-year rule of Code Section 401(a)(9)(B)(ii) applies, the five-year period described therein shall be determined without regard to calendar year 2009.

    Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a Distributee's election under this Section, a Distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Committee, to have any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee in a Direct Rollover.

(c)  Repayment of loans. 
(i)  All loan repayments under this section (including payments of principal and interest) shall be credited to the borrowing Participant's account and shall not be allocated pursuant to section 38.4.7 as earnings of the Trust. All such loan repayments shall be invested based upon the borrowing Participant's current investment election. 
(ii)  All loans made under this section 38.5.9 shall mature and be payable in full within five years after the date such loan is made, except that a loan to a Participant used to acquire any dwelling unit that within a reasonable time after the loan is made is to be used (determined at the time the loan is made) as the principal residence of the Participant shall mature and be payable in full within ten (10) years after the date the loan is made. 
(iii)  Payments of principal and interest shall be made through payroll deductions for Participants who are active employees. Such Participants shall irrevocably authorize payroll deductions in writing on a form supplied by the Committee at the time the loan is made. Such payroll deductions shall be sufficient to amortize the principal and interest payable pursuant to the loan during the term thereof on a substantially level basis in equal quarterly (or more frequent) installments. Upon termination of employment, the loan will become immediately due and payable in full. 
(d)  Interest rate. Any loan granted or renewed under this program shall bear a reasonable rate of interest. In determining such rate of interest, the Plan shall require a rate of return commensurate with the prevailing interest rate charged on similar commercial loans under like circumstances by persons in the business of lending money. Such prevailing interest rate standard shall permit the Committee to consider factors pertaining to the opportunity for gain and risk of loss that a professional lender would consider on a similar arms-length transaction, such as the credit worthiness of the Participant and the security given for the loan. 
(e)  Security. Adequate security shall be provided by the Participant before a loan is granted. For this purpose, the Plan shall consider a Participant's interest under the Plan to be adequate security. It shall be the policy of the Plan not to make loans which require security other than the Participant's vested interest in the Plan. 
(f)  Miscellaneous terms. 
(i)  The borrowing Participant shall have the right to prepay all of the interest and principal of such loan without penalty. 
(ii)  The loans shall be evidenced by such forms of obligations, and shall be made upon such additional terms as to default, prepayment, security and otherwise as the Committee shall determine. 
(iii)  The Committee may charge a borrowing Participant such reasonable administrative fees with respect to each loan as the Committee shall, in its discretion, decide. 
(g)  Default. 
(i)  The entire unpaid balance of any loan made under this section 38.5.9 and all interest due thereon, including all arrearages thereon, shall immediately become due and payable without further notice of demand, if, with respect to the borrowing Participant, any of the following events of default occurs: 
(1)  Any payments of principal or accrued interest on the loan remain due and unpaid for a period after ten days after the same becomes due and payable under the terms of the loan; 
(2)  A proceeding in bankruptcy, receivership, or insolvency is commenced by or against the borrowing Participant; or 
(3)  The Participant's employment with the City terminates for any reason. 
Any payments of principal or interest on the loan not paid when due shall bear interest thereafter, to the extent permitted by law, at the rate specified by the terms of the loan. The payment and acceptance of any sum or sums at any time on account of the loan after an event of default, or any failure to act or enforce the rights granted hereunder upon an event of default, shall not be a waiver of the right of acceleration set forth in this paragraph. 
(ii)  If an event of default and an acceleration of the unpaid balance of the loan and interest due thereon shall occur, the Committee shall have the right to direct the Trustee to pursue any remedies available to a creditor at law or under the terms of the loan, including the right to execute on the security for the loan. 
(iii)  The Trustee shall not be required to commence such actions immediately upon a default. Instead, the Trustee may grant the Participant reasonable rights to cure any default, provided such actions would constitute a prudent and reasonable course of conduct for a professional lender in like circumstances. 
(iv)  If (1) any portion of a loan or loans shall be outstanding and (2) an event occurs pursuant to which the Participant, his estate or his Beneficiary will receive a lump sum distribution from the Accounts of such Participant under the provisions of the Plan, then such Participant, if living, shall pay to the Trustee an amount equal to the portion of the loan or loans then outstanding, including all accrued interest thereon, and such Participant shall then receive the full amount of the distribution under the provisions of the Plan to which he is otherwise entitled. If such Participant is not then living, or if such Participant does not make full payment of the portion of the loan or loans then outstanding within 30 days after the date of the event pursuant to which the distribution is to be made, then such distribution shall be made to the Trustee as payment on the loan or loans to the extent necessary to liquidate the unpaid portion of the loan or loans. No distribution shall be made to a Participant or his estate or his spouse or his beneficiary from his accounts in an amount greater than the excess of the portion of his accounts otherwise distributable over the aggregate of the amounts owing with respect to such loan or loans plus interest, if any, thereon, taking into consideration any portion of the loan or loans paid by the Participant pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (iv). 
(v)  All loans made pursuant to this section 38.5.9 shall be funded from the borrowing Participant's Accounts as set forth in section 38.5.9(b)(ii). The Accounts of a Participant shall, to the extent used to fund such loan, not participate in the allocation of earnings and losses pursuant to section 38.4.7. All interest paid by a Participant with respect to a loan shall be credited to the borrowing Participant's Accounts and shall not be allocated pursuant to section 38.4.7 as earnings of the Trust. 
(h)  Grant of loan. Upon satisfaction of the criteria established for granting a loan, the Committee shall inform the Trustee that the Participant has qualified to receive a loan under the Plan.

The Committee shall render a decision on the claim appeal promptly, but not later than 60 days after the receipt of the claimant's request for review, unless special circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing, if necessary), require an extension of time for processing, in which case the 60 days prior may be extended to 120 days. The Committee shall notify the claimant in writing of any such extension. The decision upon review shall (i) include specific reasons for the decision, (ii) be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and (iii) contain specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions upon which the decision is based.

As custodian of all assets and funds of this Trust, the Trustee shall accept and receive all sums of money paid to it from time to time by the City pursuant to the terms of this Plan, and shall hold, invest, reinvest, manage and administer those monies and the increment, earnings and income thereof on the Trust Fund for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries. 
Sec. 38.7.2. - Payment of benefits. 
    The Trustee shall pay benefits to such persons, at such times, and in such amounts as shall be set forth in written instructions furnished to it by the Committee; provided, however, that in no event shall the Trustee be under any obligation to make any payment other than from the funds in this Trust.

Sec. 38.7.3. - Investments authorized. 
    The Trustee shall collect the income of the Trust Fund, and shall invest and reinvest the assets of the Trust Fund without distinction between principal and income, except such amounts as may be estimated, from time to time, to be required for current payments and expenses.

A. 1982, No. 55, being Section 38.1132 et seq. of the Michigan Compiled Laws Annotated (the "Investment of Funds of Public Employee Retirement Systems Act"), provided that the powers of the Trustee shall be subject to and limited by the provisions of such act. Notwithstanding the above, the limitations on the percentages of total assets for investment provided in the Act do not apply to the Plan to the extent a Participant directs the investment of assets in his or her own individual Accounts, and the Participant is not considered an investment fiduciary under the Act. Except as provided in section 38.7.4 for an investment manager and in Article VIII for Participant-directed investments, the Trustee shall exercise its own discretion in the investment of the Trust Fund. 
Sec. 38.7.4. - Investment manager. 
    The Committee may, by resolution, assume from, the Trustee and transfer to the Committee or an investment manager the authority and duty to direct the investment and management of all or a portion of the Trust Fund; provided that: 
(a)  A certified copy of any such Committee action shall be delivered to the Trustee whereupon the Committee or the investment manager, as the case may be, shall be the fiduciary with respect to the investment and management of the Trust Fund (or designated portion thereof) and the Trustee shall have no responsibility there for. 
(b)  Any transfer of investment and management authority to the Committee or to an investment manager may be revoked upon receipt by the Trustee of a written notice to that effect by the Committee. 
(c)  The appointment, selection, and retention of a qualified investment manager shall be solely the responsibility of the Committee unless such investment manager has been retained by the Trustee pursuant to section 38.7.5(vii) below. During such period or periods of time, if any, as the Committee or any investment manager is authorized to direct the investment and management of all or a part of the Trust Fund: 
(i)  The Trustee is authorized and entitled to rely upon the fact that the investment manager is authorized to direct the investment and management of the Trust Fund until such time as the Committee shall notify the Trustee in writing that another investment manager has been appointed in the place and stead of the investment manager named or, in the alternative, that the investment manager named has been removed and the responsibility for the investment and management of the Trust Fund has been assumed by the Committee or has been transferred back to the Trustee, as the case may be. 
(ii)  The Trustee shall not be liable or responsible for losses or unfavorable results arising from the Trustee's compliance with proper directions of the Committee which are made in accordance with this Plan and which are not contrary to the provisions of the Investment of Funds of Public Employee Retirement Systems Act regulating such investment and management of the assets of this Trust. The Trustee shall not be liable or responsible in any way for any losses or other unfavorable results arising from the Trustee's compliance with investment or management directions received by the Trustee from the investment manager. 
(iii)  All directions concerning investments made by the Committee or the investment manager shall be signed by such person or persons, acting on behalf of the Committee or the investment manager, as the case may be, as may be duly authorized in writing; provided, however, that the transmission to the Trustee of such directions by photostatic teletransmission with duplicate or facsimile signature or signatures shall be considered a delivery in writing of the aforesaid directions until the Trustee is notified in writing by the Committee that the use of such devices with duplicate or facsimile signatures is no longer authorized. 
(iv)  The Trustee shall, as promptly as possible, comply with any written directions given by the Committee or an investment manager hereunder and, where such directions are given by photostatic teletransmission with facsimile signature or signatures, the Trustee shall be entitled to resume that any directions so given are fully authorized. 
(v)  The Trustee shall not be liable for its failure to invest any or all of the Trust Fund in the absence of such written directions. 
(vi)  The Trustee shall have no obligation to determine the existence of any conversion, redemption, exchange, subscription or other right relating to any of the securities purchased, of which notice was given prior to the purchase of such securities, and shall have no obligation to exercise any such right unless the Trustee is informed of the existence of the right and is instructed to exercise such right, in writing, by the Committee or the investment manager, as the case may be, within a reasonable time prior to the expiration of such right. 
(vii)  Neither the Committee nor any investment manager referred to above shall direct the purchase, sale, or retention of any assets of the Trust Fund if such directions are not in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Investment of Funds of Public Employee Retirement Systems Act. 
(d)  For purposes of this Section, the term "Investment Manager" means, in accordance with the Public Employees Retirement Systems Investment Act, a person (other than (1) the Committee, (2) any other person named herein as a fiduciary, and (3) a Participant directing the investment of the assets of his or her own individual Accounts) who: 
(i)  Exercises any discretionary authority or control in the investment of any property of the Trust, 
(ii)  Has the power to manage, acquire or dispose of any property of the Trust, or

(2)  The State of Michigan under the Michigan Uniform Securities Act, Act No. 265 of the Public Acts of 1964, as amended,

Sec. 38.7.13. - Incapacity of Committee. 
    If, at any time, the Committee shall be incapable of giving the Trustee directions, instructions, or authorizations as herein provided, the Trustee may act as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate and advisable in the circumstances for the carrying out of the provisions of the Plan and Trust.

(d)  The Committee through the Plan's third party recordkeeper, will maintain individual accounts representing the interest of Participants in the several investment funds. Each investment fund may be invested as a single fund, however, without segregation of fund assets to the accounts of Participants.

Sec. 38.10.1. - Duty to furnish information and documents. 
    Participants and their Beneficiaries must furnish to the Committee such evidence, data or information as the Committee considers necessary or desirable for the purpose of administering the Plan, and the provisions of the Plan for each person are upon the condition that he will furnish promptly full, true, and complete evidence, data, and information requested by the Committee. All parties to, or claiming any interest under, the Plan hereby agree to perform any and all acts, and to execute any and all documents and papers, necessary or desirable for carrying out the Plan and the Trust. 
Sec. 38.10.2. - Committee's annual statements and available information. 
    The Committee shall advise employees of the eligibility requirements and benefits under the Plan. As soon as practicable after making the annual valuations and allocations provided for in the Plan, and at such other times as the Committee may determine, the Committee shall provide each Participant, and each former Participant and Beneficiary with respect to whom an account is maintained, with a statement reflecting the current status of his Accounts. No Participant, except a member of the Committee, shall have the right to inspect the records reflecting the Account of any other Participant. The Committee shall make available for inspection at reasonable times by Participants and Beneficiaries copies of the Plan, any amendments thereto, and all reports of Plan and Trust operations required by law. 
Sec. 38.10.3. - No enlargement of employment rights. 
    Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between the City and any person, nor shall the Plan be deemed to give any person the right to be retained in the employment of the City or limit the right of the City to hire or discharge any person with or without cause, or to discipline any Employee. 
Sec. 38.10.4. - Applicable law. 
    All questions pertaining to the validity, construction and administration of the Plan shall be determined in conformity with the laws of the State of Michigan. 
Sec. 38.10.5. - No guarantee. 
    Neither the Trustee, the Committee, nor the City in any way guarantee the Trust Fund from loss or depreciation or the payment or any benefits which may be or become due to any person from the Trust Fund. No Participant or other person shall have any recourse against the Trustee, the City or the Committee if the Trust Fund is insufficient to provide Plan benefits in full. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any Participant, former Participant, or Beneficiary an interest in any specific part of the Trust Fund or any other interest except the right to receive benefits out of the Trust Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and Trust. 
Sec. 38.10.6. - Unclaimed funds. 
    Each Participant shall keep the Committee informed of his current address and the current address of his Beneficiary or Beneficiaries. Neither the City, the Committee nor the Trustee shall be obligated to search for the whereabouts of any person. If the location of a Participant is not made known to the Committee after the mailing of a registered letter, return receipt requested, to the last known address, and after further diligent effort, three years after the date on which distribution of the Participant's Accounts may first be made, distribution may be made as though the Participant had died at the end of the three-year period. If, within one additional year after such three-year period has elapsed, or, within three years after the actual death of a Participant, the Committee is unable to locate any individual who would receive a distribution under the Plan upon the death of the Participant pursuant to section 3.8.5.2 of the Plan, the Adjusted Balance of the Participant's Accounts shall be deemed a forfeiture and shall be used to reduce City Contributions to the Plan for the Plan Year next following the year in which the forfeiture occurs; provided, however, that in the event that the Participant or a Beneficiary makes a claim for any amount which has been forfeited, the benefits which have been forfeited shall be reinstated. 
Sec. 38.10.7. - Interest nontransferable. 
(a)  Except as provided in section 38.5.9 in this section, no interest of any person or entity in, or right to receive distributions from, the Trust Fund shall be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, garnishment, or other alienation or encumbrance of any kind; nor may such interest or right to receive distributions be taken, either voluntarily or involuntarily, for the satisfaction of the debts of, or other obligations or claims against, such person or entity, including claims in bankruptcy proceedings. The preceding sentence shall also apply to the creation, assignment or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except as specifically provided for eligible domestic relations orders ("EDROs") pursuant to the Michigan Compiled Laws 38.1701-38.1711 and except as set forth below. 
(b)  Benefits under the Plan may be assigned pursuant to a domestic relations order which meets the requirements of Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (as if the Plan were the qualified retirement plan of a private employer rather than of a government) (a "QDRO") in whichever of the following methods is specified in such order: 
(i)  Unless the Participant has already commenced to receive benefits in an annuity form, a QDRO may divide the value of the Participant's benefits between the Participant and the alternate payee, in which case, the value of the benefits payable to the alternate payee shall be deducted from the Participant's benefits. The alternate payee shall have the right to receive such benefits in any form available to a Participant, except a joint and survivor annuity for the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse, and commencing at any time after the Participant attains earliest retirement age, but prior to the Participant's Required Distribution Date, and, as specified in the QDRO or as specified by the alternate payee if the QDRO does not specify a form and/or time for payment. Effective July 1, 2002, the benefits payable to an alternate payee pursuant to a QDRO and this Section shall be paid as soon as administratively feasible after the Committee determines that the order meets the requirements of Section 414(p) of the Code. Benefits awarded to the alternate payee in the QDRO shall be paid whether or not the Participant dies prior to such payment, and the alternate payee shall have the right to designate a Beneficiary to receive benefits in the event of the alternate payee's death to the extent permitted for a Participant electing the same form of payment, unless the QDRO provides otherwise. 
(ii)  If a Participant has already started to receive his benefits, the form of payment may not be changed, and if the form of payment is a joint and survivor annuity, the joint annuitant may not be changed. 
(iii)  An order shall not be an EDRO or a QDRO unless it includes directions with respect to the Participant's benefits. An order shall (a) direct that all, any, or no portion of the Participant's benefits be awarded to the alternate payee; (b) direct the form of payment of the alternate payee's share of the benefits, which may only be as an annuity if the order is an EDRO, but which may be in another form if the order is a QDRO. 
(iv)  The Committee may charge for the cost to review the EDRO or QDRO by the Plan's attorney. An order shall not be an EDRO or QDRO unless it includes directions on who will pay such charges. In the event a portion of a Participant's benefit is assigned to an alternate payee pursuant to an EDRO or QDRO, the alternate payee's choice of a form of payment shall not affect the right of the Participant to independently elect a form of payment of the remainder of benefits, unless the alternate payee is designated as the Participant's surviving spouse in an EDRO or unless the Participant's benefits are already in pay status (in which case the form of payment is already fixed.) 
    Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the benefits payable to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order and this section 38.10.7 may be paid in a lump sum as soon as administratively feasible after the Committee determines that the order meets the requirements of Section 414(p) of the Code (a QDRO), if so directed in such order. 
Sec. 38.10.8. - Prudent Person rule. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Trustee, the Committee and the City shall exercise their powers and discharge their duties under this Plan solely in the interest of the Participants and their Beneficiaries, and to act with the same care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a similar capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of a similar enterprise with similar aims. Subject to the terms of the preceding sentence, the Trustee or investment manager shall diversify investments of the Trust Fund so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so, and shall invest the Trust Fund for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to Participants and their Beneficiaries and of defraying reasonable expenses of investing the Trust Fund, and shall further discharge its duties in accordance with the Investment of Funds of Public Employee Retirement Systems Act. 
Sec. 38.10.9. - Limitations on liability. 
    Notwithstanding any other of the preceding provisions of the Plan the Trustee, the City, the Committee and each individual acting as an employee or agent of any of them shall not be liable to any Participant, former Participant or Beneficiary for any claim, loss, liability or expense incurred in connection with the Plan, except when the same shall have been judicially determined to be due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such person. The City shall, to the extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless each individual acting as an employee or agent of the City (including Committee members) from any and all claims, liabilities, costs and expense (including attorneys' fees) arising out of any actual or alleged act or failure to act with respect to the administration of the Plan, except that no indemnification or defense shall be provided to any person with respect to conduct which has been judicially determined, or agreed by the parties, to have constituted bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of such person, or to have resulted in his receipt of personal profit or advantage to which he is not entitled. 
Sec. 38.10.10. - Headings. 
    The headings in this Plan are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in construction of the provisions hereof. 
Sec. 38.10.11. - Gender and number. 
    Except when otherwise required by the context, any masculine terminology in this document shall include the feminine, and any singular terminology shall include the plural. 
Sec. 38.10.12. - Severability. 
    If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Plan to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue to be fully effective.

    Pursuant to the authority granted to the City in the Public Employee Health Care Fund Investment Act, 149 P.A. of 1999 (MCL 38.1121 et seq.), as amended, the City hereby establishes a separate Trust to be used for the accumulation and investment of funds for the purpose of funding health care benefits for retired employees of the Employer, an essential government function. The Trust shall constitute a governmental trust pursuant to section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Trust shall be irrevocable and shall conform to all applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code, the applicable collective bargaining agreements, personnel policies, the statement of purpose in this Plan, and all statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, arbitrators' awards and judicial decisions interpreting the foregoing provisions. 
    The Trust shall consist of City contributions, any contributions which may be paid by employees, retirees and other qualified beneficiaries pursuant to the provisions of an applicable collective bargaining agreement or City personnel policies adopted by ordinance. All investments made or held under Trust, and all income therefrom, both received and accrued, and any other property, which may be received or held by reason of this Trust. The income accruing to the Trust shall be excluded from gross income of the Trust as such Trust income is derived from the exercise of an essential government function. Any funds paid by retirees and other qualified beneficiaries as a result of premium sharing required pursuant to an applicable collective bargaining agreement or City personnel policy, shall be paid directly to the City and/or the applicable insurance carrier and shall not be paid into the Trust. 
Section 1.4. - Funding Policy. 
    For the purpose of creating and maintaining a fund for the payment of health care benefits payable as provided herein, the City will pay to the Trust an amount consistent with the actuarial valuations and calculations made by the Actuary for the Trust to result in a pre-funded plan. The City reserves the right to fund these health care benefits on a "pay-as-you-go" basis and the right to provide such lesser amount as the City determines. Such contributions shall also be made in accordance with any regulations of the Board of Trustees as are not inconsistent with the authority stated in this Plan and Trust, as well as any Personnel Policies or Collective Bargaining Agreements regarding this Plan and Trust. All contributions required by this ordinance shall be transferred to the Trust as soon as administratively feasible.

If any provisions of the Plan shall be, for any reason, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions nevertheless shall be carried into effect. 
    Neither the establishment of the Plan nor the Trust nor any modification thereof, nor the creation of any fund or account, nor the payment of any benefits, shall be construed as giving to any person covered under the Plan and Trust, or other person, any legal or equitable right against the Employer, its elected or appointed officials or employees, the Trustees or any individual Trustee, except as may otherwise be provided in this Plan. 
    Neither the Employer, nor the Trustees, nor the Plan and Trust shall be responsible for the validity of any Insurance Agreement issued in connection with the Plan or for the failure on the part of the Insurer to make payments provided by such Insurance Agreement, or for the action of any person which may delay payment or render an Insurance Agreement null and void or unenforceable in whole or in part.

The Trustees shall be entitled to collect on the Employer's indemnity under this Section only from the Employer and shall not be entitled to payment directly or indirectly from Trust assets.

Section 10.2. - Use of Trust Assets. 
    No part of the net earnings of the Trust may inure to the benefit of any Participant, Retiree or Qualified Beneficiary other than by benefit payments or for services provided to the Trustees in their administration of the Trust.

ARTICLE XI. - AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 

Section 11.1. - Amendment. 
    The City Council may amend this ordinance from time to time in any manner it deems necessary or advisable, by a two-thirds vote of City Council.

The Trust shall continue during such period of time as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of any Plan, Collective Bargaining Agreement or Personnel Policy requiring payment to the Trust and the fact that such Collective Bargaining Agreements, Personnel Policy or employment benefit decisions are not extended, shall not by itself terminate the Trust, which shall continue for a period of time sufficient to wind up the affairs of the Trust.

(c)  If the Trust shall terminate, the Trustees shall notify any Insurance Carrier or Carriers then providing insurance to Retirees and Qualified Beneficiaries in the Trust as soon as administratively feasible.

Section 12.7. - Limitation of Rights.

Section 2.03 Interpretation of Map
Where uncertainty exists regarding zoning boundary interpretation of the Official Zoning
Map, the following guidelines shall apply:
(a) Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets,
highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow the center lines.
(b) Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed
as following the lot lines.
(c) Boundaries indicated as approximately following City limits shall be construed as
following the City limits.
(d) Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway
between the main tracks.
(e) Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subsections
(a) through (d) above shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on
the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale of the map.
(f) Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground differ with those shown
on the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not covered by subsections
(a) through (e) above, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall interpret the district
boundaries.
(g) Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in a single ownership at the
time of passage of this Ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may permit the
extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot not to exceed fifty (50) feet
beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot.
Section 2.04 Vacated ROW
Whenever any street or other public way within the City is vacated, such street, alley
or other public way or portion thereof shall automatically be zoned consistent with the
zoning of the adjacent property or properties, measured from the centerline.
Section 2.05 Annexed Territory
Hereafter, any territory annexed to the City shall be considered to be R-1A Single-Family
Residential until otherwise classified.
Section 2.06 Map Amendment
The City may, from time to time, amend the zoning district boundaries shown on the

Section 3.01 Statement of Purpose
The RE - Rural Estate, R-1A - Single-Family Residential, R-1B - Single-Family Residential,
and RCO - Rural Character Overlay Districts are established as districts in which the
principal use of land is for single-family dwellings. In promoting the general purpose of
this Ordinance, the specific intent of this Article is to
(a) Encourage the continued use of the land for single-family dwellings.
(b) Prohibit incompatible non-residential uses of the land, and to prohibit any other use
that would substantially interfere with development or continuation of single-family
dwellings.
(c) Discourage any land use that would generate traffic on minor or local streets other
than normal traffic to serve the residences on those streets.
(d) Discourage any use which, because of its character or size, would create
requirements and costs for public services, such as fire and police protection, water
supply, and sewer service substantially in excess of the requirements and costs if the
district were developed solely for single-family dwellings.
(e) Maintain a balance between a quiet, rural character of the RCO - Rural Character
Overlay District and the suburban subdivision development in order to meet the
transitional needs of this area.
Section 3.02 Schedule of Uses
No building or land shall be used and no building shall be erected except for one (1)
or more of the following specified uses, unless otherwise provided for in this Ordinance.

prior to being rezoned to RCO District shall be required to comply with the
setback requirements of the underlying zoning district, including additions or
renovations thereto.
c. Creation of New Lots. Any new lot created in the RCO District or any division
to an existing lot shall be required to comply with the lot area and width
requirements of the RCO District.
d. New Buildings. Any new buildings constructed in the RCO shall be required to
comply with the lot area and width requirements of the RCO District.
Section 3.08 Open Space Preservation (Cluster) Development
(a) Intent. This section permits, by special land use approval, residential development
which, through innovative design, will encourage creative development benefiting
the total community by preserving desirable open space in the form of woodlands,
wetlands and other natural assets, or providing usable open space as an integral
part of the residential living environment. This development option is also intended
to be applied to infill parcels or sites exhibiting unusual characteristics or land use
relationships. These provisions are not intended to result in an increase in density, but
rather to allow for a more creative distribution of the permitted number of dwelling
units on designated portions of the site.
(b) Qualification of Parcel. At least one (1) of the following qualifications must be
demonstrated to approve an open space preservation (cluster) development:
(1) The parcel contains natural assets, supported by documented evidence, that will
be preserved as an integral part of the design. These assets may include natural
3-12 City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011
3
Single-Family Residential Districts
stands of large trees, land which serves as a natural habitat for wildlife, wetlands,
steep topography, bodies of water (i.e. streams, rivers), or other natural features
that should be preserved.
(2) The parcel contains floodplain or wetlands that would be preserved as
undeveloped common open space. A floodplain and wetlands map, certifiable
by the appropriate Federal, State or County agency, indicating the extent of the
wetlands and floodplain area, shall be submitted as evidence.
(3) At least twenty percent (20%) of the site will be set aside as open space for
conservation or active recreational purposes.
(4) Unusual physical characteristics, such as size or shape of the parcel, are present
that reasonably prevent using conventional development.
(5) Conventional development would result in a substantial number of the lots
abutting a major or minor arterial and be subjected to disturbance by vehicular
traffic, noise, and lights.
(6) The adjoining or adjacent land uses warrant a creative development alternative
to facilitate a suitable transition between uses.
(c) Density. The number of dwelling units allowable within an open space preservation
development shall be determined through preparation of a parallel plan. The
parallel plan shall show how the site would be developed with a conventional
subdivision based upon the existing zoning district. The parallel plan is intended only
to illustrate the allowable density for a site based upon the existing zoning district
and is not an approved development plan.
(1) The applicant shall present to the Planning Commission for review, a parallel
plan for the project that is consistent with State, County, and City requirements
and design criteria for a tentative preliminary plat. The parallel plan shall include
sufficient right-of-way for roadways, common park area, and contain sufficient
area for storm water detention.
(2) The parallel plan shall provide lots meeting all dimensional standards of the
zoning district. Lots may include wetlands or other un-buildable land provided
that a buildable area for each lot is available.
(3) Once the allowed density is determined, then the same number of units shall be
used for the open space preservation development.
(d) Dwelling Unit Type. Detached and attached single-family units are permitted. The
maximum number of attached units permitted in a single building is six (6).
(e) Placement and Building Requirements for Attached Units. All attached units shall
observe the following requirements:
(1) Buildings shall be set back at least twenty-five (25) feet from any off-street
parking areas. All principal buildings shall have a front yard setback as required
by the district in which the site is located. Where there is no public right-of-way
or access easement, the required front yard setback shall be measured from a
parallel line thirty feet (30) from the centerline of the road.
(2) A principal building shall be set back at least thirty-five (35) feet from any
abutting property lines. Accessory buildings, common parking areas, and
driveways shall not be placed closer than ten (10) feet to any adjoining property
line.
(3) A setback of at least fifteen (15) feet shall be provided between the sides of
City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance 3-13
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011
3
Single-Family Residential Districts
buildings. There shall be at least forty (40) feet between the fronts or backs of
residential buildings.
(4) The minimum required floor area shall be as required by the applicable district
within which the parcel is located.
(5) No dwelling unit shall exceed a height of twenty-five (25) feet.
(6) Variety in the design of individual groups of units shall be provided through the
use of design details to avoid a continuous or repetitious appearance.
(7) Greater flexibility in site problem areas is available by grouping dwelling units.
However, it is also necessary to provide visual and functional open space
between dwelling units. It is, therefore, required that each dwelling unit shall:
a. Have no more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the length of any exterior
wall of living unit shared with any portion of an adjacent dwelling unit.
b. Not have common walls on more than two (2) exterior walls of any one (1)
dwelling unit.
c. Provide at least a six (6) foot variation in building setback between two (2)
adjoining dwellings along any common building facade. This variation may
be provided by varying the setbacks of dwellings and garages or other similar
means, provided that the six (6) foot variations are maintained.
d. Provide each group of dwellings with the same architectural appearance
through the utilization of the similar style, roof lines, and brick facing material
and trim. The Planning Commission may deviate from these building design
requirements for attached buildings provided the proposed design meets
the intent of providing individuality, and visual and functional open space for
each unit.
(f) Placement Standards for Detached Units
(1) To achieve the minimum open space requirement, lot areas and widths may
be reduced below the district requirements; provided that an area equal to or
greater than the total net area of lot reduction for the development shall be set
aside as common open space.
(2) The setback requirements of the district may be reduced by up to twenty-five
percent (25%). The setbacks may be further reduced by the City Council, after
a Planning Commission recommendation, with a specific finding that it will
result in enhanced buffering from adjacent land uses or public rights-of-way, or
preservation of additional natural features.
(3) The maximum building height shall meet the requirements of the district.
(4) The minimum dwelling unit floor area shall meet the requirements of the district.
(g) Open Space
(1) A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the site shall be set aside as common
open space for conservation or recreational purposes. Building sites, parking
and roads shall not cover more than eighty percent (80%) of the entire parcel.
At least one-half (½) of the required open space shall be usable for active
recreation.
(2) The open space preservation development shall meet the design standards
required by the City Subdivision Control Ordinance.

(3) The applicant shall make provision in the Master Deed, satisfactory to the City,
to assure that designated open space will be irrevocably dedicated for that
purpose and prohibiting its use for future development. The City may require
that conveyances or other documents be placed in escrow to accomplish this
purpose. A performance guarantee, as prescribed in Section 21.10, may be
required.
(h) General Development Requirements
(1) At least two (2) deciduous or evergreen trees per dwelling unit that meet the
size requirements of Section 13.02 shall be planted throughout the development
portion of the site.
(2) A type A greenbelt that meets the standards in Section 13.02 with a depth
of at least thirty five (35) feet shall be provided, in addition to any required rear
yard setback, along any part of the property that abuts an arterial road. The
greenbelt shall be landscaped with an undulating landscaped berm with grass
and slopes gentle enough to avoid erosion. Berm locations shall be designed so
that the view of oncoming traffic is not obscured at access points. The Planning
Commission may allow preservation of a wooded area of equivalent size as an
alternative to a new landscape feature.
(3) Sidewalks are required along all streets in accordance with the Citys Subdivision
Control Ordinance and Sidewalk Ordinance. A pedestrian circulation plan
based on the requirements of Section 13.04 shall be submitted and approved by
the City for the lands included in the open space.
(i) Review Procedures. Applications for residential open space preservation
developments shall observe the following processing requirements.
(1) Special Land Use and Preliminary Plan Review:
a. In submitting a Special Land Use application for qualification of a parcel for
open space preservation development to the Planning Commission, the
petitioner shall include documentation substantiating one (1) or more of

Multiple Family Residential Districts
Section 4.01 Statement of Purpose
(a) R2 Townhouse Residential District. This district is established to provide a living
environment suitable for individuals, couples, and families who have few or no
children. It is intended to encourage development which, though multiple-family
in nature, is closer in character or scale to single-family development, with duplexes
and attached townhouses, each having individual entrances, yards, driveways, and
garages. To achieve this purpose, uses are primarily limited to low density dwelling
units, plus certain residentially related uses designated to provide an acceptable
neighborhood environment.
(b) RM Low-Rise Multiple-Family Residential District. This district is intended to provide
a proper environment for families that are smaller in size than those living in singlefamily
dwellings, who wish to live in low-rise multiple-family dwellings. The RM District
is designed to furnish sites for various types of attached single-family and multiplefamily
dwelling structures and may serve as a transition between non-residential
districts and lower density single-family residential districts. Development in this
district, though multiple in nature, is complementary in character to single-family
development through the utilization of lower densities, some attached garages, and
a limited number of dwelling units per structure.
(c) HRM Mid- and High-Rise Multiple-Family Residential District. The HRM Mid- and
High-Rise Multiple-Family Residential District is intended to serve the residential
needs of families and single persons desiring greater density, apartment type
accommodation with central services. The site shall be developed so as to service
only the residents of the multiple-family development, and any accessory buildings,
uses, or services shall be primarily for the use of residents. Uses considered herein
as accessory uses include: parking structures, swimming pools, recreation areas,
pavilions, cabanas, and other similar uses.
Section 4.02 Schedule of Uses
No building or land shall be used and no building shall be erected except for one (1)
or more of the following specified uses, unless otherwise provided for in this Ordinance.
Land and/or buildings in the districts indicated at the top of Table 4.02 may be used for
the purposes denoted by the following abbreviations:

Central Business District
Section 6.01 Statement of Purpose
(a) The intent of the Central Business District (CBD) is to retain and create a vibrant,
attractive and cohesive center for the Romulus community with a variety of quality
places to work, live, shop, learn, recreate and be entertained. This district is intended
to recognize and support the Romulus Central Business District (also referred to as
Downtown) as both a prime retail center and the centerpiece in the City.
(b) These regulations are intended to assist with the implementation of goals and
objectives contained in the Romulus Master Plan, the DDA Plan, the DDA Façade
and Site Improvement Guidelines, and any other supporting documents that relate
to the development of the Downtown. Among the goals of these plans are to
promote development of a compact, walkable, mixed-use district, consisting of a
variety of retail, entertainment, office, service, residential, cultural, recreation and
municipal uses. To provide for the desired traditional downtown environment this
district accommodates a wide variety of compatible uses, permits a mixture of
uses within the same building, and describes specific design standards for buildings
and sites. Design standards include site layout, setback continuity, building design,
pedestrian amenities, parking arrangement, vehicular circulation and coordination
of site features between adjoining properties.
(c) The Central Business District is divided into three different sub-categories as
established in the Central City sub-area plan of the City Master Plan to reflect
elements common to all and the unique conditions in each. Although some
regulations apply to all three districts, there are also specific regulations tailored to
each sub-category such as permitted uses and design requirements.
(1) CBD-1: Transition District. The Transition District is intended to provide a land
use transition along Goddard Road between the activity areas of the Central
Business District by promoting lower intensity uses such as residential, office, and
convenience services. A mixture of
land uses are encouraged within
the same buildings, same sites,
and adjoining sites that maintain
a residential presence but also
offer support services and business
opportunities that complement the
Downtown or Five Points Districts.
Design regulations applicable to the
Transition District such as screening,
landscaping, parking, and lighting
ensure development is compatible
with adjoining residential
neighborhoods.
(2) CBD-2: Downtown District. The Downtown District is intended to create
a pedestrian oriented destination that offers entertainment, shopping,
employment, housing, and recreation opportunities for those who live in, work in,
or visit Romulus. Allowable land uses encourage activity in the Downtown during
day and evening hours. Uses can be mixed within the same building, the same
site, and may adjoin one another. The building, site, and streetscape design
requirements herein promote a comfortable environment, pedestrian-oriented,
that is visually pleasing, with convenient parking to promote repeat and long

duration visits.
(3) CBD-3: Five Points District. The Five Points District is intended to provide a
commercial area and destination that offers convenient services, offices,
and businesses for nearby residential neighborhoods and for new residential
uses located within the district. Development in this district shall promote a
comfortable pedestrian-oriented environment that is visually pleasing and
compatible with the Downtown District but does not generally compete with
the entertainment aspect of the Downtown. Uses can be mixed within the same
building, the same site, and may adjoin one another. Convenient parking and
circulation are also important aspects of development in the district.
Section 6.02. Schedule of Uses

Business Districts
Section 7.01 Statement of Purpose
(a) O-1, Office District. The O-1, Office District is intended to permit lower intensity office
and personal service uses in well-landscaped settings, often adjacent to or near
residential areas.
(b) C-1, Local Business District. The C-1, Local Business District is intended to permit retail
business and service uses which are needed to meet the convenience shopping
and service needs of nearby residential areas. In order to promote sustainable
business districts and compatiability with nearby uses, uses are prohibited which
would create hazards, offensive and loud noises, vibration, smoke, glare, heavy
truck traffic, or late hours of operation. The intent of this district is also to concentre
local business areas at strategic locations to the mutual advantage of both the
consumers and merchants and to avoid unattractive marginal strip business
development along arterial roadways.
(c) C-2, General Business District. The C-2, General Business District is intended to
permit a wider range of business and entertainment activities than permitted in
the local business district. Commercial establishments in the BC-2 District cater to
the convenience and comparison shopping needs of nearby residential areas and
customers further away for types of businesses. These uses would generate larger
volumes of vehicular traffic, would need more off-street parking and loading and
would require more planning to integrate such districts with adjacent residential
areas. Special attention is focused on site layout, building design, vehicular and
pedestrian circulation and coordination of site features between adjoining sites.
(d) C-3, Highway Service District. The C-3, Highway Service District is intended to permit
more intensive business and entertainment activities than that permitted in the Local
and General Business Districts. The uses in the C-3 District are more automotive
oriented and serve a market that includes city residents, residents from surrounding
communities, and pass by traffic. The permitted uses are directed to arterial
streets and are generally not appropriate immediately adjacent to residential
zoning districts. Standards for site layout, building design, vehicular circulation
and buffering from other nearby uses are created to ensure well-designed vibrant
districts.
(e) RC, Regional Center District. The RC, Regional Center District is intended to promote
large scale commercial and office developments which can take advantage of the
potential trade of passengers, visitors and employees at the Metro Airport. It is also
recognized that this international air facility will encourage adjacent land uses for
conventions, trade centers, educational and training facilities, hotels, restaurants,
car rental and parking facilities. and complementary multi-story apartments and
condominiums. This district is intended to encourage innovation and variety in type,
design and arrangement of uses that create a vibrant and unified Regional Center.
Section 7.02 Schedule of Uses
No building or land shall be used and no building shall be erected except for one (1)
or more of the following specified uses, unless otherwise provided for in this Ordinance.

Industrial District
Section 8.01 Statement of Purpose
(a) O-R, Office Research District. The O-R, Office Research District is designed to
primarily accommodate office, scientific, business, technological research
operations, related testing operations, and other related uses where office,
technology and scientific research activities are mutually dependent or
developmental in nature; in a spacious, open type environment devoid of nuisance
factors commonly present in nonresidential districts; and to permit uses which
support and complement permitted uses in this district, or which are vital to the
principal uses and required to be located close to them; and the result shall be
development planned in a coordinated manner with well designed buildings and
sites. It is further the intent of this district to contain all activities within an enclosed
building with no outdoor storage and only extremely limited outdoor activities or
accessory buildings allowed.
(b) M-1, Light Industrial District. The M-1 District permits light industries, such as light
manufacturing or processing of previously refined materials and other industrial
uses that have no adverse impact upon neighboring districts along with certain
commercial uses that provide supportive services to persons working within or visiting
the district. Uses in this district have less impact on surrounding uses and generate
less truck traffic than the industrial districts listed below. Therefore, limitations
regarding the degree of noise, smoke, glare, odor, and vibration are placed upon
such uses. It is intended that this district act as a transition between heavier industrial
uses and residential or commercial areas. The form of development is intended
to be industrial parks with shared and coordinated design such as storm water
management, circulation, and screening.
(c) M-2, General Industrial District. The M-2 District is intended to permit heavier
industrial uses than permitted in the above districts that are primarily of a
manufacturing, assembling, and fabricating character, which are large-scale or
specialized industrial operations more likely to produce external physical effects. The
M-2 District is further designed to provide areas within the City where heavy industrial
uses can most efficiently utilize major roadways, utilities and other infrastructure.
(d) M-T, Industrial Transportation District. The M-T District permits industries which are of
a heavy manufacturing character and truck distribution facilities. The intent is to
permit, with certain conditions, larger-scale trucking operations involving interstate
and intrastate motor carriers in strategic locations close to complementary uses
and other potentially high volume truck traffic areas with direct access to Interstate
expressways. These uses often involve merchandise transported to a distribution
facility where it is redistributed to other trucks for immediate shipment elsewhere. It
is also the intent to permit, with certain conditions, areas for the transfer, treatment,
storage, disposal or recycling of trash, refuse and other liquid or solid wastes.

(3) Objectionable sounds, of an intermittent nature or characterized by high
frequencies, even if falling below the specified decibel levels shall be controlled
so as not to become a nuisance to adjacent uses.
(b) Vibration. No activity or operation of machines shall cause or create a steady
state vibration or an impact vibration, at any point on any property line, with a
displacement in excess of the permitted vibration displacement for the frequencies
as set forth below. Steady state vibrations shall be defined as earthborne oscillations
that are continuous discrete pulses which occur more frequently than one hundred
(100) times per minute. Impact vibrations shall be defined as earthborne oscillations
occurring in discrete pulses at less than one hundred (100) pulses per minute.

using equipment and personnel normally available to the City or obtainable
without extraordinary expense, such determinations shall be so made before
notice of violation is issued.
(3) Where determination of violation of performance standards will likely entail
the use of highly skilled personnel and expensive or unusual instrumentation
not ordinarily available to the City and when, in the considered judgment of
the Building Department a violation exists, costs of the determinations will be
charged against those responsible in addition to such other penalties as may be
appropriate.

upon determination by the Planning Director/Director of Building and Safety that
the use is clearly similar in nature and compatible with the uses that are listed in a
particular district. In making this determination, the Planning Director/Director of
Building and Safety shall consider the following:
(1) In making the determination of compatibility, the Planning Director/Director of
Building and Safety shall consider specific characteristics of the use in question
and compare these characteristics to those of the uses that are listed in the

Section 12.14 Essential Services
(a) Essential services shall be permitted as authorized under any franchise in effect
within the City, subject to regulation as provided in any law of the State of Michigan
or in any ordinance of the City. It is the intent of this Section to ensure conformity
of all structures and uses to the requirements of this Ordinance wherever such
conformity shall be practicable and not in conflict with the specific requirements of
such franchise, state legislation or City ordinance. In the absence of such conflict,
this Ordinance shall prevail. This Ordinance will treat essential public services under a
hierarchy of facilities, as they are allowed in the various zoning districts, as follows:
(1) Utility distribution facilities such as water mains, sewer mains, electrical, gas,
distribution lines, and associated structures that are designed to serve the
immediate vicinity shall be permitted in all districts.

industrial districts.
Section 12.15 Wireless Communication Facilities and Services
(a) Purpose and Intent. The regulations of this Section are intended to conform with
federal laws and administrative rules governing facilities needed to operate wireless
communication systems and to set forth procedures and standards for review and
approval for the location of such facilities within the City of Romulus. It is the Citys
intent to reasonably regulate the location and design of such facilities to retain the
integrity of neighborhoods and the character, property values, and aesthetic quality
of the City and to also ensure compliance with FAA height restrictions in the vicinity
of the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport. Given the increase
in the number of wireless communication facilities requested as a result of the new
technology and the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is the policy of the
City that all users should co-locate on attached wireless communication facilities
and wireless communication support structures. Collocation is proposed in order to
assure the most economic use of land and to prevent the proliferation of duplicative
services. In recognition of the Citys concern that technological advances may
render certain wireless communication facilities obsolete or unnecessary in the
future, requirements are set forth for the removal of unused or unnecessary facilities
in a timely manner and provide security for removal.
(b) Definitions: The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation of this Section:
(1) Wireless Communication Facilities (WCF). All structures and accessory
facilities relating to the use of the radio frequency spectrum for the purpose of
transmitting or receiving radio signals. This may include, but shall not be limited
to, radio antenna, television broadcasting antenna, telephone devices, personal
communication transmission equipment and exchanges, microwave relay,
telephone transmission equipment buildings, and commercial mobile radio
service facilities. This definition does not include satellite dish, television and radio
reception antenna for an individual lot as otherwise regulated in the applicable
zoning district.
(2) Attached Wireless Communication Facilities. Wireless communication facilities
affixed to existing structures, including but not limited to existing buildings, towers,
water tanks, or utility poles.
(3) Wireless Communication Support Structures (WCSS). Structures erected or
modified to support wireless communication antennas. Support structures within
this definition include, but shall not be limited to, monopoles, lattice towers, and
guyed towers, or other structures that are erected for the purpose of supporting
WCFs.
(4) Collocation. Location by two (2) or more wireless communication providers of
wireless communication facilities on a common structure, tower, or building,
to reduce the overall number of structures required to support wireless
communication antennas within the City.
(c) Use Requirements. Wireless communication facilities may be located within the City
12-10 City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011 General Provisions
12
in accordance with Table 12.15 (c).
(d) Application Requirements
(1) An application for a wireless communication facility, including new towers and
collocation shall be required to include a site plan that meets the requirements
of Article 17. An application for a new wireless communication support structure
(i.e. a new tower) shall include the following, in addition to other submittal
requirements for site plan, as required in Article 17:
a. Signed certification by a professional engineer licensed by the State of
Michigan with regard to the manner in which the proposed structure will fall
in the event of damage, accident or injury (i.e. fall zone), and that the
setback area provided shall accommodate the structure should it fall or
break and provide a reasonable buffer in the event the structure fails.

12
(e) Design Standards Applicable to All Facilities. In addition to the Criteria of Site Plan
Review listed in Article 17 and Special Land Use Review listed in Article 18, all wireless
communication facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with
the following standards:
(1) Facilities shall be located and designed to be harmonious with the surrounding
areas. The Planning Commission may require unique design of the structure to
either diminish the visual impact or to create an architectural feature that will
contribute to or enhance community character.
(2) All new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be designed and
constructed to accommodate collocation, with a written agreement in a format
approved by the City Attorney.
(3) Landscaping shall be provided to screen the structure base, accessory buildings
and enclosure from adjacent uses and public rights-of-way. The City may
approve a six (6) to eight (8) foot tall brick wall around the site for screening
purposes in any location where landscaping may not survive.
(4) Elevations of the accessory buildings shall be provided. All accessory buildings
shall be constructed of brick, provided the City may waive this requirement for
a building that is not visible from a public right-of-way or any adjacent nonindustrial
lot.
(5) Fencing, six (6) to eight (8) feet in height, shall be provided for protection of
the support structure and security from children and other persons who may
otherwise access facilities. Fencing shall be black vinyl coated or decorative
wrought iron.
(6) Any nonconforming situations on the site, such as, but not limited to, outdoor
storage, signs, inadequate landscaping, unpaved parking, lack of a sidewalk,
improper lighting, or similar conditions shall be brought into conformance to the
maximum extent possible prior to the erection of the wireless communication
facility in accordance with Section 20.09.
(7) The applicant shall demonstrate that the requested height of the new or
modified support structure and antenna shall be the minimum height necessary
for reasonable communication by the applicant, including additional height to
accommodate future collocation where appropriate. All wireless facilities shall
be within the maximum height set by the FAA.
(8) Minimum required setbacks for a new facility or support structure:
a. From the lot line of any residential lot - the height of the structure, provided
the engineering information required in (d)(1) is provided. The person or
body with authority to approve the facility may decrease this setback to
that provided in c. below upon a finding that no residential use exists or is
expected on the adjacent site.
b. From any existing or proposed rights-of-way or other publicly traveled roads or
non-motorized improved pathways - the height of the structure.
c. From the lot line of any adjacent nonresidential lot - one half the height of
the structure, provided the engineering information required in (d)(1) above
demonstrates such setback is adequate.
(9) Accessory buildings shall be a maximum of fourteen (14) feet high and shall
be set back in accordance with the requirements for principal buildings in that

zoning district.
(10) There shall be unobstructed access to the support structure, for operation,
maintenance, repair, and inspection purposes, which may be provided by
an easement. This access drive shall be paved and have a minimum width of
twenty six (26) feet.
(11) Where an attached wireless communication facility is proposed on the roof
of a building, if the equipment enclosure is proposed as a roof appliance or
penthouse on the building, it shall be designed, constructed, and maintained
to be architecturally compatible with the principal building. The equipment
enclosure may be located within the principal building or may be an accessory
building. If proposed as an accessory building, it shall conform with all district
requirements for principal buildings, including yard setbacks.
(12) The support system shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable
building codes and shall include the submission of a soils report from a
geotechnical engineer, licensed in the State of Michigan. This soils report shall
include soil borings and statements confirming the suitability of soil conditions for
the proposed use.
(13) The requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal
Communication Commission, and Michigan Aeronautics Commission shall be

reasonably prudent standard.
(f) Removal. As a condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility,
adequate provision shall be made for removal of all or part of the facility by users
and owners upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events:
(1) When the facility has not been used for one hundred eighty (180) days or more.
For purposes of this Section, the removal of antennas or other equipment from
the facility, or the cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of radio
signals) shall be considered as the beginning of a period of non-use.
(2) Six (6) months after new technology is available at a reasonable cost,
as determined by the City Council, which permits the operation of the
communication system without the requirement of the support structure.
(3) The situations in which removal of a facility is required, as set forth in paragraph
(1) above, may be applied and limited to portions of a facility.
(4) Upon the occurrence of one or more of the events requiring removal, specified
in paragraph (1) above, the property owner or persons who had used the facility
shall immediately apply or secure the application for any required demolition or
removal permits, and immediately proceed with and complete the demolition/
removal, restoring the premises to an acceptable condition as reasonably
determined by the Building and Safety Director.
(5) If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has not been lawfully
completed within sixty (60) days of the applicable deadline, and after at least
thirty (30) days written notice, the City may remove or secure the removal of
12-14 City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011 General Provisions
12
the facility or required portions thereof, with its actual cost and reasonable
administrative charge to be drawn or collected and/or enforced from or under
the security posted at the time application was made for establishing the facility.
(g) Collocation
(1) Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the City of Romulus to minimize the overall
number of newly established locations for wireless communication support
structures within the City and to encourage the use of existing structures for
attached wireless communication facilities. If a provider fails or refuses to
permit collocation on a facility owned or controlled by it, where collocation is
feasible, the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be
required, in contradiction with City policy. Collocation shall be required unless
an applicant demonstrates that collocation is not feasible.
(2) Feasibility of Collocation. Collocation shall be deemed feasible for the purpose
of this Section where all of the following are met:
a. The wireless communication provider or property owner where collocation
is proposed will accept market rent or other market compensation for
collocation and the wireless communication provider seeking the facility will
pay such rates.
b. The site on which collocation is being considered, taking into consideration
reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is able to provide
structural support.
c. The collocation being considered is technically reasonable, e.g. the
collocation will not result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate
physical and other adjustments in relation to the structure, antennas and the
like.
(h) Nonconforming Facilities and Penalties for Not Permitting Collocation. If a party
who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication support structure shall
fail or refuse to alter a structure to accommodate a proposed and otherwise
feasible collocation, such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to
be a nonconforming structure and use, and shall not be altered, expanded, or
extended in any respect. In addition, if a party refuses to allow collocation in
accordance with the intent of this Section, and this action results in construction
of a new tower, the City may refuse to approve a new wireless communication
support structure from that party for a period of up to five (5) years. Such a party
may seek and obtain a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals if and to the
limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which,
in this context, shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five (5)-year
prohibition would unreasonably burden some providers of functionally equivalent
wireless communication services, or that such enforcement would have the effect
of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services.
(i) Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may consider a variance from the
standards of this Section, based upon a finding that one or more of the following
factors exist, as appropriate for the type of variance requested:
(1) For location, the applicant has demonstrated that a location within a district or
location in accordance with the standards of this Section cannot reasonably
meet the coverage or capacity needs of the applicant.
(2) For no collocation the applicant has demonstrated that a feasible collocation
City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance 12-15
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011
General Provisions
12
is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs because
existing structures cannot support the facility, that collocation would result in
unreasonable interference, or that reasonable financial terms are not available
for collocation.
(3) For setback, the applicant has provided engineering information that
documents that the tower is self collapsing and that the setback area
provided shall accommodate the structure should it fall or break and provide a
reasonable buffer in the event the structure fails.
(4) For all, the applicant has proposed means to mitigate any negative impacts
through provision for future collocation, if found to be appropriate by the City,
and special design of the facility and site.
(5) For all, the wireless communication and accessory facilities shall be designed to
be compatible with the existing character of the proposed site, neighborhood,
and general area and may include such features as a steeple, bell tower, or
similar form.
Section 12.16 Excavations or Holes
(a) The construction, maintenance, or existence within the City of any unprotected,
unbarricaded, open or dangerous excavations, holes, pits, or wells which constitute
or are reasonably likely to constitute a danger or menace to the public health,
safety, or welfare, are hereby prohibited.
(b) Permits may be obtained for an excavation, where the excavation will be properly
protected and warning signs posted in a manner approved by the Building and
Safety Director. The Building and Safety Director may require security fencing
around excavations that are deep or have steep side slopes.

Section 14.05 Long-term Parking Facilities, Car Rental, and Leasing Facilities
(a) Intent. Long-term surface parking facilities, car rental, and car leasing facilities
do not represent the most efficient use of land within the City. The proliferation of
large paved areas create a negative image and large surface parking lots create
increased environmental impacts, such as greater stormwater runoff. Utilizing large
land areas in commercial and industrial districts for parking is not consistent with the
objective of encouraging other types of commercial uses, such as hotels, offices,
and high quality manufacturing facilities that provide a greater contribution to the
Citys economy and character. It is the intent of these regulations to:
(1) Minimize the amount of valuable commercial and industrial land that is
consumed by long-term parking facilities and ensure there is adequate land
available for economic growth of the City for industry and commercial services
needed by residents.
(2) Ensure long-term parking facilities are appropriately located to support other
airport-related facilities.
(3) Minimize traffic impacts from long-term parking facilities.

(4) Minimize the amount of woodlands that need to be clear for parking facilities.
(5) Minimize the impact to the microclimate and the heat island effect of large
parking facilities.
(6) Minimize the amount of stormwater runoff generated from a parking facility.
(b) Long-term Parking Facilities. Long-term parking facilities must meet the following
special land use requirements:
(1) This section shall apply to long-term parking facilities used by airport travelers
or other types of long-term vehicle parking facilities; hotels/motels that provide
long-term park-and-fly space; and, parking lots used for storage of new vehicles
not located on the same lot as a dealership or automobile manufacturing
facility. Long-term parking facilities are only permitted in the RC, M-T, and AP
Districts as a special land use. Long term parking facilities must also obtain
a Class I Parking License from the City Council in accordance with the Citys
Parking Ordinance following approval of the special land use.
(2) Any application for a new long-term parking facility or expansion to an existing
facility shall be accompanied by a market study with supporting documentation
verifying the need for long term parking. The study will inventory the supply of
existing parking, both on and off the airport, and demands created by increased
usage. The City Council shall not approve an application for a long-term parking
facility unless the study demonstrates that there is an undersupply of long-term
parking.
(3) Long-term parking facilities must be entirely contained within a parking structure
meeting the requirements of Section 14.02 (d). Entrance driveways, collection
booths, and other facilities ancillary to the parking facility may be permitted
outside of the structure, but parking spaces outside of the structure are not
permitted. In order to minimize the amount of land area consumed by a longterm
parking facility, no more than twenty five percent (25%) of the parking may
be located on the ground level of the parking structure.
(4) Long-term parking facilities shall have access to an arterial roadway that has a
right-of-way width of at least one hundred twenty (120) feet extending from the
entrance of the site to the nearest freeway interchange.
(5) All structures and facilities for the long-term parking facility shall be located at
least four hundred (400) feet from any road right-of-way.
(6) The frontage along the arterial roadway shall be capable of development
for uses permitted in the district in which the proposed facility is located. The
frontage must be developed in conjunction with the long term parking facility.
The development may be completed in phases, provided only fifty percent
(50%) of the long term parking can be developed prior to the 400-foot setback
area in front of the parking being developed. The long term parking facility shall
be integrated with the development of the frontage with integrated access and
circulation.
(7) The access drive to the site shall be at least three (3) traffic lanes wide with a
minimum of two (2) incoming lanes.
(8) A traffic impact study meeting the requirements of Section 23.02(a)(3) shall be
submitted with any application for a new or expanded long-term parking facility.
(9) The long-term parking facilities shall be designed and located to be compatible
14-16 City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011 Parking
14
with proposed land uses in the district, not adversely affect adjacent land uses,
and be located and consistent with the Master Plan.
(10) The entrance to the parking area shall be landscaped along both sides of the
entrance road. A greenbelt C meeting the requirements of Section 13.02 shall be
provided around the entire perimeter of the parking area.
(11) Overnight or long-term parking is prohibited for commercial vehicles such as
delivery vans or trucks, truck tractors, over-the-road hauling trucks, semi-trucks,
trailers or construction equipment, or similar vehicles, and recreational vehicles
such as motor homes, travel trailers and similar vehicles.
(12) Long-term parking facilities may be prohibited at highly visible locations that
may have a negative influence on the character and appearance of the
surrounding area. Added screening requirements may be imposed to reduce
the visibility of parking facilities.
(13) Existing long-term parking facilities may be permitted to increase the number
of parking spaces utilized for long term parking, provided newly created parking
spaces are located in a parking structure within an area that is currently paved
for long term parking. Existing surface parking may remain, provided there is no
expansion in the land area covered by parking and all new spaces are being
added in a structure. The site shall be upgraded to comply with the landscaping
and driveway design requirements of this Ordinance.
(14) A long term parking facility may not be expanded to cover a larger land area
unless all of the requirements of this section are met.
(c) Car Rental Establishments. Car rental establishments must meet the following
requirements:
(1) A greenbelt C landscaping along the site frontage and a landscape buffer zone
shall be provided along all other lot lines, as required by Section 13.02.
(2) Customer parking may be provided in the required front yard as long as the area
is landscaped as required by Section 13.02.
Section 14.06 Driveway Access Management
(a) Purpose and Applicability
The purpose of the driveway standards below is to provide landowners with
reasonable access but to regulate that access to reduce conflicts between vehicles
turning into or from access points with through traffic, pedestrians and bicyclists,
thereby reducing the potential for congestion and crashes. The spacing standards
are based on research and publications by numerous national and international
transportation organizations and the Michigan Department of Transportation. These
standards apply to all roads in the City, including those under the jurisdiction of the
Wayne County Department of Public Services and the Michigan Department of
Transportation wherever the City has a more restrictive standard. For those streets,
an applicant must also obtain an access permit from the applicable road agency.
(b) Driveway Location in General
(1) The requirements of this Section shall apply to all commercial/industrial
driveways, which will include driveways serving all uses except single-family
homes.
(2) Driveways shall be located to minimize interference with the free movement of
City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance 14-17
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011
Parking

traffic, provide adequate sight distance,
and provide the most favorable driveway
grade.
(3) Driveways, including the radii but not
including right turn lanes, passing lanes
and tapers, shall be located entirely
within the right-of-way frontage, unless
approved by the City and upon written
certification from the adjacent property
owner agreeing to such encroachment.
(4) Required spacing shall be measured as
illustrated in Figure 14.06.
a. Spacing from intersections from the
near edge of the street pavement to
the centerline of the driveway. See A
b. Off-set spacing from the centerline
of a driveway to the centerline of
a driveway on the other side of the
street. See G
c. Spacing between driveways along the same side of the street centerline to
centerline. See E
(c) Number of Commercial Driveways
(1) The number of commercial driveways serving a property shall be the minimum
necessary to provide reasonable access for traffic and emergency vehicles,
while preserving traffic operations and safety along the public roadway.
(2) Access shall be provided for each separately owned parcel. This access may
be from an individual driveway, shared driveway or a service drive. The Planning
Commission may permit additional driveways for property meeting the following
requirements:
a. One (1) additional driveway for properties with a continuous frontage of over
three-hundred (300) feet, and one (1) driveway for each additional threehundred
(300) feet of frontage.
b. A traffic impact study, per the requirements of Section 23.02(3), is provided
that demonstrates to the City Engineer that additional access is justified
without compromising traffic operations along the public street.
c. The Planning Commission may permit two one-way driveways rather than
a single two-way driveway when it is found to be the most reasonable
access for a given site, when other spacing standards of this Article are
met, the design helps reduce potential conflicts with a nearby intersection
or driveways, when the site has at least 125 feet of frontage, and when it is
determined the additional pavement will not create additional conflicts with
pedestrians along the street.
(d) Driveway Spacing from Intersections
(1) Minimum spacing requirements between a proposed commercial/industrial
driveway and an intersection either adjacent or on the opposite side of the
street may be set on a case-by-case basis, but in no instance shall be less

(2) To reduce left-turn conflicts, new commercial/industrial driveways shall be
aligned with those across the roadway where possible. If alignment is not possible
along arterial streets, driveways shall be offset from those on the opposite side of
the roadway as follows:
a. A proposed drive shall be offset a minimum of one-hundred-fifty (150) feet
from a downstream access where left-turn conflicts along the street will not
occur (see F in Figure 14.06).
b. A proposed drive shall have the minimum offset listed in Table 14.06(d) from
an upstream access where left-turn conflicts could occur (see G in Figure
14.06).

(f) Driveway Spacing from Median Openings
For roads that have a center median, to reduce conflicts between traffic entering
and exiting a median crossover and driveways, driveways should not be directly
aligned with crossovers unless it would be signalized or where direct ingress from the
crossover would result in acceptable traffic operation and safety, as determined by
the City Engineer or road agency. Driveways shall be offset from median crossovers
as follows:
(1) A proposed driveway shall be offset a minimum of 150 feet from a downstream
access where turning movements will not interfere with the median crossover
(see H in Figure 14.06).
(2) A proposed driveway shall be offset a minimum of 525 feet from an upstream
access to provide adequate weaving distance to or from the driveway to or
from the median crossover, or as determined by the City Engineer based on
anticipated volumes along the road and volumes in the driveway (see I in
Figure 14.06).
(g) Shared Driveways, Frontage Roads and Service Roads
(1) Where the spacing standards are not met, the Planning Commission may require
a shared commercial driveway or construction of a frontage road or rear service
drive connecting two (2) or more properties. In particular, shared access may

Requirements
14-20 City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011 Parking

be required near existing traffic signals or near locations having potential for
future signalization; along major streets or arterial roadways with high traffic
volumes; and where there is a relatively high number of crashes or limited sight
distance. Provisions for shared access or cross access shall be required between
sites that are in the same or similar zoning district (e.g. between adjacent
commercially zoned properties).
(2) Shared commercial driveways and service roads shall be within an access
easement recorded with the Wayne County Register of Deeds prior to
construction. A draft of the access easement shall be provided to the City for
approval prior to filing.
(3) Shared driveways, frontage roads, and service drives shall be designed in
accordance with the following standards:
a. Location. Service roads shall generally be parallel or perpendicular to the
front property line and may be in front of, adjacent to, or behind, principal
buildings. The Planning Commission shall determine the most appropriate
alignment, taking into account setbacks of existing buildings, topography,
and anticipated traffic flow.
b. Access Easement. The service road shall be within an access easement
permitting traffic circulation between properties. This easement shall be sixty
(60) feet wide, except an access easement parallel to a public street rightof-
way may be forty (40) feet wide, if approved by the Planning Commission.
The required width shall remain free and clear of obstructions, unless
otherwise approved by the Planning Commission.
c. Construction and Materials. Service roads shall have a base, pavement and
curb with gutter in accordance with the public street cross section in the City
of Romulus Engineering Standards Manual. The minimum required width of
the service road shall be twenty-seven (27) feet, measured back to back of
curb.
d. Parking. The service road is not intended as a parking maneuvering aisle. The
Planning Commission may require the posting of no parking signs along
the service road to be posted by the property owner/developer at the
property owners/developers expense. The Planning Commission may permit
temporary parking in the easement area where a continuous service road
is not yet available, provided that the layout provides for the removal of the
parking to allow extension of the service road.
e. Access to Service Road. The Planning Commission shall approve the
location of all accesses to the service road, based on the driveway spacing
standards of this Section. The Commission may allow additional driveways
if recommended by the City Engineer and permitted by Wayne County
Department of Public Services.
f. Temporary Access. The Planning Commission may approve temporary
accesses where a continuous service road is not yet available and a
performance guarantee is provided to assure elimination of temporary
access when the service road is continued. Building permits shall not be
issued until performance guarantee has been deposited with the City.
g. Elevation. The site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the service
road at the property line. The City shall maintain a record of all service road

Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011
Parking
14
elevations so that their grades can be coordinated.
h. Maintenance. Each property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of
the easement and service drive across their frontage.
(h) Commercial Driveway Design
(1) All commercial driveways shall be constructed according to the City of Romulus
Engineering Standards Manual and, where accessing a county road, Wayne
County Department of Public Services.
(2) For high traffic generators, or for commercial driveways along roadways
experiencing or expected to experience congestion, the Planning Commission
may require two (2) egress lanes.
(3) For a boulevard entrance, a fully curbed island, at least one-hundred-eighty
(180) square feet in area, shall separate the ingress and egress lanes. The radii
forming the edges on this island shall be designed to accommodate the largest
vehicle that will normally use the driveway. The Planning Commission may require
landscaping tolerant of roadway conditions on the section outside the public
right-of-way.
(4) Access points for uses with significant truck traffic shall meet the standards of
Section 14.04(a).
(i) Waiver of Access Standards. It is recognized that certain existing site conditions may
prohibit full compliance with the driveway spacing standards of this Section. The
Planning Commission may, after considering the criteria in (j) below, grant a waiver
from the standards of this Section in the following situations:
(1) The request involves a change in use, expansion, alteration or redesign of an
existing development where it can be demonstrated that pre-existing conditions
prohibit adherence to the minimum commercial driveway spacing standards.
(2) The modification will allow an existing driveway to remain that does not meet
the standards of this Section but that has, or is expected to have very low traffic
volumes (less than 50 in- and out-bound trips per day) and is not expected to
significantly impact safe traffic operations.
(3) The use is expected to generate a relatively high number of trips and an
additional driveway will improve overall traffic operations.
(4) Practical difficulties exist on the site that make compliance unreasonable (sight
distance limitations, existing development, topography, unique site configuration
or shape), or existing off-site driveways make it impractical to fully comply with
the standards.
(5) Because of restricted turning movements or the presence of a median that
restricts turning movements, the driveway does not contribute to congestion or
an unsafe situation.
(j) Waiver Criteria
The Planning Commission may waive certain requirements of this Section upon
consideration of the following:
(1) The proposed modification is consistent with the general intent of the standards
of this Section.
14-22 City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011 Parking
14
(2) To the degree practical, the access is designed to maximize spacing from any
adjacent major intersection, is either aligned with or adequately spaced from
access points across the street, and finally, after consideration of the above, is
spaced at least 60 feet from other access points.
(3) For access to an MDOT or County road, the road agency has endorsed the
proposed access design.
(4) Driveway geometrics have been improved to the extent practical to reduce
impacts on traffic flow.
(5) Shared access has been provided, or the applicant has demonstrated it is not
practical.
(6) Such modification is the minimum necessary to provide reasonable access, will
not impair public safety or prevent the logical development or redevelopment of
adjacent sites and is not simply for convenience of the development.

(a) The development of all condominiums shall observe the applicable yard setback
and minimum floor area requirements of the zoning district in which the project is
located. The dwelling unit density of the project shall be no greater and spacing no
less than would be permitted if the parcel were subdivided for that specific zoning
district, pursuant to the Land Division Act.
(b) Condominium setbacks shall be measured on the site plan as described below:
(1) Front Yard Setback. The distance between the public street right-of-way or
private road easement line and the foundation of the unit site. Where there is
no public right-of-way or private road access easement, the front yard setback
required in the district shall be measured from a parallel line that is thirty (30) feet
from the centerline of the road.
(2) Side Yard Setback. The distance between the side of a condominium building
unit and the side lot line. Where no unit (lot) lines are provided, the distance

Site Plan Review Requirements & Procedures
Section 17.01 Statement of Purpose
(a) Site plan review is required to provide the Planning Commission with the opportunity
to review the proposed use of a site in relation to surrounding uses, planned
future development, accessibility, pedestrian and vehicular circulation, roadway
traffic, spatial relationships, off-street parking, public utilities, general drainage,
environmental characteristics and other site elements which may affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare, and its relationship and harmony with City
ordinances and plans.
(b) It is further the intent of this Article to require the eventual upgrade of existing sites
that do not conform with current standards of this Article and ensure that the
arrangement, location, design and materials within a site are consistent with the
character of the City and the goals and design guidelines in the City of Romulus
Master Plan.
Section 17.02 Uses Requiring Site Plan Review
(a) Site plan and sketch plan reviews and approvals shall be required for the activities
or uses listed in Table 17.02.
(b) Approvals are obtained from the Planning Commission (PC), City Council (CC),
Administrative Review Committee (ARC), or Building and Safety Department (BSD)
depending upon the nature of the proposed construction or use. Where City
Council approval is required, it shall be based upon the recommendation of the
Planning Commission. Where the Ordinance allows the City to grant modifications
or waivers to a specific requirement, the approval authority shall be the body
with the authority to grant the associated modification or waiver, based upon the
standards provided in that section. Variances may only be granted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals (BZA).
(c) Activities and uses that are exempt from site plan/sketch plan approval still require
a building permit. All construction or building modification is subject to City building
permit requirements of the Building and Safety Department in accordance with
Article 21.
(d) Improvements to nonconforming sites, structures and uses are also subject to review
according to Article 20, Nonconforming.

Section 17.05 Site Plans Review Standards
A site plan or sketch plan shall be approved if it contains the information required by
the Zoning Ordinance and is in compliance with the conditions imposed under the
Zoning Ordinance, other statutorily authorized and properly adopted City planning
documents, other applicable ordinances, and state and federal statutes, as outlined
below:
(a) Adequacy of Information. The site plan shall include all required information in a
sufficiently complete and understandable form to provide an accurate description
of the proposed use(s) and structure(s).
(b) Buildings. Buildings and structures shall meet the minimum dimensional requirements
of this Ordinance. Redevelopment of nonconforming structures shall bring the site
into closer conformity to the extent deemed practical by the City. Expansions to
nonconforming buildings shall be as provided for in Article 20.
(c) Privacy. The site design shall provide reasonable visual and sound privacy for
dwelling units located adjacent to the site. Walls, berms, barriers and landscaping
shall be used, as appropriate, for the protection and enhancement of property and
the privacy of adjacent uses.
(d) Exterior Lighting. Exterior lighting shall be designed so that it is deflected away from
adjacent properties and so that it does not impede the vision of drivers on public
streets.
(e) Preservation of Natural Areas. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state,
insofar as practicable, by strategic building placement, minimizing tree and soil
removal, alteration to the natural drainage courses, and the amount of cutting,
filling and grading. Insofar as practical, natural features and the site topography
shall be incorporated into the proposed site design. Woodlands shall be preserved
as required under the City Woodlands Ordinance.
(f) Drainage. Stormwater management systems and facilities shall preserve natural
drainage characteristics and enhance the aesthetics of the site to the maximum
extent possible, and shall not substantially reduce or increase the natural retention
or storage capacity of any wetland, water body, or water course, or cause
alterations which could increase flooding or water pollution on or off the site.
(g) Soil Erosion. Measures shall be included to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation.
(h) Hazardous Materials. Sites that include storage of hazardous materials or waste,
fuels, salt, or chemicals shall be designed to prevent spills and discharges of
polluting materials to the surface of the ground, groundwater, or nearby surface
water bodies. These areas shall be designed to meet all applicable state and
federal regulations and incorporate basic management practices for the handling
of hazardous materials. Uses that involve the storage of large quantities of hazardous
or combustible materials shall be located and designed to ensure no threat to
nearby uses and residents is present.
City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance 17-13
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011
17
Site Plan Review Requirements & Procedures
(i) Ingress and Egress. Every structure and dwelling unit shall be provided with
adequate means of ingress and egress via public streets and walkways. Access to
the site shall be located and designed to ensure minimal impact on the safety and
efficiency of traffic flow along all adjoining roadways.
(j) Emergency Vehicle Access. All buildings and site circulation shall be arranged to
permit emergency vehicle access by practicable means to all buildings and areas
of the site. Vehicle circulation shall meet turning radius requirements set by the Fire
Department. Fire lanes shall be designated on the site and posted with signage
by the developer/property owner at the developers/property owners expense
prior to occupancy. Fire hydrants, fire suppression systems, fire detection, and fire
extinguishers shall be provided as required by the Fire Department.
(k) Vehicular Circulation Layout. The arrangement of public or common ways for
vehicular and pedestrian circulation shall respect the pattern of existing or planned
streets and pedestrian pathways in the area. Public streets adjacent or through
the proposed development shall be required when it is essential to promoting and
protecting public health, safety and general welfare and to provide continuity to
the public road system.
(l) Pedestrian Circulation. The site plan shall provide a pedestrian circulation system
which is insulated as completely as is reasonably possible from the vehicular
circulation system.
(m) Traffic Impact. The expected volume of traffic to be generated by the proposed
use shall not adversely affect existing roads and traffic patterns. Roadway access
shall minimize excessive vehicle traffic on local residential streets to reduce the
possibility of any adverse effects upon adjacent property. A transportation impact
study as described in Section 23.02(a)(3) may be required where the trip thresholds
noted in that section are met to help determine compliance with this standard.
(n) Public Services. The scale and design of the proposed development shall facilitate
the adequate provision of services currently furnished by or that may be required
of the City or other public agency including, but not limited to, fire and police
protection, stormwater management, sanitary sewage removal and treatment,
traffic control, and administrative services.
(o) Site Redevelopment. Redevelopment of existing sites shall conform to the site
improvement provisions of this Ordinance to the extent deemed practical by the
Planning Commission. The extent of upgrade to site improvements shall be relative
to and proportionate with the extent of redevelopment or expansion in accordance
with the nonconforming site requirements of Section 20.06.
Section 17.06 Amended Plans
(a) Minor Changes
(1) Prior to making any change to an approved site plan/sketch plan the applicant
or property owner shall notify the Planning Director of any desired change. The
Planning Director shall review the request and determine whether the requested
change is minor or major. The following shall be considered minor changes:
a. Movement of a building or buildings by no more than five (5) feet, provided
all setback, parking, landscaping and other site requirements are still met.
b. Plantings approved in the landscape plan may be replaced by similar types
and sizes of landscaping which provides a similar screening effect on an
17-14 City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011

Site Plan Review Requirements & Procedures
equal or greater basis.
c. Trees to be preserved that were damaged or lost during construction may
be replaced by trees of a similar species, with two (2) new trees required for
each tree replaced.
d. Improvements to site access or circulation, such as deceleration lanes,
boulevards, curbing, pedestrian/bicycle paths, but not the addition of new
driveways.
e. Changes of building materials to another of higher quality, as determined by
the Building and Safety Director.
f. Changes in interior floor plans which do not alter the character of the use.
g. Slight modification of sign placement or reduction of size.
h. Changes required or requested by the City, County, State or Federal agency
for safety reasons or for compliance with applicable laws.
i. Revisions that do not alter the basic design, compliance with the standards of
approval, nor any specified conditions of the approved site plan.
j. Situations the Building and Safety Director deems similar to the above.
(2) Minor changes to an approved site plan may be approved by the Planning
Director.
(b) Major Changes. All other changes not considered minor shall be considered a
major change requiring a new application for site plan review.

Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011

Special Land Use Review Requirements & Procedures
Section 18.01 Intent
(a) The formulation and enactment of the Zoning Ordinance is based upon the division
of the City into zoning districts, in each of which are permitted specified uses which
are considered to be mutually compatible. In addition to permitted compatible uses
there are certain other uses which may be necessary or desirable to allow in certain
locations within certain districts; but because of their actual or potential impacts
on neighboring uses or public facilities, there is a need to carefully regulate them
with respect to their location, site design, and operations. These uses, due to their
peculiar locational needs or the nature of the service offered, may be established
in a district where they cannot be reasonably allowed as a permitted use, but may
be allowed on a case-by-case basis as special land uses upon a finding that the
standards of this Article are met.
(b) Special land uses are uses considered to be more intense, or potentially more
disruptive, compared to the various uses permitted by right in a particular zoning
district. The uses classified as special land uses vary by district and are listed in the
regulations of each zoning district. The special land use procedures and standards
are intended to provide a procedure by which special land uses can be evaluated
to determine their potential impacts; ensure impacts can be accommodated
within the environmental, infrastructure, and public services capacities of the area;
provide site design and operational standards to minimize any negative impact
on adjoining or nearby properties; and provide for public input through a public
hearing.
Section 18.02 Authority
(a) The City Council shall have the sole authority to approve, approve with conditions or
deny all special land uses.
(b) A site/sketch plan conforming to the requirements and procedures of Article 17 is
required for all special land uses. The Planning Commission shall be the approving
authority for site/sketch plans related to the special land use.
(c) Approval of a special land use shall be granted only for those uses specified in the
application and shown on the site/sketch plan.
(d) The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not have the authority to hear appeals of the City
Councils decision to approve or deny a special land use, nor to grant variances
to the specific special land use standards for that use or any conditions imposed
on special land use approval. The Board of Zoning Appeals may hear requests for
variances to district or site/sketch plan requirements that are not special land use
requirements.
Section 18.03 Procedures
(a) Application
(1) An application for the approval of a special land use shall be made by an
owner, lessee, or other person with a legal interest in the property who has the
owner's consent to file the application.
(2) The application shall be accompanied by a complete site/sketch plan and the
necessary fees in accordance with the requirements of Article 17, and written
information describing the special land use and how the proposed land use will
comply with the standards of Section 18.05 shall be provided.

Special Land Use Review Requirements & Procedures
(3) Upon receipt of an application for a special land use, the City shall provide
notice of the request as required under Section 21.11.
(b) Planning Commission Recommendation
(1) The Planning Commission shall review the application and site/sketch plan along
with recommendations from City staff.
(2) The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the special land use
request and make a recommendation on the special land use along with any
suggested conditions they deem necessary.

Special Land Use Review Requirements & Procedures
c. Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance; be
related to the standards established in this Ordinance for the land use or
activity under consideration; and be necessary to ensure compliance with
those standards.
(d) Site Plan Approval. The site/sketch plan for the special land use shall be subject
to review by the Planning Commission after the City Council approves the special
land use. However, the Planning Commission may approve the site/sketch plan
concurrently with making a recommendation on the special land use to City
Council, where there are no significant unresolved issues with the site/sketch
plan. Approval of the site/sketch plan concurrent with the recommendation on
the special land use shall be with the condition that the City Council approves
the special land use and that any conditions set by the City Council shall be
incorporated into the site/sketch plan.
(e) Period of Validity. If construction has not commenced within eighteen (18)
months of special land use approval, approval becomes null and void and a new
application for special land use review shall be required. The City Council may
grant an extension not exceeding one (1) year. The special land use approval
shall become null and void if the applicant fails to obtain a building permit and
begin substantial construction of the project within the time period allotted, or an
extension. Any special approval land use that is discontinued or abandoned for a
period exceeding one (1) year shall have its approval automatically revoked upon
determination that the use has been abandoned.
Section 18.04 Waivers
The Planning Commission shall have the authority to grant waivers to the specific
special land use standards for a particular use listed in the district based upon the
overall design of the site/sketch plan, compatibility with surrounding land uses and
impacts of the proposed special land use in consideration of the intent of this Article.
Waivers by the Planning Commission shall be noted in its recommendation forwarded
to the City Council.
Section 18.05 General Standards
In considering all applications for special land uses, the Planning Commission and the
City Council as appropriate, shall review each case individually and must find that
each of the following standards are satisfied:
(a) Consistent with Master Plan. The proposed special land use shall be compatible with
and in accordance with the general principles and objectives of the City of Romulus
Master Plan.
(b) Consistent with Zoning Ordinance Intent. The proposed special land use shall be
designed, constructed, operated and maintained to meet the stated intent of the
zoning district and shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this
Ordinance.
(c) Compatibility with Adjacent Uses. The proposed special land use has a location,
size and character that will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly
development of the surrounding neighborhood and/or vicinity. It shall comply with
all applicable regulations of the zoning district in which it is to be located and the
other requirements of this Ordinance. The location, size and height of buildings or
structures, walls, fences, landscaping and height of signs for the proposed use will
City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance 18-5
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011
18
Special Land Use Review Requirements & Procedures
not interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent
land and buildings or unreasonably affect their value.
(d) Traffic Impacts. The proposed use will make vehicular and pedestrian traffic no
more hazardous than is normal for the district involved, taking into consideration
vehicular turning movements in relations to routes of traffic flow, proximity and
relationship to intersections, adequacy of sight distances, location and access of
off-street parking and provisions for pedestrian traffic, with particular attention to
minimizing child-vehicle conflicts. A transportation impact study in accordance with
Section 23.02 (a)(3) may be required to assist the evaluation of compliance with this
standard.
(e) Impacts to Adjacent Uses. The location, size, intensity, site layout and periods of
operation of the proposed use shall be designed and arranged to minimize any
possible nuisance which might be noxious to the occupants of any other nearby
permitted uses, whether by reason of dust, noise, fumes, vibration, smoke or lights.
(f) Environmental Impact. The proposed special land use shall not have an
unacceptable significant adverse effect on the quality of the natural environment
in comparison to the impacts associated with the districts permitted uses. The
Planning Commission or City Council may require a quantitative comparison of
the impacts of typical permitted uses and the special land use to assist in making
this determination (such as an overlay of conceptual development plans, on a
natural features map, illustrating other site development options to demonstrate
the impacts have been minimized to the extent practical). If the cumulative impact
creates or contributes to a significant environmental problem, mitigation shall be
provided to alleviate the impacts associated with the requested use (i.e. ensure the
end result is at least similar to the pre-existing conditions).
(g) Public Services. The proposed special land use shall be located where it can
be adequately served by essential public facilities and services, such as streets,
pedestrian or bicycle facilities, police and fire protection, drainage systems, water
and sewage facilities, and schools.
Section 18.07 Amendments, Expansions, and Change in Use
(a) Amendments. The property owner shall notify the Planning Director of any desired
change in an approved special land use. The Planning Director shall determine
whether the proposed amendment constitutes a minor or major amendment, based
on the total cumulative expansion since the original special land use approval as
follows:
(1) Changes that increase the usable floor area of the building(s) by more than
twenty percent (20%);
(2) Parking lots are expanded by more than twenty percent (20%);
(3) The occupancy, capacity or membership associated with the use is increased
by more than twenty percent (20%);
(4) The use is expanded to occupy an additional twenty percent (20%) or more land
area; or,
(5) The expansion will result in a twenty percent (20%) or more increase in traffic
generation based upon the latest edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers Trip
Generation Manual or will change the number or location of driveway access
points.

(b) Major Amendments. Any major amendment to an approved special land use by
the amounts in (a) above or greater shall require a new special land use permit and
shall be reviewed using the procedures and requirements of this Article.
(c) Minor Amendment. Minor amendment to an approved special land use less than
the amounts noted in (a) above does not require submittal of a new application
for a special land use, but shall still be subject to the site/sketch plan review
requirements of Article 17.
(d) Change in Use. Change to another type of special land use shall require submission
of a new application for a special land use following the review procedures
contained in this Article. A change in use that is still the same type of use shall not
require a new special land use, unless it involves a major expansion. A change in
ownership shall not constitute a change in use.

Planned Development Area Regulations
Section 19.01 Intent
The Planned Development Area (PDA) concept is a development option intended
to provide a degree of flexibility in the regulation of land development and the
arrangement of uses. Through this option, more creative approaches to development
can be utilized which take better advantage of the special characteristics of the land
than would be possible through the strict enforcement of this Ordinance. The specific
objectives of this Article are to:
(a) Encourage innovation in land use and variety in design, layout and type of
structures constructed.
(b) Achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy, and
the provision of public services and utilities.
(c) Permit flexibility in the placement, lot area and building type regulations, and
combination of uses while assuring the application of sound site planning standards.
(d) Encourage the provision of useful open space and more extensive landscaping.
(e) Provide opportunities for improvements to public streets or facilities, pathways, and
natural storm water systems.
(f) Achieve consistent and coordinated site design (lighting, signs, building design,
etc.), and high quality architectural design and materials.
(g) Encourage the use, reuse, and improvement of existing sites.
(h) Encourage the use and improvement of land where site conditions make
development under conventional zoning difficult and less desirable.
Section 19.02 Qualifying Conditions
(a) Ownership and Minimum Site Area. Any person or persons having a beneficial
interest or right to obtain a beneficial interest in at least five (5) acres of land in any
zoning district may apply for development as a PDA under the procedures for, and
in compliance with, the standards of this Article. The Planning Commission may
permit an application on less land for an infill project; provided, that the project
substantially forwards the objectives and recognizable, and substantial benefits
of the PDA, that the development is designed to be compatible with surrounding
land uses and the PDA can be integrated into the planned development of the
surrounding area.
(b) Public Utilities. The PDA site shall be serviced by public sewer and water systems. The
proposed type and density of use shall not result in an unreasonable increase in the
use of public services, public facilities, and utility capacities.
(c) Recognizable and Substantial Benefits. The PDA application shall demonstrate
that the project will result in recognizable and substantial benefits to the residents,
users, visitors, adjacent neighbors, and the City overall that would not be available
under the existing, underlying zoning classification. Benefits beyond those otherwise
required by this Ordinance include, but are not limited to:
(1) Preservation of significant natural features.
(2) A complementary mixture of uses.
(3) Extensive open space and recreational amenities.
(4) Open space greenways to link to adjacent greenway corridors.

Nonconforming
Section 20.01 Intent
Non conformities are lots, uses, structures, buildings, or site plans for developed sites
which do not conform to one or more provisions or requirements of this Ordinance or to
any subsequent amendment, but which were lawfully established prior to the time of
adoption of the Ordinance or amendment. Such non conformities are considered to
be incompatible with the current or intended use of land, buildings or structures in the
district in which they are located. It is therefore the intent of this section to:
(a) Meet the objectives stated below by establishing regulations that govern the
completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and/or substitution of nonconformities,
and specify the circumstances and conditions under which non
conformities shall be permitted to continue.
(b) Discourage the continuation of nonconforming uses that are more intense than the
uses permitted within the zoning district and are considered to be incompatible with
permitted uses, or encourage their redevelopment into a more conforming use.
(c) Permit legal nonconforming buildings, structures or uses to remain until they are
discontinued, removed or abandoned. This Ordinance also has special provisions to
permit certain nonconforming situations considered to be less harmful to continue
under certain conditions, but to discourage their expansion, enlargement, or
extension.
(d) Encourage a gradual upgrading to a more conforming status of site landscaping,
parking, paving, signs or other features of a site developed in compliance with the
Zoning Ordinance requirements at the time of their construction, but which do not
meet the site requirements of this Ordinance.
(e) Encourage the combination of contiguous nonconforming lots of record to
create lots which conform or more closely conform to current requirements and
are compatible with other lots in the zoning districts in which they are located,
to promote the public health, safety and welfare and to eliminate problems
associated with the overcrowding of land.
Section 20.02 Applicability
(a) To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require
a change in plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance, upon which actual construction is hereby defined to
include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened
in a permanent manner. Where demolition or removal of an existing building has
been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding such work shall be deemed to
be actual construction, provided that such work shall be diligently continued until
completion of the building involved.
(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to supplant or supersede the requirements
of Chapter 5 of the Romulus Code of Ordinances, any Michigan statute adopted
by the City of Romulus, or any other Romulus ordinance setting forth requirements
or procedures pertaining to deteriorated, dangerous, dilapidated, and/or unsafe
buildings and/or structures.
Section 20.03 Change of Tenancy or Ownership
In the event there is a change in tenancy, ownership, or management of an existing
City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance 20-3
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011
20
Nonconforming
non conforming use, structure and/or building, such non-conformity shall be allowed to
continue provided there is no change in the nature or character of the non conformity
and the use, structure, and/or building is otherwise in compliance with this Ordinance.
Section 20.04 Nonconforming Uses
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, a lawful
use on open land, a lot(s), building(s), or accessory structure(s) exists that is made
nonconforming by this Ordinance or its amendments, such use may be continued, as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(a) Expansions. Any nonconforming use may be expanded to occupy any part of a
building which was originally built for such use, and which existed at the effective
date of this Ordinance. Except for single-family uses as discussed in Section 20.05
below, a nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended to
occupy a greater area of land, constructed or reconstruction or structurally altered
except with approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(b) Change in Use.
(1) The Board of Zoning Appeals may allow a change in use from one
nonconforming use to another nonconforming use, upon finding that the
proposed use complies with all of the following:
a. The proposed use does not substantially differ from the existing use in terms of
compatibility with the character of the area in which it is located;
b. The proposed use does not increase the degree of nonconformity existing
prior to such change of use; and,
c. No structural alteration of the existing structure will be required to
accommodate the new use.
(2) In permitting the change, the Board of Zoning Appeals may require conditions
and safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of this Ordinance.
(3) Where a nonconforming use of a structure, land, or structure and land in
combination is hereafter changed to a more conforming use, it shall not
thereafter be changed to a less conforming use.
(c) Removal of Structures Containing Nonconforming Use. Removal of a structure
containing a nonconforming use shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the
land.
(d) Restoration from Damage. If a structure that is occupied by a nonconforming use,
other than a single family dwelling, is damaged by any means or in any manner to
the extent that the cost of reconstruction or restoration exceeds fifty percent (50%)
the value of such structure prior to the damaging occurrence, as determined by the
most recent assessment of the market value of the structure, excluding the value of
land, for purposes of taxation, such structure may be reconstructed or restored only
if its use conforms with the provisions of this Ordinance.
(e) Discontinuance or Termination of Nonconforming Use. When a nonconforming use
is discontinued or abandoned for twelve (12) consecutive months, the structure
or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in
conformance with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.

dwelling units.
(h) When a nonconforming residential use is discontinued or abandoned for twentyfour
(24) consecutive months, the structure or structure and land in combination,
shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with one of the following:
(1) The use is in conformance with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located; or,
(2) In cases where buildings containing nonconforming residential uses are vacant
for a longer period due to real estate delays or other factors beyond the owners
control (not including health or safety related issues), the Board of Zoning
Appeals may permit re-occupancy of the structure or structure and land in
combination.
Section 20.06 Nonconforming Residential Buildings or Structures
(a) Reconstruction. In the event a nonconforming residential structure or building
is damaged by fire or other natural cause, a residential structure may be
reconstructed on the same foundation provided the first floor footprint and the total
floor area does not exceed the size of the previous residence, except as provided
for below.
(b) Expansion. A residential nonconforming building may be expanded provided the
expansion will be within required setbacks and other dimensional and building
code requirements are met (spacing between structures, height, maximum lot
coverage, etc.). (Example: a home with a nonconforming front yard setback may
be expanded in the rear so long as the rear yard setback remains conforming and
maximum lot coverage is not exceeded).
Section 20.07 Nonconforming Non-residential Buildings or Structures
(a) Restrictions on Creating Nonconformities. Nonconforming structures and buildings
City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance 20-5
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011
20
Nonconforming
shall not be enlarged nor altered in a way which increases its nonconformity within
the provisions of this Ordinance, unless approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals
under Article 22.
(b) Restrictions on Alteration or Modification. If a nonconforming structure or
building is altered or modified so as to eliminate, remove or lessen any or all of its
nonconforming characteristics, then the nonconforming characteristics shall not be
later re-established or increased.
(c) Repairs and Reconstruction. Nonconforming structures or buildings that are
damaged by any means or in any manner may be reconstructed or restored only in
conformity with the following.
(1) Replacements Exceeding One-Half of Value. Where the cost of repair,
reconstruction or restoration exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the current True Cash
Value of the structure, exclusive of the land value, as determined by the City
Assessor, the structure may only be reconstructed when in compliance with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
(2) Replacements Less Than or Equal to One-Half of Value. Where the cost of
repair, reconstruction or restoration is equal to or less than fifty percent (50%)
of the current True Cash Value of the structure, exclusive of the land value, as
determined by the City Assessor, reconstruction or restoration shall be permitted,
provided a building permit is issued within one (1) year of the occurrence of the
damage.
(d) Permitted Building Improvements. A building that is nonconforming may be
altered or rehabilitated if such activity serves to clearly increase conformity to this
Ordinance and the Building Code.
(e) Permitted Expansion of Nonresidential Nonconforming Buildings. Nonresidential
nonconforming buildings shall not be expanded, unless a variance is obtained from
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(f) Safety Repairs. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety,
upon order of such official.

applicable in the district, provided that the lot is in conformance with all other
applicable yard setback, minimum floor area and maximum height requirements for
the district in which it is located.
(b) Compliance with Other Requirements. Regulations regarding development,
including dimensional requirements and review standards imposed by other
provisions of this Ordinance shall still apply.

appear may result in tabling or denial of the application.
(3) Decisions on Appeal
a. In deciding the appeal, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall first determine
whether or not the official or body making the decision used the proper
standards and guidelines in the Ordinance. The decision of the Board
of Zoning Appeals is limited to the information that was available to the
administrative official or body who made the decision initially. Additional
testimony is not appropriate.
b. If a determination is made that the administrative official or body making
the decision did so improperly, the Board of Zoning Appeals may reverse
or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify, the order, requirement, decision
or determination appealed from, and may make an order, requirement,
decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have
all the powers of the administrative official or body from whom the appeal
was taken.
(c) Dimensional (Nonuse) Variances. A dimensional variance may be allowed by the
Board of Zoning Appeals only in cases where there is evidence of practical difficulty
in the official record of the hearing and that all of the following standards are met:
(1) There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to
the property that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zoning
district. Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions may include:
a. Exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific property on the
effective date of this Ordinance; or
b. By reason of exceptional topographic or environmental conditions or other
extraordinary situation on the land, building or structure; or
c. By reason of the use or development of the property immediately adjoining
the property in question;
whereby the literal enforcement of the requirements of this Ordinance would
involve practical difficulties.
(2) The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial
property right similar to that possessed by other properties in the same zoning
district and in the vicinity. The possibility that compliance with this Ordinance
may prove to be more costly shall not be part of the consideration of the Board
of Zoning Appeals.
(3) The variance will not be detrimental to adjacent property and the surrounding
neighborhood.

Board of Zoning Appeals
(4) The variance will not materially impair the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
(5) That the immediate practical difficulty causing the need for the variance request
was not created by the applicant.
(d) Use Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant a use variance unless
there is evidence of unnecessary hardship in the official record of the hearing that
all of the following standards are met:
(1) That the condition, location, or situation of the specific piece of property or
of the intended use of the property is unique to that property. Exceptional or
extraordinary circumstances or conditions may include:
a. Exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific property on the
effective date of this Ordinance; or
b. By reason of exceptional topographic or environmental conditions or other
extraordinary situation on the land, building or structure; or
c. By reason of the use or development of the property immediately adjoining
the property in question;
whereby the literal enforcement of the requirements of this Ordinance would
involve practical difficulties.
(2) That the building, structure or land cannot be reasonably used in a manner
consistent with the uses allowed in the zoning district in which it is located.
(3) That the use variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood
or the intent of the Master Plan, nor be a detriment to adjacent properties.
(4) The variance will not materially impair the intent and purpose of this Ordinance
or the district in which the property is located.
(5) That the immediate unnecessary hardship causing the need for the variance
request was not created by the applicant.
(e) Temporary Building and Uses. The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit temporary
buildings and uses not to exceed six (6) months provided that all requirements and
conditions relative to the type of structure and use, and timing and arrangements
for termination and removal, are specified in writing. The Board of Zoning Appeals
may condition approvals related to setbacks, screening, off-street parking and other
conditions considered necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare and comfort
of inhabitants of the City. A single three (3) month extension may be granted if the
Board of Zoning Appeals is petitioned by the applicant prior to the expiration of the
original six (6) month approval.

offer a conditional zoning agreement along with an application for rezoning before
or following the public hearing for a proposed rezoning. An election to submit a
conditional zoning agreement shall be pursuant to the Zoning Act and this Article.
(1) The conditional zoning agreement shall be in writing, executed by the applicant
and the City and recorded with the Wayne County Register of Deeds.
(2) The conditional zoning agreement may include limitations on the uses permitted
on the property in question, specification of lower density or less intensity of
development and use, or may impose more restrictions on the location, size,
height, or other measure for buildings, structures, improvements, setbacks,
landscaping, buffers, design, architecture and other features.
(3) The conditional zoning agreement shall not authorize uses or developments of
greater intensity or density, or which are not permitted in the proposed zoning
district; nor may a conditional zoning agreement permit variations from height,
area, setback or similar dimensional requirements that are less restrictive than the
proposed zoning district.
(4) The conditional zoning agreement shall include conditions that bear a
reasonable and rational relationship and/or benefit to the property in question.
The conditional zoning agreement may include conditions related to the use
and development of the property that are necessary to:
a. Serve the property with improvements, including but not limited to, the
extension, widening, or realignment of streets; construction, or extension
of utilities, or other infrastructure improvements serving the site; or the
construction of recreational facilities;
b. Minimize the impact of the development on surrounding properties and the
City overall; or,
c. Preserve natural features and open space beyond what is normally required.
(b) Content of Agreement. In addition to any limitations on use or development of the
site, preservation of site features or improvements described above, the conditional
zoning agreement shall also include the following:
(1) An acknowledgement that the conditional zoning agreement was proposed
voluntarily by the applicant.
(2) A statement that the property shall not be developed or used in any manner
that is not consistent with the conditional zoning agreement.
(3) A statement that the approval of the rezoning and the conditional zoning
agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the property
owner and the City, and also their respective heirs, successors, assigns, receivers
or transferees. Where the applicant for rezoning is acting on behalf of the
landowner through some form of purchase agreement or other mechanism,
then the landowner must also consent and sign the agreement.
(4) A statement that, if a rezoning with a conditional zoning agreement becomes
void in accordance with this Section, that no further development shall take
place and no permits shall be issued unless and until a new zoning district
23-8 City of Romulus Zoning Ordinance
Resolution # 11-322 effective 11-30-2011
23
Amendments to Ordinance
classification for the property has been established.
(5) A statement that no part of the conditional zoning agreement shall permit
any activity, use, or condition that would otherwise violate any requirement or
standard that is otherwise applicable in the new zoning district.
(6) A legal description of the land to which the agreement pertains.
(7) Any other provisions as are agreed upon by the parties.
(c) Process. The conditional zoning agreement shall be reviewed concurrently with the
petition for rezoning following the process in Section 23.02 and the following:
(1) The conditional zoning agreement may be submitted prior to or following the
Planning Commission public hearing. If the agreement is provided following the
public hearing it must be reviewed by the Planning Commission prior to Planning
Commission making its recommendation on the rezoning to the City Council.
The conditional zoning agreement shall be reviewed by the City Attorney to
determine that the conditional zoning agreement conforms to the requirements
of this Section and the Zoning Act and shall confirm that the conditional zoning
agreement is in a form acceptable for recording with the Wayne County
Register of Deeds.
(2) Following the public hearing for a proposed zoning amendment, the Planning
Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council based upon
the Criteria listed in Section 23.04. In addition, the Planning Commission shall
consider whether the proposed conditional zoning agreement:
a. Is consistent with the intent of this Article;
b. Bears a reasonable and rational connection or benefit to the property being
proposed for rezoning;
c. Is necessary to insure that the property develops in such a way that protects
the surrounding neighborhood and minimizes any potential impacts to
adjacent properties;
d. Is necessary to allow the rezoning to be approved, in that the property
could not or would not be rezoned without the proposed conditional zoning
agreement;
e. Leads to a development that is more compatible with abutting or surrounding
uses than would have been likely if the property had been rezoned without a
conditional zoning agreement, or if the property were left to develop under
the existing zoning classification; and,
f. Is clearly in the public interest and not inconsistent with the recommendations
of the Master Plan.
(3) If a conditional zoning agreement has been offered by the applicant and
recommended for approval by the Planning Commission, the City Council
may approve the conditional zoning agreement as a condition to the rezoning
if it meets all requirements of subsection (b) above. The conditional zoning
agreement shall be incorporated by attachment or otherwise as an inseparable
part of the ordinance adopted by the City Council to accomplish the requested
rezoning.
(4) If the rezoning and conditional zoning agreement are approved, the zoning
classification of the rezoned property shall consist of the district to which
the property has been rezoned, and a reference to the conditional zoning
