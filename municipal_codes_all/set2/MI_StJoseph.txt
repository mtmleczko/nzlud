PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the 1968 St. Joseph Code of Ordinances of a general and permanent nature. 
    This 2010 republication includes all amendatory legislation through an ordinance adopted January 10, 2011, and was accomplished under the supervision of Diana Ossi, Editor. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1968 Code of Ordinances and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1968 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the third section of chapter 5 is 5-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 5-3 and 5-4 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 5-3.1, 5-3.2 and 5-3.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Bill Carroll, Supervising Editor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. It is hoped that this project has resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

(Amnd. by electors on 4-1-85) 
Case law references- A two-year residency requirement for city officers was held violative of equal protection, Green v. McKeon, 335 F.Supp. 630 (E.D. Mich. 1971), aff. by 468 F.2d 883 (6th Cir. 1972). 
A one-year residency requirement for city officers was upheld, Joseph v. City of Birmingham, 510 F.Supp. 1319 (E.D. Mich. 1981). 
State Law reference- Mandatory that Charter provide for qualifications of its officers, MCL 117.3(d). 
Section 4. - Meetings.

The Clerk shall preside at the first meeting under this Charter and until the Mayor shall have been selected as herein provided. Thereafter the Commission shall meet at such times as may be prescribed by ordinance or resolution, except that the Commission shall by resolution, fix a certain time and place for holding one regular meeting of the Commission each week. The Mayor or any two members of the Commission may call special meetings of the Commission upon at least six hours written notice to each member, served personally or left at his usual place of residence; provided, the presence of all Commissioners at a special meeting, held in the council chamber, shall operate to waive the necessity for such call. All meetings of the Commission shall be public and any citizen may have access to the minutes and records thereof at all reasonable times. The Commission shall determine its own rules and order of business and shall keep a journal of its proceedings in English. 
Editor's note- This section conflicts with the open meetings act in that an 18-hour public notice is required for special meetings. 
State Law reference- Mandatory that Charter provide that all meetings of the council be open to the public, MCL 117.3(l); open meetings act, MCL 15.261 et seq.; mandatory that Charter provide for keeping of a journal of every session, MCL 117.3(m).

Section 6. - Mayor and mayor pro tem. 
    The Commission, at its first regular meeting following the first election under this Charter, and following each general municipal election thereafter, shall elect, by ballot one of its members as Mayor, who shall be the presiding officer and executive head of the City and perform such other duties as are or may be imposed or authorized by the laws of the State or this Charter. In times of public danger or emergency he may, with the consent of the Commission, take command of the police and such other departments and subordinates of the City as may be deemed necessary by the Commission, and maintain order and enforce laws. The Commission shall also, at the same meeting, elect by ballot, another member of the Commission Mayor pro tem, who, during the absence or disability of the Mayor to perform his duties, shall act in the name and stead of the Mayor and who shall, during the time of such absence or disability, exercise all the duties and possess all the powers of the Mayor. The Mayor and Mayor pro tem shall receive compensation only as Commissioners. 
Section 7. - Compensation of commissioners. 
    Each Commissioner shall be paid for his services the amount of $2 for each and every meeting attended by such members, payable semi-annually on June 1st and December 1st of each year; provided, however, that no member of the Commission shall be entitled to receive more than $100 in any one year. 
State Law reference- Mandatory that Charter provide for compensation of officers, MCL 117.3(d).

The bond to the City shall be filed with the City Clerk and the bond to the County shall be filed with the County Treasurer. The premium on said bonds, if any, shall be paid by the City. 
(g)  Jurisdiction. The Municipal Judge shall have and exercise within the City of St. Joseph and County of Berrien the same jurisdiction and powers as are or may be conferred upon justices of the peace in cities and townships by the statutes and laws of Michigan except as hereinafter otherwise provided.

If the assessment is directed to be according to benefits the Assessor shall assess upon each lot such relative proportion of the whole sum to be levied as shall be proportionate to the estimated benefit resulting to such lot from the improvements. When he shall have completed the assessment it shall be signed by the Assessor and may be in the form of a certificate endorsed on the assessment roll as follows:

Inspections shall occur during the city's regular business hours, unless the city agrees to other arrangements, and all fees shall be paid prior to the inspection. 
(c)  If an inspection reveals that the rental unit is not in compliance with the housing and property maintenance code, the owner shall be provided a written list of deficiencies or violations that must be corrected before a permit is issued. If the city determines that the deficiencies or violations do not render the rental unit uninhabitable, the city may issue a provisional rental unit permit for that rental unit. 
(d)  The city may conduct additional inspections as it deems necessary, upon reasonable notice to the owner or agent, such as when: 
(1)  A provisional permit has been issued; 
(2)  When a complaint is filed with the city; or 
(3)  The city otherwise has reasonable cause to believe a rental unit is in violation of any city code. 
(e)  For short-term rental units, between each short-term rental to a different tenant, the local rental agent shall inspect the premises using a city-designated checklist and shall ensure that all smoke detectors, lights in common areas and stairways, egress doors, and railings are in a safe and working condition; any defects discovered shall be corrected promptly. Upon inspection, the agent shall sign and date that checklist and shall maintain it for city inspection and copying for a period of at least two years. 
(f)  If the city becomes aware of code or other deficiencies or violations subsequent to the issuance of a permit, the city may issue a new provisional rental unit permit addressing the deficiencies or violations, or revoke the current permit, or both, and may also take any other action allowed by law. 
(Ord. of 4-25-11) 
Sec. 8-106. - Recordkeeping. 
(a)  For all short-term rentals, the local agent shall obtain and maintain for the purpose of city inspection and copying the name, address, and other contact information of a responsible tenant as well as the document signed by that tenant acknowledging the maximum occupancy load of the rental unit and applicable city regulations.

(b)  Each rental unit, when used as a short-term rental, shall have a landline telephone with free local calls, which will appear at the 911 dispatch center. The owner of each rental unit, when used as a short-term rental, must prominently display in the unit a notice indicating the unit's street address, municipality, and other such descriptive information which, if relayed to the 911 dispatch center, would allow emergency responders to quickly locate and enter the rental unit, and further recommending that tenants who use communication devices that may be used to summon aid in an emergency, register those devices to the rental unit's location if appropriate. 
(c)  Each short-term rental unit must have a minimum of one off-street parking space for each occupant's vehicle in addition to any other spaces required under applicable laws, rules and regulations for any other uses in the building or on the premises. 
(d)  The owner of each short-term rental unit must, when the rental unit is used as a short-term rental, prominently display a full-sized copy of the rental unit permit or current provisional rental unit permit in each rental unit. 
(e)  No more than four occupants per bedroom shall be included in the calculation of the maximum occupancy load of a rental unit, when used as a short-term rental unit, regardless of the size of the bedroom. 
(f)  The owner of each unit shall not advertise an occupancy load that is greater than the maximum occupancy load limit. 
(Ord. of 4-25-11) 
Sec. 8-108. - Smoke detectors/alarms. 
(a)  It shall be the responsibility of the owner of each rental unit to install smoke detectors/alarms in each rental unit. All smoke detectors/alarms shall be UL (Underwriters Laboratories, Inc.) approved, and shall be installed in accordance with the provisions of the Michigan Residential Code and the household fire warning equipment provisions of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards Section 72. 
(b)  Smoke detectors/alarms shall be installed in the following locations: 
(1)  In each sleeping room. 
(2)  Outside of each separate sleeping area in the immediate vicinity of the bedrooms. 
(3)  On each additional story of the rental unit, including basements and cellars but not including crawl spaces and uninhabitable attics. In rental units with split levels and without an intervening door between the adjacent levels, a smoke detector/alarm installed on the upper level shall suffice for the adjacent lower level, provided that the lower level is less than one full story below the upper level. 
(c)  After every change of occupancy of a rental unit, the owner shall certify in writing to the new tenant(s), at or before the time each new tenant occupies the rental unit, that all smoke detectors/alarms required by this section are installed, the location of each and that each smoke detector/alarm is in proper working condition. Rental units are exempt from this requirement when lawfully used as short-term rental units under the provisions of this article. 
(d)  No person shall tamper or interfere with the effectiveness of a smoke detector required by this section.

    Alarm user shall mean person or other entity on whose premises an alarm system is maintained within the city. Information identifying the alarm user shall be provided to the city through the registration process under this article. In the event of an unregistered system, or one with outdated registration information, the property owner of record shall be considered to be the alarm user. 
    Chargeable alarm shall mean a false alarm which is not a nonchargeable alarm. 
    City shall mean the office of the director of public safety, or such other office or individual as may be designated by the city manager or city commission to administer all or any part of the alarm program under this article.

    Initiating device shall mean a device, whether manually operated or automatic, which signals the existence of a condition which activates an alarm system, and includes manual pull stations or "panic buttons", temperature sensors, smoke detectors, motion sensors, door or window status sensors, water-flow sensors, and similar devices.

(1)  The result of a storm or interruption of telephone or other utility service, which interruption is not the fault of the building owner; 
(2)  The result of system testing or maintenance, having notified the police/fire dispatch center at least one hour before the testing or maintenance begins and of the completion of testing or maintenance within one hour of said completion; or 
(3)  Other extenuating circumstances, in the discretion of the city. 
Correction of the procedural or mechanical defect which caused the false alarm may be considered a mitigating factor allowing a waiver, in the sole judgment of the city.

Sec. 18-21. - Declared nuisance. 
    Any chargeable alarm in excess of two in any calendar year from the same alarm system is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.

    Fire alarm systems shall be considered separate from security alarm systems protecting a property, and vice versa. However, all fire alarm systems under control of the same alarm user and protecting the same facility shall be considered one alarm system, and all security alarms under control of the same alarm user and protecting the same facility shall be considered one alarm system. Independent alarm systems under the control of separate alarm users, though they may be in the same facility, shall be considered separate alarm systems. 
(Ord. of 10-6-97, § I) 
Sec. 18-24. - Notification; appeals. 
    In the event a representative of the city responds to an alarm originated by an alarm system, and that representative believes the alarm to be a false alarm, the city shall review the incident report and make an initial classification of this alarm under this article. In the event the alarm is determined to be chargeable, notification of this fact and of any fine due will be sent to the alarm user. In the first instance of a chargeable alarm to a system in any calendar year, the city will provide the alarm user with a copy of this article. 
    In the event the alarm user believes the alarm should be classified a nonchargeable alarm, the alarm user must appeal to the city within ten days of the date of the notice, stating the grounds for the appeal. The city shall provide a final response to the alarm user within ten days of receiving the appeal.

(2)  The second through seventh such alarms in a calendar year shall each result in a $100.00 fine. 
(3)  The eighth and subsequent additional such alarms in a calendar year shall each result in a $500.00 fine. 
    In the event a false alarm, whether otherwise defined as a chargeable alarm or as a nonchargeable alarm, is generated by an unregistered system, or one with incorrect contact information on the registration form, the alarm user shall pay a $50.00 fine, in addition to any other penalties that might be levied. 
    In all cases, there shall be an additional late charge of ten percent of the amount due if the fine is not paid within 30 days of the notice date, or in the event an appeal is filed and denied, within 30 days of the mailing of the denial notice. 
(Ord. of 10-6-97, § I) 
Sec. 18-26. - Audible alarm shutoff required. 
    It shall be unlawful to install, operate, or maintain an alarm system or vehicle alarm system with an externally audible signal, unless that system is equipped with a shutoff device that automatically silences the audible signal within ten minutes of activation. An alarm system without such a shutoff device shall be subject to deactivation by the police department or fire department, and in such a case the alarm user shall be subject to a $100.00 shutoff fee, any expenses that may be incurred in deactivating the system, and in addition to any other penalties levied under this article.

The mailing shall be sent to the persons as they appear on the assessment roll. 
(c)  The city commission shall, whenever possible, resolve such appeal by a majority vote at its next regular meeting or session. The city commission shall have jurisdiction over appeals and shall conduct a de novo review of the application and determine whether permission to divide or combine shall be granted. 
(d)  The city and its officers and employees shall not be liable for approving a land division if building permits for construction on the parcels are subsequently denied because of inadequate water supply, sewage disposal facilities or otherwise, and any notice of approval shall include a statement to this effect.

(c)  Prohibition. Except as provided in subsection (d), no person shall install or utilize, or allow, permit, or provide for the installation or utilization of, a well in the city. 
(d)  Exceptions. A person may install or utilize, or allow, permit, or provide for the installation or utilization of, a well within the city if any of the following exceptions applies and the requirements of the exception are complied with: 
(1)  Water service unavailable. If city water service is unavailable to a premises in the city, any well on that premises shall be tested annually by a laboratory that is acceptable to and for chemical parameters specified by the DWRPD. The results of that test shall be promptly submitted to the DWRPD or the Berrien County Health Department for review. If the DWRPD or the Berrien County Health Department determines that the well is safe and suitable for use, and proof of that determination is delivered annually to the city, that well may be used. No split or conveyance of property shall be effective to render city water service unavailable. 
(2)  Proof of no influence. If the MDEQ determines that the use of a well is not influenced or potentially influenced by contaminated groundwater and further determines the use of that well will remain permanently unaffected by the future migration of contaminated groundwater, and proof of those determinations is delivered to the city, the city manager may execute a waiver allowing the use of the well. 
(3)  Groundwater monitoring. A well may be used for groundwater monitoring and/or remediation as part of response activity approved by the MDEQ. 
(4)  Construction de-watering. A well may be used for construction de-watering, if the following conditions are satisfied: 
a.  The use of the de-watering well will not result in unacceptable exposure to contaminated groundwater, possible cross-contamination between saturated zones, or hydro geological effects on contaminated groundwater plumes, and 
b.  The water generated by that activity is properly handled and disposed of in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, permit and license requirements, and orders and directives of any governmental entity or agency of competent jurisdiction. Any exacerbation caused by the use of the well under this exception shall be the responsibility of the person operating the de-watering well, as provided in Part 201 of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, being MCL 324.20101 to 324.20142. 
(5)  Processing activities. If the MDEQ determines that the use of a well for non-contact heating, cooling or processing activities will not cause the future migration of contaminated groundwater, and proof of that determination is delivered to the city, the city manager may execute a waiver allowing the use of the well for the permitted purposes upon such terms and conditions that the MDEQ identifies. 
(6)  Public emergencies. A well may be used in the event of a public emergency. 
(e)  Sources of water supplied for human consumption. Except as provided in subsection (d), water supply for human consumption in the city shall be delivered only from the city water system or by the use of bottled water delivered or purchased in containers under conditions approved by the DWRPD or other appropriate agency.

SECTION 1.3 INTERPRETATION & APPLICATION
1.3.1 Introduction: In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Ordinance, the provisions shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare.
A. Authority for Interpretation: The Zoning Administrator is responsible for interpreting the text of this Ordinance in accordance with the standards set forth in this Section and applicable Ordinance standards and requirements, and applicable state law. Interpretations made by the Zoning Administrator may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
B. Meaning and Intent: All provisions, terms, phrases, and expressions contained in this Ordinance shall be construed according to this Ordinances stated purpose and intent, and applicable state law.
C. Text Controls: In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the text of this Ordinance and any heading, drawing, table, or figure, the text shall control.
D. Statutory References: All references to state law in this Ordinance refer to the Michigan Compiled Laws (MCL), as amended.
E. Computation of Time: In computing a period of time prescribed or allowed by this Ordinance, the following rules apply:
1. The day of the act or event after which the designated period of time begins to run is not included. The last day of the period is included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday on which City Hall is closed for business under the City Personnel policy; in that event, the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday on which City Hall is closed for business.
2. If a period is measured by a period of weeks, the last day of the period is the same day of the week as the day on which the period begins.
3. If a period is measured by months or years, the last day of the period is the same day of the month as the day on which the period began. If what would otherwise be the final month does not include that day, the last day of the period is the last day of that month. For example, 2 months after January 31 is March 31, and 3 months after January 31 is April 30.
F. Delegation of Authority: Whenever a provision requires the head of a department or another officer or employee of the City to perform an act or duty, that provision shall be construed as authorizing the department head or officer to delegate the responsibility to subordinates, unless the terms of the provision specify otherwise.
1.3.2 Relationship to Other Regulations and Restrictions:
A. This Ordinance is not intended to interfere with or abrogate or annul any ordinance, rule, regulation, or permit previously adopted or issued and not in conflict with any of the provisions of this Ordinance, or which shall be adopted or issued pursuant to law relating to the use of land, buildings, structures or premises, and not in conflict with this Ordinance.
B. This Ordinance is not intended to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants, deeds or other agreements between parties, provided however, that where this Ordinance imposes a more stringent restriction upon the use of land, buildings, structures or other premises, or upon height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces, or larger lots, or requires mitigating measures or other limitations on a property different from those imposed or required by an easement, covenant, deed or other agreement, then the provisions of this Ordinance shall control in addition to all nonconflicting requirements of an easement, covenant, deed or other agreement.

C. In the interpretation, application and enforcement of this Ordinance, whenever any of the provisions or limitations imposed are more stringent than any other law, rule, regulation or ordinance, then the provisions of this Ordinance shall govern. However, if the requirements of any other law, rule, regulation or ordinance impose more stringent requirements than are imposed by this Ordinance, then the provisions of such other law or ordinance shall govern. Regardless of any other provision of this Ordinance, no land shall be used and no structure erected or maintained in violation of any state or federal law or regulation.
D. In the event that the combined effect of the requirements of this Ordinance and any other law, rule, regulation or ordinance so severely limit the use of property subject to this Ordinance that no economically viable use of the property remains and a claim of taking under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution could be made, then prior to seeking any redress in a court of law, the property owner shall file a petition with the City Commission for a Hardship Planned Unit Development under Article XIII of this Ordinance.

4.4.9 Reserved for Future Use
4.4.10 Intent and Structure of District Scheme: The City of St. Joseph Zoning Ordinance is based upon and is intended to help implement the City of St. Joseph Comprehensive Plan. The zoning Districts address four major land Use categories: residential, office, commercial, and industrial.
A. The three residential Zones provide for a wide range of residential living opportunities. Each Zone establishes residential Use as the primary and preferred use. A limited set of uses that are related to residential Use of property are also permitted. The greater density associated with a concentration of two-family and multiple-family development requires separate Zones for these uses. Land is intended to be rezoned to the higher intensity residential Districts only when public services are adequate and only in locations consistent with the City of St. Joseph Comprehensive Plan.
B. The commercial office District serves as a transition Zone to buffer low intensity adjacent uses (usually residential) from nearby higher intensity uses (usually commercial). It also provides a separate Zone with a limited number of other compatible uses so as to protect investments made in office Structures.
C. The commercial District is designed to meet the needs for general business in the City. The commercial District is expected to remain limited in size and location, and expanded only when growing demand cannot be met by land in the current Zone and when expansion is consistent with both the policies and Future Land Use Map of the City of St. Joseph Comprehensive Plan.
D. The downtown District is designed to be convenient and attractive for the needs of nearby office workers and residents and for shoppers and tourists arriving by automobile and parking once to carry out several errands. Intensive development of shopping and service facilities and safe and convenient pedestrian travel are essential to the economic viability of the District and public safety and welfare. To strengthen the downtowns economic viability, residential development of the upper floors of Buildings is permitted with certain conditions within the District.
E. Two industrial Districts accommodate the growing needs for a wide range of wholesale, specialized industrial service and manufacturing establishments. Special standards to minimize impacts on abutting residential properties are also provided, as are a limited number of non-industrial uses. Expansion of these Districts is expected to occur only when consistent with the City of St. Joseph Comprehensive Plan.
F. Special Districts such as open space and waterfront recreation Districts are intended to encourage the preservation, protection and appropriate Use of environmentally unique or sensitive areas and to encourage and facilitate a limited number of recreationally oriented or related uses that are compatible with the Citys waterfront areas.

SECTION 4.6 DEFINITIONS OF USE CLASSES AND AUTHORIZED USES
4.6.1 Definitions of Use Classes:
A. Use classes arrange land uses and activities into Use categories based on common functional, product or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. The categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning Districts.
B. When all Principal Uses of a development fall within one Use category, the entire development is assigned to that Use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, delicatessen and bakery, for example, would be classified in the Food and Drink Service Establishments category, because all of the development's Principal Uses are in that category. When the Principal Uses of a development fall within different Use categories, each Principal Use is classified in the applicable category and each Use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category. A mail order facility may simply be a call center or it may have warehouse or storage facilities on site. The Zoning Administrator shall classify the facility into the proper zoning District based on the characteristics of the use.
C. Accessory Uses are permitted in conjunction with a Principal Use subject to any special regulations applicable to it, and to the regulations applicable to the Principal Use if there are no special regulations. See also Article III for additional Accessory Use regulations.
D. The list of examples of Authorized Uses on Table 4-1, Section 4.6.3, lists common examples of uses included in the respective Use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific Use may call itself. For example, a Use that calls itself "Wholesale Warehouse" but that sells mostly to consumers, is included in the General Retail Establishments category rather than the Wholesale Trade Establishments category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the General Retail Establishments category.
E. Many uncategorized uses are Special Uses for which particular standards are provided in Article XI. Others are basic uses allowed by right. Some uses are listed in more than one category (e.g. drugstores as convenience retail and also as medical service establishments).
F. The Limited Neighborhood Business class is a unique Use Class intended to recognize the circumstances peculiar to a number of Nonconforming Uses. A Use which, on a particular Lot at a particular time, meets the definition of a Limited Neighborhood Business shall be considered to belong to the Limited Neighborhood Business Use Class rather than to its Ordinary Use Class. For example, a coffee shop would ordinarily be considered a Food and Drink Service Establishment; if that coffee shop were located in a residential district or proposed to be located in a residential district and otherwise meets the definition of a Limited Neighborhood Business, it would instead be considered a Limited Neighborhood Business. If the Lot should be rezoned to a nonresidential District, the Use would no longer be considered a Limited Neighborhood Business but would be considered a Food and Drink Service Establishment and would be a Conforming Use or Nonconforming Use depending on the Authorized Uses of the new zoning District.

4.6.2 Similar Use Interpretations:
A. The following considerations are examples of the factors that may be evaluated by the Zoning Administrator in making similar Use interpretations (see also Section 15.4.8 on an appeal):
1. The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each Use category.
2. The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity.
3. Relative amounts of sales from each activity.
4. The customer type for each activity (retail or wholesale).
5. The relative number of employees in each activity.
6. Hours of operation.
7. Building and site arrangement.
8. Vehicles used with the activity.
9. The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use.
10. How the Use advertises itself.
11. Any other relevant considerations.
B. The Zoning Administrator shall keep a log of all Use interpretations indicating the use, the options considered and the selection made, along with the reasons for that decision.

SECTION 9.4 DH-OD DOWNTOWN HEIGHT OVERLAY DISTRICT
9.4.1 Intent: The Downtown Height Overlay District (DH-OD) is an overlay District intended to preserve the character of the traditional downtown shopping district, which is found to be a valuable public resource of the community, while also acknowledging that in limited instances the benefits to the community of allowing varying Building Heights may justify varying from the normal standards. The DH-OD includes all lands in any zoning District in the area bounded by Main Street on the east, Port Street on the north, Lake Boulevard on the west, and Market Street on the south.
A. The character of the downtown shopping district is recognized to be a valuable asset to the citizens of the City and the State. The DH-OD is created for reasons including, but not limited to, the following: to provide specific regulations which shall further the
Article IX

Amendments through November 5, 2012 (effective November 15, 2012).
9-3
maintenance of safe and healthful conditions, prevent and control visual pollution, and reasonably limit the impact of inappropriate development on a valuable community cultural and economic resource while recognizing that in some circumstances it is possible to vary from the normal standards for the betterment of the community.
B. It is recognized that the character of the downtown shopping district is a community resource composed of many privately and publicly owned elements, and which is greater than the sum of its individual components, and which affects the viability of the community as a whole as well as the well being of individual property owners, and thus must be regulated in a manner that reasonably balances the uses afforded to private property owners with the rights of the general public and the community.
9.4.2 Structure Development: The installation, construction and operation of
Structures within the DH-OD shall be regulated so as to preserve the character of the traditional downtown shopping district, enhance the economic value of properties, and minimize the negative impact associated with degradation of public sight lines, as follows:
A. A Building in the DH-OD Overlay District and fronting on State Street, Broad Street, Pleasant Street, or Ship Street must be built to the Front Lot Line for at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the Lot Width and must have at least two Stories along that Front Lot Line.
B. A Building in the DH-OD Overlay District may exceed a Building Height of 55 only in the following circumstances:
1. The Building must be approved through the Special Use Permit procedure, as described in Article XI, unless otherwise approved as a Planned Unit Development as described in Article XIII, a Variance as described in Article XV, or a Nonconformity as described in Article XXI.
2. To be approved through the Special Use Permit Procedure, in addition to the standards described in Article XI, the applicant must demonstrate that the proposal, if approved, would result in benefits to the traditional downtown shopping district and to the community as a whole that outweigh any substantial negative impact upon the character of the downtown shopping district.
C. To the extent of any conflict between the regulatory provisions contained in this section and other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, the restrictions contained in this section shall control.
D. In the event the City Commission, Planning Commission, or Zoning Board of Appeals should consider approving or recommending approval of a Special Use Permit, Planned Unit Development, Variance, or any other request to construct a Structure in this DH-OD with a Building Height in excess of 55, in addition to the standards otherwise applicable to the particular request involved, that body must also affirmatively find that any substantial negative impact upon the character of the downtown shopping district potentially resulting from the approval of the request will be outweighed by other benefits to the community of the proposed Structure.
E. All projects or Structures for which final zoning approvals were granted by the City prior to the effective date of this Section shall be exempt from application of this section, conditioned upon the owners or developers full compliance with all of the original conditions of approval.

SECTION 9.5 LB-OD LAKE BLUFF SCENIC VIEW PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT
9.5.1 Intent: The Lake Bluff Scenic View Protection Overlay District (LB-OD) is an overlay District intended to limit the environmental and aesthetic degradation associated with destroying public sight lines, which are found to be a valuable public resource of the community. The LB-OD includes all lands in any zoning District generally northwesterly of the Lake Bluff Park, between the St. Joseph River to the north and Elm Street to the south. See Map 9-1.
A. The public sight lines from Lake Bluff Park toward the Lake Michigan Shoreline are recognized to be a valuable asset to the citizens of the City and the State. The LB-OD is created for reasons including, but not limited to, the following: to provide specific regulations which shall further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions, prevent and control visual pollution, reasonably limit the impact of development on a valuable natural resource, provide for access of light and air for adjacent properties by controlling overall height of Structures within the LB-OD, and controlling development so as to preserve the economic and environmental value of beach areas;
B. It is recognized that the public sight lines of the City are a shared resource of relatively fixed supply, and thus must be regulated in a manner that reasonably balances the Use afforded to private property owners with the rights of the general public;
C. It is the intent of this section to comply with the provisions and requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program, as constituted in accord with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, and subsequent enactment in the rules and regulations promulgated in furtherance of this program by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, as amended, and all relevant state regulatory provisions.
9.5.2 Structure Development: The installation, construction and operation of Structures within the LB-OD shall be regulated so as to protect natural beauty, enhance the economic value of properties, and minimize the negative impact associated with degradation of public sight lines, as follows:
A. The highest point of any Structure in the LB-OD shall not exceed the elevations identified on a map designated as The Official Lake Bluff Scenic View Protection Overlay District Map of the City of St. Joseph. See Map 9-1. The Official Lake Bluff Scenic View Protection Overlay District Map shall be kept in the office of the Zoning Administrator, and shall be available to the public for review and inspection during all regular City Hall hours of business.
B. The Official Lake Bluff Scenic View Protection Overlay District Map shall include a rectangular grid overlay dividing the LB-OD into squares, with each square of that grid representing an area of land fifty feet (50) on each side. The grids north-south lines shall be parallel to the easterly line of the Right-Of-Way for Lake Street, and the grids east-west lines shall be parallel to the northerly line of the Right-Of-Way for Elm Street. The grid squares shall be identified from south to north by the letters A through X, and from east to west by the numbers 1 through 37; thus, the square in the southeasterly corner of the grid shall be identified as A-1, and the square in the northwesterly corner of the grid shall be identified as X-37. The grids fixed reference point is the northeasterly corner of the intersection of the rights-of-way for Elm Street and Lake Street, which point shall coincide with the southeast corner of grid square A-17. The highest point of any Structure within a grid square shall not exceed the

Amendments through November 5, 2012 (effective November 15, 2012).
9-5
elevation reference set forth in that grid square on the map. All such elevations shall be based upon and tied to North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD88).
C. For purposes of this section, highest point shall mean relevant elevation at the highest point of a Structure, inclusive of (but not limited to) all peaks, gables, hips, spires, chimneys and all other appurtenances of the Structure, of any kind or nature.
D. To the extent of any conflict between the regulatory provisions contained in this section and other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, the restrictions contained in this section shall control, except that if the maximum Building Height otherwise specified in the propertys zoning District would result in a lower highest point of a Structure than would be permitted under this section, then the maximum height specified in the zoning District shall control.
E. In the event the City Commission, Planning Commission, or Zoning Board of Appeals should consider approving or recommending approval of a Special Use Permit, Planned Unit Development, Variance, or any other request to construct a Structure in this LB-OD with a highest point exceeding the elevation designated in the map, in addition to the standards otherwise applicable to the particular request involved, that body must also affirmatively find that any substantial negative impact upon the public views resulting from approving the request will be outweighed by other benefits to the public of the proposed Structure.
F. All projects or Structures for which final zoning approvals were granted by the City prior to the effective date of this Ordinance shall be exempt from application of this section, conditioned upon the owners or developers full compliance with all of the original conditions of approval.

Where Federal Insurance Administration information is not available, the best available floodplain information shall be utilized.
B. Where a dispute involves an allegation that the boundary is incorrect as mapped and Federal Insurance Administration floodplain studies are being questioned, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall modify the boundary of the Areas of Special Flood Hazard or the floodway, only upon receipt of an official letter of map amendment issued by the Federal Insurance Administration.
C. All parties to a map dispute may submit technical evidence to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
9.6.8 General Standards for Flood Hazard Reduction:
A. No Building or Structure shall be erected, converted or substantially improved or placed, and no land filled or Structure used in an Area of Special Flood Hazard unless a Zoning Permit, or Variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals, is obtained, which approval shall not be granted until a permit from the Department of Environmental Quality has been obtained. Where a development permit cannot be issued prior to the issuance of a Zoning Permit, a letter from the issuing agency indicating intent to issue contingent only upon proof of zoning compliance shall be acceptable.
B. All public utilities and facilities shall be designed, constructed and located to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
C. The Zoning Administrator shall review development proposals to determine compliance with the standards in this Section.
D. Land shall not be divided in a manner creating Parcels or Lots which cannot be used in conformance with the requirements of this Section.
E. The flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated watercourse not subject to state or federal regulations designed to insure flood carrying capacity shall be maintained.

F. Available flood hazard data from federal, state or other sources shall be reasonably utilized in meeting the standards of this Section. Data furnished by the Federal Insurance Administration shall take precedence over data from other sources.
9.6.9 Areas of Special Flood Hazard Application Information: In addition to the information required with an application for a Zoning Permit, Special Use Permit, Variance, or any other type of development permission required under this Ordinance the following information shall be submitted as part of an application for permission to commence any type of development within an Area of Special Flood Hazard:
A. The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the floor, including Basement, of all Structures;
B. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development;
C. Proof of development permission from appropriate local, state, and federal agencies as required by Section 9.6.8.A above, including a floodplain permit, approval, or letter of no authority from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality;
D. Base flood elevation data where the proposed development is subject to Public Act 288 of 1967, the Land Division Act, or the land is greater than five acres in size; and
E. Additional information which may be reasonably necessary to determine compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
9.6.10 Disclaimer of Liability: The degree of flood protection required by this Ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based upon engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. Approval of the Use of land under this Article shall not be considered a guarantee or warranty of safety from flood damage. This Ordinance also does not imply that areas outside of the Areas of Special Flood Hazard will be free from flood damage. This Ordinance does not create liability on the part of the City of St. Joseph or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
SECTION 9.7 EB-OD EDGEWATER BEACH OVERLAY DISTRICT
9.7.1 Intent. The Edgewater Beach Overlay District (EB-OD) is an overlay District intended to preserve the character of the public trust land along the shore of Lake Michigan, which is found to be a valuable public resource of the community, to prevent damage to the public trust land and to prevent damage to private property.
Based on the record presented the City finds that during periods of low Lake Michigan water levels, sand accretion in this District tends to significantly enlarge the beach and to enlarge affected parcels in this District. This additional land area can be seen by property owners as permanent and attractive for development. The character of the public trust land along the Lake Michigan shoreline, as well as viewsheds along the shoreline from public parks included in and adjacent to this District, is compromised by development in immediate proximity to the public trust land.
Based on the record presented the City further finds that the beach and property area near the shoreline is subject to submergence and erosion during periods of higher Lake Michigan water levels and resulting from weather conditions. It has been demonstrated that current state and federal development standards for the Lake Michigan shoreline, such as the Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM) and the Base Flood Elevation, do not
Article IX
Special Districts
CITY OF ST. JOSEPH ZONING ORDINANCE
Amendments through November 5, 2012 (effective November 15, 2012).
9-16
ensure that property shoreward of those locations is protected from erosion, inundation, or damage during such periods of time and/or weather events. The OHWM is not intended to reflect these periods of peril, and the Base Flood Elevation is a still water elevation that does not take into account the effect of wave action. The City further understands that revised federal floodplain regulations are being developed to take into account additional environmental factors such as waves and to provide an improved standard of floodplain development protection, but implementation of these regulations will not likely occur for several years.
When erosion threatens a Structure legally built near the shoreline, a natural reaction for the owner is to attempt to construct a seawall or implement similar shore protection measures. Shore protection measures in this District would diminish significantly the character of the public trust land and pose an increased threat of erosion and damage to the public trust land as well as to adjacent private property.
The City has long experience with the detrimental effects of seawalls and shore protection structures constructed over a period of many years in response to erosion south of the St. Joseph River. These shore protection structures were and are necessary to protect previously developed areas of the City which are otherwise subject to regular and ongoing erosion. However, given the physical, environmental, and developmental characteristics of the EB-OD, including generally large lots which need not be developed near to the waters edge to be economically viable and that the area is generally benefitting from accretion rather than persistent erosion, the City believes that shore protection measures should not be necessary in this area and would be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare for reasons further identified and set forth in the City of St. Joseph, Michigan Coastal Engineering Study, dated August 17, 2012, a copy of which is on file with the City.
The City believes the most appropriate, effective and reasonable method to further the public interests of protecting natural resources; preserving the economic and environmental well-being of the community; to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the community; and the general preservation or enhancement of property values is to restrict the construction of structures so near to the waters edge as to be detrimental to the character of the public trust property and/or the vistas from neighboring public parks; and/or to be susceptible to damage resulting from inundation or erosion or to create an apparent future need for seawalls or other shore protection measures in order to protect these structures from damage resulting from inundation or erosion; and/or to be potentially built in a location that will render the structure nonconforming under the future federal floodplain protection regulations currently under development.
These regulations are intended to preserve the character of the public trust property along the shoreline, protect the vistas from neighboring public parks, and prevent the construction of structures and shore protection measures which would have deleterious effects on the public trust property as well as neighboring private property.
These regulations are also supported by the Comprehensive Plan, as the Future Land Use Map indicates lakefront property in this area should be used as open space and the supporting text indicates that open space areas should be maintained and encouraged along the shoreline.

9.7.3 Structure Development. For the reasons set forth in Subsection 9.7.1 and elsewhere in this Ordinance, the installation, construction and operation of Structures, which for the purpose of this section includes seawalls and shore protection measures, within the EB-OD shall be subject to the following:
A. No Structure shall be installed or constructed in the EB-OD. The following are not considered a Structure for purposes of this section only:
1. Public recreational equipment in public parks;
2. Open, unroofed walkways, including those constructed of pavers or similar objects;
3. Stairs and similar open, unroofed structures that are set on the surface of the ground and which are not attached to a Structure; and
4. Freestanding signs.
B. For the purposes of this section, shore protection measures does not include temporary fencing not more than four feet (4) in height and with openly spaced slats or weaves, placed seasonally between October 1 and May 1 to influence the accumulation of sand and/or snow and which does not prevent public passage across the public trust property.
C. In the event the provisions of the EB-OD prevents the development or use of a Lot existing on the effective date of this amendment for the purposes permitted in the Zoning District, or creates practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship for the use of such a Lot, the property owner may seek a Hardship Planned Unit Development under the terms of this Ordinance for lands within the EB-OD or a Hardship Planned Unit Development or Variance for lands adjacent to the EB-OD.
D. If any Lot within or partially within the EB-OD is divided or the subject of a boundary adjustment after the effective date of this amendment such that any resulting parcel is nonbuildable due to the regulations of this section, except for a boundary adjustment that has the effect of lessening a Nonconformity with respect to this section, it will be deemed a voluntary action of the property owner and will disqualify the resulting nonbuildable parcel from receiving a Variance or Hardship Planned Unit Development.
E. In the event the provisions of the EB-OD render Nonconforming any Structure which is existing or which is the subject of a valid building permit and under construction on the effective date of this amendment, this shall not be deemed a voluntary action of the property owner and will not disqualify the parcel from receiving a Hardship Planned Unit Development under the procedures described in this Ordinance for lands within the EB-OD or a Hardship Planned Unit Development or Variance if on lands adjacent to the EB-OD.
F. Variances shall not be permitted within the EB-OD.
G. To the extent of any conflict between the regulatory provisions contained in this section and other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, the restrictions contained in this section shall control.

SPECIAL AND CONDITIONAL USE REGULATIONS
SECTION 11.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to establish procedures and criteria that shall be applied in the determination of requests to establish special and Conditional Uses. Special and Conditional Uses are not essentially incompatible with uses permitted in a zoning District, but possess characteristics which require individual review and discretion in order to avoid incompatibility with the character of the surrounding area, public services and facilities, and adjacent uses of land. The criteria for decision and requirements set forth in this Article shall be in addition to those required elsewhere in this Ordinance which are applicable to the Use under consideration.
SECTION 11.2 TYPES OF USE REGULATIONS
A. Conditional Uses are allowed by right in a particular District, provided that the Use complies with the standards of this Article.
B. Special Uses may be permitted in a particular District, but only after review by the Planning Commission and issuance of a permit by the City Commission, in accordance with the standards set forth in this Ordinance.
SECTION 11.3 CONDITIONAL USES
Before establishing, expanding, or amending a Conditional Use, with the exception of terminating a Conditional Use, any Person shall obtain a Zoning Permit from the Zoning Administrator, using a form provided by the City. The Applicant shall provide sufficient information to allow the Zoning Administrator to determine whether the proposed Use complies with the requirements of this Ordinance. If the application is denied, the Zoning Administrator shall identify the reasons for that denial. In such a case, an aggrieved Applicant may either appeal the Zoning Administrators determination to the Zoning Board of Appeals, as described in Section 14.10, or may seek a Special Use Permit. If the Zoning Board of Appeals denies such an appeal, as an alternative to seeking Circuit Court review of the Zoning Board of Appeals decision as described in Section 15.4.19, the Applicant may seek a Special Use Permit.
SECTION 11.4 SPECIAL USE PERMIT APPLICATION PROCEDURES
Any Person must obtain a permit before establishing, expanding or amending a Special Use, with the exception of terminating the Special Use as described in Section 11.8.4. Any application for a combined Special Use Permit and Planned Unit Development shall not be subject to the requirements of Article XI, but shall instead be subject to the requirements of Article XIII.
11.4.1 Application: The Zoning Administrator shall, within a reasonable time, review each application for completeness. If incomplete, the application shall be returned to the Applicant, along with an explanation of the deficiencies. If complete, the application shall be scheduled for consideration in a public hearing at a Planning Commission meeting, which occurs no less than twenty-four (24) days after the date of that determination.

11.8.2 Permit Revocation: In the event the City Commission believes the holder of a Special Use Permit has failed to comply with one or more of the terms or conditions of the permit or of this Ordinance, the City Commission may schedule a hearing to consider the revocation of the permit. The permit holder shall be given reasonable notice of the hearing date, which shall in any event be not less than ten (10) business days form the date of the notice. The notice of hearing shall include a written statement of the reasons for the possible revocation. The permit holder shall be allowed to appear at the hearing and to present evidence pertinent to whether the permit should be revoked. If the City Commission decides to revoke the permit, the Use for which the permit was granted must cease within sixty (60) days of the hearing date. Failure to terminate the Use for which the permit was revoked within sixty (60) days is declared to be a Nuisance per se and a violation of this Ordinance.
11.8.3 Permit Transferability: A new Owner may continue to use the property for the purposes for which the Special Use Permit was granted as long as all conditions and terms of the permit are satisfied. Permit transfer is automatic, provided that within sixty (60) days of acquiring ownership the new Owner registers his intent to continue the Special Use with the Zoning Administrator on a form established for that purpose. The Zoning Administrator shall review with the new Owner all the applicable Ordinance requirements that apply to the property and any special conditions imposed upon the Special Use when the transfer form is submitted. A Special Use Permit may not be transferred from one property to another property.
11.8.4 Termination of a Special Use Permit if the Use Changes:
A. If there is a change in the Use of a property for which a Special Use Permit was issued, the Special Use shall automatically terminate and the property shall only be used for a Use permitted in the District in which the property is located. A Special Use Permit for a seasonal Use is also subject to termination, if the season passes in which the Special Use would normally occur and a different Use is in place instead.
B. In place of the above standards, the following standards shall apply to Short-term Rentals. A Special Use Permit for a Short-term Rental shall automatically terminate and the property shall only be used for a Use permitted in the District in which the property is located if one or more of the following occurs:
1. If there is a change in the Use of the property.
2. In the event that the rental unit permit required under Chapter 8, Article VI of the Code of Ordinances of the City of St. Joseph expires without being timely renewed, is not timely transferred to a new Owner, or is revoked.
3. In the event that the property for which the Special Use Permit was issued is not actually used as a Short-term Rental at least once in each twenty-four month period.
11.8.5 Recording with Register of Deeds: A Special Use Permit, or expiration, revocation or termination thereof, shall be recorded by the City with the Berrien County Register of Deeds.
11.8.6 Amendment and Extension: A Special Use Permit approved by the City Commission under this Ordinance may be amended only through the filing and approval of a new application under this Article, except that a time extension may be requested from and granted by the City Commission as described under Section 14.13.2.

SECTION 11.9 REAPPLICATION
A. No application for a Special Use Permit which has been denied, wholly or in part, shall be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of the denial, except on satisfactory proof of substantially changed conditions, newly discovered evidence, or a falsehood previously relied upon by the City which, through the exercise of normal diligence, could not have been discovered before the hearing, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
B. The following circumstances are exceptions to the one (1) year time limit in A, above:

In the event that an application for a Special Use Permit receives a tied vote from the Planning Commission and is therefore recommended for neither approval nor disapproval, or if the application is recommended for disapproval but it would be mathematically possible by addition of votes from members who were absent from that meeting to have resulted in a recommendation of approval, the application may be withdrawn before the City Commission acts upon it and a reapplication may be submitted.
2. In the event that an application for a Special Use Permit receives a tied vote from the City Commission, and therefore is not approved, or if the application is denied but it would be mathematically possible by addition of votes from Commissioners who were absent from that meeting to have resulted in approval, a reapplication may be submitted at any time.

C. Amenities and appurtenances not specified in Sections 12.3 and/or 12.4 of this Ordinance, such as benches, drinking fountains, planters, bicycle racks, and internal directional signage, may be added, removed or altered by the Applicant so long as this does not cause a violation of this Ordinance or other applicable laws or regulations. Such alterations do not constitute a change to the site plan requiring zoning approval.
D. This Section applies to all applications, whether for Permitted Uses, Conditional Uses, Special Uses, Planned Unit Developments, Hardship Planned Unit Developments, or Variances.
E. Examples:
1. An Applicant provides renderings of a proposed Building, including but not limited to exterior finishes, colors, window size and placement. Section 12.3.E requires the shape, size and height of all Buildings but does not require an elevation. The application is approved as a Permitted Use The Applicant may not change the shape, size or height of the Building except as otherwise described in this ordinance but may alter the exterior finish, color, window size and placement, and add or alter signage as allowed under the sign ordinance.
2. Similar to example 1, except the application is for a Planned Unit Development. As a condition of approval, the City Commission finds that the Building must have a brick exterior in order to be harmonious with the character of adjacent property and to maintain the essential character of the surrounding area, which are among the standards which must be satisfied to approve the application. The applicant must maintain a brick exterior in keeping with the condition of approval but may alter other aspects of the building exterior.
3. Using example 2 above, site plan approved for the Planned Unit Development shows site amenities such as benches, drinking fountains, and a bicycle rack as well as interior directional signage. The Applicant wishes to remove one bench, change the design of the drinking fountain, move the bicycle rack to another location on the site, and construct a small storage building. Constructing a storage building requires a site plan amendment and the Applicant must follow this process. The Applicant may make the other changes so long as these individual changes do not violate the Zoning Ordinance or other applicable laws or regulations.
SECTION 12.8 SITE PLAN AMENDMENT
A. The holder of an approved site plan shall notify the Zoning Administrator of any proposed change to the site plan.
B. Proposed site plan changes associated with a Permitted Use, Conditional Use, Nonconforming Use, or property that is the subject of a Variance shall be reviewed and processed by staff as described in this Article and other relevant provisions of this Ordinance.
C.

D. A site plan adjustment must be a minor change(s) which meets the standards of the zoning ordinance and other applicable ordinances and regulations; is in keeping with the basic concept of the approved site plan; and does not violate any specific conditions included as part of the original approval. Examples of potential site plan adjustments include but are not limited to:
1. changes to building design that do not increase the overall area or height of the structure or the number of dwelling units, if part of the original approval;
2. addition, deletion or adjustment of signage if allowed by the sign ordinance;
3. addition, deletion or adjustment of lighting, fencing and/or screening, and trash or dumpster locations;

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
SECTION 13.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to permit innovation and variety in land use, design, and layout of property in order to achieve economy and efficiency in the Use of land, natural resources, energy and the provision of public services and utilities; encourage useful open space, and provide opportunities particularly suited to the needs of the residents of the City of St. Joseph, provided such opportunities do not unreasonably create adverse economic, social or environmental impacts on surrounding land uses.
The use, area, height, bulk and placement regulations of this Ordinance are primarily applicable to the usual situation of one principal Building on a Lot. In certain developments, including but not limited to condominium, townhouse, and Apartment developments, these regulations might require design and land Use arrangements with multiple Buildings on a Lot and a design less in the interest of public health, safety and welfare than if a controlled degree of flexibility in the regulation of land development were allowed. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) is intended to permit and control the development of preplanned areas for various compatible uses. It is a discretionary review and approval procedure that results in an approved development if all standards of this Article are met and denial if they are not. The zoning District does not change if a PUD is approved, but like a Special Use, an approved PUD has all the rights and privileges of an approved Use by right as long as all conditions attached to the approval are satisfied and the approved Use continues.
A PUD shall afford each type of land use within the PUD reasonable protection from encroachment or interference by other incompatible land uses, and provide reasonable protection to uses adjacent to a PUD.
As a PUD permit is required for most Uses in the W Water Recreation District in order to ensure compatibility among a wide range of possible Uses, as befits the special nature of that District, and as the General Standards of Section 13.6.1 suffice to ensure the necessary compatibility, the Applicant need not demonstrate that approval of a proposed PUD in the W Waterfront District would advance one or more of the objectives listed in Section 13.2.
A PUD permit is required for Medical Service Establishments, Large, and Social Institution Uses in R1, R2, R3. This allows changes to existing sites on which these Uses are operating and similar new Uses, ensuring compatibility of these Uses within the District while enabling the community to benefit from the services provided under such Use classes so long as one or more of the objectives of Section 13.2 are advanced and the Eligibility Requirements of Section 13.3.2 B are met.
SECTION 13.2 OBJECTIVES
For a proposed PUD located in a District other than the W Water Recreation District, the Applicant shall demonstrate that approval of the PUD would result in a recognizable and substantial benefit to the community that could not be achieved under the normal regulations of the District, in one or more of the following areas:
Article XIII
Planned Unit Development Regulations

B. To encourage the provision of open space and the development of recreational and other common facilities in a generally central location within reasonable distance of all living units. Developments having water frontage should be so designed to preserve public vistas where possible.
C. The long-term protection and/or preservation of natural resources and natural features and/or historical and/or architectural features of a significant quantity and/or quality in need of protection or preservation on a local, state and/or national basis.
D. Reducing to a significant extent the Nonconformity of a Nonconforming Use, Building or Structure, i.e., modification of a Nonconforming Use or Structure so that, to a significant extent, it is rendered more conforming, or less offensive, to the zoning District in which it is situated.
E. The provision of additional amenities which would not otherwise be provided in a conventional development, including but not limited to more usable open space.
F. To promote the efficient Use of land to facilitate a more economic arrangement of Buildings, circulation systems, land uses, and utilities.
G. To combine and coordinate architectural styles, Building forms, and Building relationships within the PUD.
SECTION 13.3 GENERAL
13.3.1 Minimum Requirements:
A. PUDs are permitted in all Districts.
B. A PUD must be primarily composed of Authorized Uses and Uses designated in Section 4.6.3, Section 4.6.6, or Section 4.6.5 as PUD for the District in which the proposed PUD would be located. Any other Uses included in a PUD must be clearly incidental to and in support of these Authorized Uses and PUD Uses.
C. The dimensions of Lots, Structures, height, Yard, Setback and Lot Coverage requirements, as established in the District, may be modified by an approved PUD permit.
D. A PUD including a residential Use and located in a residential District may not exceed the number of Dwelling Units otherwise allowed for that Parcel in that District, considering all District regulations such as Setbacks, minimum Dwelling Unit sizes, and required access to Streets, by more than twenty percent (20%). A PUD including a residential Use and located in a District other than a residential District may not exceed the number of Dwelling Units permitted for that Parcel, if that parcel were located in an R3 District, considering all R3 District regulations such as Setbacks, minimum Dwelling Unit sizes, and required access to Streets, by more than twenty percent (20%).
E. In the case of a mixed-use PUD which includes a Permitted Use in the zoning District, a Building devoted primarily to such a Use must be built before or concurrently with any Building devoted primarily to any other Use. If there is no Building devoted primarily to a Permitted Use, a Building including a Permitted Use must be built before or concurrently with any Building that does not include such a Use.
F. For a PUD located in a District other than the W Water Recreation District, not less than twenty percent (20%) of the area of a PUD must be undeveloped open space. Required yards, landscaping, rights-of-way and other similar features otherwise

Noncontiguous Parcels may be considered where other benefits to the public are sufficiently great to warrant such consideration in the opinion of the City Commission as provided in MCL 15.584b.
B. Other Districts. No PUD located in a District other than the W Water Recreation District shall be approved unless the Applicant demonstrates, through written submittal that the land Use and development substantially advances objectives described in Section 13.2,and meets the eligibility requirements and the standards set forth in this Ordinance, and in addition that:
1. The PUD shall result in a recognizable and substantial benefit to the ultimate users of the project and to the City of St. Joseph. Such benefit must otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved by development under a single zoning District taking into consideration the reasonably foreseeable detriments of the proposed development and use(s).
2. The PUD shall remain under the control or authority of a single individual, corporate or organizational Owner who is authorized to administer the PUD. Noncontiguous Parcels may be considered where other benefits to the public are sufficiently great to warrant such consideration in the opinion of the City Commission as provided in MCL 15.584b.

Commission decides to revoke the permit, the Use for which the permit was granted must cease within sixty (60) days of the hearing date. Failure to terminate the Use for which the permit was revoked within sixty (60) days is declared to be a Nuisance per se and a violation of this Ordinance.
13.7.3 Permit Transferability: A PUD permit may be transferred from one Owner of the property to which it is affixed to the next Owner of the same property. A PUD permit may not be transferred from one property to another property. A new Owner may continue to use the property for the purposes for which the PUD was granted as long as all conditions and terms of the permit are satisfied.

The site plan, as approved, shall be part of the PUD and may be altered only through the amendment procedure described above or through the adjustment procedure described in Section 12.8.
13.7.8 Scheduled Phasing: When proposed construction is to be phased, the project shall be designed in a manner that allows each phase to fully function on its own regarding services, utilities, circulation, facilities, and open space.

extension may be granted, following review of a formal request for extension by the developer and approval of same by the City Commission.
SECTION 13.8 REAPPLICATION
A. No application for a PUD which has been denied, wholly or in part, shall be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of the denial, except on satisfactory proof of substantially changed conditions, newly discovered evidence, or a falsehood previously relied upon by the City which, through the exercise of normal diligence, could not have been discovered before the hearing, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
B. The following circumstances are exceptions to the one (1) year time limit in A, above:
1. In the event that an application for a PUD receives a tied vote from the Planning Commission and is therefore recommended for neither approval nor disapproval, or if the application is recommended for disapproval but it would be mathematically possible by addition of votes from members who were absent from that meeting to have resulted in a recommendation of approval, the application may be withdrawn before the City Commission acts upon it and a reapplication may be submitted.
2. In the event that an application for a PUD receives a tied vote from the City Commission, and therefore is not approved, or if the application is denied but it would be mathematically possible by addition of votes from Commissioners who were absent from that meeting to have resulted in approval, a reapplication may be submitted at any time.
C. A reapplication shall be processed as a new application.
SECTION 13.9 HARDSHIP PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
13.9.1 Intent and Purpose: It is the intent of this section to provide a site specific administrative remedy to allow reasonable Use of property in those limited instances in which a property Owner demonstrates to the City Commission that (1) the Applicants property cannot be used for the purposes permitted in the zoning District, (2) the plight is due to the unique circumstances peculiar to the property and not to the general neighborhood conditions, (3) the proposed development and Use would not alter the essential character of the area, and (4) the Applicants problem has not been self-created.
If and when a property Owner meets such four-part threshold burden of proof, it is not intended that any Use may then be approved. Rather, this section is intended to authorize administrative relief to the minimum extent necessary to allow reasonable Use of property on the particular site, which is compatible to the extent possible with the uses of adjacent properties.
In order to satisfy the finality requirement dictated by the Michigan Supreme Court in Paragon Properties Company v. City of Novi, 452 Mich 568 (1996), a property Owner shall not be required to seek Variance relief at the Zoning Board of Appeals if relief is sought and denied under this Section.

In any case where a permit is denied, the reasons shall be stated in writing to the Applicant.
G. Relation to Nonconforming Uses: It shall not be necessary for an Owner of a legal Nonconforming Structure or use, existing on the effective date of this Ordinance to obtain a Zoning Permit in order to maintain its legal, nonconforming status. However, no Nonconforming Building, Structure, or Use shall be enlarged, expanded, or extended until a Zoning Permit pursuant to Article XXI has been issued by the Zoning Administrator.

other entities. Such fees may also include but are not limited to all costs associated with conducting public hearings or inspections, including public notices, postage, photocopying, staff time, Planning Commission, City Commission and/or Zoning Board of Appeals time, mileage and any costs associated with reviews by qualified professional planners, attorneys, and/or engineers or other experts hired by the City.
B. A fee is required for any application for approval of a Site Plan, Special Use, Planned Unit Development, Variance, or other Use or activity requiring a permit under this Ordinance, except for projects proposed by the City of St. Joseph or one of its agencies, or by any other public agency if the fee is waived by the City Planning Commission. An escrow fee may be requested for any project which may, in the discretion of the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission create an identifiable and potentially negative impact on public infrastructure or services, or on adjacent properties and because of which, professional input is desired before a decision to approve, deny or approve with conditions is made.
C. The escrow shall be used to pay professional review expenses of engineers, community planners, and any other professionals whose expertise the City values to review the proposed application and/or Site Plan of an Applicant. Professional review shall result in a report to the City indicating the extent of conformance or nonconformance with this Ordinance and to identify any problems which may create a threat to public health, safety or the general welfare. Mitigation measures or alterations to a proposed design may be identified where they would serve to lessen or eliminate identified impacts. The Applicant will receive a copy of any professional review hired by the City and a copy of the statement of expenses for the professional services rendered.
D. No application for approval for which an escrow fee is requested will be processed until the escrow fee is deposited with the City Treasurer. The amount of the escrow fee shall be established based on an estimate of the cost of the services to be rendered by the professionals contacted by the Zoning Administrator. The Applicant is entitled to a refund of any unused escrow fees at the time a permit is either issued or denied in response to the Applicant's request.
E. If actual professional review costs exceed the amount of an escrow, the Applicant shall pay the balance due prior to receipt of any Zoning Permit or other permit issued by a representative of the City in response to the Applicant's request. Failure of the Applicant to make timely payment of any balance due will entitle the City to place a lien on the subject property.

If appropriate, based on the type of performance guarantee submitted, the City shall deposit the funds in an interest bearing account in a financial institution with which the City regularly conducts business.
C. Amount: The amount of the performance guarantee or bond should be sufficient to cover the estimated cost of the Improvements or conditions. Additional guidelines for establishing the amount of a performance guarantee or bond may be prescribed by resolution of the City Commission. If none are specified or applicable to the particular Use or development, the City Commission shall by resolution establish a guideline which it deems adequate to deal with the particular problem while ensuring the protection of the City and its inhabitants.
14.8.3 Return of Performance Guarantee or Bond: The Zoning Administrator, upon the written request of the obligor, and pursuant to the procedure in the next subsection, shall rebate portions of the performance guarantee upon determination that the Improvements for which the rebate has been requested have been satisfactorily completed.

14.8.4 Withholding and Partial Withholding of Performance Bond: As required Improvements are completed, or when all of the required Improvements have been completed, the obligor shall send written notice to the Zoning Administrator of completion of said Improvements. Thereupon, the Zoning Administrator shall inspect all of the Improvements and shall transmit recommendation to the City Commission indicating either approval, partial approval, or rejection of the Improvements or conditions with a statement of the reasons for any rejections. If partial approval is indicated, the cost of the improvement or condition rejected shall be set forth.
A. The City Commission shall either approve, partially approve or reject the Improvements or conditions with the recommendation of the Zoning Administrator's written statement and shall notify the obligor in writing of the action of the City Commission within 30 days after receipt of the notice from the obligor of the completion of the Improvements. Where partial approval is granted, the obligor shall be released from liability pursuant to relevant portions of the performance guarantee or bond, except for that portion adequately sufficient to secure provision of the Improvements not yet approved.
B. Should installation of Improvements begin and fail to meet full completion based on the approved Site Plan, or if the project area is reduced in size and Improvements are only partially completed or conditions only partially met, the City may complete the necessary Improvements or conditions itself or by contract to an independent developer, and assess all costs of completing the Improvements or conditions against the performance guarantee or bond.

E. The condition or situation of the specific piece of property or of the intended Use of said property, for which the Variance is sought, is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for the condition or situation.
F. The condition or situation for which the Variance is sought shall not be the result of actions of the property Owner.
G. Strict compliance with area, Setbacks, Frontage, height, bulk or density requirements would unreasonably prevent the Owner from using the property for a permitted purpose, or would render conformity unnecessarily burdensome.
H. The Variance requested is the minimum change necessary to mitigate the hardship.
I. The Variance will relate only to the property that is the subject of the application.
15.4.11 Use Variances: Use Variances shall not be permitted in any zoning District within the City. An alternative procedure may be available in some circumstances; see Section 13.9 for the Hardship Planned Unit Development procedure and requirements.
15.4.12 Special Exceptions: In the event that the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality acknowledges a special exception is warranted in a designated Area of Special Flood Hazard, high risk erosion area or sand dune area, the Board shall have the power to grant a special exception pursuant to applicable standards in state law.

Article XVIII
OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
SECTION 18.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to prescribe provisions, criteria and standards for off-street parking and loading areas. The City recognizes that inadequate off-street parking and loading areas may lead to traffic congestion and loss of economic opportunities, as well as unauthorized parking in adjacent Lots and on nearby Streets. Excessive parking and loading areas are an inefficient Use of resources, and increase the potential for drainage problems. This Article seeks to balance the public and the private needs for off-street parking and loading areas.
SECTION 18.2 PARKING REQUIREMENTS
18.2.1 Intent: Parking Spaces shall be provided and adequately maintained by each property Owner in every zoning District for the off-street storage of motor vehicles for the Use of occupants, employees and patrons of each Building and premise constructed, altered or enlarged under the provisions of this Ordinance, except as otherwise provided by this Ordinance.
18.2.2 General Provisions:
A. Whenever a Use requiring off-street parking is increased in floor area, or when interior Building modifications or a change in Use result in an increase in the required parking under this Ordinance, additional parking shall be provided and maintained as required by this Ordinance.
B. No parking area or parking space or loading area which exists at the time this amendment becomes effective or which later is provided for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Ordinance shall thereafter be relinquished or reduced in any manner below the requirements established by this Ordinance unless and until equal or better parking facilities meeting the requirements of this Ordinance are approved and provided.
C. Required parking areas shall be used only for the parking of vehicles.
18.2.3 Right-of-Way: The Right-Of-Way of any public Street shall not be used for off-Street parking or loading without the written permission of the appropriate authority. No parking space located within or along the traveled portion of any Street shall be counted toward the off-Street parking requirements set forth in this Ordinance.
18.2.4 Limited Neighborhood Businesses; Businesses with Parking Nonconformities: For Limited Neighborhood Businesses, the following special procedures shall be used:
A. If the proposed Successor Use requires no greater number of parking and/or loading spaces than would be required for the Predecessor Use, as determined at the time of application, no additional parking need be provided regardless of the actual number of parking and/or loading spaces provided on the Lot.
B. If the proposed Successor Use requires a greater number of parking and/or loading spaces than would be required for the Predecessor Use, as determined at the time of application, only the additional number of parking and/or loading
Article XVIII
Off-Street Parking and Loading
CITY OF ST. JOSEPH ZONING ORDINANCE
Approved January 12, 2015 (effective January 22, 2015).
18-2
spaces need be provided regardless of the actual number of parking and/or loading spaces provided on the lot.
C. Any additional spaces provided must meet the requirements of this Ordinance, including the site development and buffering standards of Articles XVIII and XIX.
For example, if the Predecessor Use is an office with 1,200 square feet of usable floor area, which would require 6 parking spaces under the current Ordinance, for the purposes of zoning approvals considered for the Limited Neighborhood Business Use Class, the proposed Successor Use may consider the Lot to provide 6 parking spaces regardless of the number of parking spaces actually provided.
18.2.5 Joint Use of Parking Areas: The joint use of parking areas by two or more Uses may be approved by the Zoning Administrator whenever such joint use is practical and satisfactory to each of the Uses intended to be served, and when all requirements for location, design, and construction are met.
A. Computing Capacities: In computing capacities of any joint parking area, the total parking space requirement is the sum of the greatest number of Parking Spaces required for the individual uses that will occur at the same time. If the maximum space requirements for individual uses occur at distinctly different times, the total number of off-street Parking Spaces required for joint use may be reduced by the Zoning Administrator.
B. Record of Agreement: A copy of an agreement between all joint users and the City shall be filed with and must be approved by the Zoning Administrator, and recorded with the Register of Deeds of Berrien County prior to the issuance of the Zoning Permit. The agreement shall include provisions for the continued long-term Use and maintenance of the parking area as well as the allocation of Parking Spaces to each use.
18.2.6 Measurements and Calculations:
A. Definition of Usable Floor Area: The gross floor area used or intended to be used for services to the public, including those areas occupied by fixtures and equipment used for display or sale of merchandise, but excluding floor areas which are used exclusively for storage, housing of mechanical equipment integral with the Building, maintenance facilities, or other areas where customers, patients, clients, visiting salespeople, and the general public are denied access. Floor area, whether usable or gross, shall be measured from the exterior faces of exterior walls, except in a case where an interior Building wall separates two uses or users. In such a case, the floor area shall be measured from the inside face of such an inside wall.
B. Fractional Space: When a calculation determining the number of required Parking Spaces results in a fractional space, any fraction to and including one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and fractions over one-half (1/2) shall require one (1) parking space.
C. Employees: Requirements for parking stated in terms of employees shall be based upon the maximum number of employees likely to be on the premises during the largest shift.
D. Seating Capacity: When benches, pews or other similar seating is used, each 18 inches of that seating shall be counted as one seat, unless Table 18-1 specifies otherwise.

18.2.7 Parking Space Requirements:
A. Dimensional Requirements.
1. General. Parking Spaces shall meet the following dimensional standards, as shown in Figure 18-1:
a. Parking Spaces oriented parallel to, or at an angle of less than thirty (30) degrees from, the direction of travel of the maneuvering lane serving such Parking Spaces shall be not less than ten feet (10') wide and twenty feet (20') long.
b. Parking Spaces oriented at an angle of thirty (30) degrees to ninety (90) degrees from the direction of travel of the maneuvering lane serving such Parking Spaces, or which can be accessed without lateral maneuvering (such as parking at the end of a driveway) shall be not less than nine feet (9') wide and eighteen feet (18') long.
2. Exceptions. The above dimensional standards are amended as follows:
a. A Parking Space, except a Parking Space associated with a Dwelling Unit, placed such that a wall, column, or similar object would interfere with opening a parked vehicles side doors, shall be increased in width by one foot (1') if one side is so obstructed and by two feet (2') if both sides are so obstructed.
b. Parking Spaces associated with Dwelling Units, and not more than ten per cent (10%) of the number of Parking Spaces required under this Ordinance for a nonresidential parking area may be designated compact car spaces and may reduce the length of the stall by two feet (2) and the width of the stall by one foot (1) from the above standards. Any compact car Parking Space, or group of Parking Spaces, not associated with Dwelling Units must be designated by signage indicating compact cars only.
3. ADA Parking. Accessible Parking Spaces which satisfy the dimensional requirements of the current version of the Michigan Building Code, including the provision of access aisles or passenger loading areas, are exempt from the above standards.
B. Plans and specifications showing the number of required off-street Parking Spaces for every use, as listed on Table 18-1, shall be provided and approved prior to the issuance of a zoning or Building permit. If there is more than one Principal Use on a Lot, then the combined parking requirements for each of the Authorized Uses must be met unless there is an approved joint use agreement as set forth above. If a Use is not listed, then the Zoning Administrator may apply the off-street parking standards for a similar use, or use a standard from the American Planning Associations current edition of the Parking Standards publication. Accessible Parking Spaces required under the Americans with Disabilities Act shall be counted toward the number of Parking Spaces required under this section. Loading and unloading spaces required under Section 18.3 shall not be counted toward the number of Parking Spaces required under this section.
C. Parking Standards Table. Table 18-1 presents the parking required for each Use based on the size and/or occupancy of each Use.

18.2.11 Special Parking Restrictions for Residential Districts:
A. Front Yards.
1. In R1 and R2 Districts, as well as for single-family and two-family dwellings in R3 Districts, no curb cut onto a public Street is permitted if access to an existing garage, Carport or parking area is available from a public Alley. If a garage, Carport, or parking area is newly constructed, even if replacing an existing garage, Carport, or parking area, and if the Lot abuts on a public Alley, the garage, Carport, or parking area must be accessible only from that Alley and no curb cut onto a Street is permitted. Otherwise, one (1) curb cut is permitted. If the Lot has Frontage in excess of eighty (80) feet, two (2) curb cuts are permitted if the Lot abuts on a local Street, but only one (1) if it abuts a minor or Major Thoroughfare. For Lots that front on more than one (1) Street, the number of permitted curb cuts is determined by the Lot Frontage on that Street with the least Frontage.
B. Driveways.
1. When a curb cut is permitted and constructed, a hard surface Driveway meeting the requirements of 18.4.2.E leading to the Carport, garage or parking area shall be constructed.
2. The portion of the Driveway located within the Street or Alley shall be constructed of concrete not less than six (6) inches thick for Residential Uses, or as approved by the City Engineer for Commercial or Industrial Uses. In cases where the Driveway crosses a public sidewalk, the portion of the sidewalk which also serves as a Driveway shall be constructed in keeping with this requirement.
3. Vehicle Parking Spaces required by Section 18.2.7 shall be behind the front Building Line of the Structure.
C. Vehicle Parking.
1. All vehicles parked in any Yard must be on a hard surface meeting the requirements of 18.4.2.E.
2. The outdoor parking of motor vehicles on Parcels in the R1, R2, and R3 Districts shall be limited to passenger vehicles and a single commercial vehicles built on a chassis which is rated one-and-one-half (1 ½) tons or less and not exceeding ten thousand (10,000) pounds in gross vehicle weight. All such vehicles shall be currently operable and registered and shall display a current license plate. These vehicles may be parked in the Front Yard for a period not to exceed twelve (12) hours in any calendar day, provided that this time limitation shall not apply if the vehicles are parked in front of the required Parking Spaces such as a garage or Carport or in front of the adjacent Side Yard.
3. The outdoor storage or parking of any airplane, boat, personal watercraft, float, raft, trailer, Recreational Vehicle and other equipment or vehicles of similar nature shall be prohibited for a period greater than forty-eight (48) hours in all residential Districts, except where expressly permitted under Chapter 17 of the St. Joseph Code of Ordinances or where expressly permitted by other provisions of this Ordinance, unless the following minimum conditions are met:
a. All such vehicles or equipment shall be placed within a completely enclosed Building or be located behind the rear face of the principal Building, but no closer than three (3) feet to any Side or Rear Lot Line.
b. Storage or parking shall be limited to a Lot or Parcel of land upon which is located an inhabited Dwelling Unit and the vehicle or equipment is owned by the occupant.
c. Mobile Homes and Recreational Vehicles or equipment intended or adaptable for sleeping purposes shall remain unoccupied and shall not be connected to

sanitary sewer facilities, or have a fixed connection to electricity, water or gas, except as otherwise permitted in this Ordinance.
18.2.12 Downtown Parking:
A. When Required. Public parking facilities are intended to serve the majority of Uses in the D Downtown District. Off-street parking must be provided only for the following Uses (and need not be provided for other Uses even when sharing the same Structure or Lot):
1. Definitions. For the purpose of this Section:
a. Building Structure. The exterior physical structure of an Existing Building as it existed on January 18, 2007.
b. Converted Dwelling Unit. A Dwelling Unit created or remodeled on or after January 18, 2007, entirely within the Building Structure of an Existing Building, except that balconies, decks, porches and/or garages may be outside the Building Structure.
c. Existing Building. A Building which first received a certificate of occupancy before January 18, 2007.
d. Existing Dwelling Unit. A Dwelling Unit which was located in an Existing Building before January 18, 2007.
2. Parking must be provided for all Uses in the Lodging/ Accommodations Use Class.
3. Parking must be provided for all Uses in Use Classes categorized as Residential & Related Uses in Table 4-2, Authorized Uses except as provided below.
4. Exemptions.
a. Converted Dwelling Units: Up to six (6) Converted Dwelling Units in an Existing Building are exempt from the above residential parking requirement; the number of exemptions may be reduced as described in subsection (c), below. Parking must be provided for any Converted Dwelling Units in the Building beyond the exempt number.
b. Existing Dwelling Units. All Existing Dwelling Units are exempt from the above residential parking requirement and even if modified may remain exempt from that parking requirement so long as they then qualify as Converted Dwelling Units.
c. Reduction of Exemption for Building Expansions: Any Dwelling Unit created by conversion, reconfiguration or expansion of an Existing Building which does not qualify as a Converted Dwelling Unit is ineligible to receive an exemption under subsection (a) or (b) and in addition reduces the subsection (a) exemption for the Building by one Dwelling Unit.
5. Examples.
a. A new building including both residential and commercial Uses is constructed after January 18, 2007. All residential Uses must include parking under 18.2.12.A.3; no parking is required for the commercial Uses under Section 18.2.12.A.
b. An Existing Building is converted to contain four Dwelling Units. One unit is entirely within the existing building, two units are entirely within the existing building but receive new external balconies, and one unit includes a newly constructed penthouse. Parking must be provided for the Dwelling Unit that includes the penthouse because the Dwelling Unit is not located entirely within the existing building and therefore is not a Converted Dwelling Unit; the
Article XVIII

CITY OF ST. JOSEPH ZONING ORDINANCE
Approved January 12, 2015 (effective January 22, 2015).
18-12
remaining three units are Converted Dwelling Units and exempt from providing parking under Section 18.2.12.A.4.a.
c. An Existing Building is converted to contain twelve Dwelling Units. Ten units qualify as Converted Dwelling Units but two units include a newly constructed penthouse and therefore do not qualify as Converted Dwelling Units. Typically six Converted Dwelling Units would be exempt from providing parking under Section 18.2.12.A.4.a but under Section 18.2.12.A.4.c the two penthouse units reduce this exemption by two, so the exemption is four units. Subtracting the exemption of four units from the total of twelve units built indicates that parking must be provided for eight Dwelling Units.
B. State Street Access Prohibited.
1. No curb cut or vehicular access shall be permitted onto State Street, in the area north of Elm Street and south of Ship Street.
SECTION 18.3 LOADING AND UNLOADING SPACE REQUIREMENTS
18.3.1 Loading Space Requirements: Plans and specifications showing the number of required off-street loading and unloading spaces for every use, including the means of ingress and egress and interior circulation, shall be provided and approved prior to the issuance of a zoning or Building permit.

One additional off-street loading space shall be required for Lots used for commercial or industrial purposes where the floor area of all Buildings actually used for such purposes exceeds one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet. If there is more than one Principal Use on a Lot, then the greater of the loading and unloading requirements for each of the Authorized Uses must be met. Each loading and unloading space required by this section shall not be less than twelve (12) feet in width, fifty (50) feet in length, and fourteen (14) feet in height. Accessible Parking Spaces required under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Parking Spaces required under Section 18.2 shall not be counted toward the number of loading and unloading spaces required under this section.
18.3.2 Access: Access to a loading and unloading space shall be so arranged to provide sufficient off-street maneuvering space as well as adequate ingress and egress to and from a Street or Alley.
18.3.3 Site Requirements: Off-street loading spaces and access drives shall be paved, drained, lighted, and shall have appropriate bumper or wheel guards where needed. Any light used for illumination shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining premises and Streets. Where any off-street loading space adjoins or abuts a Lot or premises used for residential, educational, recreational, or religious purposes, or abuts a residential District, there shall be provided a masonry wall or solid Fence not less than four (4) feet in height between the off-street loading space and said residential, educational, recreational, or religious premises or residential Zone.

NONCONFORMING USES
SECTION 21.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to provide for the regulation of legally Nonconforming Structures, Lots of record, and uses, and also to specify circumstances and conditions under which nonconformities shall be permitted to continue. The zoning regulations established by this Ordinance are designed to guide the future Use of land located in the City of St. Joseph by encouraging appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. The continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with these purposes; therefore, the gradual elimination of nonconformities is generally desirable. The regulations of this Article permit nonconformities to continue, but are intended to restrict further investments which would make them more permanent.
SECTION 21.2 RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE
SECTION 21.3 NONCONFORMITIES
Except as otherwise provided in this Article, any Nonconforming Lot, use, or Structure lawfully existing on the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful. All Nonconformities shall be encouraged to convert to conformity wherever possible and shall be required to convert to conforming status as required by this Article. A Nonconformity shall not be enlarged, expanded, or extended, including extension of hours of operation, unless the change is in compliance with all requirements of this Ordinance. Normal maintenance and incidental Repair of a Nonconformity shall be permitted, provided that this does not violate any other section of this Article.
A. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or Restoration to a safe condition of a Structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares the Structure to be unsafe and orders its Restoration to a safe condition, provided that the Restoration is not otherwise in violation of the various provisions of this Section prohibiting the Repair or Restoration of partially damaged or destroyed Structures.
B. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prevent the addition of required off-Street parking or loading spaces, so long as there is no expansion of the Nonconformity, and subject to the restrictions of Article XVIII Off-Street Parking and Loading.
C. A Nonconformity shall not be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on any other Lot unless the net effect of the change shall be to reduce the Nonconformity on the current Lot; and the entire relocated Structure and/or Use shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning District in which it is relocated. Any Nonconformity reduced or eliminated as a result of the move shall not be re-established in its nonconforming condition.
D. A Nonconformity shall not be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same Lot, unless the net effect of the change shall be to reduce the Nonconformity.
E. No Use, Structure, or sign which is accessory to a principal Nonconforming Use or Structure shall continue after the Principal Use or Structure has ceased or terminated, unless it shall thereafter conform to all regulations of this Ordinance.

21-2
F. The burden of establishing that any Nonconformity was legally established shall, in all cases, be upon the Owner of such Nonconformity and not upon the City of St. Joseph.
G. A Nonconforming Use shall not be changed to any Use other than a Use allowed in the zoning District in which it is located. For the purposes of this section, reducing the number of residential units on a Lot shall not be considered a change of Use. For example, a three-unit apartment is in the Multiple-family Dwellings Use Class and therefore is a Nonconformity in the R1 Single-family Residence zoning District. Eliminating one residential unit would change the structure to a duplex, which is in the Two-family Dwellings Use Class, which is also a Nonconformity in the R1 zoning District. This change would be allowed.
H. Nonconforming Structures shall not be re-established in their nonconforming conditions in any zoning District after damage, destruction or Demolition if the estimated expense of reconstruction exceeds fifty (50) percent of the appraised replacement cost of the Structure. For the purposes of this Section, damage or destruction does not include Dismantlement.
I. If a Nonconforming Use ceases for any reason for a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive months, such discontinuance shall be considered conclusive evidence of an intention to abandon the Nonconforming Use. At the end of the twelve (12) month period, the Nonconforming Use shall not be re-established and any future Use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
SECTION 21.4 EXCEPTIONS
The following exceptions to Section 21.3 apply:
A. A Nonconforming residential Use, Building or Structure in the C Commercial or CO Commercial Office zoning Districts is exempt from the provisions of Sections 21.3.H and 21.3.I.
B. Any Nonconforming Building or Structure in the OS Open Space District is exempt from the provisions of 21.3.H, unless the Structure is prohibited under Areas of Special Flood Hazard, high risk erosion area, sand dune area, or other state or federal laws or regulations.
C. A Limited Neighborhood Business shall be exempt from Section 21.3 with regard to the Nonconforming Use; it shall remain subject to Section 21.3 for the purpose of dimensional nonconformities.
D. A Nonconforming Building or Nonconforming Structure located in the DH-OD Downtown Height Overlay District and which is of such height that special approval under Section 9.4 of this Ordinance would be required to construct a new Building or Structure of that height in that location is partially exempt from Section 21.3.H with respect to that height in that it may be restored following damage or destruction; it may not be restored following Demolition. To benefit from the exemption under this Section, the Building or Structure must be restored to an exterior appearance and design as similar as possible to its previous configuration and shall not increase in height or volume as a result of restoration; this Section is intended only to preserve the appearance of existing Nonconformities in the DH-OD Overlay District and shall not be used to allow the substitution of a new, dissimilar Nonconformity.

A. Nonconforming Uses. Repairs, maintenance and replacement may be performed on any Building or Structure devoted in whole or in part to a Nonconforming Use, including Repair or replacement of roofs, doors, windows, interior and exterior walls, foundations, fixtures, wiring, plumbing and similar appurtenances and features. However, the dimensions or volume of the Building or Structure as it existed on the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment shall not be increased in any way. Except that a Building or Structure occupied by a Limited Neighborhood Business may be repaired, replaced, or expanded so long as no dimensional Nonconformity is created or increased. If the Building or Structure is itself Nonconforming, Section 21.7.B also applies.
B. Nonconforming Structures. Repairs and maintenance may be performed on any Nonconforming Building or Structure, including Repair or replacement of interior walls, roofs, doors, windows, fixtures, wiring or plumbing and similar appurtenances and features, or Repair of exterior walls and foundations. No dimensional Nonconformity shall be increased in any way. Portions of the Structure necessary to allow the reasonable use of the Structure, such as an exterior stairway or steps, may be removed and replaced in their previous location, or with such minor modifications as may be needed to meet current standards. The intention of this Section is to allow the maintenance and rehabilitation of existing Nonconforming Structures but not to allow the replacement of foundations and exterior walls in such a way as to effectively allow a new Structure to be constructed in a nonconforming location under the guise of rehabilitation.
SECTION 21.8 CHANGE OF TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP
There may be a change of tenancy, ownership, or management of any Nonconformity provided there is no change in the nature of character of the Nonconformity, unless such change is allowed under this Ordinance.
SECTION 21.9 ELIMINATION OF NONCONFORMITIES  USES, BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES
For the purpose of removing any Nonconforming Use, Building or Structure, the City Commission may acquire private property or an interest in private property by purchase, condemnation, or other means. The cost, expense, or a portion thereof may be paid from general funds or assessed to a special district in accordance with applicable statutory provisions and relevant provisions of the City Charter.

AMENDMENTS
SECTION 22.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to establish the procedures to amend the zoning text and/or Zoning Map of the City of St. Joseph when a change in circumstances or conditions or the need to correct an error warrant such an amendment and when the proposed change would be consistent with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan and the intent of this Ordinance.
SECTION 22.2 AMENDMENT PROCEDURE
22.2.1 Amendment Procedure: The Planning Commission, City Commission, an Owner of property in the City of St. Joseph, or any other interested Person may make a written request to the Planning Commission to initiate a Zoning Map change or text amendment to this Ordinance. The following procedures shall be followed:
A. An Applicant, other than the Planning Commission or City Commission, shall submit to the Zoning Administrator a formal application to amend the Zoning Ordinance on a form established for that purpose, along with the fee authorized under Section 14.7.1. The Zoning Administrator shall review the application form to ensure it is complete, and any incomplete application shall be returned to the Applicant along with the fee. Complete applications shall be transmitted to the Planning Commission. The application shall include the Applicants name and address, the desired change and the reasons for such change, and shall address all the factors in Section 22.3. If a zoning map change is proposed, the application shall also include the Applicants legal interest in the property, if any; if the Applicant is not the Owner, the name and address of the Owner; and a description adequate to accurately identify the subject property.
B. The Planning Commission or City Commission may initiate the preparation of a proposed amendment.
C. A public hearing shall be scheduled and noticed pursuant to the requirements of Section 14.14.
D. The Planning Commission shall conduct the public hearing, noting all comments and reports received. Any interested party may appear and be heard at such hearing in person or by agent or attorney. The Planning Commission may adjourn the hearing in order to obtain additional information, to direct the Zoning Administrator to revise the proposal, or to cause service of such further notice as it deems proper. If an Applicant fails to appear at the hearing, in person or through an agent or attorney, the Board shall conduct the hearing and issue its decision based on the information available at the hearing. The Planning Commission shall use the factors in Section 22.3 when considering a proposed amendment.
E. The Planning Commission shall recommend that the City Commission approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed amendment. The concurring vote of a majority of the Planning Commission members present and qualified to vote shall be required to take any formal action.
F. After the hearing, the Planning Commission shall submit to the City Commission its recommendations on the proposed amendment, a summary of the comments received at the public hearing, and the proposed amendment.

G. The Planning Commission shall report in full its findings and recommendations for action on the proposal to the City Commission. That report shall be available for review for no less than ten (10) days before the City Commission acts upon the recommendation.
H. The City Commission may adopt or deny the proposed amendment with a concurring vote of a majority of its members present and qualified to vote, with or without any changes, recommendations, or conditions that have been previously considered by the Planning Commission.
I. If the City Commission wishes to consider additional changes, recommendations, or conditions not previously considered by the Planning Commission, it shall return the proposal to the Planning Commission for reconsideration, in accordance with the procedures set forth above. The City Commission shall indicate why it is returning the matter for reconsideration to the Planning Commission with clear direction as to what should be examined. Once the Planning Commission forwards its reconsideration, the City Commission may take any action it deems appropriate under the circumstances.
SECTION 22.3 FACTORS TO CONSIDER ON REZONINGS
In reviewing any application for an amendment, the Planning Commission shall evaluate all factors relevant to the application. The Planning Commission may solicit information from public agencies or from individuals or firms with relevant experience. The factors to be considered shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
A. What conditions related to the application have changed since the Zoning Ordinance was adopted which justify the proposed amendment?
B. What are the possible precedential effects which might result from the approval or denial of the application?
C. What is the potential impact of the proposal on the ability of the City and other governmental agencies to provide adequate public services and facilities, and/or programs that might reasonably be required in the future?
D. Does the proposed amendment adversely affect environmental conditions, the character of, or the likely value of property?
E. Does the proposed District change comply with the adopted City Comprehensive Plan? (If not, and if the proposed amendment is reasonable in light of all other relevant factors, then the Comprehensive Plan should be amended before the proposed zoning amendment is approved.)
F. If a specific property is involved, can the property in question be put to a reasonable economic Use in the zoning District in which it is presently located?
G. Is another procedure, such as a Variance, Special Use, Planned Unit Development, or hardship Planned Unit Development a more appropriate alternative than the proposed amendment?
SECTION 22.4 PUBLICATION AND EFFECTIVE DATE
The City Clerk shall publish a notice of adoption in a newspaper of general circulation in the City within seven (7) days after adoption of an Ordinance amendment. The notice shall include the following information:
A. Either a summary of the regulatory effect of the amendment including the geographic area affected, or the text of the amendment.
B. The effective date of the amended Ordinance, which shall be ten (10) days after adoption, unless otherwise specified in the amendment.

C. The place and time where a copy of the amended Ordinance may be purchased or inspected.
SECTION 22.5 OPTIONS UPON DENIAL OF AMENDMENT REQUEST
A property Owner whose proposed amendment is denied and who alleges that the denial of the amendment has the result of leaving the property Owner with no reasonable or economically viable Use of the property, must first request a Hardship PUD pursuant to the requirements of Article XIII before filing any action with the Circuit Court.
SECTION 22.6 RE-APPLICATION
A. No application for a proposed amendment which has been denied, wholly or in part, shall be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of the denial, except on satisfactory proof of substantially changed conditions, newly discovered evidence, or a falsehood previously relied upon by the City which, through the exercise of normal diligence, could not have been discovered before the hearing, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
B. The following circumstances are exceptions to the one (1) year time limit in A, above:
1. In the event that an application for a proposed amendment receives a tied vote from the Planning Commission and is therefore recommended for neither approval nor disapproval, or if the application is recommended for disapproval but it would be mathematically possible by addition of votes from members who were absent from that meeting to have resulted in a recommendation of approval, the application may be withdrawn before the City Commission acts upon it and a reapplication may be submitted.
2. In the event that an application for a proposed amendment receives a tied vote from the City Commission, and therefore is not approved, or if the application is denied but it would be mathematically possible by addition of votes from Commissioners who were absent from that meeting to have resulted in approval, a reapplication may be submitted at any time.
C. A reapplication shall be processed as a new application.
SECTION 22.7 PROTEST PETITION
An amendment to the zoning text or Zoning Map is subject to a protest petition as required by State law. The protest petition must be presented to the City Commission before the final approval of the amendment, and must be signed by 1) the owners of at least twenty (20) percent of the area of land included in the proposed change, or 2) owners of at least twenty (20) percent of the area of land included within an area extending outward one hundred (100) feet from any point on the boundary of the land included in the proposed change. Publicly owned land shall be excluded in calculating the twenty (20) percent land area requirement.
In the event a valid protest petition is presented, the amendment must be approved by not less than a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the City Commission.

TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS, VESTED RIGHTS, SEVERABILITY, REPEAL AND EFFECTIVE DATE
SECTION 25.1 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
25.1.1 Violations Continue: This Ordinance shall not impair or affect any act done, offense committed or right accruing, accrued, or acquired; or liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred prior to the time this Ordinance takes effect, but the same may be enjoyed, asserted, enforced, prosecuted or inflicted as fully and to the same extent as if this Ordinance had not been adopted. Such proceedings may be consummated under and according to the Ordinance in force at the time such proceedings are or were commenced. All prosecution, or other actions, pending at the effective date of this Ordinance and all prosecution, or other proceedings, instituted after the effective date of this Ordinance, or offenses or acts committed prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, may be continued or instituted under and in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance in force at the time of such offense. Any violation occurring under the previous Zoning Ordinance (the Citys Zoning Ordinance adopted on July 6, 1987 and repealed by Section 25.4 of this Ordinance) will continue to be a violation under this Ordinance and be subject to penalties and enforcement pursuant to Article XIV: Administration and Enforcement, unless the violation is brought into compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
25.1.2 Nonconformities Under Prior Ordinance: Any Nonconformity under the previous Zoning Ordinance (the Citys Zoning Ordinance adopted on July 6, 1987 and repealed by Section 25.4 of this Ordinance) which is not otherwise permitted under this Ordinance will also be a legal Nonconformity under this Ordinance.

previous Ordinance. Any re-application for an expired permit shall meet the standards in effect at the time of re-application.
25.1.6 Prior Construction Approval: The completion of construction and Use of a Nonconforming Building for which a Building permit has been issued and footings poured prior to the effective date of this Ordinance is allowed, provided that construction is commenced within ninety (90) days after the date of issuance of the permit; that construction is carried on diligently without interruption, as weather permits, for a continuous period; and that the entire Building shall have been completed according to the plans filed with the permit application within two (2) years after the issuance of the Building permit. To avoid unnecessary hardship, nothing in this Article shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated Use of any Building on which construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Article, and upon which actual construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner, except where demolition or removal of an existing Building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding. The demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the Building involved.

SECTION 25.3 SEVERABILITY
This Ordinance and its various parts, Articles, Sections, and clauses thereof are severable. If any such part sentence, paragraph, section, clause or word is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid for any reason, by any Court, the remainder of the Ordinance shall not be affected. If any such part is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid as applied to a particular property, Structure or use, the application of that part of the Ordinance to other properties, Structures or uses shall not be affected. Where there is a conflict between the provisions of this Ordinance and another Ordinance, or within this Ordinance, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. Whenever any condition or limitation is included in an approval or permit, it shall be conclusively presumed that the authorizing officer or body considered such condition or limitation to be lawful and necessary to carry out the spirit and intent of this Ordinance.
SECTION 25.4 REPEAL

The following Table of Updates, Summary of Zoning Map Updates, and Components of Current Ordinance are not parts of the Ordinance, but are provided as informal aids to assist in tracking the history of the Ordinance and to ensure that a particular copy of the Ordinance is up-to-date. The date of City Commission approval of an amendment is used for reference, rather than the effective date of an amendment.
Zoning map changes, such as rezonings and Planned Unit Development approvals, are not necessarily immediately reflected on the map published with the ordinance. These changes are indicated on the date of approval with a small letter (such as a, b, c, etc.) to indicate that a change has taken place, along with a number to identify the specific change, therefore the first change after the adoption of the map is change a1. A capital letter (A, B, C, etc.) is used to show when the change is reflected on the published map. For example, changes a1 and a2 would both be included in published map change A; the first change after published map change A would be change b1, which would be included in published map change B, and so forth. Map changes that have been approved but are not yet reflected on the published map are reflected on the official zoning map, which is available for review in the Inspection Department. The effective changes, whether or not incorporated into the published zoning map, are described in the Summary of Zoning Map Updates table.
The Cover of the Ordinance, and the tables in this section are updated with every amendment, and are therefore not included in the Table of Updates.
