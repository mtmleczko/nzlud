PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Butler, Missouri. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code, as supplemented through February 1970, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to John L. Pursley, City Attorney, and J. William (Bill) Tucker, City Administrator, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06) 
Sec. 2-118. - Employment at will. 
    Except for police officers covered by the police merit system, all employees of the city, including appointed officers, are "employees at will" which means that either the employee or the city may terminate the employment relationship at any time and without cause or justification. No employee has any right to expect continued employment with the city, and thus does not have a property interest in their employment. An employee may acquire rights to continued employment only if the city council officially votes to approve and adopt a written employment contract for a specific individual. 
(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06)

(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06) 
Sec. 2-120.1. - Open door policy. 
    The city believes the best way to handle potential problems is quickly and directly. Employees should attempt to resolve questions, concerns or problems informally with their supervisor or department head. If the employee is not satisfied with the resolution, he or she may bring the matter to the attention of the city administrator. The city administrator will make the final decision on any such matter. No employee will be entitled to appeal the city administrator's decision. 
    Police officers and employees represented by a labor union may have other procedural rights. 
    Employees who report directly to the city administrator shall be able to approach the city council and/or mayor with any problems or issues in accordance with the chain of command. 
(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06; Ord. No. 1012, 2-2-16) 
Sec. 2-120.2. - Unlawful harassment. 
    The city is firmly committed to providing a work place free from illegal discrimination or harassment of any kind. Any actions, words, comments, or adverse conduct toward an employee based on race, religion, national origin, age, sex, protected activity (including opposition to discrimination or illegal harassment), or any other unwelcome legally protected factor is strictly prohibited. Violation of this policy will lead to severe disciplinary action, including possible termination. 
    This prohibition specifically applies to sexual harassment. Although it is difficult to define, sexual harassment can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, touching, comments or jokes of a sexual nature, and any other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment also may include intimidating or hostile conduct toward an employee because of the employee's gender. 
    Any employee who is aware of sexual or other illegal harassment of any employee should immediately report the matter in writing to the city administrator, or if the city administrator is involved in the harassment, to the mayor. If both the city administrator and mayor are involved in the harassment, a written complaint should be filed with the personnel committee. The city will promptly, thoroughly, and impartially investigate the complaint, and take any action necessary to correct the problem. The complaint will be kept as confidential as possible, although it may be necessary to disclose some information during the resulting investigation. Employees also should report harassment by non-employees, including vendors, suppliers, customers, and citizens. 
    Without minimizing the importance of this policy, employees should understand that not all violations of the policy would warrant immediate termination. It also is possible that even a thorough investigation may not clearly establish a violation. Nonetheless, it is critical that employees promptly report any harassment so the city can stop it. 
(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06) 
Sec. 2-120.3. - Religious discrimination. 
    Federal and state laws prohibit discrimination or harassment on the basis of religion, religious beliefs, or views concerning religion. The United States Constitution expressly prohibits establishment (or endorsement) of religion by a governmental entity. It thus is critical that there be a clear division between religion and employment policies and practices. The city's personnel policies reflect these mandates by requiring all employment decisions to be based on merit, not religious views. 
    The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has determined that employers must protect their employees from harassment or intimidation on the basis of religious beliefs or practices. Pursuant to federal law, a person holding supervisory authority over an employee may not, explicitly or implicitly, insist that any employee participate in religious activities or hold religious beliefs as a condition of continued employment, promotion, job assignments, or any other aspect of employment. A supervisor preaching religion or proselytizing to employees on the job, requiring attendance at devotional services at work, or singling out an employee for unpleasant tasks because the supervisor disagreed with the employee's religious beliefs all have been deemed to violate federal law. Obviously it would be illegal to fire an employee for differences in religious views. 
    Employees are free to hold any religious belief, and during non-working time are free to practice (or not practice) any religious observance. The city also will accommodate employees' religious beliefs to the extent possible. During working time, however, the city of Butler will not tolerate any adverse treatment or harassment of employees on the basis of religion. 
(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06) 
Sec. 2-120.4. - Employee benefits. 
    The city attempts to provide a competitive package of fringe benefits for its employees. Although the city may add to, modify or cancel benefits at its sole discretion, at the time this division was enacted the city offered the following benefits: 
(1)  Health/dental/vision/life insurance. Regular employees may participate in the group health/dental, vision and life insurance program selected by the city council. The city council will annually approve an amount that the city will pay on the insurance premiums charged for coverage of the employee. The employee shall pay the premium for dependent coverage. 
(2)  Holidays. The following days will be recognized as paid holidays: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Day, President's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veteran's Day, Thanksgiving Day, Friday after Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. If such holiday occurs on a Saturday, the holiday shall be observed on the Friday preceding the holiday; if such holiday occurs on a Sunday, it shall be observed on the Monday following the holiday. If Christmas Eve is a Friday and Christmas is a Saturday, the city shall observe the Monday following as a holiday. If Christmas Eve is a Sunday and Christmas is a Monday, the city shall observe the Friday preceding as a holiday. Regular employees required to work on the actual day of a holiday (not the observed day) shall receive eight (8) hours of holiday pay at their regular rate of pay plus their applicable rate for all hours worked on the holiday. In lieu of receiving holiday pay for a holiday worked, an employee may elect to "bank" the holiday and receive it as an extra vacation day to be scheduled and paid pursuant to the vacation leave provision below. The number of "banked" hours shall be the same number of hours as the employee's regular daily work schedule. All such "banked" hours must be taken before the succeeding April 1. Any banked hours not taken as of April 1 will be paid during the pay period in which April 1 occurs. 
(3)  Vacation Leave-Additional accrued time after years of service. Regular employees earn five (5) vacation days, or forty (40) hours of vacation time, after the completion of their first full year of service. Regular employees earn ten (10) vacation days, or eighty (80) hours of vacation time, after the completion of their second full year of service. The rate of ten (10) vacation days per year continues until the employee complete five (5) full years of service. Employees earn one (1) additional day of vacation, or eight hours (8), for each year of service from the sixth through tenth year, to a maximum total of fifteen (15) days, or one hundred twenty (120) hours, total at ten (10) years of service. After fifteen (15) years of service the employee earns four (4) weeks, or one hundred sixty (160) hours, of vacation. Regardless of the rate at which employees accrue vacation leave, only one (1) workweek for forty (40) hours may be carried over from one year to the next (any additional balance would be forfeited): 
Accrued vacation time may be compensated for when employment as a regular employee ceases; however, any amounts owed the city at the time of termination may be deducted from the compensation. Vacations must be scheduled and approved by department heads. Department heads shall schedule vacations in accordance with operating requirements of the department and seniority of employees. Prior employment with the city shall not be used to compute vacation days earned unless approved by the city administrator. Employees shall not earn vacation during leave without pay. Employees who become regular employees prior to the 16th day of the month, or cease employment subsequent to the 15th day of the month, shall receive leave credit from the beginning of the month. Employees may use vacation leave for any reason, including illness, injury or disability. 
Employees shall be rewarded for years of service to the city. After ten (10) years of service the employee shall receive one additional day of vacation leave. After twenty (20) years of service the employee shall receive another additional day (two (2) total in addition to standard time). After thirty (30) years of service the employee shall receive one additional day (three (3) total in addition to standard time). 
(4)  Sick leave. 
a.  Regular employees earn one (1) day of sick leave per month. Each year on January 1, sick leave accrued in excess of one hundred twenty (120) days (nine hundred sixty (960) hours) shall be converted to regular paid time at the rate of five (5) hours sick leave for one (1) hour of regular pay. Each year as of January 1, employees will be notified of the amount of their accrued sick leave balance and shall have the option of converting sick leave accrued in excess of sixty (60) days into regular paid time at the rate of five (5) hours sick leave for one (1) hour regular pay. Employees electing to convert sick leave to regular pay must retain a sick leave balance of sixty (60), seventy-two (72), eighty-four (84), ninety-six (96), one hundred eight (108), or one hundred twenty (120) days. 
b.  Sick leave may be taken for personal illness or physical incapacity, quarantine ordered by a physician, or for up to three (3) days due to illness or injury to spouse or children. Sick leave may never be taken in advance of earning the time. 
c.  To be eligible for sick leave, the reason for the leave must be reported to the employee's supervisor before the workday begins. Department heads or the city administrator may require a physician's statement certifying the employee's, spouse's, or children's illness. Sick leave may be used during the last two (2) weeks of employment only upon submission of a physician's statement, acceptable to the city administrator in his sole discretion, certifying the employee's illness. Unused sick leave will not be compensated for in any way when employment ends. Absences in excess of the sick leave accrued shall be charged to vacation leave or leave without pay at the employee's choice. Abuse of sick leave may result in appropriate discipline up to and including discharge. Repeated or routine use of sick leave without a physician's statement may be construed to be abuse. 
d.  Sick leave during vacation. Regular employees may use accumulated sick leave credit for illness or injury while on authorized vacation leave, provided such use of sick leave credit would be warranted if the employee were not on vacation leave and, provided further, that an attending physician's statement is furnished upon request to the recommending authority certifying that the employee was incapacitated to a degree which would have prohibited performance of normal duties. 
(5)  Disability leave. As an additional benefit, regular employees who are injured on the job and are eligible for workers' compensation benefits for that injury will continue to receive their regular pay for up to sixty (60) days per year, provided: 
a.  The employee returns any workers' compensation benefits received on account of the injury to the city in return for the city continuing the employees' pay; 
b.  The employee agrees to a physical examination by a physician selected by a city to confirm the injury, if requested by the city; 
c.  The employee accepts any other duties or assignments offered by the city that the employee is capable of performing, as determined by the physician selected by the city; 
d.  Disability leave provided under these circumstances will not be charged to sick leave, vacation leave, or compensatory time. 
(6)  Funeral leave. Regular employees may be granted up to three (3) work days paid leave in the event of the death of an immediate family member. Such leave shall not be charged to sick leave, vacation leave, compensatory time leave or other paid leave. 
(7)  Jury leave. Regular employees may be granted paid leave for up to thirty (30) calendar days when required to be absent from work for jury duty or when subpoenaed as a trial witness, provided any compensation received by the employee is paid over to the city. 
(8)  Military leave. 
a.  Employees shall be granted military leaves of absence in accordance with RSMo 105.270. Military leave of absence and reemployment shall be granted as required by federal and state law. 
b.  A regular employee who is drafted into military service shall, after discharge from active service, be entitled to return to city service at a level equivalent to the position held on his departure, assuming an equivalent position exists. 
(9)  Voting leave. When an employee's work schedule, either regular or emergency, does not leave available three (3) consecutive hours during voting hours for the purpose of voting at all state, county, city and national elections, then the employee will be given time off, with pay, during his or her tour of duty as is necessary for such purposes. 
(10)  Unpaid leave. Leave of absence without pay may be granted by the city at its discretion for good cause. Request for leave of absence must be submitted in writing stating the reason therefor and the expected date of return to work, not to exceed ninety (90) days from the beginning of the absence. Such leaves are totally within the discretion of the city and will be granted only if the city believes the employee's time away from the job would be in the best interests of both the employee and the city. If such a leave is granted, it will be on such terms and conditions as the city approves. 
(11)  Retirement. All regular employees shall participate in the LAGERS state retirement program. Four (4) percent of gross pay is deducted and paid to LAGERS. 
Employees retiring with twenty (20) years of service shall receive two (2) nights stay at Big Cedar Lodge and ten dollars ($10.00) per year of service in the form of a two hundred dollar ($200.00) gift card. Employees retiring with thirty (30) years or more of service shall receive three (3) nights stay at Big Cedar Lodge and a gift card of ten dollars ($10.00) per year of service. 
(12)  Family and medical leave of absence policy (FMLA leave). Consistent with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), the city of Butler (city) provides FMLA leave to eligible employees. All provisions of FMLA govern the city's FMLA policy. Following is a summary. 
a.  Eligibility. To be eligible for FMLA leave, employees must have worked at least one (1) year and at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours during the twelve (12) months prior to commencement of the leave, and must be employed at a worksite where fifty (50) or more employees are employed by the employer within seventy-five (75) miles of that site. 
b.  Purposes of leave. 
1.  To care for the employee's child after birth, or placement for adoption or foster care; 
2.  To care for the employee's spouse, son or daughter (usually a minor), or parent, who has a serious health condition; 
3.  For a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the employee's job (which includes on-the-job injuries covered by the workers' compensation laws). 
c.  Maximum leave. Up to twelve (12) weeks in any rolling twelve-month period, measured backward from the date the employees uses any FMLA leave. 
d.  Restrictions on leave. 
1.  Leave to care for a child after birth or placement for adoption or foster care must be completed within twelve (12) months after the birth or placement. 
2.  If both the employee and the employee's spouse work for the city, the maximum combined leave for both for leave to care for a child after birth or placement for adoption or foster care or to care for a parent is twelve (12) weeks. 
3.  An employee on FMLA leave is prohibited from working elsewhere unless the city consents in advance and in writing to such other employment. 
4.  If an absence from work is for an FMLA reason, it will be considered an FMLA absence and charged against the employee's twelve-week FMLA leave allowance even if the time off was originally scheduled as a non-FMLA absence (such as vacation, paid time off, discretionary/person leave, etc.). 
e.  Types of leave. 
1.  Some leaves are "continuous", requiring the employee's absence from work for a continuous period of time normally exceeding three (3) days. 
2.  Leave can also be "intermittent" or on a "reduced schedule" basis, meaning that the employee will be absent usually for short periods of time on a recurring basis (such as for chemotherapy, physical therapy, etc.) or will work a reduced number of hours for a continuous period of time. Intermittent or reduced schedule leave is available for serious health conditions only if medically necessary. Intermittent or reduced schedule leave to care for a child after birth or placement for adoption or childcare is available only with the city's consent. During intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the city may temporarily transfer the employee to another job of equivalent pay and benefits to better accommodate the employee's leave. 
f.  Required notices and certifications. 
1.  Employee must provide thirty (30) days' advance written notice of the need for leave, or, if emergency conditions prevent such notice, it must be given as soon as practicable. 
2.  If leave is for a serious health condition, the employee must provide certification of the condition from a health care provider, normally within fifteen (15) days after requesting leave. In some cases, a second or third medical opinion may be required (at the city's expense). 
3.  While on leave, an employee must report periodically on his/her status, usually every thirty (30) days. 
g.  Benefits while on leave. 
1.  Leave will be unpaid unless the employee has earned/accrued but unused paid time off benefits (such as vacation, paid time off, short-term disability or sick pay or the employee is eligible to receive pay under workers' compensation laws), in which case the employee must exhaust all such paid time off benefits, after which the leave will be unpaid. Using paid time off benefits does not add to the total length of leave. 
2.  Health care benefits in effect at the time will continue during the leave, but the employee is still responsible for paying the cost charged to active employees for the same coverage. If the employee chooses not to return from leave, the employee may be required to repay the city's portion of the premiums. 
3.  Any other benefit, which the employee earned before the leave began, will be restored to the employee when he/she returns to work. 
h.  Return to work. 
1.  The employee must provide a release to return to work (with or without restrictions) from the health care provider. 
2.  If the employee is released to work with no restrictions, the employee will be returned to the same position held prior to leave, or one that is equivalent in pay, benefits and other employment terms. 
3.  If the employee is released to work with restrictions, the city will review such situations on a case-by-case basis to determine if reasonable accommodation of the restrictions can be made. 
i.  Non-Discrimination. It is the city's policy to fully comply with its obligations under FMLA and not to discharge or discriminate against any employee for exercising his/her rights under FMLA. If the employee thinks he/she has been treated unfairly, please contact the city administrator.

(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06; Ord. No. 901, § 1, 11-3-09) 
Sec. 2-120.6. - Hours of work, overtime, time and attendance records. 
(a)  Hours of work.

(4)  Salaried employees are to provide the best possible services that their position demands while ethically reporting the hours worked any given week. Salaried employees shall be available to the city at all reasonable times and dates. 
a.  As an employee of the city, each employee is required to report a fair and accurate statement of hours worked. Each salaried employee is required to complete, sign and date a time and attendance record for each payroll period. This record should detail which days the employee worked and how many actual hours were worked that day. Absence from a full day's work will be considered either sick leave or vacation (paid time off). 
b.  Salaried employees are expected to work until their tasks are accomplished for the week, regardless of actual time. It is expected that all salaried employees work a schedule of Monday through Friday with a traditional start time of 8:00 a.m. and continue until 5:00 p.m. In addition, salaried employees are to be available to the public and the City of Butler at times expected of their position.

Vacation and holiday hours paid but not worked in a work period shall be treated as hours worked for calculating overtime pay for employees who, but for the holiday, would have worked those hours. Overtime hours must be reviewed and approved by the department head. 
(2)  An employee called to work outside his/her regularly scheduled work period by a duly authorized person shall be credited a minimum of two (2) hours work for the day, unless that employee is being compensated with standby pay. If multiple call-ins occur the same day, the employee shall be paid in excess of the two (2) hours' credit only for time actually worked in excess of two (2) hours during the day. Those employees on standby shall be paid for actual time worked in addition to their standby pay with no minimum two-hour credit given. 
(3)  Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay; however, the mayor or city administrator may authorize less than a full workday off for such employees for partial relief from extended work hour schedules. 
(d)  Compensatory time. Non-exempt employee may accumulate compensatory time in-lieu of overtime compensation in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act when they work more than forty (40) hours in a work week. 
    Compensatory time is allowed to accumulate, at the time and one-half (1/2) rate, up to a maximum of two hundred forty (240) hours, or one hundred sixty (160) hours at the straight time rate for general employees and up to four hundred eighty (480) hours, or three hundred twenty (320) hours at the straight time rate for police department or fire department employees, however, the two hundred forty (240) hour limit will apply to office personnel who work in the police department or fire department. Once an employee has accrued the maximum allowable hours of compensatory time, all subsequent hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek, must be paid as overtime. 
    A request for use of compensatory time will be granted within a reasonable time period to be determined by considering the customary work practices within the department based on the facts and circumstances in each case and is subject to the approval of the department head. Work practices may include, but are not limited to 1) normal schedule of work, 2) anticipated peak workloads based on past experience, 3) emergency requirements for staff and services, and 4) the availability of qualified substitute staff. 
    The employee requesting time off may choose to use accrued compensatory time instead of accrued annual leave, unless the employee is subject to lose annual leave in accordance with the annual leave policy. 
    An employee who must be absent from work under the sick leave policy may choose to use accrued compensatory time instead of accrued sick leave with department head approval. 
    An employee who must be absent from work due to an approved family medical leave absence, after exhausting all allowed sick leave, may choose to use accrued compensatory time before using annual leave. 
    Compensatory time earned or used must be clearly indicated on time cards and leave request forms. 
    Upon resignation or termination of employment from the city, non-exempt employees shall be paid for all unused accrued compensatory time at the employee's rate of pay at the time of resignation or termination. 
(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06; Ord. No. 924, 3-15-11; Ord. No. 937, 11-15-11; Ord. No. 1012, 2-2-16) 
Sec. 2-120.7. - Separation, layoffs. 
    The city may lay off employees whenever it deems necessary to efficiently operate city government. Regular employees who are laid off will receive compensation for wages due and, if the layoff exceeds three (3) months, accrued vacation time. 
(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06) 
Sec. 2-120.8. - Conduct and discipline. 
(a)  Conduct. It shall be the duty of each employee to maintain high standards of conduct, cooperation, efficiency and economy in their work for the city. Employees must remember that their conduct both on and off duty reflects upon the city. Accordingly, the city is justifiably concerned with any aspect of an employee's job performance or behavior that adversely affects the services provided by the city or the public's view of the city. 
(b)  Discipline. It is the city's obligation to deliver the highest quality service to its residents in the most efficient manner possible. Whenever an employee's work habits, deportment, production levels or other aspects of an employee's behavior fall below a desirable standard, the city may take steps to address the problem, including disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
    Depending upon the circumstances, the city may find it necessary to reprimand, suspend (with or without pay), demote, dismiss, or otherwise deal with an employee whose performance or behavior is not acceptable. The city may take whatever action it considers appropriate under the circumstances. Although progressive discipline may be appropriate; the city also may use more severe disciplinary action, including termination, if the city in its sole discretion finds such action necessary. 
    It is impossible to predict and list all the possible scenarios in which discipline might be necessary. In an effort to provide some examples, however, the following types of conduct will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge: 
(1)  Criminal, dishonest, or disgraceful conduct. Specifically including: 
a.  Dishonesty. Stealing or taking city property or other employees' property without proper authorization; misuse of city's funds or employee's funds; cheating; forging or willfully falsifying official city reports, records, application forms, or other documents; misuse of paid leave of absence; any other falsifying action detrimental to the city or fellow employees; or any intentional false statement, deception or fraud. 
b.  Disturbance. Fighting; using profane, abusive or threatening language; horseplay; causing injury to fellow employees through deliberate action or gross negligence; spreading false reports; or otherwise disrupting the harmonious relationships between employees. 
c.  Sabotage. Deliberate damage or destruction of city equipment or property; altering, removing, or destroying city records; advocacy of or participation in unlawful trespass or seizure of city property; encouraging or engaging in slow-downs, sit-ins strikes or any other concerted effort to limit or restrict employees from working. 
d.  Misconduct. Any criminal offense or other misconduct, including immoral conduct, during or off working hours, which could have an adverse effect on the city, or on the confidence of the public in the integrity of the city government (including violations of any applicable Code of Ethics); or on the relationship of the employee and other employees (including sexual harassment); or repeated convictions on misdemeanor charges such as speeding, reckless driving, or accidents involving injuries to persons or damage to property or equipment; or the discovery of such conduct in prior employment. 
(2)  Abuse of drugs or alcohol. Reporting to work in unfit condition, being under the influence of intoxicants or controlled substances, including marijuana, narcotics, or illegal drugs of any kind (defined to include legal drugs taken without proper prescription); drinking intoxicants or ingesting a controlled substance, including marijuana, narcotics, or illegal drugs of any kind during working time; or possessing intoxicants or illegal drugs of any kind on city property or in city vehicles. 
(3)  Drug and alcohol testing policy violation. Violation of the city's drug and alcohol testing policy and procedures. 
(4)  Unsatisfactory attendance. Excessive, unauthorized absence and/or tardiness. Abuse of lunch hours or break time. Note: Failure to report for duty without contacting the appropriate supervisory authority for two (2) consecutive workdays may be construed as a voluntary resignation. 
(5)  Indifference toward work. Inefficiency, loafing, carelessness, failure to remain at work, performing unauthorized personal business during working hours, abuse of eating and/or rest periods, sleeping or being inattentive during working hours, interfering with work of others, mistreatment of the public or other employees, or leaving work without permission. 
(6)  Violation of safety rules. Smoking in prohibited areas; improper removal of safety guards, fire extinguishers, or other equipment designed to protect employees; failure to use safety equipment or to follow safety practice rules; or failure to report an on-the-job injury, vehicle accident, or unsafe condition. 
(7)  Misuse of city equipment or services. Using or providing any city equipment, credentials, or services for other than official city business, or without proper authority. Careless use of city property resulting in damages. 
(8)  Incompetence. Inability or unwillingness to perform assigned work satisfactorily; failure to provide appropriate leadership or supervision (for managers or supervisors). 
(9)  Insubordination. Willful failure or refusal to perform assigned work or fully comply with instructions or orders as requested by the supervisor or other members of management. 
a.  If the employee believes an instruction or order is improper, he should obey the order or instruction and file a written objection afterward. This does not apply to imminently dangerous situations. 
b.  If the employee believes the instruction or order, if followed, would result in physical injury to himself or others or damage to city equipment, he should request approval by the next higher level of supervision. 
(10)  Statutory disqualification. Any statutory disqualification which makes the individual unfit for a job or a failure to meet and maintain requirements of his or her job description. 
(11)  Rules violations. Violation of city or department administrative rules and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06) 
Sec. 2-120.9. - Political activities. 
    The city encourages all employees to vote in municipal elections. There is a risk, however, that excessive involvement in the election process by city employees could create the potential for candidates to pressure employees for their support, for employees to exert control over municipal elections, or the appearance of bias in the delivery of public services. These risks are sufficiently severe to justify some limitation on city employees' involvement in public elections. Missouri law also imposes some restrictions on political activities of municipal employees. 
    For these reasons, any employee who wishes to run for public office or campaign for a candidate for public office must notify the city administrator. Depending on the circumstances, the city may impose specific limitations or restrictions as deemed necessary by the city administrator, including but not limited to prohibiting employees from running for public office without taking an unpaid leave of absence, holding an elected municipal or county office while employed by the city, or soliciting, encouraging, or otherwise attempting to obtain a contribution or anything of value for or on behalf of a candidate for public office. 
(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06) 
Sec. 2-120.10. - Outside employment. 
    No regular employee shall accept outside employment, whether part-time, seasonal, permanent or otherwise, without prior written approval of his/her department head. Outside employment, which interferes with an employee's duties with the city or which could create a conflict of interest is prohibited. Police officers shall not be granted approval to work in any establishment that sells alcoholic beverages at retail. 
(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06) 
Sec. 2-120.11. - Use of personal vehicles/CDL licenses. 
    Employees who are required to use their personal vehicles in connection with their employment for the city shall provide evidence of insurance suitable to the city. Such employees will be reimbursed for miles driven on city business at the current rate established by the Internal Revenue Service. If an employee is required to hold a CDL license to perform his/her duties for the city, the city will reimburse the employee for the difference in cost between a regular driver's license and a CDL license. 
(Ord. No. 839, § 1, 6-20-06) 
Sec. 2-120.12. - Employee suggestion awards program. 
    The purpose of the employee suggestion awards program is to improve productivity and the quality of public service in city operations by implementing practical suggestions from as many employees as possible. This program allows employees to express their ideas about better ways to do their jobs and rewards employees with some of the savings or benefits resulting from their ideas. 
(1)  Acceptable suggestions are defined as "constructive" ideas submitted in writing to the human resource manager by one (1) or more employees to improve methods, equipment or procedures that will reduce time or cost of operations, or make working conditions better or safer, or improve directly the operations of the organization, or provide better public service, or otherwise benefit the government directly. In other words, eligible suggestions must: 
a.  Increase productivity. 
b.  Improve service to the public. 
c.  Add a new source of revenue. 
d.  Reduce costs, duplication or waste. 
e.  Improve working conditions or safety. 
f.  Conserve labor, materials or energy. 
    A suggestion is not eligible if it: 
(1)  Deals with routine matters, such as standard equipment or normal replacements, repairs or maintenance. 
(2)  Proposes minor improvements in working conditions that the employee or department head can correct through normal or customary action. 
(3)  Points out problems without proposing solutions, or is a proposal which has the nature of a grievance. 
(4)  Relates to union agreements or collective bargaining. 
(5)  Concerns pay and job classifications. 
(6)  Increases existing fees or charges. 
(7)  Duplicates an earlier suggestion. 
(8)  Concerns applications of technology that are widely accepted as routine. 
(9)  Concerns a situation that exists only because established procedures are not being followed. 
(2)  Annual award amounts are recommended by the suggestion awards program committee and approved by the city administrator. The minimum award for an implemented suggestion is a personal day off with pay. All award winners will receive a framed certificate. 
(3)  Awards for selected suggestions are differentiated between "tangible" benefits, those that can be measured in dollars, and "intangible" benefits, those that cannot be measured in terms of dollars, but are worthy of adoption. 
a.  Tangible. Suggestions that result in a ten (10) percent reduction in departmental expenses (a minimum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00)), a reduction in measurable staff time, or a revenue increase may receive time up to two (2) personal days off subject to scheduling approved by supervisor. 
b.  Intangible. Where the value of a suggestion cannot be measured entirely or precisely in actual savings, such as a safety or service quality, awards for intangible benefits will be evaluated for awards up to one (1) personal day off. 
1.  How effective the proposed solution is. 
2.  How serious the problem is. 
3.  How extensive the problem is. 
4.  How probable the problem is. 
5.  How ingenious the suggestion is. 
Note: All awards for groups of employees who submit suggestions shall receive an award that is prorated, but not less than two (2) hours of paid leave. 
c.  Indirect. If a suggestion is not implemented as stated, but leads to a different but related solution to the problem, an "indirect award" may be based on a yearly savings or revenue increase up to a maximum of one (1) personal day off. 
d.  Interim. If the benefit from a suggestion cannot be accurately estimated when it is implemented, an "interim award" (up to one (1) personal day off) may be made. After the first year, an additional award may be made if actual results justify it. Total award may not exceed the limits stated above. 
(4)  City employees may obtain a suggestion awards program form from the human resource manager at City Hall. Complete the form following instructions on the back, and turn the form into the human resource manager. The human resource manager will keep employee(s) informed about their suggestion after it is processed by the suggestion awards program committee, which is comprised of management and employee representatives appointed by the city administrator. 
    Supervisory and management employees are eligible to participate in the program, however, suggestions affecting the individual supervisor's or manager's area of operation and/or span of control shall not be eligible. 
    The committee will refer eligible suggestions to the operating department to be tested for a period of sixty (60) days, during which time specific results or benefits are identified and an estimate of savings is computed. If it appears the suggestion can be adopted, the committee will provide the city administrator with a written report providing a sound basis for deciding the type and amount of the award. The city administrator has the final decision for implementation and award of suggestions. 
    If a suggestion is rejected, a written report will be prepared setting forth explicitly why the suggestion could not be adopted and how the idea was tested. Every suggestion will be acknowledged. 
    An awards ceremony for successful suggestions will be held annually during a regular city council meeting where employees submitting selected suggestions will be honored and recognized.

(d)  An employee whose job position requires the performance of safety-sensitive functions shouldconsult with their physician upon receiving a prescription as to the effect the drug may have upon the employee's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle, to operate heavy equipment or machinery, or to perform other safety-sensitive job duties. Performing such duties, when it is in conflict with the physician's recommendations, is strictly forbidden. If the drug is required to be taken just prior to or during working hours and will affect the employee's working abilities, immediate supervisor notification is required so that job duties may be reassigned. 
(e)  If an employee reports the use of a prescription drug to their immediate supervisor, the supervisor shall report this information promptly to the program coordinator. 
(f)  Any employee, who is convicted of the illegal manufacture, sale, distribution, possession, or use of a controlled substance while at work, is required to report the conviction to the program coordinator within five (5) calendar days following the conviction. The program coordinator upon such notification will act in accordance with the city's "Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 Policy."

(Ord. No. 631, § 1, 12-3-96) 
Subdivision III. - Testing Procedures 

Sec. 2-125.3. - Pre-employment testing. 
(a)  A drug test shall be conducted in accordance with federal regulations and a verified negative result received before an employee is permitted to perform a safety-sensitive function. Testing on applicants considered for positions involving safety-sensitive job functions shall be conducted after the employment offer has been made but before employment commences. Offers of employment are contingent on negative test results. A refusal to submit to drug testing and/or a refusal to authorize the release of previous employment information as required by the city shall remove the applicant from employment consideration. A pre-employment drug test shall also be required of any employee transferring into a safety-sensitive position. 
(b)  The city is not required to administer a pre-employment drug test if the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The employee must have participated in a DOT drug testing program within the previous thirty (30) days, and 
(2)  While participating in this program the employee either: 
a.  Was tested for drugs within the previous six (6) months (from the date of application with the city), or 
b.  Participated in a random drug testing program for the previous twelve (12) months (from the date of application with the city); and 
(3)  The city has verified that no prior employer of the employee has record of any drug-related DOT violations for the employee in the previous six (6) months. 
(c)  In order for the city to exercise the option listed above, the city must first contact the employee's previous employer and obtain the following information: 
(1)  Name(s) and address(es) of the program(s); 
(2)  Verification that the employee participates or participated in the program(s); 
(3)  Verification that the program conforms to the required procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40; 
(4)  Verification that the employee is qualified to perform safety-sensitive functions as specified in 49 CFR Part 382 and that the employee has not refused to submit to a drug or alcohol test; 
(5)  The date the employee was last tested for drugs and alcohol; 
(6)  The results of any drug or alcohol tests administered in the previous six (6) months, and any drug or alcohol-related violations. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 1, 12-3-96) 
Sec. 2-125.4. - Release of information by previous employers. 
(a)  The city must obtain, on all new employees which will be performing safety-sensitive job functions and pursuant to the employee's consent, information with regard to all alcohol tests with a result of 0.04 percent or greater, all positive drug tests, and all refusals to be tested, from the employee's previous employers, for the preceding two (2) years (if maintained under 49 CFR Part 382). 
(b)  This information must be obtained and reviewed by the city no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the first time an employee performs safety-sensitive functions for the city. The city may not permit an employee to perform safety-sensitive functions after fourteen (14) days without obtaining this information. 
(c)  If the employee stops performing safety-sensitive functions for the city before the expiration of the fourteen-day period or before the city has obtained the information, the city must still obtain this information. 
(d)  The city shall provide to each of the employee's previous employers within the two (2) preceding years the employee's specific, written authorization for release of this information. 
(e)  The release of this information may take the form of personal interviews, telephone interviews, letters, or any other method of obtaining information that ensures confidentiality. The city must maintain a written, confidential record with respect to each past employer contacted. 
(f)  The city may not use an employee to perform safety-sensitive functions if the city obtains information that the employee has had an alcohol test with a result of 0.04 percent or greater, a verified positive drug test, or a refusal to be tested violation, without obtaining information on a subsequent substance abuse professional's evaluation and/or determination, return-to-duty and follow-up testing requirements. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 1, 12-3-96) 
Sec. 2-125.5. - Post-accident testing. 
    Post accident testing shall be required to test employees after a vehicular or equipment accident has occurred in which a fatality has occurred, or when a traffic citation issued after an accident, or testing may be required where injury to a person required transport to a medical treatment facility or disabling damage to one (1) or more vehicles or equipment and may require towing from the accident site to occur or an accident report is filed with a law enforcement agency. Controlled substance and alcohol testing may include breath alcohol, urine, or blood testing of the employee(s). 
(Ord. No. 631, § 1, 12-3-96; Ord. No. 924, 3-15-11) 
Sec. 2-125.6. - Random testing.

The city shall randomly select a sufficient number of employees for testing from each pool during the calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate as determined by federal regulations. 
(c)  The city shall require that once an employee has received notification to report for random testing, the employee shall proceed immediately to the collection-site and submit to a drug and/or alcohol test. No delay of any type may be granted or taken. Any delay by the employee in reporting immediately to the collection-site shall be deemed as a "refusal to submit." 
(d)  An employee shall be tested for alcohol only while performing a safety-sensitive function, just before the employee is to perform a safety-sensitive function, or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions. 
(e)  An employee shall be tested for drugs at any time while on-duty, regardless of the job duties the employee is performing at the time of notification. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 1, 12-3-96) 
Sec. 2-125.7. - Reasonable suspicion testing. 
(a)  Requirement to submit. Qualified supervisors or management personnel shall require an employee to submit to a drug or alcohol test when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the alcohol or drug prohibitions as set forth in this division. 
(b)  Observations. The observations required for a reasonable suspicion test request can only be made by supervisors or management personnel who have been trained in accordance with federal regulations. Reasonable suspicion testing shall be used to determine "fitness for duty" and must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee. The observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of drugs. 
(c)  Authorization. Reasonable suspicion testing for alcohol is authorized only if the required observations are made just before, during or just after the period of the work day when the employee is required to comply with the alcohol prohibitions. If an alcohol test is not administered within two (2) hours from the time the observations are made, the program coordinator shall prepare and maintain a record on file stating the reason(s) for why the test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test is not administered within eight (8) hours from the time the observations are made, any further attempts to administer the test shall cease and the program coordinator shall state in the record the reason(s) for not securing the test. 
(d)  Documentation. Written documentation of all observations involved in the determination for a reasonable suspicion test request is required. A report shall be prepared by the individual who observed the employee and must be completed within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the observed behavior(s) occurred or before the results of the drug test are released, whichever is earlier. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 1, 12-3-96) 
Sec. 2-125.8. - Return-to-duty testing. 
    A return-to-duty test is required before an employee returns to duty in a safety-sensitive position following a confirmed positive drug or alcohol test. An employee, whose test confirms positive for alcohol, cannot return to duty in a safety-sensitive position until the return-to-duty test produces a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 percent. An employee, whose test confirms positive for drugs cannot return to duty in a safety-sensitive position until the return-to-duty test indicates a verified negative result for controlled substance use. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 1, 12-3-96) 
Sec. 2-125.9. - Follow-up testing. 
(a)  An employee who violates the city's drug or alcohol policy and is subsequently identified by a substance abuse professional as needing assistance in resolving an alcohol or drug-related problem shall be subject to unannounced follow-up testing as directed by the substance abuse professional in accordance with federal law. 
(b)  The employee, who is allowed to return to work and has tested negative on the return-to-duty test(s), shall be subject to a minimum of six (6) follow-up tests for drugs and/or alcohol. The follow-up tests shall be ordered by the substance abuse professional and performed randomly throughout the twelve (12) months following the employee's return to work. Follow-up testing may be continued for a period of up to sixty (60) months (five (5) years) based on the recommendations of the substance abuse professional. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 1, 12-3-96) 
Sec. 2-125.10. - Refusal to submit. 
    No employee shall refuse to submit to any of the required tests. An employee refuses to submit when he or she fails to provide adequate breath or urine for testing when notified of the need to do so, or who engages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process. Adulteration of specimens will be considered as a refusal to test. Such refusal is a policy violation and is treated as if the city received a positive test result. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 1, 12-3-96) 
Sec. 2-125.11. - Collection, testing, and reporting procedures. 
(a)  The city shall follow the federal guidelines (49 CFR Part 40) with regard to specimen collection and testing. This shall include the selection of appropriately-trained collection personnel, adequately-secured collection-sites, certified breath alcohol technicians, approved evidential breath testing instruments, a SAMHSA-certified laboratory to perform the drug testing, and the selection of a medical review officer to verify all laboratory drug test results. 
(b)  The drug and alcohol testing program shall provide for individual privacy in the collection of the required specimens to the maximum extent possible. 
(c)  Chain-of-custody procedures are required for all specimen collections and throughout processing to ensure that specimen security, identification, and integrity are not compromised. 
(d)  Confidentiality is to be maintained at all times with regard to an employee's test results and reports. Only authorized personnel shall receive testing results and reports. Employee records pertaining to alcohol and drug testing shall be secured in an area with restricted access and maintained separate from the employee's personnel file. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 1, 12-3-96) 
Subdivision IV. - Post-Testing Procedures 

Sec. 2-125.12. - Consequences for policy violations. 
(a)  An employee who notifies city officials, prior to engaging in a safety-sensitive function, regarding the use of over-the-counter or prescription medication which could result in a positive drug test or an alcohol test of 0.02 percent or greater will be temporarily removed from driving responsibilities or the performance of other safety-sensitive functions for the duration of usage and will not be subject to disciplinary action. An employee's repeated inability to perform his or her job responsibilities may require a job evaluation to determine if the employee is able to maintain current job status. 
(b)  An employee who, as a result of testing, is found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 percent or greater but less than 0.04 percent shall not perform or continue to perform any safety-sensitive functions until the start of the employee's next regularly-scheduled duty period but not less than twenty-four (24) hours after the test was administered. A return-to-duty test may be required and a test result of less than 0.02 percent must be obtained. Further employment actions up to and including termination may be instigated under the independent authority of the city. 
(c)  An employee who, as a result of testing, is found to have engaged in the use of a controlled substance or has an alcohol concentration of 0.04 percent or greater shall be immediately removed from service and subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. In addition, the employee shall be referred to a substance abuse professional for evaluation. 
(d)  An employee's refusal to submit to a required drug or alcohol test will be treated as a policy violation and the employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
(e)  Any employee mandated by federal regulation (CDL-holders), with a drug or alcohol violation (see prohibited conduct) is required under federal law to undergo a DOT evaluation performed by a qualified substance abuse professional and to complete a rehabilitation program as specified by the substance abuse professional. The employee may not return to duty in a safety-sensitive position for any employer until such time that the required conditions have been satisfied and the employee is released by the substance abuse professional to return to work. 
(f)  Evaluation by a substance abuse professional or completion of a required rehabilitation program does not protect an employee from disciplinary action related to violations of this division or guarantee continued employment or reinstatement by the city. 
(g)  This division does not displace any other penalties or disciplinary action that may be imposed or incurred as a result of violation of other city policies, state, or federal laws, or as provided in the worker's compensation laws of this state. 
(h)  Pursuant to its own independent legal authority, the city may impose disciplinary actions up to and including termination on an employee for any violations of the provisions of this division. 
(Ord. No. 631, § 1, 12-3-96) 
Sec. 2-125.13. - Employee evaluation and rehabilitation. 
(a)  An employee who voluntarily admits having a problem and requests assistance prior to the city identifying the problem through testing or an employee who, following a violation of this division, has been determined by a substance abuse professional to be in need of assistance for a controlled substance or alcohol-related problem, may be permitted to enter into a rehabilitation plan approved by the city. A rehabilitation contract between the employee and the city will be prepared and, provided that the employee agrees to adhere to the terms and conditions of this contract, a leave of absence will be granted. The employee will be eligible to utilize sick and vacation leave benefits, if available, and in accordance with the city's employee benefit program. Evaluation of an employee by a substance abuse professional and participation in a rehabilitation program will be at the employee's own expense or as covered under the employee's medical insurance plan, if applicable. 
(b)  Failure to complete the rehabilitation program or to adhere to the rehabilitation contract shall be considered as resignation by the employee from employment with the city. 
(c)  The rehabilitation contract with an employee shall include the following terms and conditions. The employee shall agree: 
(1)  To undertake and successfully complete the rehabilitation program established for the employee by the substance abuse professional; 
(2)  To refrain from the use of controlled substances and alcohol consistent with the plan of rehabilitation; 
(3)  To provide for the release of all medical records pertaining to the employee's rehabilitation, for review by the city in order to establish participation and compliance of the employee in the program; 
(4)  Upon successful completion of the rehabilitation program and prior to reinstatement of employment duties, to submit to a return-to-duty test, and shall test "negative" for controlled substances and/or alcohol; 
(5)  To subsequent, unannounced follow-up testing for controlled substances and/or alcohol as determined is necessary by the substance abuse professional; and 
(6)  That any future violations of this division shall be considered as resignation, without recourse, by the employee from employment with the city. 
(d)  Repeated requests for drug or alcohol rehabilitation may result in conditions being placed on the employee at the time of reinstatement regarding the opportunity for future approved rehabilitation leave. 
(e)  The city's responsibility, under federal law, is only to assist in the referral of an employee (regardless of job status, i.e., suspension, termination) requesting or requiring rehabilitation for a substance abuse problem to a qualified substance abuse professional for evaluation. Evaluation by a substance abuse professional, treatment, and rehabilitation costs shall be solely the financial responsibility of the employee.

(5)  The city may disclose information required to be maintained under federal regulations pertaining to an employee, the decisionmaker in a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding initiated by or on behalf of the individual, and arising from the results of an alcohol and/or drug test administered under this program, or from the city's determination that the employee engaged in conduct prohibited by this program (including, but not limited to, a workers compensation, unemployment compensation, or other proceeding relating to a benefit sought by the employee). 
(6)  The city shall release information regarding an employee's records as directed by the specific, written consent of the employee authorizing release of the information to an identified person. Release of such information by the person receiving the information is permitted only in accordance with the terms of the employee's consent.

(a)  Written materials. The city shall provide, to all participating employees, written educational material which explains the employee drug and alcohol testing program, its general requirements, policies and procedures. The program coordinator shall ensure that a copy of this material is distributed to each employee prior to initiation of the testing program and to each employee subsequently hired or transferred into a safety-sensitive job position. The educational materials to be made available to employees shall include the specified information as required by federal law in 49 CFR 382.601. All employees shall be required to sign a statement, which will be maintained on file by the city, certifying that the employee received a copy of the education material. 
(b)  Training.

(a)  Design guidelines for review of applications for certificates of appropriateness shall, at a minimum, include the following architectural criteria: 
(1)  Height. The height of any proposed alteration or construction should be compatible with the style and character of the landmark and with surrounding structures in a historic district. 
(2)  Proportions of windows and doors. The proportions and relationships between doors and windows should be compatible with the architectural style and character of the landmark and with surrounding structures within a historic district. 
(3)  Relationship of building masses and spaces. The relationship of a structure within a historic district to the open space between it and adjoining structures should be compatible. 
(4)  Roof shape. The design of the roof should be compatible with the architectural style and character of the landmarks and surrounding structures in a historic district. 
(5)  Landscaping. Landscaping should be compatible with the architectural character and appearance of the landmark and of surrounding structures and landscapes in historic districts. 
(6)  Scale. The scale of the structure after alteration, construction or partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural style and character and with surrounding structures in a historic district. 
(7)  Directional expression. Facades in historic districts should blend with other structures with regard to directional expression. Structures in a historic district should be compatible with the dominant horizontal or vertical expression of surrounding structures. The directional expression of a landmark after alterations, construction or partial demolition should be compatible with its original architectural style and character. 
(8)  Architectural details. Architectural details including materials, colors and textures should be treated so as to make a landmark compatible with its original character of significant architectural style and to preserve and enhance the landmark or historic district. 
(9)  Signage. The character of signs should be in keeping with the historic or architectural character of a landmark or historic district. Character of a sign includes the number, size, area, scale, location, type (e.g., off-site advertising signs and on-site business signs), letter size or style and intensity and type of illumination. 
(10)  Minimum maintenance. Significant exterior architectural features should be kept in a condition of good repair and maintenance. All structural and mechanical systems should be maintained in a condition and state of repair that will prevent decay, deterioration or damage to significant architectural features or otherwise adversely affect the historic or architectural character of structures within a historic district. 
(11)  Guidelines available to the public. A copy of the foregoing design review guidelines shall be made available to the public upon request at the office of the city administrator. 
(b)  In its review of proposals which are subject to this chapter, the BHPC shall be guided by the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (revised 1983) including, but not necessarily limited to, the following standards for rehabilitation set forth therein: 
(1)  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(2)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
(4)  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(8)  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(9)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(c)  In addition, the BHPC may also from time to time adopt by rule additional or modified standards and guidelines as authorized by the city council as provided in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1041, § 2, 8-15-17) 
Sec. 2-197. - Certificate of appropriateness; effect of review on other approvals.

The certificate of appropriateness shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following information: the name of the applicant, the date the certificate is issued, the location of the proposed development, a brief narrative description of the development, specific reference to any and all plans submitted by the applicant, whether or not the BHPC finds the proposed development to be contributing to the historic district and any and all specific design recommendations made by the BHPC on the application. 
(b)  Issuance of a certificate of appropriateness by the BHPC does not constitute or imply approval of any other permit or approval which may be required for the development. 
(c)  No provision of this chapter shall be interpreted as limiting the authority of the hearings body or decision-making body to impose conditions as authorized elsewhere in this Code. 
(d)  Properties subject to review pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to the provisions set forth in this chapter, as well as the bulk use, setback and other provisions of the zoning district in which they are located.

ARTICLE III. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS[2] 
Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 908, adopted April 29, 2010, repealed the former Art. III in its entirety and enacted a new Art. III as set out herein. The former Art. III., Divs. 1-4, §§ 7-56-7-121 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 720, Arts. 1-5, adopted Dec. 5, 2000. 

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND PURPOSES 

Sec. 7-56. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Missouri has in RSMo 89.020 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Butler, Missouri, ordains as follows: 
(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 1, § A, 4-29-10) 
Sec. 7-57. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The special flood hazard areas of the City of Butler, Missouri, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 1, § B, 4-29-10) 
Sec. 7-58. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in subsection 7-57(a); to establish or maintain the community's eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(b) by applying the provisions of this article to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and 
(3)  Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard. 
(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 1, § C, 4-29-10) 
Secs. 7-59-7-65. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 7-66. - Lands to which article applies. 
    This article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Butler identified as unnumbered A zones on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Bates County dated May 3, 2010, on panel numbers 29013C0200C and 29013C0325C as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this article, no development shall be permitted, except through the issuance of a floodplain development permit granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community, and as specifically noted in division 5. 
(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 2, § A, 4-29-10) 
Sec. 7-67. - Floodplain administrator. 
    The city administrator is hereby designated as the floodplain administrator under this article. 
(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 2, § B, 4-29-10) 
Sec. 7-68. - Compliance. 
    No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 2, § C, 4-29-10) 
Sec. 7-69. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
    It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this article shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 2, § D, 4-29-10) 
Sec. 7-70. - Interpretation. 
    In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 2, § E, 4-29-10) 
Sec. 7-71. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside unnumbered A zones or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This article shall not create a liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 2, § F, 4-29-10) 
Sec. 7-72. - Severability. 
    If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this article is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected thereby.

(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above base flood level. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in subsection 7-88(7)c. 
(3)  Require for all new construction and substantial improvements that fully-enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 5, § C, 4-29-10) 
Sec. 7-129. - Floodplain management variance criteria. 
    In passing upon such applications for variances, the zoning board of adjustments shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article, and the following criteria: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to flood damage; 
(2)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, streets, and bridges. 
(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 5, § D, 4-29-10) 
Sec. 7-130. - Conditions for approving floodplain management variances. 
(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (b) through (f) below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(f)  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article. 
(Ord. No. 908, § Art. 5, § E, 4-29-10) 
Sec. 7-131. - Conditions for approving variances for accessory structures. 
    Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case-by-case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in sections 7-129 and 7-130 of this article. 
    In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures that are constructed at grade and wet floodproofed. 
(1)  Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM). 
(2)  For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with subsection 7-106(c)(2) of this article. 
(3)  The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure in accordance with subsection 7-106(c)(1) of this article. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces. 
(4)  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with subsection 7-106(c)(4) of this article. 
(5)  The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with subsection 7-107(a)(3) of this article. 
(6)  The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway encroachment provisions of subsection 7-107(b)(2) of this article. No variances may be issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway, if any increase in flood levels would result during the 100-year flood. 
(7)  Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage. 
(8)  No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any federal agency shall be paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures. 
(9)  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article. 
(10)  Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community and registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction.

(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, or 
(3)  Any improvement to a building. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of reconstruction, alteration, or improvement to a building, taking place during the life of the building, in which the cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the current market value of the building. For the purposes of this definition, an improvement occurs when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. This term includes structures, which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done. 
The term does not apply to: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, or

Editor's note- Ord. No. 949, § 1, adopted June 19, 2012, repealed former Art. IX, §§ 13-291-13-297, and enacted a new Art. IX as set out herein. Former Art. IX pertained to the same subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 659, § A, adopted Oct. 7, 1997. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 13-291. - Statement of intent. 
(a)  The intent of the city council in passing the ordinance from which this article derives is to provide a means of protecting the health and safety of persons who occupy residential dwelling units within rental property (as defined in section 13-26) in the city. The residential occupancy permit system is not designed to impose any undue hardship on the property owners by causing them to make unnecessary and costly improvements to their respective properties, but rather to provide safe and sanitary dwelling units, particularly rental units, to future residents of our community. 
(b)  The residential occupancy permit process will not require that existing dwelling units be brought up to our present new construction building code standards. Rather, the residential occupancy permit inspection will check for health and safety measures and sanitation. Exterior areas will also be inspected to insure that they are clear of trash and debris when the new occupant moves into the particular dwelling unit. The inspections will check for serious electrical, plumbing, structural and other defects as well as acceptable levels of sanitation. Major deficiencies will be cause to deny the permit until corrected. Existing dwelling units will not be expected to meet all the new construction code standards. 
(Ord. No. 949, § 1, 6-19-12) 
Sec. 13-292. - Remedies not exclusive. 
    The remedies provided in this section are not exclusive. They are in addition to, and do not supersede or preempt, other remedies such as condemnation, written violation orders and warnings, criminal charges for violation of substantive provisions of any city or state code relating to housing maintenance, fire safety, building codes, zoning, health, and the like. Further, the remedies in this section do not supersede or affect the legal rights and remedies of tenants and landlords provided under state law or this Code.

Sec. 13-297. - Permit required for occupancy of all residential dwelling units. 
(a)  No person shall allow to be occupied, or shall rent to another for occupancy, any dwelling unit within a rental property without first receiving a residential occupancy permit from the city under the terms of this section. 
(b)  No city owned or controlled utilities will be turned on for any residential dwelling unit, unless and until a valid residential occupancy permit for such residential dwelling unit has been issued and is currently in effect. 
(1)  All residential dwelling units shall be inspected for conformance to the International Property Maintenance Code for minimum housing, building and sanitation standards, and including but not limited to roof repair and water damage, pest inspection, and all applicable dangerous buildings, nuisance, weed and junk ordinance provisions, before a residential occupancy permit shall be issued. 
(c)  No residential occupancy permit will be issued if the residential dwelling unit does not have an off-street parking space within one thousand (1,000) feet of the main building structure of such residential dwelling unit. 
(d)  In cases of emergency or other unique circumstances, the fire chief or his authorized representative may authorize occupancy prior to inspection and the securing of a residential occupancy permit, provided the inspection and permit are issued as soon as practical. If the unit does not pass inspection, the fire chief or his authorized representative may allow necessary repairs to be made or he/she may direct the occupant to vacate the unit, depending on the severity of the deficiencies. 
(e)  A residential occupancy permit for newly constructed dwelling units within newly constructed rental property shall not be the same as the final building permit inspection and shall be valid until such time as the initial tenant vacates the unit, provided that the final building permit inspection required as a part of satisfying the provisions of the building code have been met prior to occupancy. 
(f)  A landlord, agent, builder, developer, or other party involved in the provision of housing shall secure a residential occupancy permit by any prospective occupants. An "open" permit valid for ninety (90) days may be secured for vacant units prior to the designation of the prospective occupant. However, after ninety (90) days or each time occupancy changes in a dwelling unit, a new residential occupancy permit shall be required.

(g)  Violation as an offense. Pursuant to section 16-4, property owners and/or non-owner occupants may also be charged with violations of the provisions of this section for "failure to abate a nuisance" in the municipal court, and if found guilty to or if a guilty plea is entered, may be fined according to the schedules set forth in section 16-4.

(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-53. - Rights-of-way use agreement, license, or franchise required; requirements. 
(a)  ROW use agreement, license, or franchise required. Except where otherwise authorized or required by applicable law, no person may own, control, lease, use, or install facilities or other structures in the rights-of-way without a franchise, license, or ROW use agreement all subject to the requirements of this chapter and issued by the city as provided herein and as follows: 
(1)  Franchise. A franchise shall be obtained in conformance with all applicable franchise procedures for any ROW user seeking to use the rights-of-way for the purpose of providing, transporting or distributing electricity, gas, water, steam, lighting, energy, or sewer service to any person or area in the city's limits and boundaries. 
(2)  ROW use agreement. A ROW use agreement shall be required for all other ROW users, except as provided herein or otherwise required by law. A ROW use agreement shall conform to all applicable laws and requirements, including as provided herein, but shall not be subject to procedures applicable to franchises. 
(3)  License for incidental uses. Persons desiring to install an incidental use, which includes installation of temporary structures or minor incidental uses in the rights-of-way, such as driveway aprons, ingress or egress facilities, and similar incidental uses, that utilize a small area of the rights-of-way and serves the principal structure, may be permitted without a franchise or rights-of-way use agreement pursuant to a license issued by the director. The director shall have discretion to establish such application, requirements, and conditions applicable to such uses consistent with the purposes of this chapter or as otherwise established by law. The applicant shall be required to pay an application fee and an inspection fee as established by the city. Any person granted a license hereunder shall be subject to the applicable requirements of this chapter. Unless otherwise stated in the license, a license shall be for an indefinite term and shall be revocable at any time on written notice in the public interest by the city. 
(b)  Grant and nature of approval; terms and compensation. The authority granted by the city in any ROW use agreement, license or franchise shall be for non-exclusive use of the rights-of-way. Such grant does not in any way limit the continuing authority of the city through the proper exercise of its statutory powers to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional agreements or other rights to use the rights-of-way for any purpose and to any other person, including itself, as it deems appropriate, subject to all applicable laws. The granting of any ROW use agreement, license or franchise by the city shall not be deemed to create any property interest of any kind in favor of the ROW user nor shall it create any relationship of agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment between the parties. Licenses may be approved by the director on a non-discriminatory basis provided that the person is in compliance with all applicable requirements. Each franchise, license, and ROW use agreement shall include terms of use and be deemed to incorporate the terms of this chapter and other applicable laws of the city, except as may be expressly stated in such use agreement, license or franchise. The city may require compensation for use of the ROW or other public property as may be reasonably required by the city council, subject to applicable law. 
(c)  Condition precedent to permit. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, no permit may be issued unless or until such person has a valid franchise, license or rights-of-way use agreement with the city that authorizes that person's use of the rights-of-way. Unless prohibited by applicable law, in addition to any other reason provided herein, the director may deny a ROW permit to any person that does not have a valid franchise, ROW use agreement, or license with the city. 
(d)  Transferability. Except as provided in this chapter or as otherwise required by law, no franchise, ROW use agreement, or permit may be transferred or assigned without the written application to and consent of the city based on the requirements and policies of this chapter. The city shall not unreasonably withhold its consent as provided herein, but any costs incurred shall be paid by the ROW user to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. In the case of the city granting consent to transfer, the transferee shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter. 
(e)  Use of city or third-party facilities. No ROW use agreement, franchise, or license shall grant the right to use facilities owned or controlled by the city or a third party, and no such use shall occur, nor shall any franchise, ROW use agreement or license excuse such person from first obtaining a pole attachment agreement or other express consent for such right or use before locating on the facilities controlled or owned by the city or a third party. 
(f)  Lease required for public lands. Unless otherwise provided, use or installation of any facilities in non-rights-of-way public property of the city shall be permitted only if a lease agreement or other separate written approval has been negotiated and approved by the city with such reasonable terms as the city may require. 
(g)  ROW user fees. 
(1)  User fee. Unless otherwise established by the city council or applicable law, each ROW user shall pay to the city as compensation for use of the public way, a user fee as follows: 
a.  Linear foot fee: A monthly payment of $0.165 per linear foot of facilities located in the rights-of-way, but not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per month, for an annual amount of one dollar and ninety-eight cents ($1.98) per linear foot of facilities in the rights-of-way; and 
b.  "Fast-track" linear foot fee: A monthly payment of $0.0825 per linear foot of facilities located in the rights-of-way, but not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per month, for an annual amount of ninety-nine cents ($0.99) per linear foot of facilities in the rights-of-way. The following "fast-track" linear foot fee shall only be applicable to facilities that are located and operating between at least two (2) separate "fast-track" small wireless facilities and shall otherwise be inapplicable to other linear foot facilities in the rights-of-way. If ROW user has more than one-half (1/2) of all its facilities located and operating between "fast-track" small wireless facilities, the "fast-track" linear foot fee minimum monthly amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per month shall apply; otherwise the minimum one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per month per linear foot of facilities in the rights-of-way shall apply; 
Provided that all ROW users shall be entitled to a credit against the user fee due hereunder equal to the payment(s) from such ROW user in accordance with RSMo 67.1846; provided, however, such credit cannot exceed the amount due under this subsection and may not be carried forward or back to any other time period and a credit shall not apply to any taxes paid under protest or otherwise paid with qualification unless so required by law. 
(2)  Bundled services. The ROW user expressly acknowledges and agrees that to the extent it markets bundled services, including a combination of goods or services, it will fairly reflect to the city an appropriate and reasonable division of services among the various services offered based on the actual value of each separate service. Whether or not the ROW user separates services on a subscriber's bill, it will provide to the city notice of any such allocation sufficient for city verification. Should the ROW user engage in billing or payment practices that, in the reasonable determination of the city, do not fairly reflect a fair and appropriate allocation, the city may nullify such allocation and require payment applicable to the full receipts. 
(3)  Timing of payment of user fees. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, all ROW user fees shall be due and payable every month of each calendar year within thirty (30) days after the end of each such month. A credit of the applicable gross receipts tax for that same period may be taken against the linear foot payment for that month. 
(4)  Interest of late payments and underpayments. If any ROW user fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest on the payment and interest on the unpaid balance shall accrue from the due date until received, at a rate of one and one-half (1.5) percent per month of the total amount past due or at such other lower rate as may be required by applicable law. 
(5)  Fee statement; retroactive adjustments. Each ROW user fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement, certified as true, showing the manner in which the ROW user fee was calculated including the total number of feet of ROW occupied by the ROW user's facilities, the per foot linear foot rate applied, including any "fast-track" linear rate applied, any credit or adjustment taken (including setting forth the prior month's gross revenue and describing what revenues or receipts were included and excluded in the fee paid), and the payment of the user fee made. If any fee statement is determined to understate the fee owed, the such additional amount owed shall be made with a corrected statement, including interest on said amount as provided herein. No refund, credit, or offset shall be granted for any claimed payment or overstatement of the amount due to certification of facilities reported, provided that a corrected payment or report may be filed within the time of the original time for payment. 
(6)  No accord and satisfaction. No acceptance by the city of any user fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any use fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the city. 
(7)  Maintain records. ROW users shall at all times maintain complete and accurate books of account and records of the business, ownership, and operations of the ROW user with respect to the facilities in a manner that allows the city to determine whether the ROW user has properly calculated its user fee in compliance with this section. Should the city reasonably determine that the records are not being maintained in such a manner, the ROW user shall correct the manner in which the books and/or records are maintained so that the ROW user comes into compliance with this section. All financial books and records which are maintained in accordance with FCC regulations and the regulations of any governmental entity that regulates utilities in Missouri, and generally accepted accounted principles shall be deemed to be acceptable under this section. Such books and records shall be maintained for a period of at least three (3) years. 
(8)  Right of inspection. The city or its designated representatives shall have the right to inspect, examine, or audit, during normal business hours and upon seven (7) calendar days' notice, all documents, records, or other information that pertains to the facilities within the ROW and/or ROW user's user fee obligations. In addition to access to the records of the ROW user for audits, upon request, the ROW user shall provide reasonable access to records necessary to verify compliance with the terms of this section. 
(9)  Fees and compensation not a tax. The fees and costs provided for in this section, and any compensation charged and paid for use of the ROW as provided for in this section, are separate from, and additional to, any and all federal, state, city or other local taxes as may be levied, imposed, or due. 
(h)  No warranties. The city makes no express or implied representation or warranty regarding its rights to authorize the installation or construction of facilities on any particular segment of rights-of-way and shall not be liable for any damages therefrom. The burden and responsibility for making all such determinations in advance of construction or installation shall be entirely upon the ROW user. The ROW user shall be solely liable for any damages to facilities or other property due to excavation, facilities maintenance, or other work performed prior to obtaining the location of all facilities that have been properly identified prior to such work or around. The ROW user shall not make or attempt to make repairs, relocation or replacement of damaged or disturbed facilities without the approval of the owner of the facilities. 
(i)  Forfeiture of agreement and privilege. In case of failure on the part of the ROW user, including its successors and assigns, to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or a ROW use agreement, franchise, or license, or if the ROW user, its successors and assigns should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of this chapter or the terms of the authorization of such use, or otherwise loses authority to provide its service in the city, the ROW user, its successors and assigns shall forfeit all rights and privileges permitted by any ROW use agreement, franchise, or license, and all rights hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, provided that said forfeiture shall not take effect until the city shall carry out the following proceedings: before the city declares the forfeiture or revocation of a rights-of-way use agreement, franchise, or license, it shall first serve a written notice upon the person setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and the person shall have thirty (30) days thereafter, or such other reasonable period established by the director, in which to cure the default by complying with the conditions of such ROW use agreement, franchise, or license and fully remedying any default or violation. If at the end of such period the city determines that the conditions have not been complied with and that the person did not reasonably and in the public interest require more than the establish time to cure the default, the city shall take action by an affirmative vote of the city council present at the meeting and voting to terminate the ROW use agreement, franchise, or license, setting out the grounds upon which said authorization is to be forfeited or revoked. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from invoking any other remedy or from declaring immediate forfeiture where the default is incapable of being cured by the ROW user, including where such defaults or violations have repeatedly occurred. 
(j)  No waiver. No action or omission of the city shall operate as a future waiver of any rights of the city under this chapter. Except where rights are expressly granted or waived by a ROW permit, ROW use agreement, franchise, or license they are reserved, whether or not expressly enumerated. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-54. - Application for franchise or ROW use agreement required. 
(a)  Application Form. An application for a franchise or ROW use agreement shall be provided to the city on city forms and shall include all such information as is required by this chapter and as determined necessary by the director. The ROW user shall be responsible for accurately maintaining the information in the application during the term of any franchise or ROW use agreement and shall be responsible for all costs incurred by the city due to the failure to provide or maintain as accurate any application information required herein. 
(b)  Application deposit fee. An application deposit of five hundred dollars ($500.00), or such other amount determined to be required, shall be submitted with the application, which shall be utilized to at least partly offset the city's costs in reviewing and issuing an agreement, consistent with applicable law provided that no costs shall be included if such inclusion is prohibited by applicable law as to that person; any amount not used by the city for its actual lawfully reimbursable costs will be refunded upon request after execution of a ROW use agreement or franchise. If applicable, the applicant shall be obligated to reimburse the city for its reasonable expenses associated with the review, negotiation, and adoption of an appropriate ROW use agreement or franchise that may exceed the application deposit. 
(c)  Standard for approval or renewal. In reviewing an application for a new or renewal ROW use agreement or franchise, the city may consider prior conduct of the person in performance of its obligations or compliance with the city's ordinances in the past, or the existence of any outstanding violations or deficiencies. The city may deny or condition any ROW use agreement or franchise where the proposed use would interfere with the public use of the rights-of-way or otherwise conflict with the legitimate public interests of the city to fulfill the requirements and objectives of this chapter or as otherwise provided by law. All ROW use agreements or franchises by ordinance or resolution of the city council and applications shall be decided on a non-discriminatory basis and shall be approved, conditioned or denied based on compliance with all applicable requirements herein, and conformance with applicable law and the public interest. 
(d)  Approval process. After submission by the applicant of a duly executed and completed application, deposit fee, and executed franchise or rights-of-way use agreement as may be provided by the director or as modified by the director in review of the specific circumstances of the application, all in conformity with the requirements of this chapter and all applicable laws, the director shall submit such agreement to the city council for approval. Upon determining compliance with this chapter, the city council may authorize execution of the franchise or ROW use agreement (or a modified agreement otherwise acceptable to the city consistent with the purposes of this chapter) and such executed franchise or ROW use agreement shall constitute consent to use the rights-of-way; provided that nothing herein shall preclude the rejection or modification of any executed franchise or ROW use agreement submitted to the city to the extent applicable law does not prohibit such rejection or modification, including where necessary to reasonably and in a uniform or non-discriminatory manner reflect the distinct engineering, construction, operation, maintenance, public work, or safety requirements applicable to the person or use. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-55. - Use by third-parties and reseller service provider requirements. 
(a)  ROW user authority; obligations. A ROW user is authorized, subject to other applicable requirements, to sell or transfer use of excess capacity to reseller service providers or other entities, provided that such entity either: (1) has no right to and does not physically access the facilities while in the ROW, or (2) has a separate franchise or ROW use agreement or other written agreement or consent authorizing the same with the city. In the event of such sale or transfer to a reseller service provider, the ROW user shall notify the city of the same prior to such action so that the city can review compliance regarding doing business in the city. This notice shall not relieve the reseller service provider from its own obligation to register, pay taxes, and obtain any necessary authorization from the city. 
(b)  Registration of reseller service providers and exempt entities. 
(1)  Reseller service provider registration. Prior to providing service (including sale or transfer of product or service) within the city or acquiring or using excess capacity through facilities in the city, reseller service providers shall register with the city the intent to do so and shall include: (1) identity of the reseller service provider and certification of the applicable regulatory approval necessary to undertake such service, (2) the name of the provider(s) owning the facilities within the city through which the service shall be transmitted; (3) name, address, telephone number, and email address of an officer, agent or employee responsible for the accuracy of the registration, and contact information for a person to speak on behalf of the reseller service provider, if different; and (4) such other information as requested by the director. It shall be unlawful for any reseller service provider to have its own facilities in the rights-of-way, have the right to physically access the facilities in the rights-of-way, or to transmit service for commercial purposes through any facility owned by a person without a valid franchise, rights-of-way use agreement, or other city authorization for such facilities. It shall be the duty of a reseller service provider to report any changes to its registration information within thirty (30) days of such change. 
(2)  Exempt entity registration. Prior to providing service within the city, transmitting communications through facilities in the city, or constructing in the rights-of-way, entities not required to obtain a franchise, license, or rights-of-way use agreement due to superseding federal or state law, shall nevertheless be required to register with the city by providing the city the information required by the rights-of-way application in section 21-54. It shall be the duty of such exempt entity to report any changes to such registration information within thirty (30) days of such change. 
(c)  Reseller service provider obligations. Any reseller service provider that buys or leases excess capacity or other services for resale from a ROW user, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter, including the requirement to first register with the city and obtain any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration, franchise agreement or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the city, public service commission or the federal communications commission. If a person through such lease or purchase owns facilities in the rights-of-way or has the right to physically access or maintain any facilities in the rights-of-way, then such person no longer meets the definition of a reseller service provider and is required to first obtain a franchise, license, or rights-of-way use agreement as required herein. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-56. - Permit required; requirements. 
(a)  Excavation permit required. Except as otherwise provided herein, no ROW user or other person shall perform excavation work in the ROW without an excavation permit. Any person desiring to excavate in the ROW shall first apply for an excavation permit, on an application form provided by the city, and submit the application fee and pay all applicable fees to obtain an excavation permit, in addition to any other building permit, license, easement, or other authorization required by law, unless such excavation must be performed on an emergency basis as provided herein. The cost of said permit shall be set out by the director. The director is authorized to draft an application form consistent with the requirements of this chapter. An excavation permit should be obtained for each project unless otherwise provided for in this chapter. A separate special permit or lease shall be required for excavation in or use of any real property interest of the city that is not ROW. It shall be unlawful for any person to perform excavation work within the city at any time other than from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Monday through Friday without prior approval from the city, except in the case of an emergency. No work shall be performed during city holidays, except in the case of an emergency. All excavation permits shall expire after sixty (60) days from the date of issuance, unless otherwise specified in the excavation permit. An applicant whose excavation permit application has been withdrawn, abandoned or denied for failure to comply with this chapter shall not be refunded the application fee. 
(b)  Local representative designation. Each ROW user shall designate a local person familiar with the facilities that shall act as a local agent for the ROW user and shall be responsible for satisfying information requirements of this chapter. The ROW user shall present to the city the agent's name, address, telephone number, and email address. The agent shall be the person to whom relocation notices and other such notices shall be sent, and with whom rests the responsibility to facilitate all necessary communications. The ROW user shall be responsible for all costs incurred by the city due to the failure to provide such information to the city. 
(c)  Facilities maintenance permit; exemptions. No person shall perform facilities maintenance at a specified location in the rights-of-way without first obtaining a facilities maintenance permit from the director, except where such facilities maintenance is expressly authorized by an existing valid excavation permit for the applicable facilities maintenance location or is exempt herein. In addition to the applicable conditions and obligations set forth in this chapter, conditions of a facilities maintenance permit shall be as established in such permit and shall include requirements of notice to and approval by the city whenever traffic lanes are to be obstructed, manhole covers or safety barriers removed or altered, temporary or other barricades installed, and other events set forth in the facilities maintenance permit. All facilities maintenance permits shall expire after sixty (60) days from the date of issuance, unless otherwise specified in such permit. A facilities maintenance permit shall not be required for: 
(1)  ROW users performing routine maintenance which does not require excavation, does not disrupt traffic or pedestrians, and requires no more than four (4) hours to complete, provided that at minimum two (2) hours' notice is provided to the city during normal business hours; 
(2)  Emergency situations as more fully described in subsection (e) below; or 
(3)  Contractors working on the construction or reconstruction of public improvements and which are operating pursuant to a contract with the city for such construction; or 
(4)  Routine maintenance on previously approved small wireless facilities, replacement of small wireless facilities that are the same or smaller in size, weight, and height, or installation placement, maintenance, operation, or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are strung on cables between utility poles in compliance with applicable safety and building codes, when such work will not involve excavation, affect traffic patterns, obstruct traffic in the ROW, or materially impede the use of a sidewalk, and provided the ROW user submits as-builts of the new small wireless facilities or micro wireless facilities so the city may maintain an accurate inventory of facilities installed in the ROW. 
(d)  Bulk permits. The director shall have the authority to establish procedures for bulk processing of applications and periodic payment of fees. 
(e)  Emergencies. In the event of an emergency requiring immediate attention to remedy defects, and in order to avoid loss of damage to person or property, it shall be sufficient that the person conducting the work shall as soon as practicable notify the city of the location of the work and shall apply for the required ROW permit as soon as practicable following the commencement of the work, not to exceed the third business day thereafter, or as otherwise directed by the city. In the event the city becomes aware of an emergency requiring facilities work the city shall attempt to contact a representative of each ROW user affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency work. If no response is received by a particular ROW user to whom contact is attempted, the director may take whatever action he/she deems necessary to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the person whose action or inaction occasioned the emergency or by the ROW user if the emergency was occasioned by an act of nature. 
(f)  ROW permit specific conditions. The director may also impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of a permit and the performance of work in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, to ensure the structural integrity of the rights-of-way, to protect the property and safety of other users of the rights-of-way, and to minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public. Such reasonable conditions may include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  The amount of excavation or facilities maintenance which may occur at one (1) time and the amount of rights-of-way which may be obstructed during construction; 
(2)  The number or size of conduits or other facilities that may be installed by each ROW user based on the reasonable needs to ensure that no one (1) ROW user may unreasonably consume a disproportionate amount of the available rights-of-way to deter competition or deprive the public or others of the reasonable use of the rights-of-way; 
(3)  Posting of an additional or larger performance and maintenance bond for additional facilities, except as otherwise provided in section 21-62(h) hereof, when the established amount is reasonably determined to be insufficient; 
(4)  The design, location, and nature of all facilities, based on a nondiscriminatory basis in ensuring the safe, efficient, and appropriate use of the ROW consistent with this chapter and applicable law; and 
(5)  Other reasonable conditions regarding the timing, safety precautions, space, or specific implementation of the specific work proposed. 
(g)  Codes incorporated. Every permit issued hereunder shall incorporate the requirements and terms of this chapter, agreements, and all applicable ordinances, to the extent permitted by law. The ROW user shall perform such work in accordance with the issued permit and applicable provisions of this chapter and any subsequent ordinances or regulations that may be adopted by the city regarding excavation or facilities maintenance work. In addition, all ROW users shall be subject to all technical specifications, design criteria, policies, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the city in the reasonable exercise of its police power relating to permits and fees, sidewalk and pavement cuts, facility location, construction coordination, surface restoration, and other requirements on the use of the rights-of-way. A ROW user shall perform all excavations or facilities maintenance in full compliance with all applicable engineering codes adopted or approved by the city, and in accordance with applicable statutes of the State of Missouri, and the rules and regulations of the public service commission, federal communications commission, and any other local, state or federal agency having jurisdiction over the parties. The ROW user shall comply with the excavation requirements of Missouri One Call established by RSMo 319.010 et seq., as amended. A ROW user shall be responsible for all excavations or facilities maintenance done in the rights-of-way on its behalf, regardless of by whom the excavation or facilities maintenance is done. 
(h)  Tree and landscape protection. Upon ten (10) days' written notice and with the supervision of the city or as otherwise provided by law or agreement, the city may permit a ROW user to trim trees that overhang rights-of-way of the city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with facilities in the ROW, at its own expense, subject to the supervision and direction of the city. Nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the trimming of trees on private property without permission of the property owner. All cut materials shall be properly disposed. Unless otherwise approved in writing by the city, a ROW user shall not remove, cut or damage any trees or their roots in the rights-of-way. In reviewing any permit application, the city may require the applicant to directionally bore around or otherwise avoid disturbance to any tree or landscaping, existing facility, or other protected area in the rights-of-way. 
(i)  Permit displayed. At all times during the work, permits shall be conspicuously displayed at the work site and shall be available for inspection by the director. 
(j)  Modification requiring new permit. If at any time it appears that the duration or scope of the work is or will become materially different from that allowed by the permit, the ROW user shall inform the director. The director may issue a waiver, an extension or revised permit, or require that the ROW user reapply for a permit in accordance with all requirements of this chapter. 
(k)  Joint permit applications. Applicants may apply jointly for permits in the rights-of-way at the same time and place. All joint applicants must jointly execute all required documents and shall be jointly and severally liable for all duties and obligations hereunder. Persons who apply jointly may share in the payment of the application deposit fee. Such persons must agree among themselves as to the portion each shall pay. 
(l)  Notification, joint installation, and collocation. ROW users shall, prior to any excavation or installation in the rights-of-way, provide sufficient notification and joint installation opportunity on a shared-cost basis to potential users of the rights-of-way as may be provided for by separate city policy. Such notification and adopted policies shall be designed to maximize collocation of ROW users, to minimize the disturbance to the rights-of-way, and maximize its useable capacity. ROW users shall identify by mapping, as required by the director, the location and specifications of all conduit available or dedicated for collocation. Any person unreasonably failing to respond to collocation opportunities or otherwise comply with this provision or policies adopted hereunder shall, unless good cause is found by the city, be precluded from use of the rights-of-way for a period of thirty (30) months at such locations that would reasonably have been accommodated by the collocation opportunity that was declined. 
(m)  Subsurface utility engineering survey. Unless determined by the director as unnecessary, prior to the commencement of any construction or alteration of its facilities located in the rights-of-way, the ROW user shall furnish to the director a subsurface utility engineering study on the proposed route of construction, expansion, or alteration, which shall consist of the following tasks: 
(1)  All available plans, plats, and other location data indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along the proposed construction route; 
(2)  Completion of a visual survey and written record of the location and dimensions of any above-ground features of any underground facilities along the proposed construction route including, but not limited to, manholes, pedestals, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut repairs; 
(3)  Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of tasks (1) and (2) above onto the provider's proposed facilities route maps, plan sheets, and computer-aided drafting and design (CADD) files; and 
(4)  Provide all such data collected into a CADD file (or other format as may be identified by the director) compatible with that used by the director and deliver a copy to the director. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-57. - Permit fees. 
(a)  A rights-of-way permit fee shall be paid to the city in such amounts as established by the city council and, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law, shall be based on the actual costs incurred in managing the rights-of-way and calculated as provided for by RSMo 67.1840 or other applicable law. 
(b)  Unless hereinafter established by the council or preempted by applicable law, the fees for rights-of-way permits are hereby amended and reestablished as provided by law as follows: 
(1)  Excavations: 
a.  In asphalt, macadam, concrete or other improved surface, a linear foot charge of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the first fifteen (15) linear feet, then three dollars ($3.00) per linear feet thereafter. 
b.  In unimproved surface (e.g. grass, soil) a linear foot charge of fifty dollars ($50.00) for the first fifteen (15) linear feet, then one dollar ($1.00) per linear feet thereafter. 
(2)  Driveway/apron installations and construction. See City Code sections 21-135-21-145. 
(3)  Miscellaneous facilities. Other activities or facilities in the ROW shall be permitted subject to a fee based on the estimated actual costs, including hourly time for inspections and other costs reasonably anticipated by the project. A deposit for such fee may be established where actual costs are not reasonably ascertainable at the time of application. 
(c)  In the event the scope of the project is revised during the course of the excavation or work, the city administrator may recalculate the fee based on the actual size of the excavation or work and may require an additional rights-of-way permit fee. 
(d)  The city administrator may establish, with the approval of the city council, a system providing for payment of rights-of-way permit fees by ROW-users in bulk. 
Nothing herein shall preclude the city from charging any other or additional fee for use of the rights-of-way where such fee is consistent with applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-58. - Permit denial. 
    The director may deny an application for a permit if: 
(1)  To the extent permitted by law, the person does not have a current franchise, license, or rights-of-way use agreement, or other authorization with the city. 
(2)  The ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, fails to provide all the necessary information requested by the city for managing the rights-of-way. 
(3)  The ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, including contractors or subcontractors, has a history of noncompliance or permitting noncompliance within the city. For purposes of this section, "history of noncompliance or permitting noncompliance within the city" shall include where the ROW user, or any persons acting on the behalf of the ROW user, including contractors or subcontractors, has failed to return the rights-of-way to its previous condition under a previous permit, or has violated terms, or is in violation of terms of the ROW users' franchise, rights-of-way use agreement, license, or other authorization with the city. 
(4)  The city has provided the ROW user with a reasonable, competitively neutral, and nondiscriminatory justification for requiring an alternative method for performing the excavation or facilities maintenance identified in the permit application, or a reasonable alternative route that will not result in additional installation expense of more than ten (10) percent to the ROW user or a declination of service quality. 
(5)  Any other violations or noncompliance caused by or through the ROW user of any applicable city, state, or federal law or regulation, except where such violation is prohibited by applicable law for being a basis for denial. 
(6)  The city determines that the denial is necessary to protect the public health and safety, provided that the authority of the city does not extend to those items under the jurisdiction of the PSC, such denial shall not interfere with a ROW user's right of eminent domain of private property, and such denials shall only be imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis. In determining whether denial of a permit application is necessary to protect the public health and safety, the director may consider one (1) or more of the following factors: 
a.  The extent to which the rights-of-way space where the permit is sought is available, including the consideration of competing demands for the particular space in the rights-of-way, or other general conditions of the rights-of-way; 
b.  The applicability of any ordinance, code provision, or other regulations that affect the location of facilities in the rights-of-way; 
c.  The degree and nature of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the rights-of-way, including whether the issuance of a permit for the particular dates and/or times requested would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event; 
d.  The area is environmentally sensitive as defined by state statute or federal law or is a historic district designated by city ordinance; and 
e.  The failure to comply with applicable city ordinances, or any other violation, unsafe conditions, or damage or threatened harm to the rights-of-way or public, except where such circumstance would otherwise not constitute a lawful basis for denial of a permit. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-59. - Permit revocation. 
    The director may, after reasonable notice and an opportunity to cure, revoke a permit without fee refund, but only in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and material conditions of the permit. A substantial breach by a ROW user includes but is not limited to: 
(1)  A material violation of a provision of the permit; 
(2)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens; 
(3)  A material misrepresentation of fact in the permit application; 
(4)  A failure to complete work by the date specified in the permit, unless a permit extension is obtained, or unless the failure to complete the work is due to reasons beyond the ROW user's control; 
(5)  A failure to correct, within the time specified by the city, work that does not conform to applicable national safety codes, industry construction standards, or local safety codes, upon inspection and notification by the city of the faulty condition; or 
(6)  Such other lawful reasons. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-60. - Location, design, and mapping of facilities. 
(a)  Exclusion of certain locations/facilities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the director may designate certain locations or facilities in the rights-of-way to be excluded from use by the ROW user, including but not limited to, ornamental or similar specially-designed street lights or other facilities or locations which, in the reasonable judgment of the director, do not have electrical service adequate or appropriate for the provider's facilities, or cannot safely bear the weight or wind loading thereof, or any other facility or location that in the reasonable judgment of the director is incompatible with the proposed facilities, or would be rendered unsafe or unstable by the installation. The director may further exclude certain other facilities that have been designated or planned for other use or are not otherwise available for use by the ROW user due to engineering, technological, proprietary, legal, or other limitations or restrictions as may be reasonably determined by the city. In the event such exclusions conflict with the reasonable requirements of the ROW user, the city will cooperate in good faith with the ROW user to attempt to find suitable alternatives, if available, provided that the city shall not be required to incur financial cost nor require the city to acquire new locations for the ROW user. 
(b)  Location, type, and design of facilities subject to approval. 
(1)  Review required. The design, location, and nature of all facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the director. Such review shall be on a non-discriminatory basis in application of city policy and approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld. City height limitations, applicable zoning restrictions, and general city policies with regard to all users of the rights-of-way shall be applicable to all facilities. The director may establish regulations or policies as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to affect this provision. 
(2)  Underground and collocation of facilities required; exceptions. Except as provided herein or where prohibited by applicable law, no person may erect, construct, or install facilities above the surface of the rights-of-way without the written permission of the city based on good cause established by applicant and found by the city. In addition, all new fiber optics, coaxial, and similar cable facilities shall be located within existing conduit, trenches, or other facilities to minimize unnecessary use of rights-of-way space, reduce potential existing or future interference and obstructions, and to reduce the cost to the public or others therefrom, and to maximize the public's ability to use and license appropriate private or public uses of the rights-of-way in the public interest except where preempted by law or where good cause is established and written permission granted by the city. Such permission may be granted by the city council when other similar facilities exist above-ground and conditions are such that underground construction is impossible, impractical or unfeasible, as determined by the city, and when in the city's judgment the above-ground construction has minimal aesthetic impact on the area where the construction is proposed. Where reasonable and appropriate and where adequate rights-of-way exists, the ROW user shall place above-ground facilities underground in conjunction with city capital improvement projects and/or at specific locations requested by the city provided that such placement is practical, efficient, and economically feasible. New utility poles and related ground mounted equipment shall be permitted to be installed above ground; provided, however, that to ensure unobstructed pedestrian use and city maintenance of the ROW and minimize visual obstructions for vehicular traffic, a new utility pole and any ground mounted equipment related to that utility pole or the equipment thereon shall not be installed within one hundred and fifty (150) feet of another utility pole or other ground mounted equipment on the same side of the ROW. A replacement utility pole that is installed in lieu of an existing utility pole and is installed within ten (10) feet of the existing utility pole, shall not be considered a new utility pole subject to the spacing requirements herein. Such spacing regulations as applied to that specific site may be altered by the director upon good cause shown within the application by the applicant. 
a.  Wireless antennas and facilities. Pursuant to city authority, including by RSMo 67.1830(f) and the uniform small wireless facility deployment act (RSMo 67.5110 et seq.), and due to the limited space in the city's rights-of-way and in order to minimize obstructions and interference with the use of the rights-of-way and to ensure traffic safety, while also seeking to facilitate delivery of broadband technologies to city residents and businesses, wireless facilities shall be permitted in the rights-of-way in compliance with the requirements applicable to other facilities and users in the rights-of-way, and the additional requirements set forth in this section for wireless antennas and facilities. 
General conditions. Any wireless facility in the ROW shall be subject to conditions relating to the location (including prohibited or limited locations), design, height, appearance, safety, radio-frequency, and other interference issues as may be lawfully imposed by the city where necessary or appropriate to protect the public, and to conform to policies and interests of the public as may be set forth in special district plans, historic areas, or other policies as may be reasonably adopted by the director to address changing infrastructure, technology, and uses of the rights-of-way and/or city facilities. A wireless facility shall not be located or installed in a manner that results in interference with or impairs the operation of existing utility facilities or city or third-party attachments. Wireless antennas or facilities shall further comply with (1) all applicable requirements for installation of any facilities in the ROW as set forth in this article including a ROW permit, (2) the requirements of this section, and (3) requirements for installation of wireless antennas and facilities set forth in the Uniform Wireless Communications Infrastructure Deployment Act (RSMo 67.5090 et seq.), Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act (RSMo 67.5110 et seq.), applicable zoning, building, and other regulations and approvals, specifically including chapter 26, article VI, division 6 on wireless facilities. 
b.  Specific conditions. 
1.  Small wireless facilities. Any small wireless facility meeting the requirements for small wireless facility as defined by section 26-283 and as provided in section 26-286 of the Zoning Code shall be authorized to be located in the rights-of-way with approval of the director subject to the following additional requirements: 
i.  If proposing to install a new utility pole, compliance with the spacing requirements in section 21-60(b)(2); 
ii.  Compliance with RSMo 67.5113.3(9) to the satisfaction of the city; 
iii.  For collocations on city utility poles, all make-ready estimates for the utility pole, including replacement costs where necessary for the safety and reliability of the utility pole, as determined by the city; 
iv.  Attestation that the proposed small wireless facility meets the volumetric requirements to meet the definition of a small wireless facility in section 26-283 of the Zoning Code; and 
v.  Any other requirements which may be applicable to the proposed small wireless facility pursuant to the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act (RSMo 67.5110 et seq.). 
2.  "Fast-track" small wireless collocation. Any wireless facility meeting the requirements of a "'fast-track' small wireless facility" as defined by section 26-283, and as provided in section 26-287(a)(2) of the Zoning Code, may be authorized to be located in the rights-of-way with approval of the director subject to the following additional requirements: 
i.  Attestation that the proposed facilities meet the volumetric requirements to meet the definition of "Fast Track" in section 26-283 of the Zoning Code; 
ii.  No ground equipment shall be authorized; 
iii.  If the proposed structure the applicant proposes to locate its "fast-track" small wireless facility is not structurally sound, but the director finds such to be a desired location, the director can require the applicant to install a new substantially similar structure at its cost; and 
iv.  Compliance with the spacing requirements in section 21-60(b)(2) if granted a waiver under the "fast-track" zoning procedure to install a new structure. 
3.  All other wireless in ROW. Any wireless facility located on a utility pole or existing structure but not meeting the requirements of subsection 1. small wireless facilities or subsection 2. "fast-track" small wireless collocation above, may be approved, subject to conditions as may be imposed consistent with the purposes of this section, only upon approval by the council upon a determination by the council that such wireless facility is: (1) in the public interest to provide a needed service to persons within the city, (2) cannot feasibly meet all of the requirements of a "small wireless facility," "fast-track" or otherwise, but varies from such requirements to the minimum extent necessary, (3) does not negatively impact appearance or property values in light of the location, design, and circumstances to be approved, (4) does not create any reasonable safety risk, and (5) complies with all zoning, ROW, and other applicable requirements. 
c.  Wireless facility compensation. If the small wireless facility or fast track is to be located on a city owned structure or utility pole, an annual payment of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per attachment shall be required. Nothing herein shall limit, waive, or otherwise affect the applicability of linear foot fees as may be required by a grandfathered political subdivision pursuant to RSMo 67.1846. 
(3)  Limited space. The city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional equipment in the rights-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of potential ROW users. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, public health and safety, the public's priority needs for the particular service, the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing equipment in the rights-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which are in the public interest. 
(4)  Limit number of ROW users. To the extent not prohibited by law, the city may limit the number of users in the rights-of-way in a competitively neutral manner, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, specific local considerations such as: 
a.  The capacity of the rights-of-way to accommodate current or future facilities, public improvements, or public use; 
b.  The impact on the community of the volume of facilities in the rights-of-way; 
c.  The disruption arising from the use of or numerous excavations of the rights-of-way; or 
d.  Any other consideration based upon the interests of the public safety and welfare. 
(c)  Mapping of facilities. Upon completion of the ROW work involving installation of new facilities, the ROW user shall supply the city copies of as-built and detailed maps showing the exact location of facilities installed in the ROW. As a condition of continued ROW use, all ROW users shall, on an annual basis, provide the city with as-builts or other detailed maps of the ROW user's current facilities. Such annual requirement may be waived by the director upon written request 
(d)  No interference. All ROW users shall construct and maintain its facilities so as not to interfere with other users of the rights-of-way. The ROW user shall not interfere with or alter the facilities of the city or other ROW user without their consent and shall be solely responsible for such. Except as may otherwise be provided or as determined by the director, the ROW user shall, prior to commencement of work, execute a city-approved resident-notification plan to notify residents affected by the proposed work. All construction and maintenance by the ROW user or its subcontractors shall be performed in accordance with industry standards. The ROW user shall, in the performance of any excavation, facilities maintenance, or other ROW work, limit such work to that necessary for efficient operation and so as not to interfere with other users of the rights-of-way. All facilities and other structures shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners, ROW users, and the city. Facilities and other structures shall not be placed where they will disrupt or interfere with other facilities, structures, or public improvements or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents and businesses in the city or public improvements. Above-ground facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such a manner so as not to emit any unnecessary or intrusive noise. When reasonable and necessary to accomplish such purposes, the director may require as alternatives to the proposed work either less disruptive methods or different locations for facilities consistent with applicable law. 
(e)  Subordinate uses. ROW user's use shall be in all situations subordinate and subject to public municipal use. In situations where multiple users are within the same location, first the municipal use shall have priority followed by Persons with a valid and current rights-of-way use agreement, franchise, or other authorization with the city, followed by all others. 
(f)  Site triangle maintained. ROW users shall comply with the requirements of site triangles and nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede vision within the triangular area formed by the rights-of-way lines and a line connecting them at points thirty (30) feet from their point of intersection or at equivalent points on private street. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-61. - Relocation of facilities. 
(a)  City required relocation. The ROW user shall promptly remove, relocate, or adjust any facilities located in the rights-of-way as directed by the city when such is required by public necessity, or public convenience and security require it, or such other findings in the public interest that may require relocation, adjustment, or removal at the cost of the ROW user. Such removal, relocation, or adjustment shall be performed by the ROW user within the time frames established by the city and at the ROW user's sole expense without any expense to the city, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors and shall be specifically subject to rules, regulations, and schedules of the city pertaining to such. 
(b)  Emergency exception. In the event of an emergency or where construction equipment or facilities create or are contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the city may, to the extent allowed by law, remove, re-lay, or relocate such construction equipment or the pertinent parts of such facilities without charge to the city for such action or for restoration or repair. The city shall attempt to notify the person having facilities in the rights-of-way prior to taking such action, but the inability to do so shall not prevent same. Thereafter, the city shall notify the person having facilities in the rights-of-way as soon as practicable. 
(c)  Third-party relocation. A person having facilities in the rights-of-way shall, on the reasonable request of any person, other than the city, holding a validly issued permit, after reasonable advance written notice, protect, support, or temporarily disconnect or relocate facilities to accommodate such person and the actual cost, reasonably incurred, of such actions shall be paid by the person requesting such action. The person having facilities in the rights-of-way taking such action may require such payment in advance. 
(d)  Abandonment exception. Rather than relocate facilities as requested or directed, a ROW user may abandon the facilities if approved by the city as provided in subsection (g) of this section. 
(e)  ROW user responsible for damage. Any damages suffered by the city, its agents or its contractors to the extent caused by the ROW user's failure to timely relocate, remove or adjust its facilities, or failure to properly relocate, remove, or adjust such facilities, shall be borne by the ROW user. Where the ROW user shall fail to relocate facilities as required by the city, the city may, but shall not be required to, upon notice to the ROW user remove the obstructing facilities with or without further delay and the ROW user shall bear all responsibility and liability for the consequences therefrom, and the city shall bear no responsibility to the ROW user or others for damage resulting from such removal. 
(f)  No vested rights. No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of property and no person shall be entitled to any compensation therefor. No location of any facilities in the rights-of-way shall be a vested interest or property right. 
(g)  Abandoned facilities; removal. A person owning abandoned facilities in the rights-of-way must not later than thirty (30) days of notice or of abandonment remove its facilities and replace or restore any damage or disturbance caused by the removal at its own expense. The director may upon written application and written approval allow underground facilities or portions thereof to remain in place if the director determines that it is in the best interest of public health, safety, and general welfare to do so. The city shall be entitled to all costs of removal and enforcement for any violation of this provision. 
(h)  Nuisance. Facilities abandoned or otherwise left unused in violation of this chapter are deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, (a) abating the nuisance, (b) taking possession and ownership of the facility and restoring it to a useable function, or (c) requiring the removal of the facility by the ROW user. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-62. - ROW user responsibilities and requirements. 
(a)  Compliance with laws. Each ROW user shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations and rules as well as all city ordinances, resolutions, rules, and regulations heretofore and hereafter adopted or established. 
(b)  Zoning, safety, and building code compliance. ROW users shall at all times be subject to the lawful exercise of the police powers of the city, including but not limited to all police powers regarding zoning, supervision of the restoration of the rights-of-way, building and safety regulations, and control of the rights-of-way currently in effect or as may be amended. Installation of all facilities in the rights-of-way are subject to and must be in compliance with all zoning and safety and building code requirements. For applications for installation of any facility in the rights-of-way, (1) the most restrictive adjacent underlying zoning district classification shall apply unless otherwise specifically zoned and designated on the official zoning district map, and (2) no application shall be submitted for approval without attaching the city's consent to use the rights-of-way for the specific construction application in accordance with RSMo ch. 67 and compliance with this chapter. 
(c)  No cause of action against the city. As a condition for use of the rights-of-way, a ROW user shall have no damages, remedy, or monetary recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising from any of the provisions or requirements of any ROW use agreement, franchise, or license, or because of the enforcement thereof by said city, or from the use of the rights-of-way. Nothing herein shall preclude the ROW user from seeking injunctive or declaratory judgment relief against the city where such relief is otherwise available and the requirements therefor are otherwise satisfied. 
(d)  Maintenance of facilities. Each ROW user shall maintain its facilities in good and safe condition and in a manner that complies with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements. 
(e)  Advertising, signs, or extraneous markings. ROW users shall not place or cause to be placed any sort of signs, advertisements, or other extraneous markings, whether relating to the ROW user or any other person on the rights-of-way, except such necessary minimal markings as approved by the city as are reasonably necessary to identify the facilities for service, repair, maintenance or emergency purposes, or as may be otherwise required to be affixed by applicable law or regulation. 
(f)  Responsible for subcontractors. If excavation or facilities maintenance is being done for the ROW user by another person, a subcontractor or otherwise, the ROW user shall be responsible for ensuring that the excavation or facilities maintenance of said person is performed consistent with its permit and applicable law (including that the contractor shall be properly licensed under the State of Missouri and local ordinances) and shall be responsible for promptly correcting acts or omissions by said person. 
(g)  Insurance; exceptions. Except as provided in this section, each ROW user shall provide, at its sole expense, and maintain during the term of any ROW use agreement or franchise or anytime the ROW user has facilities in the ROW, commercial general liability insurance with a reputable, qualified, and financially sound company licensed to do business in the State of Missouri, and unless otherwise approved by the city, with a rating by best of not less than "A", that shall protect the ROW user, the city, and the city's officials, officers, and employees, from claims which may arise from such use of the ROW, whether such operations are by the ROW user, its officers, directors, employees, and agents, or any contractors or subcontractors of the ROW user. This liability insurance shall include, but shall not be limited to, protection against claims arising from bodily and personal injury and damage to property, resulting from all ROW user operations, products, services, or use of automobiles or construction equipment. The amount of insurance for single limit coverage applying to bodily and personal injury and property damage shall be in no event less than the individual and combined sovereign immunity limits established by RSMo 537.610 for political subdivisions; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive the city's sovereign immunity. An endorsement which states that the city as an additional insured with full and equivalent coverage as the insured under the insured's policy and stating that the policy shall not be cancelled or materially modified so as to be out of compliance with the requirements of this section, or not renewed without thirty (30) days' advance written notice of such event being given to the director, along with copies of the policy and other documentation, shall be provided. If the person is self-insured, it shall provide the city proof of compliance regarding its ability to self-insure and proof of its ability to provide coverage in the above amounts. The city's additional insured coverage shall have no deductible. The insurance requirements in this section or otherwise shall not apply to a ROW user to the extent and for such period as the ROW user is exempted from such requirements pursuant to RSMo 67.1830(6)(a) and has on file with the city clerk an affidavit certifying that ROW user has twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and is otherwise therefore so exempted unless otherwise provided by a ROW use agreement or franchise or the city determines such exemption has not been adequately shown. Additionally, in accordance with RSMo 67.5121(3), a self-insured ROW user shall not be required to obtain insurance naming the city as an additional insured solely to the extent such ROW user is utilizing "small wireless facilities" as defined in the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act within the ROW. This exception to the city's insurance requirements shall only apply as related to "small wireless facilities" and shall not otherwise alter the obligations of a ROW user to provide appropriate insurance to the city for any other activities or operations. The city may waive any and all requirements under this subsection when deemed to be lawful and in the public interest. 
(h)  Performance and maintenance bonds. 
(1)  Bond required. Prior to any work, a ROW user shall establish in the city's favor a performance and maintenance bond in an amount to be determined by the director to guarantee the restoration of the rights-of-way as more fully provided in section 21-64(b)(4). The bond shall continue in full force and effect for a period of forty-eight (48) months following completion of the work. The director may waive this requirement when the work involves, as determined in the sole discretion of the director, no or only minor disruption or damage to the rights-of-way. The bond requirements in this section or otherwise shall not apply to a ROW user to the extent and for such period as the ROW user is exempted from such requirements pursuant to RSMo 67.1830(6)(a) and has on file with the city clerk an affidavit certifying that ROW user has twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in net assets and is otherwise therefore so exempted, unless otherwise provided by a ROW use agreement or franchise or the city determines such exemption has not been adequately shown. The city may waive any and all requirements under this subsection when deemed to be lawful and in the public interest. 
(2)  Failure to satisfactorily complete restoration. If a ROW user fails to complete the work in a safe, timely, and competent manner or if the completed restorative work fails without remediation within the time period for the bond (as determined by the director), then after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the ROW user and the cost of completing work in or restoring the rights-of-way, up to the full amount of the bond. The city may also recover against the bond any amount recoverable against a security fund or letter of credit where such amount exceeds that available under a security fund or letter of credit. 
(3)  Bond terms. The bond shall be issued by a surety with an "A" or better rating of insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition, shall be subject to the approval of the city's attorney and shall contain the following endorsement: "This bond may not be cancelled or allowed to lapse until sixty (60) days after receipt by the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew." 
(4)  Exception. In lieu of the bond required herein, the ROW user may establish in the city's favor such other security as the director may determine to be commensurate with the noted bonding requirements including, but not limited to, an annual bond to be maintained in the minimum amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). Additionally, in accordance with RSMo 67.5121(4), the bonds required for "small wireless facilities" as defined in the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act shall not exceed one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) per "small wireless facility" or more seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) for all "small wireless facilities" within the ROW of a ROW user. This exception to the city's bonding requirements shall only apply as related to such "small wireless facilities" and shall not otherwise alter the obligations of a ROW user to provide appropriate bonds to the city for any other activities or operations. 
(i)  Indemnification. Any person performing excavation or a ROW user as a condition of use of the rights-of-way shall at its sole cost and expense fully indemnify, protect, defend (with counsel acceptable to the city), and hold harmless the city, its municipal officials, officers, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, proceedings, and actions, liability, and judgment by other persons for damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including attorney fees, arising, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from the action or inaction of the person performing excavation or ROW user, its agents, representatives, employees, contractors, subcontractors, or any other person for whose acts the person performing excavation or ROW user may be liable, in constructing, operating, maintaining, repairing, restoring, or removing facilities or other structures, or use of the rights-or-way or the activities performed, or failed to be performed, by the person performing excavation or ROW user under this chapter or applicable law, or otherwise, except to the extent arising from or caused by the sole or gross negligence or willful misconduct of the city, its elected officials, officers, employees, agents, or contractors. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the city, or any agent from participating in the defense of any litigation by their own counsel at their own expense. Such participation shall not under any circumstances relieve the person from the duty to defend against liability or its duty to pay any judgment entered against the city, or its agents. This indemnification shall survive the expiration or termination of any ROW use agreement, license, or permit. Provided however, that in accordance with RSMo 67.5121(2), a ROW user solely to the extent a ROW user is operating "small wireless facility" as defined in the Uniform Small Wireless Facility Deployment Act within the ROW shall only indemnify and hold the city, its officers and employees, harmless against any damage or personal injury caused by the negligence of the ROW user, its employees, agents, or contractors. This exception shall only apply to the ROW user's "small wireless facilities" and shall not otherwise alter the obligations of a ROW user to provide indemnification to the city for any other activities or operations. 
(j)  ROW user responsible for costs . The ROW user shall be responsible for all reasonable costs borne by the city that are directly associated with ROW user's installation, maintenance, repair, operation, use, and replacement of its facilities in the rights-of-way that are not otherwise accounted for as part of the permit fee established pursuant to this chapter, to the extent permitted by law. All such costs shall be itemized and the city's books and records related to these costs shall be made available upon request of the ROW user. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-63. - Excavation details; manner of work generally. 
(a)  Open excavations; street-plate bridging. The ROW user shall not permit an excavation to remain open or facilities maintenance actions to continue in the rights-of-way longer than is necessary to complete the repair, installation or action, and in no event, may an excavation or facilities maintenance remain open or continue beyond the expiration of the excavation permit or any approved extension. Unless otherwise approved by the director in writing, all excavations shall be filled in or covered at the end of each working day. Street plate bridging (SPB) to cover open excavations shall be authorized subject to requirements contained in the standard specifications. 
(b)  Interference control. The ROW user excavating in the rights-of-way shall cause the excavation to be done with the least possible injury to the pavement, sidewalk, curbing, parkway, or other surface and shall place the materials from the excavation where they will cause the least possible inconvenience to the public and permit the uninterrupted passage of water along the gutters. The width of the excavation shall be no greater than is necessary for doing the work. 
(c)  Erosion control. Before new excavation or construction is commenced and until sodding, planting, concreting, paving, or other final surfacing is in place, which will avoid washing or spreading of dirt and mud onto other property, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streets, and the rights-of-way, the ROW user shall erect and maintain approved temporary erosion control measures to prevent such washing or spreading of materials. At the end of each day and as required throughout the day during the course of excavating or construction, dirt and mud on the sidewalks, curbs, gutters, streets, and the rights-of-way resulting from work must be removed. 
(d)  Cleaning up; removing mud from vehicles. The person doing the excavating or other ROW work under the requirements of this chapter shall immediately, after the work is completed and the refill is made, clean up and haul away all surplus earth, rock, debris, or other rubbish. The ROW user shall remove dirt from the wheels of all vehicles leaving any site where mud has accumulated on the wheels before such vehicles enter any public street of the city. It shall be unlawful for any ROW user to permit any vehicles to leave such place with mud on the wheels which is liable to be dispersed over any public street of the city and it shall be unlawful for any driver of a vehicle to enter upon the public streets of the city without having removed or had mud removed from the wheels prior to such entry. Each occurrence shall be a separate offense. The ROW user shall be responsible for damages to the city, or its contractors, resulting from such failure and shall indemnify the city and its contractors as provided herein and pay the costs for remedying such failure. 
(e)  Spilling materials onto rights-of-way. The ROW user shall load materials on any vehicle so no portion thereof shall be spilled or be liable to be spilled on the streets of the city. It shall be unlawful for any ROW user to permit any vehicle to enter upon the streets of the city loaded in violation of this provision and it shall be unlawful for any person to operate a vehicle on the streets of the city which is loaded in such manner that it spills or is liable to spill mud, dirt, or other materials on the streets. 
(f)  Hours of activity. Nonemergency excavations or facilities maintenance effecting traffic on arterial and collector streets may not be performed during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., in order to minimize disruption of traffic flow. The ROW user shall perform excavations or facilities maintenance on the rights-of-way at such times that will allow the least interference with the normal flow of traffic and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood, and shall not work between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. 
(g)  Methods of pavement removal, excavation, and backfill. The person making an excavation shall abide by the following conditions: 
(1)  The initial cut in a street pavement shall be equal to the width of the trench with the option of being jack hammered or saw cut. The final cut in an asphaltic concrete street pavement shall be one (1) foot wider than the trench width and shall be made only by saw cutting of the pavement. 
(2)  For cuts in concrete paved streets, concrete pavement replacement shall be full slab length (joint-to-joint) and full slab width (curb or gutter to street centerline) unless specifically authorized otherwise by the director. 
(3)  Refill excavation with suitable unfrozen materials free from trash, rubbish, vegetative and deleterious material, and/or rocks over three (3) inches in maximum dimension, in layers not exceeding eight (8) inches in depth and each layer shall be compacted thoroughly. 
(4)  Compaction shall meet or exceed the most current version of the standards and conditions of the city and the ASTM International (American Society for Testing and Materials). If inspections were not requested or a valid excavation permit obtained, the city may require compaction testing by a registered professional engineer licensed in the State of Missouri at the ROW user's expense. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-64. - Standards for all work within the ROW. 
(a)  Property repair and alterations. 
(1)  No damage. During any work, the person doing the work shall protect from damage any and all existing structures and property belonging to the city and any other person. Any and all rights-of-way, public property, or private property disturbed or damaged during the work shall be repaired or replaced by the person doing the work or the person on whose behalf the work is being done and such person shall immediately notify the owner of the fact of any damaged property. Such repair or replacement shall be completed within a reasonable time specified by the director and to his/her satisfaction. 
(2)  Alterations. Any alteration to the existing water mains, sewerage or drainage system, or to any city, state, or other public structures or facilities in the rights-of-way required on account of the construction, installation, repair, or maintenance of facilities in the rights-of-way shall be made at the sole cost and expense of the owner of such facilities. 
(b)  Specifications and conditions for work. 
(1)  Barricades and safety devices. The ROW user assumes the sole responsibility for maintaining proper barricades, plates, safety fencing, and/or lights as required from the time of opening of the ROW until the excavation is surfaced and opened for travel. All excavations and facilities maintenance that disturb traffic or pedestrian travel shall be barricaded in such a manner as to protect both pedestrians and vehicular traffic. Such excavations, facilities maintenance, and barricades shall be lighted at night with danger signals in such a manner that all traffic may be warned of the existence and location of such excavations, facilities maintenance, and barricades. 
(2)  Traffic control. Whenever there is an excavation or facilities maintenance by the ROW user, the ROW user shall be responsible for providing adequate traffic control to the surrounding area as determined by the director. All traffic control devices shall be in compliance with the current version of the standard specifications and the Manual of Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), unless otherwise agreed to by the city. All surplus excavation materials, tools, or supplies at the site of the excavation or facilities maintenance shall be barricaded and lighted at night in the manner described in this section. In the event the excavation or facilities maintenance is not completed in a reasonable period of time, the ROW user may be liable for actual damages to the city for delay caused by the ROW user pursuant to this chapter. 
(3)  Specifications and restoration . All work and maintenance shall comply with all such specifications as may be established by the director. The ROW user shall restore the rights-of-way and surrounding areas and shall comply with other reasonable conditions of the director. Restoration of the rights-of-way shall be completed within the dates specified in the ROW permit unless the Director issues a waiver, extension, or a new or revised ROW permit. 
(4)  Failure to restore. If a ROW user fails to restore the rights-of-way to its reasonable before condition (including placement of sod to restore any grassy areas unless such requirement is waived by the director in his/her sole discretion based on area disturbed and weather conditions) within the date specified either by the ROW permit or any extension thereof as granted by the director, the city may perform its own restoration. If the city performs the restoration, the ROW user shall be responsible for reimbursing the city's reasonable actual restoration costs within thirty (30) days of invoice. The city may use the required performance bond to repair the same, if necessary. The ROW user shall not be relieved of the obligation to complete the necessary rights-or-way restoration and maintenance because of the existence of any performance bond required by this chapter. 
(5)  Inspection. When an excavation has been made in the ROW, and after the same has been properly backfilled, the person making the excavation shall notify the director that the same is ready for final repair. The director or his duly authorized agent shall inspect the same. The judgment of the director or his authorized agent as to when an excavation has been properly backfilled to permit final repair shall be conclusive. If any person fails to contact the director for an inspection within a reasonable time, as determined by the excavation permit issued for the excavation, after completion of the work, to ensure that the rights-of-way or other public place has been restored to as good a condition as it was previous to such excavation being made, the excavation shall not be deemed complete and the ROW user shall be in violation of this chapter. 
(6)  Notice of completion. The ROW user shall notify the director upon completion of the excavation or facilities maintenance authorized by the excavation permit. 
(7)  Guarantee of work. Every ROW user in restoring the rights-of-way, shall guarantee its work and shall maintain it for forty-eight (48) months following its completion and in accordance with RSMo 67.1834. During the forty-eight (48) months, the ROW user shall, upon notification from the director, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using any method as required by the director. Said work shall be completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days, of the receipt of notice from the director (not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable). In the event the ROW user is required to perform new restoration pursuant to the foregoing guarantee, the director shall have the authority to extend the guarantee period for such new restoration for up to an additional forty-eight (48) months, or other greater period allowed by law, from the date of the new restoration requirements. The guarantee period shall be applicable to failure of the pavement surface as well as failure below the pavement surface. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-65. - Jurisdiction, inspection, stop work orders, appeals, and penalties. 
(a)  Inspections. All work and facilities shall be subject to inspection by the city and the supervision of all federal, state, and local authorities having jurisdiction in such matters to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations, and the permit. 
(b)  Stop work orders. The director shall have full access to all portions of the work and may issue stop work orders and corrective orders to prevent unauthorized work or substandard work as established herein. Except in cases of an emergency or with approval of the director, no work may be done in violation of a stop work order issued by the director. 
(c)  Repairs when defective. All violations of the standards and requirements herein shall be corrected within the time specified in the issuance of a written notice to correct. Action to correct violations which require immediate action shall be taken upon notification to the person by the city. Every person failing to comply with the oral or written notice shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. If the action is not taken within the time period specified by notice and in addition to any other remedy, the director may have the violation, including but not limited to, the existence of mud or debris on the rights-of-way, immediately remedied and the city's costs shall be reimbursed by the ROW user through the surety or otherwise. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent prosecution of violation of this chapter in the absence or in addition to the issuance of notice of violation. 
(d)  Appeals. Unless otherwise provided herein or by any other governing ordinance or law, any person aggrieved by a decision, fee or requirement established or made pursuant to this chapter shall, prior to seeking any judicial or statutory relief, if any, fire a written appeal of any such decision, fee, or requirement with the city council within fifteen (15) days of such decision or imposition of such fee or requirement specifying this provision and including specific details of the alleged claim or grievance, and an evidentiary hearing shall be held on such appeal by the city council or its designee to render a final decision. Nothing herein shall deny or preclude any additional applicable appeal remedy that may be granted and required by federal or state law after such decision. 
(e)  Enforcement; attorneys' fees. The city shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Code through all remedies lawfully available, and any person determined to have violated the terms of this Code shall further be liable to pay the city's costs and attorneys' fees in enforcing such Code provisions. Additionally, any user of city services, rights-of-way, or other city facilities or property, shall, as a condition of such use or continued use, to the full extent permissible by law, be liable to pay the city's costs and attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing any lawful requirement applicable to such use, whether arising in contract, statute, ordinance, or other enforceable duty as to such use. 
(f)  Penalties. In addition to any other penalties and remedies for violations that may exist in law or equity, any person that violates any provision of this chapter shall be subject to such penalties as set forth in section 1-7 of the City Code per day for each and every day the violation exists or continues. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-66. - Reservation of rights. 
    In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the city by this chapter, the city reserves unto itself every right and power which is required to be reserved by a provision of any ordinance under any registration, permit, or other authorization granted under this chapter, and as may be authorized by RSMo ch. 67 and other authority applicable to regulation of the use of the rights-of-way. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the provisions of this chapter shall not infringe upon the rights of any person pursuant to any applicable state or federal statutes, including, but not limited to any right that may exist to occupy the rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 1090, § 2 (Exh. A), 2-5-19) 
Sec. 21-67. - Pole attachments. 
(a)  Attachment fee required. No person, other than the city or a department thereof, shall attach or maintain any fixture to or place or maintain any facilities or wires on any utility pole or other fixture or facility of the city within the rights-of-way or easements without: (1) a pole attachment agreement approved by the city council after the date hereof, and (2) payment of a pole attachment fee of eight dollars fifty cents ($8.50) per pole per year or as may be hereinafter approved as alternative lawful compensation in a pole attachment agreement approved by the city council after the date hereof, or such other amount as may be established hereinafter by the city council by resolution or ordinance in conformance with any applicable law. Failure to hold and maintain a current and valid pole attachment agreement with the city shall not excuse payment of the pole attachment fee at the rate required herein. Where a pole attachment agreement expires, and in addition to any penalties or other requirements, the licensee during any holdover period shall pay monthly one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the rate above or one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the rate in the expired agreement, whichever is greater, until a valid agreement is obtained, or the attachments are removed. The person shall indemnify and be responsible to pay all costs incurred by the city in any way due or arising from any such attachment or violation of any provision hereof or of any pole attachment agreement including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees, except as may be otherwise expressly provided by agreement. To the extent that limitations by state or federal law require a lower rate than established herein, such lower maximum rate permitted by law shall apply in lieu of the rate established above. 
(b)  Payment and affidavit-When. Unless otherwise provided by pole attachment agreement or applicable law, amounts due under this section shall be paid to the city not later than January 15 of each year for the prior calendar year (or pro rata portion thereof if less than a full year) and any amount unpaid after such date shall accrue interest payable to the city at the rate of one and one-half (1.5) percent per month, or such lesser amount if limited by applicable law. Each payment shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the number of poles to which attachments exist and computation of the fee. 
(c)  Agreement required. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, no pole attachment shall be authorized except by authorized pole attachment agreement, which shall include such provisions as necessary to protect the public interest and provide for payment of the required compensation consistent with this section. An application may be required containing such information as may be necessary to determine the appropriateness of the application and may contain a fee requirement in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city its costs or such other reasonable basis as permitted by law. A franchise or ROW agreement shall not be deemed to authorize pole attachments unless expressly so provided therein. No pole attachment agreement shall be granted to any person unless such person has a valid franchise or ROW agreement with the city, whether separately granted or incorporated in the pole attachment agreement, except in any case where such requirement is prohibited by applicable law. A pole attachment agreement shall be reviewed and approved, denied or conditioned as the public interest dictates subject to all applicable law. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to contravene any unwaived rights in a duly authorized and lawful existing agreement with the city. Unless otherwise provided, attachments to any city-owned or controlled utility pole, fixture, or facility within non-rights-of-way property of the city shall be permitted only if a lease agreement or other separate approval has been negotiated and approved by the city with such reasonable terms as the city may require. 
(d)  Penalty for attachments without agreement. Any person or entity who shall, attach or maintain any fixture to or place or maintain any facilities or wires on any city facilities, including any utility poles or other fixture or facility of the city, within city rights-of-way or easements without a currently valid and unexpired pole attachment agreement approved by the city council, whether the person has failed to obtain a pole attachment agreement or whether a former pole attachment agreement has expired or been terminated, shall be subject to a penalty of an unauthorized attachment fee of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) per pole per unauthorized attachment. Any person who shall attach or maintain any fixture to place or maintain any facilities on any city facilities, including any utility poles or other fixture or facility of the city within city rights-of-way or easements without a currently valid and unexpired pole attachment permit, or in violation of the pole attachment agreement, pole attachment permit, or this article, shall be subject to a penalty of an unauthorized attachment fee per pole per attachment equal to five times the current annual pole attachment fee rate set by the city council for every year or portion thereof that such person is in violation of this article or the attachment is otherwise unauthorized. Provided that no person shall be subject to the penalties in this section until after the person has been provided a reasonable time, of not more than sixty (60) days, to cure the violation. Up to seventy-five (75) percent of the penalties provided for in this section may be waived if the violation is self-reported, the violation is remedied in a timely manner, and the city's costs in enforcing the applicable pole attachment agreement, pole attachment permit, or this article are reimbursed. Penalties under this section shall be required to be paid on a monthly basis in accordance with the procedures and interest of subsection (b) of this section. Any person asserting any right to proceed on city poles, where no pole attachment agreement yet exists between the parties, pending a dispute over required pole agreement terms that exclusively are as to the "per-pole fee or any requirement or issue not directly related to the pole attachments" ("protestable terms"), shall except to the extent such applicant may be exempted by law, and prior to proceeding on any pole: (1) execute the pole attachment agreement required by the city and provide the city with such executed copy for execution by the city, and (2) provide a cover letter under oath specifically asserting (i) that a dispute remains as to terms in the executed agreement exclusively as to the protestable terms in such agreement, and (ii) specifically set forth each and every provision (quoting the precise disputed words) that are so disputed. During pendency of the dispute, the agreement shall be binding and applicable as written, provided that the protestable terms specifically disputed shall be deemed protested and subject to ultimate judicial resolution by a court to be unlawful. The agreement shall be required and deemed to establish the "agreed upon terms and conditions" accepted by the user subject only to the protestable terms specifically identified as authorized herein. In the event that there is a dispute as to terms other than protestable terms, no attachment shall occur until such dispute or disagreement is resolved and nothing in this article shall be deemed to authorize proceeding on city poles without an executed agreement, or to authorize protest of any provisions not specifically protested in the required cover letter authorized herein. Pending the resolution of the dispute, the pole user shall comply with all requirements in the agreement and shall be subject to all remedies and penalties for breach thereof, subject to court action as to any protestable terms, and subject to any limitations as may be mandated by law. All pole use shall occur only after obtaining an attachment permit from the city in its capacity as pole owner for such use, and all such permits shall be deemed to incorporate this article and all provisions of the applicable required agreement. Failure to execute an agreement shall be deemed a material violation of this article and of a permit as to any such pole use, and failure to obtain a permit shall further be deemed a material violation of this article and of a required permit and agreement, whether or not actually obtained as required herein. Notwithstanding any provision herein, no party shall have the right to proceed on a city pole during the pendency of a dispute as to any city required terms except when such right is also specifically granted by enforceable valid state or federal law. Penalties under this subsection shall be required to be paid on a monthly basis as provided in subsection (b). 
(e)  Appeal of agreements. Any person or entity who is required to obtain a pole attachment agreement under this section may avoid penalties under subsection (d) above by complying with all application requirements and executing a pole attachment agreement provided by the city and submitting therewith a letter notifying the city that the agreement or other requirements are claimed by the person or entity to be unlawful under the circumstances and are being executed and/or submitted under protest. This letter shall be separate and apart from any protest letter required by subsection (d) for dispute of protestable terms. Within twenty (20) days of its execution of the agreement, the person or entity shall file with the city clerk a verified appeal seeking relief from any fee, term, or condition of the pole attachment agreement or other requirement that the person or entity alleges to be unlawful. The appeal shall state with specificity the fee, term, or condition which is claimed to be unlawful and shall specify all basis, data, information, and argument relied upon to justify said claims. The person or entity may request the city council to hold a public hearing at which such basis, data, information and argument may be received. The city council may provide relief from any rate, term, or condition that it finds in its sole discretion to be unlawful under the facts presented or otherwise unlawful by addition, deletion, or amendment to the agreement. If the person or entity accepts such relief, the addition, deletion, or amendment to the pole attachment agreement shall be made by a writing executed by the person or entity and the city. If such relief is not accepted, the pole attachment agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and the person or entity may then pursue any available remedies in a court of law or otherwise, provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of the city's sovereign immunity. No final decision of the city on any fee, term, or condition shall be deemed to exist prior to completion of this appeal process. Nothing herein shall be deemed to unlawfully limit any remedy that is required to be available as a matter of law. 
(f)  Insurance. Before any user shall attach or maintain any fixture to or place or maintain any facilities or wires on any utility pole or other fixture or facility of the city within city rights-of-way or easements, such user shall maintain, at its sole expense, commercial general liability insurance with a reputable, qualified, and financially sound company licensed to do business in the State of Missouri, and unless otherwise approved by the city, with a rating by best of not less than "A," that shall protect the user, the city, and the city's officials, officers, and employees from claims which may arise from such use, whether by the user, its officers, directors, employees, and agents, or any subcontractors of user. This liability insurance shall include, but shall not be limited to, protection against claims arising from bodily and personal injury and damage to property, resulting from all user operations, products, services, or use of automobiles or construction equipment. The amount of insurance for single limit coverage applying to bodily and personal injury and property damage shall be at least two million eight hundred four thousand forty-six dollars ($2,804,046.00), but in no event less than the individual and combined sovereign immunity limits established by RSMo 537.610, or its successor, for political subdivisions; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive the city's sovereign immunity. An endorsement shall be provided which states that the city is named as an additional insured with full and equivalent coverage as the insured under the insured's policy and stating that the policy shall not be cancelled or materially modified so as to be out of compliance with the requirements of this section, or not renewed without thirty (30) days' advance written notice of such event being given to the city clerk. The city's additional insured coverage shall have no deductible. Proof of compliance with this requirement, including current and duly issued certificates of insurance, or copies of the policies if so requested by the city, shall be maintained with the city at all times. 
(g)  Indemnification. In addition to any supplemental requirement as may be specified in a pole attachment agreement, any person or entity attaching to any city pole shall indemnify and hold harmless the city, including each and every officer, employee, or agent thereof, for any liabilities, damages, or costs incurred that are caused or result from, in whole or in part, the attachment, or attaching person or entity, except where prohibited by applicable law. 
(h)  Penalty. Any person violating any provision of this section shall, in addition to being subject to all other remedies herein, be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). Each day's violation shall constitute a separate offense. 
(i)  Conflict. Nothing in this section shall apply or be interpreted to apply in conflict with any state or federal law.

ARTICLE III. - PROCEDURE 
 
Sec. 22-6. - Filing procedure. 
(a)  Pre-application. During the pre-application period the subdivision is shaped and designed. The developer will work with a representative from the planning commission and the technical plat committee regarding the various requirements of the planning commission and acquaint the developer with all pertinent public improvements, existing or contemplated, in the project area. The developer will not be expected to have initially more than a broad, general concept of his project, expressed perhaps in the form of a simple work sketch. 
(b)  Preliminary plat. After all technical detail concerning layout and design has been worked out, the preliminary plat will be formally presented to the planning commission. The preliminary plat will express in precise terms, adequately documented, the decisions reached during pre-application procedure, together with such engineering data as may be necessary to enable the planning commission to take appropriate action on the matter. At this point in the process, construction drawings will not normally be required unless extraordinary circumstances necessitate such. 
The developer will then be secured what is referred to as "tentative approval of the preliminary plat" and will proceed with detailed engineering. Upon completion of that phase to the satisfaction of the operating departments and utilities having jurisdiction, the developer may follow on of two (2) alternate steps: 
(1)  Request a recommendation of approval of his final or record plat by the planning commission. 
(2)  Proceed to install all required improvements based on preliminary plat approval and postpone filing of the final plat until completion and acceptance of these improvements. 
(c)  Final plat. When final plat approval is requested immediately, a bond, or other security acceptable to the planning commission, shall be posted in the amount of the improvement costs as estimated by the agencies having immediate jurisdiction. This bond shall be released gradually as work progresses.

(Ord. No. 1109, § 1, 12-3-19)  
Sec. 22-7. - General procedure. 
(a)  No contract of sale of preliminary plat. No persons, firm or corporation, proposing to make or having made a subdivision within the city limits of the City of Butler, Missouri, shall enter into any contract for the sale of, or shall offer to sell any subdivision or any part thereof, until they have obtained from the planning commission a recommendation for approval of the final plat of the proposed subdivision and the approval of the city council has been recorded. 
(b)  Compliance with design principles. In planning and developing a subdivision, the developer shall comply with the general principles of design and minimum requirements for the layout of subdivisions and with the rules and regulations concerning required improvements set forth in article VII of these subdivision regulations. In every case, the developer shall adhere to the following procedure: 
(1)  Pre-application proceedingsPublic works director. Prior to submitting the preliminary plat to the planning commission, the developer or their engineer shall consult with the representative of the planning commission and acquaint themselves with all that is necessary to meet the planning commission's requirements. This includes, but is not limited to: highways, primary or secondary thoroughfares, collector streets, parkways, parks, playgrounds, school sites and other community facilities or planned developments. 
The pre-application time may be reduced by the director of public works and utilities, or his/her designee, at their discretion. During pre-application proceedings, the general features of the subdivision, its layout, facilities and required improvements shall be determined to the extent necessary for preparation of the preliminary plat. Pre-application proceedings shall be properly documented by minutes of conferences and memoranda, as may be necessary, and copies of such documentation shall be furnished to the planning commission by the developer. 
(2)  Preliminary plat. The developer shall prepare a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision which shall conform with the requirements set forth in article IV of these subdivision regulations. The developer shall file a written application with the planning commission, on a form provided, for review by the planning commission. The developer shall provide sufficient copies of their application and all necessary documentation for each member of the planning commission for their review at least two (2) weeks prior to the meeting of the planning commission at which action is desired. 
a.  CheckingReview by other agencies. The preliminary plat shall be reviewed by the planning commission for its conformity with the standards, requirements, and principles hereinafter prescribed. The planning commission shall cause said preliminary plat to be checked by the planning commission's representative, through the technical plat committee, to ascertain compliance with all applicable additional requirements. 
b.  Recommendation of approval. Upon receipt of the recommendations and/or report of the planning commission representative, the planning commission shall make a recommendation to the city council to approve or reject the plat, or approve it with modifications, noting all such modification on said plat. If the planning commission fails to take any action on the preliminary plat within sixty (60) days, the preliminary plat shall be deemed approved by the planning commission. The planning commission, with the consent of the developer for the approval, does have the option to extend the sixty (60) day period. 
c.  Modifications. In any recommendation for conditional approval subject to modifications, the planning commission may require the developer to submit a revised preliminary plat. The planning commission's recommendation for approval of the preliminary plat shall be deemed to be approval of the designed feature of the tract only. The city engineer may modify engineering or constructions details as may be necessary for the protection of the public interest. 
d.  Construction of improvementsBond. Upon the planning commission's recommendation for approval or conditional approval subject to modifications, which shall be effective for a period of two (2) years, the developer may proceed to install all required improvements and, for this purpose must secure from the appropriate authorities the necessary permits. In the event approval of the final plat is requested prior to installation of improvements, the developer shall post a corporate surety bond, running to the City of Butler, a cashier's check or such other security as may be acceptable to the City of Butler, in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of installing all required improvements as estimated by the officials having jurisdiction. This is to assure the satisfactory construction and performance of said improvements at the time and terms fixed by the planning commission and in accordance with its regulations. 
(3)  Final plat. Upon completion of all required improvements or posting of appropriate securities as stipulated in article III, section 22-7, subsection (b)(2)(d), the developer shall file with the planning commission the final plat of the subdivision. The final plat may include all or any reasonably acceptable part of the tentatively approved preliminary plat, and completion of improvements, or the bond which only need cover that portion of the plat for which final approval is requested.

ARTICLE VII. - PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN AND MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS 
 
Sec. 22-13. - General. 
In laying out a subdivision, the developer shall comply with the following general principals and requirements: 
(1)  Flood areas. In order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the people, the planning commission shall make a recommendation for disapproval of any proposed subdivision located in an area subject to flooding. Whenever a subdivision is proposed to be in an area having poor drainage or other adverse physical characteristics and impairment, the planning commission may approve the plat, provided the developer legally binds themselves to make such improvements as will render the subdivision substantially safe and otherwise acceptable for the intended use. Additionally, the developer shall post with the City of Butler a surety performance bond or other acceptable security sufficient to cover the cost of such improvements as estimated by the officials having jurisdiction. 
(2)  Comprehensive planCompliance. 
a.  The subdivision layout shall conform to the official thoroughfare plan. Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a highway, thoroughfare, parkway or other major or collector street it shall be platted by the developer in the location and at the width indicated in the plan. 
b.  The subdivision shall conform to the official comprehensive plan. Unless a proposed public ground or park is dedicated to the city, the board of education, or the county, if it is in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision, it shall be reserved by the developer for acquisition by said city, board of education or county within a period of two (2) years of purchase or other means. 
(3)  The street and block layout. 
a.  Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. 
b.  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions or unless such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout. 
c.  Dead-end streets of reasonable length may be approved where necessitated by topography or where, in the opinion of the planning commission, they are appropriate for the type of development contemplated. 
1.  Temporary dead-end streets may be approved where necessitated by the layout of the subdivision or staging of development, provided that temporary turn-around shall be constructed where lots are fronting on such temporary dead-end street. 
2.  The additional width of right-of-way required for such temporary turn-around shall be the same as that required for permanent turn-around. 
d.  Proposed streets shall intersect one (1) another as nearly at right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit. Four-way intersections shall be used for minor interior streets wherever practicable and not in conflict with other applicable design principles and standards. Street jobs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided. 
e.  Wherever there abuts the tract to be subdivided a dedicated or platted and recorded half-width street or alley, the other half-width of such street or alley shall be platted such that the ultimate right-of-way conforms to the minimum standards included herein. 
f.  In platting lands abutting federal and state highway or other primary thoroughfares, every effort shall be made to cushion the adverse impact of heavy or high-speed traffic on such lands, especially where used for residential purposes minimize interference with through traffic operations and reduce vehicular and pedestrian accident hazards. In designing such plats, the following rules and the provisions shall be applied: 
1.  Lots abutting such thoroughfares shall be platted at generous depth. Vehicular access to such lots shall be provided by means of minor streets, alleys in the rear, or frontage streets immediately alongside the traffic way, connected therewith at infrequent intervals and otherwise separated therefrom by reserved non-access control strips or land; or 
2.  The frontage of such lots may be reversed, and the lots may front on a minor street paralleling the thoroughfare at approximately one hundred (100) feet to one thousand (1,000) feet, and loop streets of cul-de-sacs may be extended from such collector street toward the thoroughfare, the ends of which will give access to the lots abutting the thoroughfare immediately along their rear or side lot lines. 
3.  Each lot shall be provided with access to a public street or highway to assure convenient ingress and egress to and from such lot, provide adequately for the layout of and other services, and to protect and further the public health and safety generally. Subdivision intended for commercial or industrial occupancy shall be access to a major street or thoroughfare, may have access to any residential street or residential collector street under any circumstances, except in the case of appropriately separated planned retail centers. 
g.  Except under unusual conditions, when held desirable by the planning commission, private streets will not be approved. 
h.  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate depth, except in the case of reversed frontages. 
1.  The length of blocks shall be such as may be appropriate, in the opinion of the planning commission, for the locality of the type of development contemplated, but shall not exceed one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet where the average size of lots does not exceed two (2) acres in area. 
(4)  Minimum rights-of-way of streets, alleys and easements for utilities. 
a.  Highways, primary thoroughfares and parkways: as specified in the official thoroughfare plan, but not less than seventy-two (72) feet wide in any case.

e.  Utility easements, where required: not less than fifteen (15) feet wide along rear or side lot lines. Easements of adequate width shall be provided for open drainage channels, where required. 
f.  Alleys, where platted: a minimum width of twenty (20) feet. 
g.  Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, and where the planning commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 
(5)  Minimum pavement and sidewalk widths. 
a.  Minimum pavement widths, back to back of curb, required to be installed at the developer's expense, shall be as follows: 
1.  Primary thoroughfares and parkways, collector streets, and minor streets: not less than six hundred and thirty-two (632) feet long.

ARTICLE XI. - WEATHER EMERGENCIES 

Sec. 23-233. - Parking during winter weather events. 
    With any winter weather event, parking on city streets becomes problematic in maintaining efficient and effective snow/ice removal operations. Parked vehicles slow snow/ice removal operations and create situations that impede street clearing operations depriving residents and the traveling public of safe and efficient travel. Similarly, emergency response will be affected. As such, the following regulations shall apply to parking on city streets during any winter weather event: 
(1)  A parking prohibition on all city streets shall automatically go into effect without any formal declaration when there has been an accumulation of 2" or more of snow, ice, or other frozen precipitation, during the period from 6:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m., of any day. 
(2)  Once in effect, a prohibition under this chapter shall remain in effect until terminated by announcement of the mayor, city administrator, or public works director, except, that any street which has become substantially clear of snow and ice for the length of the entire block shall be automatically excluded therefrom. However, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to permit parking at any time or place where it is forbidden by any other provision of law. 
(Ord. No. 941, 3-6-12) 
Sec. 23-234. - Stalled vehicles during winter weather emergency. 
    Whenever a vehicle becomes stalled for any reason during a winter weather emergency, the person operating the vehicle shall take immediate action to have the vehicle towed or pushed off the roadway. No person shall abandon or leave his/her vehicle in the roadway regardless of whether he/she indicated by raising the hood or otherwise, that the vehicle is stalled, except for the purpose of securing assistance during the actual time necessary to go to a nearby telephone or to a nearby garage, gasoline station or other place of assistance and return without delay. 
(Ord. No. 941, 3-6-12) 
Sec. 23-235. - Deposit of snow or ice in street or public way. 
    No person or persons, other than persons employed or under contract by the City of Butler, engaged in the removal of snow, ice or other frozen precipitation from driveways, parking lots or sidewalks shall deposit such snow, ice or other frozen precipitation in the streets or any public way for vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Nor shall any person or persons engaged in the removal of snow or ice allow such snow, ice or other frozen precipitation to be deposited on or against any fire hydrant. One result of clearing city streets is that the windrow from the plows pushes snow/ice out to the edges of the roadway often blocking private driveway or mailbox access. Property owners and residents clearing this windrow to provide driveway and mailbox access shall only do so in a manner that does not place the snow/ice back onto the public street pavement. 
(Ord. No. 941, 3-6-12) 
Sec. 23-236. - Special provisions during all types of weather emergencies. 
    For weather related emergencies of any kind, the mayor or city administrator may cause additional restrictions or prohibitions to traffic and parking regulations be placed into effect by making a public declaration thereof. Each declaration made by him/her pursuant to this chapter to be publicly announced by means of the city's internet website and/or such other media or internet sites or systems as the mayor or city administrator may find appropriate from time to time, and by issuing a press release to local media with broadcast or telecast from a station with a normal operating range covering the city. Each announcement shall describe the action taken, including the time it became or will become effective. 
(Ord. No. 941, 3-6-12) 
Sec. 23-237. - Termination of parking prohibition or traffic emergency.

(Ord. No. 941, 3-6-12) 
Sec. 23-238. - Temporary provisions to take precedence over other ordinances-Exceptions. 
    Any provisions of this chapter which becomes effective by declaration of the mayor or city administrator or upon the occurrence of certain weather conditions shall while temporarily in effect, take precedence over other conflicting provisions of law normally in effect; except, that it shall not take precedence over provisions of law relating to traffic accidents, emergency travel of authorized emergency vehicles or emergency traffic directions by a public safety officer. 
(Ord. No. 941, 3-6-12) 
Sec. 23-239. - Removal, impounding and return of vehicles.

Sec. 23-242. - Violation of chapter provisions. 
    That any person, firm or corporation found to be in violation of any provision of this chapter by parking or causing to be parked a motor vehicle on any street shall be subject to a fine of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00), as well as to the costs incurred in towing and storing said vehicle.

A side yard along the side street lot line of a corner lot, which lot abuts in the rear, either directly or across an alley, the side lot line of another lot in an R district, shall have a width of not less than one-half the required depth of the front yard on such other lot fronting the side street. 
(g)  Frontage modifications. In the case of curvilinear streets and cul-de-sacs, the board may authorize a reduction of the otherwise specified lot frontage in R districts, provided that: 
(1)  The lot width measured at the building line shall equal the frontage required in the district where located; 
(2)  The front lot line shall be not less than forty (40) feet in any event; and

(Z.O., § 8.11.05) 
Sec. 26-136. - Conditional uses. 
(a)  Statement of intent. The division of the city into zoning districts is based on the principle that similar conditions prevail throughout a particular district. Some uses of land are not appropriate as a "permitted use" in certain districts and are designated as conditional uses. These uses may be approved at a particular location because of factors or reasons not applicable to the zoning district as a whole. Conditional uses may have a unique impact on the adjoining uses of land, and are therefore subject to individualized considerations as to location and conditions of use to protect and promote the basic purposes of this chapter. A conditional use permit may be issued by the city council following the procedures set forth in this section. 
(b)  When conditional use permit required. 
(1)  Uses for which a conditional use permit is specifically required as set forth elsewhere in this chapter. 
(2)  Uses not specifically set forth as "permitted uses", "prohibited uses" or as "uses subject to conditions" elsewhere in this chapter shall be deemed to be "conditional uses" unless otherwise determined. The planning and zoning commission and city council may consider granting a conditional use permit for such uses in accordance with the zoning code. 
(c)  Conditional use permit; application-Contents and submission requirements. The following items shall be submitted in support of an application for a conditional use permit: 
(1)  A completed application on a form provided by the city. 
(2)  A comprehensive narrative description of the use sought, both as to function and operation, and as to structures, installations, equipment or surface improvements, changes or other requirements incidental to such use. 
(3)  The length of term of the use after the date of issuance of the permit, if applicable. 
(4)  Special conditions relating to the operation of the proposed use(s), site development and other pertinent descriptive factors. 
(5)  Color photographs of surrounding structures within one hundred eighty-five (185) feet and site plan and elevation drawings of the proposed conditional use in sufficient detail to determine compliance with the zoning district regulations in which the conditional use is to be located. 
(d)  Consideration of conditional use permit applications. 
(1)  Public hearing required. Consideration of all applications for conditional use permit shall require a public hearing before the planning and zoning commission and city council, with publication notice, notice to surrounding property owners within one hundred eighty-five (185) feet of the property, and posting of signs on the property at least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing. 
(2)  Notice. Notice of the public hearings shall contain the following: 
a.  Time, date and place of the hearing; 
b.  Purpose of the public hearing; 
c.  Applicant; and 
d.  Statement that all interested parties shall have a right to be heard. 
(e)  Standards for approval. 
(1)  Conditional uses may be approved by action of the city council after recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. Conditional uses may be approved with conditions including, but not limited to, requirements for special yards, open spaces, buffers, fences, walls, and screening; the installation of landscaping and maintenance; provisions for erosion control; requirements for street improvements, dedications, limitations on ingress and egress movements into and out of the site, and traffic circulation; limitation on signage; limitation on hours of operation and other characteristics of operation; and other conditions deemed necessary to insure compatibility with surrounding land uses. 
(2)  In considering any application for a conditional use permit, the planning and zoning commission and city council may give consideration to the criteria listed below, to the extent they are pertinent to the particular application. 
a.  Character of the neighborhood. 
b.  Compatibility with adjacent property uses and zoning. 
c.  Suitability of the property for which the conditional use is being requested. 
e.  Extent to which the proposed use will negatively impact the aesthetics of the property and adjoining properties. 
f.  Extent to which the proposed use will injure the appropriate use of, or detrimentally affect, neighboring property. 
g.  Impact on the street system to handle traffic and/or parking. 
h.  Impact of additional stormwater runoff to the existing system or to the water shed area if no storm sewer is available. 
i.  Impact of noise pollution or other environmental harm. 
j.  Potential negative impact on neighborhood property values. 
k.  Extent to which there is need of the proposed use in the community. 
l.  Economic impact upon the community. 
m.  Extent to which public facilities and services are available and adequate to satisfy the demand generated by the proposed use. 
n.  Comparison of the benefit gained to the public health, safety and welfare of the community if approved versus the hardship imposed upon the landowner if the requested application is denied. 
o.  Conformance to current city policies and ordinances. 
p.  Recommendation of professional staff. 
q.  Consistency with permitted uses in the area in which the conditional use is sought. 
(f)  Conditional use permits-Transferability, lapse, expiration, revocation and renewal. 
(1)  Transferability. 
a.  A conditional use permit may be conveyed with the land only if the transferor has obtained a building permit for one or more structures authorized by the conditional use permit and construction of at least ten (10) percent of the project has been completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project. The transfer of a permit in which these conditions have not been satisfied shall be invalid. Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the expiration date of permits or the authority of the city council to revoke a permit. 
b.  A permit cannot be assigned or transferred to a different parcel of land. 
c.  Every entity attempting to convey a conditional use permit shall give notice in writing to the city administrator or his/her designee within seventy-two (72) hours after having sold, transferred, given away or otherwise disposed of an interest in or control of a parcel of land for which a conditional use permit has been issued. Such notice shall include the name and address of the successor in interest or control of the parcel. Receipt of such notice shall not constitute acceptance of a invalid transfer. 
(2)  Lapse. Unless a building permit for one or more structures authorized by the conditional use permit has been obtained and at least ten (10) percent of the total expected cost of the project has been expended, the conditional use permit shall lapse and become void unless the applicant applies for any building permit incident to the proposed use within two (2) years of the date of approval by the city council. Upon the written request of the property owner and for good cause shown, the city administrator or his/her designee may grant one extension of not more than one (1) year. An application for extension will be considered only if it is submitted, in writing, prior to the expiration of the initial period. 
(3)  Expiration. A conditional use permit shall be valid for a specific period of time if so stated in the permit. A permit may be renewed upon application to the city council, subject to the same procedures, standards, and conditions as an original application. 
(g)  Revocation procedure. 
(1)  Grounds of revocation. Any conditional use permit granted by the city council in accordance with this section is subject to revocation for any or all of the following reasons: 
a.  Non-compliance with all the conditions of approval established in the ordinance granting such conditional use permit; 
b.  A change from the original use or the intensity of the original use for which the permit was issued resulting in a change in impact upon the surrounding neighborhood pursuant to subsection (e), Standards for Approval; 
c.  Expiration of the conditional use permit; 
d.  Violation of any provisions of this section; or 
e.  Violation of any provisions of the Code of Ordinances pertaining to the use of land, construction or uses of buildings or structures, or activities conducted on the premises by the permit holder, agents of the permit holder or tenants and is declared to be a nuisance to the neighborhood in which located. 
(2)  Procedure for revocation. 
a.  Revocation proceedings may be initiated by the city administrator or his/her designee. 
b.  Notice of intent to revoke shall be mailed to the permit holder's last known address stating the grounds for the intended revocation, and the date, time and place of the hearing. 
c.  The matter will then be placed on a designated planning and zoning commission agenda for hearing, which may be continued for good cause shown. 
d.  The matter will then be forwarded to the city council with the planning and zoning commission's findings and recommendation. 
e.  The city council will consider the findings and recommendation of the planning and zoning commission in rendering their final decision. 
f.  No conditional use permit shall be revoked unless a majority of the city council is satisfied by a preponderance of evidence that grounds for revocation exist. 
(h)  Renewal. A conditional use permit may be renewed using the same procedure as was used for the original approval set forth in this section. The city council may grant a renewal containing modifications, but only for existing conditions, without the submission of a site plan and elevation drawings. 
(i)  Right to continue. 
(1)  The issuance of a conditional use permit gives no vested rights to the permit holder. 
(2)  The rights conferred by the authorization of a conditional use under this article shall not become effective until the project is constructed and the use actually started. 
(3)  A right to continue a specially permitted use shall only exist provided all conditions of the conditional use permit and all other city ordinances have been met and continue to be met, and until duly revoked under this section. 
(4)  The right to continue a conditional use authorized under this article shall last only as long as specified by the conditional use permit. 
(5)  A conditional use permit shall be allowed to continue, unless specified otherwise as a condition of its authorization, as long as all conditions placed on it are met. If a particular use ceases to exist for a period of six (6) months, it will forfeit its conditional use permit and will not be allowed to exist again unless a new application is made, a public hearing held as provided for in these regulations and a new conditional use permit approved.

(e)  Responsibility for removal. The owner or occupier of the property upon which any political sign is erected, placed, or located shall be responsible for the removal of such sign within the time required by this chapter. 
(f)  Legislative purpose and intent. The city council makes the following findings of legislative purposes and intent: 
(1)  That the expression of political speech is an important and constitutionally protected right. 
(2)  That, under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to restrict or regulate the time, place and manner of the expression of such speech in order to advance and protect other significant legitimate interests of local government. 
(3)  That political signs have certain characteristics that distinguish them from many of the other types of signs permitted and regulated by the city. These characteristics include the fact that many of such signs, intended to be temporary in nature, do not meet the regular structural and installation requirements necessary to prevent them from being affected by weather and other natural forces and presenting a potential hazard to persons and property. Severe weather conditions, including, without limitation, thunderstorms with accompanying high winds, tornados, ice accumulation and flooding, are characteristic of local weather conditions. With respect to the temporary nature of such signs, the durational and illumination regulations provide a channel of communication on an election candidate or issue balancing the aesthetic and public health and safety concerns surrounding temporary structures. 
(4)  That the primary purpose of political signs placed along a roadway is to attract the attention of drivers and distract them from their primary responsibility of constant attention to traffic and road conditions. This concern is especially acute in residential areas where young children present a significant potential hazard for drivers. With respect to residential areas, with their lower speed limits, it is concluded that political signs not exceeding twenty-six (26) inches by twenty-six (26) inches on each side. Although it is recognized that certain individuals may wish to express political thoughts that require a larger area to adequately convey them, a greater number of or larger and more complex messages would further distract drivers' attention, presenting an unacceptable safety risk, and there exists in the community adequate other means for conveying such message. In nonresidential areas, motorists frequently see and reasonably expect to see larger signs, so their attention is not as easily distracted, and higher speed limits, larger lot areas, and a larger size sign can be allowed consistent with safety requirements. Further, since permitted signage in residential areas is minimal, the aesthetic impact of signs in residential areas is much greater than in nonresidential areas. 
(5)  That in addition to the safety and traffic interests affected by political signs, the city council concludes that the unrestricted proliferation of political signs would create visual clutter, have an adverse effect on the aesthetic quality of the city, with accompanying adverse economic effects, and detract from the desirable visual environment that the city has made a strong effort to create through its land use regulations. 
(6)  That the city council concludes that the interests to be protected by this regula tion are sufficiently substantial to justify the content-neutral regulation of political speech represented by this section, and that this section represents a reasonable accommodation of the city's interest with First Amendment Rights.

DIVISION 6. - WIRELESS FACILITIES 

Sec. 26-282. - Purpose. 
(a)  Statement of Purpose. The general purpose of this division 6 ("division") is to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of telecommunications wireless communications facilities to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the City of Butler. Specifically, this division is intended to: 
(1)  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of Butler; 
(2)  Minimize adverse visual impacts of wireless communications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques that provide predictability for nearby property owners and others that future uses will not materially alter such approved aesthetic protections without zoning hearing procedures and input from interested parties; 
(3)  Ensure that any new wireless communications facilities are located in an area compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible; and 
(4)  Ensure that regulation of wireless communications facilities does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services and does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service and promotes the provision and availability of communication services within the city. 
(b)  Applicability; preemption . Notwithstanding any ordinance to the contrary, the procedures set forth in this division shall be applicable to all wireless communications facilities existing or installed, built or modified after the effective date of this division to the fullest extent permitted by law.
