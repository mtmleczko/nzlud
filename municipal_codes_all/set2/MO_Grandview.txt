Preface 
_______ 
    This volume, as originally published, constituted the first revision and codification of the general ordinances of the City of Grandview, Missouri. It contained such of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature passed on or before February 15, 1968, as were found desirable for retention, except those expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The Code, as now supplemented, contains ordinances as indicated on the page of instructions for handling supplemental pages. 
    The ordinances were codified, edited and indexed by the Editorial Staff of Michie City Publications Company under the supervision of Chas. W. Sublett, Stephen C. Willard and John K. Haley. 
    The publishers wish to express their appreciation for the cooperation of all the city officials and employees during the preparation of this publication. Particular acknowledgment is due Mr. James C. Morris, Special Counsel, for his assistance during the progress of the work. The publishers also are grateful to Mrs. Ruth D. Kirkwood, City Clerk, for her assistance. 
    A feature to which the attention of the user is directed is the arrangement of the chapters in alphabetical order. Attention is also directed to the analysis preceding each chapter which, in many instances, will serve as an index within itself. The general index, carried at the end of the Code, has been carefully prepared and should serve as an accurate medium for locating the individual sections of law within the Code. In the footnotes appearing throughout the Code will be found references to the applicable and related provisions of the state law. These notes also contain cross references to other and related provisions in the City Code. By reference to the historical citations, appearing at the end of each section, the user will be able to ascertain the ordinance from which the present section has been derived. 
    It is a recognized fact that if any Code is to accomplish its intended purpose it must be kept up to date by means of an adequate supplemental service. Accordingly, the publishers point out the advisability and necessity of keeping this Code current. 
    The new City Code is presented to the officials and citizens of the City of Grandview, Missouri, in the belief that it will merit their approval.

Sec. 2A-31. - Intent of article. 
    The special provisions of this article are intended to regulate the location of adult entertainment establishments as herein defined, by specifying districts in which such uses may be permitted and requirements for spatial separation of such uses. Nothing in this article shall be construed or interpreted to permit adult entertainment establishments in areas other than those set forth herein. 
    Adult entertainment establishments are hereby acknowledged to have special characteristics and impacts upon their surroundings, and upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent property. It is the intent of these regulations to provide for the confinement of adult entertainment establishments to those commercial and industrial areas in which these special impacts are judged to be least disruptive to the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties. These regulations are further intended to require that adult entertainment establishments shall not be permitted to locate in such concentrations that their operational features may establish the dominant character of any commercial or industrial areas. 
    These regulations are further intended to protect and balance lawful rights of expression with other lawful rights to the enjoyment and use of property, and are made with full consideration of the legal and constitutional issues heretofore adjudicated. 
    The provisions of this article shall govern the location and spatial separation of adult entertainment establishments in commercial districts and industrial districts, and no such regulated use, as defined, may be permitted except in conformance with these provisions.

The humane officer shall maintain animal bite reports for a period of not less than two (2) years after the court date or if no court date is involved, then not less than two (2) years after the date the bite occurrence is reported. If any such dog or cat or other animal is dangerous, fierce or vicious, and cannot safely be taken into custody and impounded, such dog or cat or other animal may be rendered harmless by using a tranquilizer weapon, such weapon to be used only by the humane officer or police officer. 
(d)  It shall be the duty of the veterinarian or city-authorized impounding agent, with whom the impounded animal is placed, to notify the humane officer, in writing, that such animal has been confined and will remain so for ten (10) to twelve (12) days.

(2)  If the injured party, or his/her parent or guardian is unwilling to agree in writing to pay for the animal's board during the period of impoundment, the animal shall be permitted to remain on the property of its owner or keeper, provided such person signs a written agreement to keep the animal confined to the property for the period specified in section 4-32 and further agrees to allow the animal to be examined periodically to determine its physical condition during the confinement period. Such home confinement shall require that the animal be confined inside the home except for twenty (20) minute exercise periods each day in which case the animal must be tethered. If the owner or keeper is unwilling to sign such an agreement, the animal shall be immediately impounded in accordance with section 4-32. 
(3)  In cases where a dog, cat or other animal has bitten or so injured his owner or member of the owner's family so as to cause an abrasion of the skin, the dog or other animal may be held on the premises of the owner for the lawful observation period. 
(4)  When such dog or cat or other animal has been held by the individual, it will be the duty of the owner or keeper to cause delivery of the dog or cat or other animal to be made to a veterinarian within the corporate limits of the City of Grandview, Missouri, for rabies inoculation.

Cross reference- Subdivision of land, Ch. 27. 

Sec. 6-25. - Building design and construction standards. 
(a)  Purpose: The purpose of this article is to set special standards for the construction and exterior appearance of commercial, office, industrial and multi-family buildings that adjoin or are visible from certain major roadways, residentially zoned areas, or planned residential areas, thereby protecting the values of properties throughout the City of Grandview. Specifically, this article shall apply to all buildings which front on or are visible from the following: 
  U.S. Highway 71 Corridor 
  MO. Highway 150 Corridor 
  Blue Ridge Boulevard Extension Corridor 
  Main Street-Highgrove Road Corridor 
  Residentially Zoned Areas or Areas Planned for Residential Development in Accordance with the Grandview Comprehensive Plan 
(b)  Minimum Exterior Building Material Standards for Buildings Visible from the Following Roadways: 
  U.S. Highway 71 Corridor 
  Mo. Highway 150 Corridor 
  Blue Ridge Boulevard Extension Corridor East of the Kansas City Southern Railroad Lines 
  Main Street-Highgrove Road Corridor East of the Kansas City Southern Railroad Lines 
All commercial, office, industrial, and multi-family buildings hereafter erected, constructed, altered, or repaired having walls or facades, which are within one thousand feet (1,000') from any of the above corridors shall be constructed to the following minimum standards: 
(1)  Site and Building Design - Compatibility with Other Development: 
(a)  The form and proportion of buildings should be consistent with the scale, form, and proportion of other development within the immediate surrounding area. 
(b)  The rhythm of structural mass to voids, such as windows and glass doors, of a front facade should relate to the rhythms established in adjacent buildings. 
(c)  Care should be exercised to coordinate final grades and site arrangement with those of adjoining properties and streets. 
(d)  Buildings shall incorporate four (4) sided architecture. Horizontal and vertical elements shall extend completely around the building and utilize the same, compatible, or complimentary materials on all building facades. 
(2)  Location: Buildings should be located to ensure the provision of adequate open space for outdoor gathering areas, facilities, services and amenities and to provide natural indoor light, air and privacy to the extent possible. All buildings, parking lots and other structures should be located to integrate with the natural topography and to avoid deep cuts and fills, excessive foundation wall depth, unnecessary steps and steep access gradients. 
(3)  Design Focus: The front facade of a building, as well as the main entrance(s), should be designed as focal points to the building. The main entrances should incorporate devices such as canopies, overhangs, arcades, raised parapets over the door, larger door openings, display windows, accent colors, and other architectural details such as moldings. The remaining portions of the building should be designed in a way that complements and is consistent with the building's street facade. 
(4)  Visual Interest: 
(a)  Architectural design should create visual interest through the use of different textures, complementary colors, shadow lines and contrasting shapes. Monotonous design should be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting should be used to provide visual interest. Facades should be articulated with variations in the building plane and parapet height, materials and colors, entrance canopies, and landscaping. At a minimum, facades facing a public or private street should incorporate at least two of the following features along each applicable facade. These standards should be applied to each facade individually: 
(i)  Recesses and projections along at least 20 percent of the length of the building facade. 
(ii)  Windows, awnings, arcades or other significant architectural features used along at least 60 percent of the front building facade length and 30 percent of the side or rear building facade length. 
(iii)  Brick, natural or fabricated all weather stone covering at least 50 percent of the area when applied to the front building facade or 25 percent of the area when applied to a side or rear building facade. 
(iv)  Landscaping islands or planting against the building, covering at least 30 percent of the length of the building facade. 
(b)  Loading docks, trash enclosures, outdoor storage and similar facilities and functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building and the landscaping so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are reduced to as great an extent as possible and are out of view from adjacent properties and public streets. 
(c)  Overhead doors shall be relieved by matching their color to the wall or trim, recessing the doors, or adding architectural details to diminish the dominance of the doors. 
(d)  The use of unusual shapes, color and other characteristics that cause new buildings to call excessive attention to them and create disharmony shall NOT be allowed. 
(e)  Where a change in material, color, or texture along the exterior side of a building is proposed, the demarcation of the change should occur a minimum of twenty (20) feet on both adjacent sides of the building or to the natural dividing point established by the physical plan of the building. 
(f)  Building materials and design shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Community Development, or his designee. 
(5)  Building Color: Building color should be limited to light, medium, and dark shades of earth tone gold and brown colors. Approximately 90 percent of each building wall surface should be light and medium colors. The remaining surfaces should be restricted to a darker color. Colors should match or compliment other buildings in the immediate surrounding area. The use of walls in a single color, with little detailing or completely blank, shall NOT be permitted. 
(6)  Roofs: Careful consideration of durable materials, proportions, and shapes, emphasizing the importance of roofs as integral and embracing elements of the over-all design, is particularly important. Building roof tops should have at least two of the following features: 
(a)  Parapets concealing flat roofs and roof top equipment; 
(b)  Overhanging eaves; and 
(c)  Sloped roofs. 
(7)  Exposed Roofs: Exposed roofs shall be architectural in nature and integrally colored. 
(8)  Roof Mounted Equipment: Roof mounted equipment, including ventilators, and satellite dishes greater than 30" in diameter shall be screened from view by a 100% opacity solid or louvered structure; or isolated so as not to be visible from ground level of any adjacent public thoroughfare or residentially zoned area, up to a maximum of one thousand feet (1,000') away. Screening should completely obscure from ground level all surfaces of the equipment. The appearance of roof screens should be coordinated with and integral to the building design to maintain a unified appearance, not merely a separately designed afterthought. It is not the intent of this requirement to increase the height of the screening significantly above that of the equipment in order to screen it from view from tall buildings or from higher ground. 
(9)  Parking: 
(a)  Parking should be designed in a way that it does not dominate the character of the development nor appear as a dominant feature of the site. 
(b)  Parking standards are outlined in Chapter 31 entitled; Zoning Ordinance. 
(10)  Access: Pedestrian access should be an integral part of the overall design of the development. The pedestrian access should provide not only safe and convenient access to and from off-street parking areas but should also connect with abutting properties and developments so as to accommodate an alternative means of transportation such as walking or biking to and from work and surrounding activities. Access to site or park amenities should also be provided. 
(11)  Sidewalks: 
(a)  Detached sidewalks shall be provided as required by the City's public improvement manual and/or subdivision code. A continuous internal pedestrian sidewalk should be provided from the perimeter public sidewalk to the principal building entrance(s). 
(b)  Sidewalks shall be provided along the full length of any facade featuring a customer entrance and along any facade abutting a public parking area. Such sidewalks should be located at least ten feet away from the building facade to provide planting areas for landscaping along the foundation of the building. 
(12)  ADA Compliance: All sidewalks, crosswalks, parking lots, or other areas of pedestrian circulation shall comply with ADA accessibility guidelines and standards (See Section 31-21(I) of the Zoning Ordinance) 
(13)  Utilities: All telephone and cable television lines, electrical services and distribution lines shall be placed underground, except that this provision shall not include meters, electric and telephone service pedestals, transformers, three-phase feeder lines, sub-transmission and transmission lines, electrical substations and such other facilities as the utility may deem necessary to install utilizing "overhead" type construction. These aboveground utilities should be located as close to the building as permitted by the utility company and screened from view of public streets to the extent possible through the use of landscaping or screening walls that are integrated into the overall site design. 
(14)  Mechanical Equipment: All electrical and mechanical equipment located adjacent to the building and visible from any adjacent public thoroughfare or residentially-zoned area shall be screened from view (100% opacity), up to a maximum one thousand feet (1,000') away. Screening should completely obscure from ground level all surfaces of the equipment. Such screens and enclosures should be treated as integral elements of the building's appearance. 
(15)  Trash: All trash, refuse, debris or garbage shall be contained within an enclosed building or container designed for such purposes. Outdoor containers or dumpsters shall be shielded on all sides by an enclosure constructed of the same, or complementary, materials to those used on the primary building. The use of landscaping to further decrease the visual impact of the trash enclosures is encouraged. Refer to Chapter 23, Article IV of the Grandview Code Laws for further information. 
(16)  Loading Docks: 
(a)  Loading areas shall NOT be located at the front of the building. Loading docks visible from a street or street side yard should be screened from view from the street and neighboring properties. 
(b)  Where visible from a public street or residential-zoned property, the visual impact of loading docks shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible through the use of landscaping, fences and berms. 
(c)  Where possible, the screening shall be an integral part of the building structure and be used in conjunction with landscaping, ground cover, trees and shrubbery. If the screening is not an integral part of the building, then landscaping ground cover, trees and shrubbery should be used to screen the loading area. 
(17)  Exterior Storage: Except during permitted construction periods, all exterior storage of equipment, raw materials, or finished products shall be fully screened from the view of adjacent parcels and streets by a visual barrier such as a solid screen fence. Such exterior storage shall not exceed the height of the barrier. Barriers shall be constructed as indicated in Chapter 31 of the Grandview Code of Laws; entitled Zoning Ordinance. Additional height or screening, such as landscaping, may be required based upon the height of the items to be screened. Chain-link fence with vertical slats shall NOT be permitted. 
(18)  Lighting: 
(a)  Light Mitigation: Cut-offs and lighting shields should be used to prevent spill over and glare onto adjoining streets and residential properties. Exposed lighting sources such as unshielded wall packs should not be permitted. 
(b)  Color: Lighting should predominantly consist of lights that have a "warm" appearance. Parking lot lighting should be of a type that provides sufficient lighting for safety and security without distorting the perception of color. Low-pressure sodium lights may not be used in parking areas or at main entrances. 
(c)  Coverage: Light coverage should be localized as part of an overall lighting plan. Light fixtures that broadcast light over large areas or that are a source of glare, sky-glow or other light pollution should not be permitted. 
(d)  Height: 
(i)  Building mounted lighting should not extend above the roof line of the building on which it is mounted. 
(ii)  Pole lighting heights should be a maximum of 14 feet. 
(19)  Materials: 
(a)  Buildings should be constructed or clad with high-quality materials that are durable, economically-maintained, and will retain their appearance over time, including, but not limited to, brick, glass, stucco, natural and fabricated stone, treated wood, integrally-colored, textured, or glazed concrete masonry units (CMU's), pre-stressed concrete systems, water-managed Exterior Insulated Finish Systems (EIFS), or similar durable and visually pleasing materials. 
(b)  The following construction materials are permitted:

(8)  Descriptive materials accompanying the object which explain or depict its use; 
(9)  National and local advertising concerning its use of which the person charged has knowledge;

ARTICLE IV. - HAZARDOUS MATERIALS EMERGENCY RESPONSE COST RECOVERY[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2995, § 1, adopted Jan. 26, 1982, repealed former §§ 11-41-11-95, which had been included as Arts. IV-VII, pertained to flammable liquids, dry cleaning and dyeing establishments, liquefied petroleum gases, and nitrocellulose motion picture film, and were derived from Ord. No. 132, §§ 504, 701-711, 801-814, 901-919, 1001-1007; and Ord. No. 1886, § 1.  Subsequently, section 3 of Ord. No. 6668, adopted March 25, 2014, enacted new provisions as Art. IV, §§ 11-41-11-45. 

Sec. 11-41. - Missouri statute. 
    Missouri state law (RSMo § 260.546) states, in the event that a hazardous substance release occurs for which a political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association as defined in RSMo § 320.300, provides emergency services, the person having control over hazardous substances shall be liable for such reasonable cleanup costs incurred by the political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association. Such liability includes the cost of materials, supplies and contractual services actually used to secure an emergency situation. 
    The liability may also include the cost for contractual services that are not routinely provided by the department or political subdivision or volunteer fire protection association. Such liability shall not include the cost of normal services that otherwise would have been provided. ;p0p; To assist local hazardous substance emergency responding agencies recover cleanup costs in accordance with RSMo §§ 260.500 through 260.550, sometimes referred to as the "Spill Bill." Under RSMo §§ 260.500 through 260.550 in the State of Missouri, the City of Grandview Fire Department can submit an itemized bill to the responsible party to recover cost associated with a hazardous materials incident. The billing procedure and approved state costs are attached. 
(Ord. No. 6668, § 3, 3-25-14) 
Sec. 11-42. - Recommended procedure for billing. 
    The following steps should be followed when trying to recover costs incurred while handling a hazardous substance release. Remember that the billing is to recover actual costs while trying to clean-up/mitigate the release of the hazardous substance. Its purpose is not to acquire new equipment that may be used by the agency for future responses or replace exhausted equipment. An attached price guide has been provided by a committee comprised of division of fire safety, department of natural resources, and local response agencies across Missouri. 
Step 1. Ensure that the release has been reported to the department of natural resources twenty-four-hour spill line at 573-634-2436. This will help document the release and can assist with consistency in response details. 
Step 2. Keep good documentation of the activities at the site and who performed various duties (using ICS forms and submitting them will help document the response). Include photos of any damaged equipment. If any gear needed to be cleaned or replaced submit documentation (including photos) of the cleaning and pricing. 
Step 3. An itemized, dated, detailed bill (see attached example invoice) should be sent via certified mail, with a return receipt requested, to the person having control of the hazardous substance (owner, responsible party, etc.). If equipment was destroyed and compensation is being sought, explain how and why it was lost, including information as to how the replacement cost was determined. This bill should include copies of all bills for any assistance that was required from other departments as defined in the statute. It should be noted that the person having control of the hazardous substance can contest the billing if done in accordance with the law. 
Step 4. If payment is not received within thirty (30) days, resubmit the detailed billing via certified mail, with a return receipt requested, along with a copy of the Chapter [RSMo §§] 260.500-260.550 (or at least [RSMo] § 260.546). It is important to outline the part of the law that states, "Full payment shall be made within thirty (30) days of receipt of the cost statement." Also, it would be advisable to note to them that "John Doe" signed for the initial statement, which was sent earlier. 
Step 5. If the second step is unsuccessful at recovering costs incurred, your agency will need to seek legal counsel (city attorney, county prosecutor, etc.) to assist with the cost recovery. 
Step 6. Send one (1) invoice for all agencies involved. This invoice should be sent by the lead agency responsible for the incident with jurisdictional authority.

Sec. 11-44. - Local government reimbursement. 
    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a program designed to reimburse local governments that have been affected by costs beyond those routinely incurred when dealing with a hazardous substance release. The local governments reimbursement program (LGR) is found under federal regulations at 40 CFR Part 310, which defines a hazardous substance in section 101 (14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). Only emergencies involving CERCLA compounds will be eligible for compensation using the LGR program. This does not include petroleum, crude oil or any fraction thereof. 
    The LGR program will reimburse local governments for expenses incurred in carrying out temporary emergency measures. These measures must be necessary to prevent or mitigate injury to human health or the environment associated with the release of any hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant. The financial relief is limited to twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) per single response. To obtain more information about the LGR program or to receive an application, call 800-431-9209 or

    Substantial-damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) per cent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. The term includes repetitive loss buildings (see definition). 
    For the purposes of this definition, "repair" is considered to occur when the first repair or reconstruction of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences. 
    The term does not apply to: 
a.)  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
b.)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure;" or 
c.)  Any improvement to a building. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of reconstruction, alteration, or improvement to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds fifty (50) per cent of the current market value of the building. For the purposes of this definition, an improvement occurs when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. This term includes structures, which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work done. 
    The term does not apply to: 
a.)  Any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
b.)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure;" or 
c.)  Any building that has been damaged from any source or is categorized as repetitive loss. 
** Recommend development of written and adopted policy and procedure. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) per cent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief by the zoning board of adjustment from the terms of a floodplain management regulation pursuant to section 11A-11 of this chapter. Flood insurance requirements remain in place for any varied use or structure and cannot be varied by the City of Grandview, Missouri or its board of adjustment. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplain.

a.  The storage or processing of materials within the special flood hazard area that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
b.  Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods, if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning. 
6.  Nonconforming use. A structure, or the use of a structure or premises that was lawful before the passage or amendment of the ordinance, but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject to the following conditions: 
a.  If such structure, use, or utility service is discontinued for twelve (12) consecutive months, any future use of the building shall conform to this chapter. 
b.  If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than fifty (50) per cent of the pre-damaged market value of the structure. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building, safety codes, regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination. 
7.  Accessory structures. Structures used solely for parking and limited storage purposes, not attached to any other structure on the site, of limited investment value, and not larger than four hundred (400) square feet, may be constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed provided there is no human habitation or occupancy of the structure; the structure is of single-wall design; a variance has been granted from the standard floodplain management requirements of this chapter; and a floodplain development permit has been issued. 
8.  Hazardous materials. All hazardous material storage and handling sites shall be located out of the floodplain. 
9.  Cumulative improvement. A structure may be improved (remodeled or enlarged) without conforming to current requirements for elevation so long as the cumulative value of all work done within the last five (5) calendar years does not exceed fifty (50) per cent of the structure's current market value. If the cumulative value of the improvement exceeds fifty (50) per cent of the structure's current market value, the structure must be brought into compliance with Article 4, Section B(1)[sic] which requires elevation of residential structures to or above the base flood elevation or the elevation/floodproofing of non-residential structures to or above the base flood elevation. 
10.  Critical facilities. 
a.  All new or substantially improved critical nonresidential facilities including, but not limited, to governmental buildings, police stations, fire stations, hospitals, orphanages, penal institutions, communication centers, water and sewer pumping stations, water and sewer treatment facilities, transportation maintenance facilities, places of public assembly, emergency aviation facilities, and schools shall be elevated above the 500-year flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the 500-year flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations. 
b.  All critical facilities shall have access routes that are above the elevation of the 500-year flood. 
D.  Specific standards.

a.  Residential construction. New construction or substantial-improvement of any residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial-improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in section 11A-9.9. of this chapter. 
c.  Require, for all new construction and substantial-improvements that fully enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(1)  A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; and 
(2)  The bottom of all opening shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
E.  Standards for manufactured homes. 
1.  All manufactured homes to be placed within all unnumbered and numbered A zones and AE zones, on the community's FIRM shall be required to be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. 
2.  Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered or numbered A zones and AE zones, on the community's FIRM on sites: 
a.  Outside of manufactured home park or subdivision; 
b.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
c.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
d.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
3.  Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and numbered A zones and AE zones, on the community's FIRM, that are not subject to the provisions of subsection 2. above, be elevated so that either: 
a.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at one (1) foot above the base flood level; or 
b.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and be securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
F.  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 11A-2 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  The City of Grandview shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point. 
2.  The City of Grandview shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
3.  If section 11A-10(f) of this chapter is satisfied, all new construction and substantial-improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 4[sic]. 
4.  In unnumbered A zones, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from federal, state, or other sources as set forth in section 11A-10.C.2. of this chapter. 
G.  Standards for recreational vehicles. 
1.  Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within all unnumbered and numbered A zones and AE zones on the community's FIRM either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use*; or 
c.  Meet the permitting, elevation, and the anchoring requirements for manufactured homes of this chapter. 
*A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 6950, § 2, 12-13-16) 
Sec. 11A-11. - Floodplain management variance procedure; appeals; criteria; conditions for approval. 
A.  Establishment of appeal board. The zoning board of adjustment as established in the zoning ordinance of the City of Grandview, Missouri shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the floodplain management requirements of this chapter. 
B.  Responsibility of appeal board. Where an application for a floodplain development permit or request for a variance from the floodplain management regulations is denied by the director of public works, the applicant may apply for such floodplain development permit or variance directly to the zoning board of adjustment. The zoning board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the director of public works in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
C.  Further appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board of adjustment or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Jackson County Circuit Court as provided in RSMo 89.110. 
D.  Floodplain management variance criteria. In passing upon such applications for variances, the zoning board of adjustment shall consider all technical data and evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the following criteria: 
1.  The danger to life and property due to flood damage; 
2.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flood damage, for the proposed use; 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
11.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems; streets; and bridges. 
E.  Conditions for approving floodplain management variances. 
1.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial-improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items 2. through 6. below have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination provided the proposed activity will not preclude the structure's continued historic designation. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
5.  Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.  The floodplain administrator shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this chapter. 
F.  Conditions for approving variances for accessory structures. Any variance granted for an accessory structure shall be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as those criteria and conditions set forth in section 11A-11.D and E. of this chapter. 
    In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance issued for accessory structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed. 
1.  Use of the accessory structures must be solely for parking and limited storage purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM). 
2.  For any new or substantially damaged accessory structures, the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with section 11A-10.C.4.b. of this chapter. 
3.  The accessory structures must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure in accordance with Article 4, Section A(4)(a)[sic] of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces. 
4.  Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section 11A-10.C.4.d. of this chapter. 
5.  The accessory structures must meet all National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) opening requirements. The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters in accordance with section 11A-10.D.1.c. of this chapter. 
6.  The accessory structures must comply with the floodplain management floodway encroachment provisions of section 11A-10.F.2. of this chapter. No variances may be issued for accessory structures within any designated floodway, if any increase in flood levels would result during the 100-year flood. 
7.  Equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected from any flood damage. 
8.  No disaster relief assistance under any program administered by any Federal agency shall be paid for any repair or restoration costs of the accessory structures. 
9.  A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this chapter. 
10.  Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and approved by the community and registered professional engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for construction.

Any automated traffic-control system on a street, highway or railroad crossing may be identified by appropriate advance warning signs conspicuously posted either at the major roadways entering the city, or not more than three hundred (300) feet from the automated traffic-control system location. All advance warning signs must be approved by the director of public works. 
(i)  Public safety violations. No vehicle shall be driven into an intersection controlled by a traffic-control signal at which an automated traffic-control system is installed while the traffic-control signal facing the vehicle displays a steady red signal, including a steady red arrow. 
(1)  Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn, a motor vehicle facing any steady red signal, including a steady red arrow, may be cautiously driven into the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street, after stopping as required by subsection 14-104(e) of this article. 
a.  No vehicle shall be driven past a traffic-control signal located along a street or highway but not at an intersection at which an automated traffic-control system is installed while the traffic-control signal facing the vehicle displays a steady red signal. 
(j)  Affirmative defenses. In addition to all applicable affirmative defenses available by law, it shall be an affirmative defense to an information alleging a violation of this section based upon automated traffic-control system records that: 
(1)  The traffic-control signal was not in proper position and sufficiently legible to an ordinarily observant person; 
(2)  The operator of the motor vehicle was acting in compliance with the lawful order or direction of a police officer; 
(3)  The operator of the motor vehicle violated the instruction of the traffic-control signal so as to yield the right-of-way to an immediately approaching authorized emergency vehicle; 
(4)  The motor vehicle was being operated as part of a funeral procession pursuant to RSMo § 194.503; 
(5)  The motor vehicle was being operated as an authorized emergency vehicle as defined and in compliance with RSMo § 304.022; 
(6)  The motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle and being operated by a person other than the owner of the vehicle without the effective consent of the owner: 
(7)  The license plate depicted in the recorded image of the violation was a stolen plate and being displayed on a motor vehicle other than the motor vehicle for which the plate had been issued; 
(8)  The motor vehicle was being operated by a person other than the owner of the vehicle, provided that the owner, or the owner's representative in the circumstance where the owner is not a natural person, submits to the city an affidavit as provided in subsection (f)(2) of this section; or 
(9)  The presence of ice, snow, unusual amounts of rain or other unusually hazardous road conditions existed that would make compliance with section 14-100 more dangerous under the circumstances than noncompliance. 
    The existence of affirmative defenses as provided in this section shall not be construed to preclude the defendant from introducing any other evidence of innocence which may be weighed by the court pursuant to existing procedures. 
(k)  Fine. Notwithstanding any other provision of the City Code of Laws, the fine for violation of this section shall be equal to the applicable fine for failure to obey a traffic-control signal as set by the municipal court and under no circumstances may a person be imprisoned for such a violation. 
(l)  Nonmoving violation. Violations of this section shall be considered nonmoving violations for purposes of the assessment of points by the Missouri Department of Revenue against the license of either the owner or the violator.

(a)  Successive colored lights. Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall have the following meanings: 
(1)  Green. Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed; except, that such traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and vehicles lawfully within a crosswalk or the intersection at the time such signal was exhibited. Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk; provided, that where pedestrian-control signals are installed, pedestrians shall proceed across such roadway on the signal of "walk" only. 
(2)  Yellow. When shown alone following the green, vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at the intersection or at such other point as may be designated by signs or markings placed by the street commissioner unless so close to the intersection or such signs or markings that a stop cannot be made in safety. No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter such roadway while such signal shall be on; provided, that where pedestrian control signals are installed, pedestrians may proceed across such roadway on the signal "walk" only. 
(3)  Red. Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at the intersection or at such other point as may be designated by signs or markings placed by the city, and remain standing until the green or flashing green is shown. Where signs have been installed providing for a right turn while facing a red light, the driver of a vehicle may proceed to make a right turn after bringing his vehicle to a stop, yielding right-of-way to all pedestrians lawfully crossing the street and to all other vehicles on the cross street. No pedestrian facing such a signal shall enter the roadway until the green is shown; provided, that where pedestrian control signals are installed, pedestrians may proceed across such roadway on the signal of "walk" only. 
(4)  Green arrow. Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(b)  Pedestrian control signals. Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words "walk," "wait" or "don't walk" are in place, such signals shall have precedence over all other colored lights or signal indications for the exclusive control of pedestrian traffic only, and shall have the following meanings: 
(1)  Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway and shall be given the right-of-way by drivers of all vehicles; provided, that where such signal is given for all entrances to any intersection, then such pedestrians may cross such intersection at any angle. 
(2)  Wait or don't walk. No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway, but any pedestrian who partially completed his crossing on the walk signal shall have the right-of-way over all vehicles until such pedestrian has reached the opposite curb or safety zone. 
(c)  Flashing lights. Where flashing lights are in use, they shall have the following meanings: 
(1)  Flashing yellow or flashing green (caution signal). When a yellow or green lens is illuminated with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the intersection or past such signal only with caution. 
(2)  Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated by rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, and the right to proceed shall be subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign. 
(d)  Traffic signal control. 
(1)  All vehicular and pedestrian traffic shall be controlled at those intersections where traffic signals are in operation, according to the traffic-control signal legend contained in this section, which said intersections are as set forth in the "Intersection Control Schedule" attached hereto as Exhibit A. 
(2)  A copy of such "Intersection Control Schedule," Exhibit A, shall be filed in the office of the city clerk. 
(e)  Right turn on red after stop permitted generally. The driver of any vehicle when facing a continuous red indication may proceed to make a right turn, in conformance with section 304.218(3b), Missouri Revised Statutes, 1975 supplement, after bringing his vehicle to a stop, yielding right-of-way to all pedestrians or other traffic lawfully entering the intersection, except at such intersections where a right turn on red is prohibited in conformance with section 14-104(f). 
(f)  Right turn on red prohibited at certain locations. A right turn on red signal is prohibited at the following locations: 
(1)  Reserved.

Sec. 17-49. - Aggressive solicitation. 
(a)  Intent. 
(1)  This section is intended to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitation that are unwelcome. Aggressive solicitation usually includes approaching or following pedestrians, repetitive soliciting despite refusals, the use of abusive or profane language to cause fear and intimidation, unwanted physical contact, or intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The board of aldermen finds that the presence of individuals who solicit money from persons in vehicles, at or near banks or automated teller machines, or on public transportation is especially troublesome because of the enhanced fear of crime in those confined environments. Such activity carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property. 
(2)  The law is not intended to limit any person from exercising his or her constitutional right to solicit funds, picket, protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activities. 
(b)  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
    Aggressive manner means: 
(1)  Intentionally or recklessly making any physical contact with or touching another person in the course of a solicitation without the person's consent and with the intent to intimidate; 
(2)  Following the person being solicited, if that conduct is: a) intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the person's possession; or b) intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person being solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation; 
(3)  Continuing to solicit within five (5) feet of the person being solicited after the person has made a negative response, if continuing the solicitation is: a) intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the person's possession; or b) intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person being solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation; 
(4)  Intentionally or recklessly blocking the safe or free passage of the person being solicited with intent to intimidate, or requiring the person or the drive of a vehicle to take evasive action to avoid physical contact with the person making the solicitation. Acts authorized as an exercise of one's constitutional right to picket or legally protest, and acts authorized by a permit issued pursuant to this Code, shall not constitute obstruction of pedestrian or vehicular traffic; 
(5)  Intentionally or recklessly using obscene or abusive language or gestures intended to or likely to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the person's possession, or words intended to or reasonably likely to intimidate the person into responding affirmatively to the solicitation; or 
(6)  Approaching the person being solicited in a manner that is: a) intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon property in the person's possession; or b) intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person being solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation. 
    Automated teller machine means a device, linked to a financial institution's account records, which is able to carry out transactions, including but not limited to account transfers, deposits, cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, and mortgage and loan payments. 
    Automated teller machine facility means the area comprised of one (1) or more automated teller machines and any adjacent space which is made available to banking customers. 
    Bank means any banking corporation, credit union or savings and loan licensed by the state or the United States of America and for the purposes of this section includes the following establishments as defined at section 31-3 of the Code of Laws of the City of Grandview (Zoning Ordinance): check cashing establishment, pawn shop, consumer credit loan business, title loan business, and Section 500 Company. 
    Intimidate means to engage in conduct which would make a reasonable person fearful or feel compelled. 
    Public area means an area to which the public or a substantial group of persons has access, and includes but is not limited to alleys, bridges, buildings, driveways, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, plazas, sidewalks and streets open to the general public, and the doorways and entrances to buildings and dwellings, and the grounds enclosing them. 
    Solicit or solicitation means to request an immediate donation of money or other thing of value from another person, regardless of the solicitor's purpose or intended use of the money or other thing of value, offering for sale, or advertising any product, property or service of any kind. The solicitation may be, without limitation, by spoken, written or printed word or by other means of communication. 
(c)  Prohibited acts. It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit money or other things of value or to solicit the sale of goods or services: 
(1)  In an aggressive manner in a public area. 
(2)  In an aggressive manner from person in vehicles. 
(3)  On any public transportation. 
(4)  Within fifteen (15) feet of any entrance or exit of any or within fifteen (15) feet of any automated teller machine during the hours of operation of such bank or automated teller machine without the consent of the owner or other person legally in possession of such facilities; provided, however, that when an automated teller machine is located within an automated teller machine facility, such distance shall be measured from the entrance or exit of the automated teller machine facility. 
(5)  On private property if the owner, tenant or lawful occupant has asked the person not to solicit on the property or has posted a sign clearly indicating that solicitations are not welcome on the property. 
(d)  Miscellaneous 
(1)  This section is not intended to prohibit any demand for payment for services rendered or goods delivered. 
(2)  Transient merchants or itinerant vendors shall obtain a solicitor's permit as required by Chapter 30 of the Code of Laws. 
(3)  Solicitation from persons in vehicles shall only be allowed after issuance of a solicitation permit authorized by section 14-126 of the Code of Laws.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ordinance No. 6467, §§ 1, 2, adopted June 14, 2011, repealed the former Ch. 22A, §§ 22A-1-22A-24, and enacted a new Ch. 22A as set out herein. The former Ch. 22A pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 4821, adopted Jan. 9, 1996. 

Sec. 22A-1. - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "The Urban Redevelopment Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 6467, § 2, 6-14-11) 
Sec. 22A-2. - Determination of necessity for legislation. 
    It is hereby determined and declared by the board that: 
(a)  In certain portions of the city obsolete, decadent, substandard, or blighted areas exist occasioned by inadequate planning, excessive land coverage, lack of proper light, air or open space, defective design or arrangement of buildings, or the existence of buildings which, by reason of age, obsolescence, inadequate or outmoded design, or physical deterioration, have impaired the economic and social value of large areas, infecting them with blight and that such conditions are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, or crime, or inability to pay reasonable taxes; 
(b)  Such areas are characterized by depreciated values, impaired investments, reduced or negligible income and consequent tax delinquencies; 
(c)  Such conditions exist in areas where obsolete, decadent, substandard, outworn or outmoded industrial, commercial, or residential buildings prevail; that their assembly for purposes of clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and redevelopment may be difficult and costly; 
(d)  The existence of such conditions and the failure to clear, replan, rehabilitate, reconstruct, or redevelop these areas results in progressive deterioration, and occasions large outlays for creation of public facilities and services elsewhere; 
(e)  It is desirable to induce private capital investments to alleviate these conditions and redevelop these areas but that sometimes it is impossible or uneconomic for individual owners to independently undertake to remedy such conditions; 
(f)  Such conditions require the employment of capital on an investment basis, allowing however, that widest latitude in the amortization of any indebtedness created thereby; 
(g)  Such conditions further require the acquisition of adequate areas at fair prices, the clearance of such areas through demolition of existing obsolete, decadent, inadequate, or unsafe buildings and the redevelopment of such areas under proper supervision with appropriate planning as to land use and construction policies; that the clearance, replanning, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and land redevelopment of such areas on a large scale basis are necessary for the public welfare and are public uses and purposes for which private property may be acquired by purchase or eminent domain; and 
(h)  Obsolete, decadent, substandard, and blighted areas constitute a menace to the citizens of the city. 
    Therefore, the necessity for the provisions in this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination to be in the public interest. 
(Ord. No. 6467, § 2, 6-14-11) 
Sec. 22A-3. - Acceptance of application of the Urban State Enabling Act. 
    The provisions of the Urban Redevelopment Corporations Law, found in RSMo Ch. 353, are hereby accepted and shall apply to all persons and corporations operating under this chapter insofar as the same may be applicable thereto. 
(Ord. No. 6467, § 2, 6-14-11) 
Sec. 22A-4. - Purpose statement. 
    Considering the necessity of this chapter, as established in section 22A-2, the board states its intent that this chapter be implemented, construed, and interpreted in a manner deemed most effective to carry out the following purposes:

(b)  To incentivize the redevelopment of such areas in accordance with the city's adopted economic development policy and other city visioning documents. 
(c)  In light of any incentives provided, to maximize benefits to the city and other affected taxing jurisdictions through payments in lieu of taxes, increased personal property tax and sales tax revenues, and revenues generated from base-level real property values. 
(d)  To ensure that applications for incentives made pursuant to this chapter fit the parameters of the city's adopted economic development incentive policy, including, but not limited to, such factors as expanding the future tax base of all affected taxing jurisdictions, satisfying minimum capital improvement requirements, and balancing incentive to investment ratios.

At such hearing, some evidence of the vehicle or junk which is deemed to constitute a nuisance as defined in this article shall be presented. Thereupon, the director of community development may declare that such vehicle or junk constitutes a nuisance as defined in this article and order abatement of the nuisance by removal from the property on which such vehicle or junk is located to another location so that this or any other ordinance of the City of Grandview is not violated, such removal to begin within ten (10) days. Should the required removal be made to another premises in the City of Grandview in such a way that this or another ordinance is violated, no further notice to anyone is required before the abatement procedure set forth in Code section 23-16(b) can be commenced. 
(b)  Abatement; special assessment and personal debt. In case abatement of the nuisance is not begun within ten (10) days, the director of community development or his representative shall remove and dispose of such vehicle or junk, and shall certify the notice to abate the nuisance and the actual costs of same (including amounts billed to the city by private contractor, if any) plus an eighty-five dollar ($85.00) administrative fee to the finance director who should cause a bill to be prepared, filed and collected. If the bill is unpaid, the finance director shall have the option of adding said certified costs to the annual real estate tax bill or creating a special tax bill in a manner so as to be a first lien on such property from the date the tax bill is delinquent until paid. Such tax bill, if not paid within thirty (30) days of its issuance, shall bear interest at the rate of eight (8) per cent per annum. The tax bill from the date of its issuance shall also be deemed a personal debt against the owner. 
(c)  Exception for storage of one operable, but unlicensed vehicle. Persons ordered to remove vehicles or junk pursuant to the provisions of this article shall have the right to appeal to the director of community development for the storage of no more than one (1) vehicle if, in good faith, they feel that such vehicle is operable, but unlicensed. Such appeal shall be made within the time specified for abatement of the nuisance. Appeals made pursuant to this subsection shall require the director of community development or his representative and the person making such appeal to jointly inspect the vehicle in question within the time allowed for abatement. If the director of community development or his representative find the vehicle to be operable, the time allowed for abatement of the nuisance shall be changed to sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the notice to abate. If the director of community development or his representative find the vehicle to be damaged, disabled, or inoperable, the person making such appeal shall abate the nuisance within the time allowed by the notice to abate. Upon a showing of extenuating circumstances by the person appealing, the director of community development may allow the unlicensed, operable vehicle to remain on the property for up to one (1) year from the date of receipt of the notice to abate, provided the outdoor storage of said vehicle meets all standards of the zoning ordinance. Only one (1) unlicensed, operable vehicle shall be permitted to remain per dwelling unit at a given time. All other inoperable, wrecked, demolished, disabled or unlicensed vehicles shall be declared a public nuisance pursuant to the provisions of this article. 
(d)  Procedure where owner is unknown. When the owner or custodian of any vehicle or junk declared to be a nuisance as defined by this article cannot be notified as provided for in subsection (a) of section 23-16, such notice shall be attached to such vehicle or junk. If such vehicle or junk is not removed within five (5) days from the posting of such notice, such vehicle or junk is hereby declared to be abandoned property and shall be removed at the direction of the director of community development or his representative to a suitable city storage area designated by the director of community development or his representative. Such vehicles or junk shall be stored for a period of at least thirty (30) days and the owner thereof shall be entitled to redeem same by payment to the city of the actual costs for each removal and reasonable storage. In the event such vehicle or junk is unredeemed, it shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of sections 14-149 to 14-155, relating to abandoned motor vehicles and other personal property. 
(e)  Actions in emergency cases. Where it reasonably appears that vehicles or junk existing on premises within the city constitute a nuisance as defined in this article and pose an immediate danger to the health, safety or welfare of any citizen, the director of community development may take emergency measures to abate such nuisance.

A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action and shall not otherwise limit the director's authority to proceed under this article during the pendency of the show cause proceedings. 
(8)  Emergency suspensions. 
a.  The director may immediately suspend sewer service to an industrial user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, which threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
b.  Any industrial user notified of a suspension of sewer service shall immediately stop or eliminate its discharge.

(a)  The purpose of this article is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Grandview, Missouri through the regulation of stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent possible. 
(b)  The board of alderman of the city hereby finds that pollutants may discharge into surface waters, both through inappropriate non-stormwater discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) or the surface waters directly, and through the wash off and transport of pollutants found on the land and built surfaces by stormwater during rainfall events. Such discharge of pollutants may lead to increased risks of disease and harm to individuals, particularly children, who come into contact with the water; may degrade the quality of such water for human uses, such as drinking, irrigation, recreation, and industry; and may damage the natural ecosystems of rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands, leading to a decline in the diversity and abundance of plants and animals. 
(c)  Further, the board of aldermen of the city hereby finds that this article will promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the improper discharge of trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet waste, wastewater, oil, petroleum products, cleaning products, paint products, hazardous waste, sediment and other pollutants into the storm drainage system. Such discharges are inconsistent with the provisions and goals of the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), and other federal and state requirements for water quality and environmental preservation. 
(d)  Further, the board of aldermen of the city hereby finds that a reasonable establishment of restrictions and regulations on activities within the city is necessary to eliminate or minimize such discharges of pollutants, to protect the health and safety of citizens, to preserve economic and ecological value of existing water resources within the city and within downstream communities, and to comply with the provisions of the city's responsibilities under the Clean Water Act and the NPDES program.

No person shall construct, plant, or maintain, or allow the construction, planting or maintenance of any object, including live plants to a height greater than three (3) feet above the pavement elevation in a residential zone within a triangle formed by the centerlines of the streets and a line drawn between points located on the centerline of each street ninety (90) feet from the intersection of the centerlines at any intersection within the city, which object creates a sight obstruction for approaching motorists. Such a sight obstruction within an intersection triangle as defined herein is declared to be a public nuisance subject to abatement as provided in this section. 
(B)  Procedures for determination of existence of obstructions; removal. 
(1)  The city engineer may cause a study to be made of any intersection within the city at which he has reason to believe objects, other than legally parked vehicles, exist on private property which constitute an obstruction to sight and visibility to motorists using said street near said intersections. Such study shall use commonly accepted practices of traffic engineering, to determine whether or not a sight distance obstruction exists, and whether or not such obstruction constitutes a hazard to such approaching motorists. The city engineer may then recommend through the citizens advisory committee on transportation what such countermeasures to eliminate or reduce such hazard shall best serve the interests of the city and of public safety. Countermeasures to be considered shall include, but not be limited to: 
a.  Removal or modification of the sight obstruction to abate the condition as a public nuisance; 
b.  Installation of stop signs or other traffic control signs or devices, on one or both approaches to such intersections if the intersection is uncontrolled; 
c.  Reduction of the speed limits on one or both of the approaches to such intersections. 
(2)  Upon determination by the citizens advisory committee on transportation that it is necessary to remove or modify any sight obstruction, the city engineer shall notify the owner of the property on which such obstruction exists of such determination, which such notice shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested, and which notice shall allow the property owner not less than fifteen (15) days within which to comply with the order to remove or modify such sight obstruction. Such notice shall also advise the property owner of his right to request, in writing, a hearing before the board of aldermen, at which the property owner shall have the right to be heard, for the purpose of determining whether or not such objects do constitute a sight obstruction and should be removed, and whether or not the order of the citizens advisory committee on transportation is a reasonable directive to alleviate such hazard. 
(C)  Violations; penalty. 
(1)  Violation of any provisions of this ordinance, or the failure or refusal to modify or remove any sight obstruction after order by the city engineer or, in the event a hearing is requested, the board of aldermen, shall be deemed to be a misdemeanor, and any person violating any such provision, or failing to comply with the order of the city engineer, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). 
(2)  Each day during which any object which is a sight obstruction and which the property owner has been ordered to remove or modify is permitted to remain shall constitute a separate offense.

(A) Intent.
The provisions of this section are intended to apply to uses within all zoning districts of the City of Grandview except the C-3 District. Due to its unique character, the C-3 District shall be exempt from those provisions requiring off-street parking. No such use shall be commenced, expanded, or enlarged in any manner unless the off-street parking and loading provisions of this Section are complied with.
(B) Site Plan Required.
A site plan shall be required for the construction or creation of any parking lot or the expansion of any existing parking lot in accordance with the site plan provisions of Section 31-21 of this Ordinance.
(C) Computation of Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements.
The following provisions shall govern the computation of required off-street parking and loading spaces:
(1) Where computation of required off-street parking spaces results in a fractional number, the required spaces for the use shall be the next higher whole number.
(2) Where more than one use is established on a single lot, the off-street parking and loading requirements for each use established on the lot.
(3) No building or structure shall be erected or structurally altered, nor shall any land be used, for any purpose, without provision for off-street parking and loading as required by this Section. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to use changes of existing buildings unless such use change would require an increase in the number of parking spaces in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the parking spaces as required for the existing use established in Section 31-22(G) of this Ordinance.
Example of Computations:
(a) Existing Use: Required to have 20 spaces.
New Use: Required to have 23 spaces.
20% of existing use: 20% of 20 = 4 spaces.
New use may go up to 24 spaces without being required to provide additional spaces.
(b) Existing Use: Required to have 50 spaces.
New Use: Required to have 75 spaces.
20% of existing use: 20% of 50 =10 spaces.
New use may go up to 60 spaces before being required to provide additional parking spaces.
New use would be required to provide an additional 25 spaces.

(I) Outdoor Storage of Damaged, Disabled, or Unclaimed Vehicles related to Licensed Automobile Repair Shops.
A duly license automobile repair business may store outside of a completely enclosed building a maximum of three (3) vehicles for each service bay. The word storage shall be defined for the purpose of this section as a vehicle which is stored outside of a completely enclosed building, whether awaiting repair or not, for a period of not less than two (2) weeks but not more than six (6) months. Should extenuating circumstances require outside storage for more than six (6) months, the Director of Community Development may approve an
extension of up to nine (9) additional months for one or more vehicles. All outdoor storage areas must meet the minimum improvement requirements for storage lots as contained in the zoning ordinance.
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-22
As Amended 4/09/2013 136
Outside storage may be permitted in any side or rear yard only, provided it does not interfere with any area utilized for off-street parking of vehicles and it does not impede upon the right-of-way. However, if any side of an outside storage area can be viewed from any angle from:
a) 71 Highway or its frontage roads,
b) Blue Ridge Boulevard Extension, or
c) Main Street-Highgrove Road Corridor; or
d) Any abutting office or residential district,
Then, said storage areas shall be permanently screened from said right-of-way or said district with a 100% opacity fence a minimum of six feet (6) in height constructed of wood, masonry, vinyl, or similar approved material. Said storage areas shall be as a minimum gravel surfaced. Additionally, private driveways exiting directly from public streets which provide access to such storage lots/areas shall be permanently surfaced with either a asphaltic concrete or portland cement concrete.

31-23 LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING REQUIREMENTS
(A) Intent
The landscaping and screening requirements are intended to preserve and enhance property values by ensuring that yards, open spaces, parking lots and areas next to public rights-of-way are constructed and maintained with plants and landscape materials. This Section further intends that property development should respect land capability and constraints, minimize erosion and destruction of natural amenities and reduce conflicts between land uses.
(B) Application and Scope
No new structure, building or parking lot shall be constructed unless in compliance with the landscaping and screening standards of this Section.
(C) Definitions
For the interpretation of this Section, the following definitions shall be used.
(1) Landscaped: An area devoted to or developed predominately with plant material or natural landscape features, including lawn, ground cover, gardens, trees, shrubs, and other plant materials.
(2) Screened: Shielded, concealed, and effectively hidden from view by a person standing at ground level on an abutting site, or outside the area or feature so screened, by a fence, wall, hedge, berm, or similar architectural or landscaped feature.
(D) Landscaping Requirements
All uses shall provide and maintain a landscaped area as provided herein:
(1) Single-family and two-family dwellings shall maintain a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of lot area as a permeable and uncovered surface that contains living materials. Single-family and two-family dwelling shall install, prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, sod over the entire lot and plant a minimum of one (1) tree having a minimum two and one half inch (2 ½) caliper measured at one foot (1) above ground level in each front yard and generous foundation plantings of shrubs across the front of the dwelling. (Ord. #6116, 08/28/2007)
(2) All other uses shall provide and maintain a landscaped area that equals or exceeds ten percent (10%) of the total lot area, except that the C-3 district, because of its district and unique character, shall be exempted from this provision. The following areas are listed by priority for the placement of this required landscaped area and may be utilized in conjunction with the Screening Requirements as set forth in this Section:
(a) A minimum landscaped area of ten feet (10) in width along all street frontages.
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-23
As Amended 4/09/2013 138
(b) A minimum landscaped area of ten feet (10) in width along all perimeter property lines.
Additionally, of the required landscaped area, no more than twenty percent (20%) may consist of porous non-living materials.
(3) All off-street parking areas (except for single and two-family uses) shall provide site trees on the basis of one (1) tree for every ten (10) off-street parking spaces provided or fraction thereof. Fifty percent (50%) of required site trees shall be placed along street frontages. The remaining 50% may be placed in the interior of the parking lot. Site trees shall be of a minimum two and one-half inch (2 ½) caliper as measured one (1) foot above ground level at the time of planting. Further, required site trees may be utilized in conjunction with screening requirements as set forth in this Section.
(E) Screening Requirements
Where permitted uses are at a lower elevation than abutting frontage or use and screening is required by this Section, screening types which utilize plantings and berms are encouraged. It is recognized that in these instances an effective screen is difficult to achieve and, in such cases, seeks to provide the best screen possible.
(1) Table of Screening Requirements:
(a) Types of Screens. The following three basic types of screens are hereby established and are to be used as the basis for screening requirements as established in the Table of Screening Requirements as provided herein. Variations of these screening types may be permitted at time of site plan review with approval from the Director of Community Development.
(i) Opaque Screen, Type A. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet (6') with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least twelve feet (12'). The opaque screen is intended to exclude all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spacial separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm. Planted or natural vegetation screens will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation.
The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet (10') wide. The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are
included in the following diagrams. Planting areas for the placement of these screens shall be a minimum of five feet (5') in width.
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-23
As Amended 4/09/2013 139
(ii) Semi-Opaque Screen, Type B. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet (3'), with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least twelve feet (12'). The semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet (10') wide. The zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants. Planting areas for the placement of these screens shall be a minimum of five feet (5') in width.
(iii) Broken Screen, Type C. A screen composed of intermittent visual obstruction from the ground to a height of at least twelve feet (12'). The broken screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, planted vegetation, or existing vegetation. Compliance of planted vegetative screens or natural vegetation will be judged on the basis of the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns which will achieve this standard are included in the following diagrams. Planting areas for the placement of these screens shall be a minimum of five feet (5') in width.
(2) Screening Locations.
Screening, as required in the Table of Screening Requirements, shall be required along the common lot line(s) of adjacent uses. Where uses are separated by an intervening right-of-way, the burdened use need only screen from the adjoining right-of-way as required in the table. Screening required by a burdened use for a benefited use shall apply only to those uses which are determined to be permitted within the particular zoning district. A burdened use is not required to provide screening to benefit a use within a zoning district that is determined to be a non-conforming use.

ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-24
As Amended 4/09/2013 159
(1) The maximum area of the sign, shall be four hundred (400) square feet per face. No embellishments are permitted.
(2) Off-premise signs shall be spaced a minimum of one-thousand feet (1,000) apart as measured along the centerline of U.S. Highway 71 or Missouri Highway 150.
(3) Off-premise signs shall be restricted to property abutting U.S. Highway 71 or Missouri Highway 150.
(4) Off-premise signs shall be located a minimum of five hundred feet (500) from any residential zone, residential use, or any planned residential use as shown in the adopted Comprehensive Plan.
(5) Placement of said sign shall comply with the building setbacks of the zoning district.

(Ord. #6116, 08/28/2007)
(J) Non-Conforming Signs
Any sign which becomes a non-conforming sign on the effective date of this Ordinance or which becomes a nonconforming sign at any future date shall be regulated according to the rules set forth in Section 31-25(A) of this Ordinance. In the event that the structural framework or supporting members, or one or more parts thereof of such non-conforming sign require modification or replacement, then such non-conforming sign shall be made to conform to the maximum area, number, allowable structure type, protection, height, lighting, and motion requirements for signs otherwise permitted in the zoning district or be removed. The changing of the copy or advertising material on the face of the structure shall not be deemed modification or replacement.(Ord. #6116, 08/28/2007)

(L) Reserved for future use
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-24
As Amended 4/09/2013 160
(M) Sign Area:
(1) On-Premise Sign Area:
(a) Single Panel: The area of a single panel sign shall be measured by calculating the area of the extreme limits of the sign panel(s). If a single-faced sign contains more than one sign panel, the area of each sign panel shall be calculated separately and then the area of each sign panel shall be added together to yield the total sign area of a single faced sign. In no case shall the area between any sign panels or the supporting sign structure be calculated as part of the sign area.
(b) Double-Faced (or Panel): Same as single panel sign except that a double-faced sign shall only count one (1) face for sign area determination.
(2) Off-Premise Sign Area: The area of off-premise signs shall be measured in the same manner as on-premise signs, except for off-premise signs that have "add-ons" or embellishments to the principal sign panel then each additional "add-on" shall be calculated separately for its area and added to the principal sign panel. However, in no case shall the total area of the principal sign panel when
added to the "add-ons" exceed the maximum sign area provided within the district in which it is located.
(N) Sign Construction Standards
(1) Design
(a) General. Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist wind and seismic forces as specified in this Section. Bracing systems shall be designed and constructed to transfer lateral forces to the foundations. For signs supported on buildings, the dead and lateral
loads shall be transmitted to the ground in a manner so as to avoid overstressing the elements of the structural frame.
The overturning moment produced by lateral forces shall not exceed two-thirds of the dead-load resisting moment. Uplift due to overturning shall be resisted by proper anchorage to the ground or to the structural frame of the building. The weight of earth superimposed over footings may be used in determining the dead load resisting moment. Such earth shall be carefully placed and thoroughly compacted.
(b) Wind Loads. Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist wind forces as specified in the Grandview Building Code.
(c) Seismic Loads. Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist seismic forces as specified in the Grandview Building Code.
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-24
As Amended 4/09/2013 161
(d) Combined Loads. Wind and seismic loads need not be combined in the design of signs or sign structures; only the loading producing the larger stress need be used. Vertical design loads, except roof live loads, shall be assumed to be acting simultaneously with wind or seismic loads.
(e) Allowable Stresses. The design of wood, concrete, steel or aluminum members shall conform to the Grandview Building Code. Loads, both vertical and horizontal, exerted on the soil shall not produce stresses exceeding those specified in the Grandview Building Code.
The working stresses of wire rope and its fastenings shall not exceed 25 percent of the ultimate strength of the rope or fasteners. Working stresses for wind or seismic loads combined with dead loads may be increased as specified in the Grandview Building Code.
(f) If required by the Building Official, an engineers seal may be required to certify the design of the sign.
(2) Listing Required. Every electric sign of any type shall be listed and installed in conformance with that listing in the National Electrical Code, unless otherwise permitted by special permission.

31-25 SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS - USE
(A) Nonconformities
(1) Nonconformities, in General
Within the zoning districts established by this Ordinance or any subsequent amendment, there exist: a) lots; b) structures; c) uses of land; d) uses of structures; e) uses of land and structures in combination; and f) characteristics of use, which were lawful before this Ordinance was adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or its subsequent amendment. Such instances shall hereafter be considered lawful nonconformities.
The burden of proof of such claim shall be upon the property owner. Failure of the City to identify any lawful nonconformity shall not constitute evidence or be construed as an admission by the City that such property conforms to the regulations contained in this Ordinance. (Ord. #6116, 08/28/2007)
(2) Nonconformities, Intent
It is the intent of this Ordinance to recognize the legitimate interests of owners of lawful nonconformities by allowing such lawful nonconformities to continue, subject to the provisions contained herein. At the same time, it is recognized that lawful nonconformities may substantially and adversely affect the orderly development, maintenance, use and taxable value of other property in the same zoning district, property that is itself subject to the regulations and terms of this Ordinance. In order to secure eventual compliance with the City's Comprehensive Plan and with the standards of this Ordinance, it is therefore necessary to carefully regulate lawful nonconformities and to prohibit the re-establishment of such nonconformities that have been discontinued.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. "Actual building construction" is hereby defined to include the placement of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.
(3) Nonconformities, Lawful
(a) Lots: Any lot having insufficient area, width or depth for the zoning district in which it is located, frontage on an improved public street or an improved private street of a planned district, or any combination thereof, shall be considered a lawful nonconforming lot only if 1) it was lawfully platted and recorded and on file in the office of the Jackson County Recorder prior to the adoption of this Ordinance; 2) there has been a building permit issued on that lot; or 3) it was lawfully recognized by the City prior to January 1, 1978. On any single lawful non-conforming lot within a zoning district which permits single-
family detached residential dwellings, one such dwelling may be constructed by right, provided that height, lot coverage, and off-street parking requirements of
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 166
the zoning district within which the parcel is located are complied with, and all appropriate permits are obtained prior to any construction activity. Required yard setbacks for the district may be reduced by no more than 25 percent of the requirements of the zoning district within which the parcel is located if necessary and approved by the Director of Community Development. Further, no zoning lot or portion thereof shall be used or sold in a manner which will increase its degree of non-conformity.
(b) Structures: Structures that were lawfully constructed prior to the adoption of this Ordinance, but which could not be constructed under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, setbacks (yards), location on the lot or other requirements concerning structures, shall hereafter be considered lawful non-conforming structures. As such, they may continue to exist so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided that no reconstruction, enlargement or alteration of said structures shall occur that will increase their nonconformity except as provided for in Section 31-25(A) of this Ordinance. However, any lawful non-conforming structure or portion thereof may be altered to reduce its nonconformity.
(c) Uses:
(i) Uses of Land: Any use of land, or use of land which involves no individual structure with a replacement value exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000) which would not be permitted under the terms of this Ordinance but was lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance shall hereafter be considered a lawful nonconforming use of land. As such, it may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful and provided that no enlargement, increase or extension of the lawful nonconforming use of land occurs so that a greater area of land is occupied than was occupied at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, and that no additional structures or additions to structures existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance shall be constructed on the same zoning lot.
Further, no such lawful nonconforming use of land shall be moved or relocated in whole or in part to any other portion of the zoning lot on which it is located than that portion occupied at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance. If any lawful nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than ninety (90) consecutive days, and subsequent use of such land shall conform to the terms of this Ordinance.
(ii) Uses of Structures: Any use of a structure with a replacement cost of one thousand ($1,000) or more which would not be permitted under the terms of this Ordinance but was lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance shall hereafter be considered a lawful
nonconforming use of that structure. As such, it may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful and provided that the structure in which the lawful nonconforming use is located shall not be enlarged,
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 167
extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, relocated or structurally altered except in changing the use to a permitted use in the district in which it is located or as otherwise provided for in this Ordinance. However, a lawful nonconforming use of a structure may be extended throughout any parts of the structure in which it is manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, but if any lawful nonconforming use of a structure is discontinued for any reason for a period of 180 days, (except when government action impedes access to the premises), such structures shall only thereafter be used in conformity with the terms of this Ordinance. (Ord. #6116, 08/28/2007)
(iii) Uses of Land and Structures in Combination: Any use of land in combination with a structure with a replacement cost of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) which would not be permitted under the terms of this Ordinance but was lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance shall thereafter be considered a lawful nonconforming use of land and structure in combination. As such, it may continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful and provided that the provisions of Section 31-25(A)(3)(C) of this Ordinance are complied with.
(iv) Characteristics of Use: When an otherwise lawful existing use is permitted generally in any given zoning district but where, due to the adoption of this Ordinance, required off-street parking, paving of parking area, landscaping, screening, and similar regulations are not provided, such deficiencies attributable to the use shall be considered lawful, nonconforming characteristics of such use. Said deficiencies shall be brought into conformance when the use they attributable to is expanded, enlarged or the intensity is increased, even though the use itself is permitted generally.
(4) Change from One Nonconforming Use to Another
One existing lawful nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to one other nonconforming use of the same structure by the Director of Community Development based upon a review of the following criteria and when he/she reasonably believes that such a change will not adversely affect the purposes and intent of this Ordinance. If any of the criteria cannot be met or are violated due to the requested change from one nonconforming use to another, than the request shall be reviewed by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 31-27 of this Ordinance for their disposition.
(a) The proposed use is no more intensive than the existing use;
(b) The proposed use occupies no more area of the structure than the existing use;
(c) The proposed use requires no more off-street parking than the existing use; and
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 168
(d) Existing lawful nonconforming uses of a structure that change owners but continue the same use shall be permitted to do so provided that an agreement is signed by the new owner and kept on file in the Department of Community Development stating that the new owner agrees to all conditions placed on the previous owner and use(s) of the structure.
All signage for the existing use shall be removed and all signage for the proposed use shall conform to the underlying district in which it is located as provided in Section 31-24 of this Ordinance except that where signage is prohibited then one (1) wall-mounted sign of a maximum area of 40 square feet shall be permitted and the proposed use otherwise complies with the terms of this Ordinance and a Conditional Use Permit has first been obtained before any change or conversion is commenced.
(5) Lawful Nonconforming Uses Superseded
Anywhere a lawful nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, such lawful nonconforming use shall not thereafter be resumed.
(6) Expansion of Certain Lawful Nonconformities
Certain lawful nonconformities may be expanded by the Director of Community Development based upon a review of the following criteria and when he/she reasonably believes that such an extension will not adversely affect the purposes and intent of the Ordinance.
If any of the criteria cannot be met or are violated due to the expansion of the nonconformity, then the request shall be reviewed by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 31-27 of this Ordinance for this disposition.
(a) They are either a residential dwelling in a zoning district other than residential, or a commercial use allowed as a permitted or conditional use in one commercial zoning district but located in a different commercial zoning district where such use is not provided for;
(b) The current capital investment in buildings, structures, or other facilities of the enough to indicate that such use is likely to be maintained on the property for the foreseeable future;
(c) The continuance thereof will not be contrary to the public health, safety, welfare or the spirit of this Ordinance;
(d) The proposed expansion does not require additional off-street parking;
(e) The proposed expansion does not generate additional noise, vibration, odor, or is more intensive than what currently exists;
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 169
(f) The use and its proposed expansion do not and are not likely to significantly depress the value of nearby properties;
(g) No useful purpose would be served by strict application of the provisions or requirements of this Ordinance with which the use does not conform;
(h) The aggregate extent of the expansion does not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the gross floor area of the building devoted to the nonconforming use such expansion shall comply with the schedule of district regulations in the district in which it is located; and
(i) The public will receive some benefit from the proposed expansion through improvement of conditions on the property including but not limited to upgrading the appearance of the premises, removal of nonconforming signs, and addition of off-street parking and loading facilities.
No vested interest shall arise out of the approval of a Conditional Use Permit pursuant to this Section.
(7) Reconstruction of Certain Lawful Nonconforming Structures Should any lawful nonconforming structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than seventy-five percent (75%) of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it may only be reconstructed in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance; except that lawful nonconforming structures that are owner-occupied, single-family detached dwellings, may be reconstructed to their former condition, dimensions and location on the lot provided that the destruction was caused by an accident or act of God occurring after the adoption of this Ordinance and such reconstruction does not increase the degree of nonconformity where permitted must commence within twelve (12) months of destruction.

As Amended 4/09/2013 187
antenna or tower shall remove the same within ninety (90) days of a receipt of notice from the Board of Aldermen notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said ninety (90) days, the Board of Aldermen may remove such antenna or tower at the owners expense under the provisions of Chapter 6, Article V and may draw upon the financial security to recover incurred costs. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.
(J) Commercial and Industrial Building Appearance Guidelines.
(1) Site and Building Design: Compatibility with Other Development:
(a) The form and proportion of buildings should be consistent or compatible with the scale, form and proportion of other development within the business park.
(b) The rhythm of structural mass to voids, such as windows and glass doors, of a front facade should relate to the rhythms established in adjacent buildings.
(c) Care should be exercised to coordinate final grades and site arrangement with those of adjoining properties and streets.
(2) Location: Buildings should be located to ensure the provision of adequate open space for outdoor gathering areas, facilities, services and amenities and to provide natural indoor light, air and privacy to the extent possible. All buildings, parking lots and other structures should be located to integrate with the natural topography and to avoid deep cuts and fills, excessive foundation wall depth, unnecessary steps and steep access gradients.
Site Design should integrate building and parking elements with pedestrian ways.
(3) Lot Coverage: The maximum lot coverage should be 70 percent. Lot coverage includes those portions of the net site area covered by the ground floor of any structure, parking lots, and private streets and drives. Lot coverage does not include sidewalks or plazas.
(4) Design Focus: The front facade of a building, as well as the main entrance(s), should be designed as focal points to the building. The main entrances should incorporate devices such as canopies, overhangs, arcades,
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 188
raised parapets over the door, larger door openings, display windows, accent colors, and other architectural details such as moldings. The remaining portions of the building should be designed in a way that complements and is consistent with the buildings street façade.
Building details should be incorporated to break the façade of a structure.
(5) Visual Interest:
(a) Architectural design should create visual interest through the use of different textures, complementary colors, shadow lines and contrasting shapes. Monotonous design should be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting should be used to provide visual interest. Facades should be articulated with variations in the building plane and parapet height, materials and colors, entrance canopies, and landscaping. At a minimum, facades facing a public or private street should incorporate at least two of the following features along each applicable façade. These standards should be applied to each façade individually:
(i). Recesses and projections along at least 20 percent of the length of the building façade.
(ii). Windows, awnings, arcades or other significant architectural features used along at least 60 percent of the front building façade length or 30 percent of the side or rear building façade length.
(iii). Brick, natural or fabricated all weather stone covering at least 50 percent of the area when applied to the front building façade or 25 percent of the area when applied to a side or rear building façade.
(iv). Landscaping islands or planting against the building, covering at least 30 percent of the length of the building facade.
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 189
Recesses and projections along at least 20% of the length of the building façade.
(b) Loading docks, trash enclosures, outdoor storage and similar facilities and functions should be incorporated into the overall design of the building and the landscaping so that the visual and acoustic impacts of these functions are reduced to as great an extent as possible and are out of view from adjacent properties and public streets.
(c) Long expanses of overhead doors should be relieved by matching their color to the wall or trim, recessing the doors, or adding architectural details to diminish the dominance of the doors.
(d) The use of unusual shapes, color and other characteristics that cause new buildings to call excessive attention to themselves and create disharmony should not be allowed.
(6) Materials:
(a) The use of high-quality materials such as brick, glass, stucco, natural and fabricated stone, treated wood or similar durable and visually pleasing material should be used on the front facade and main entrances to the building. The remaining portions of the building should be designed to be compatible with the front facade and building entrance features. The following construction materials should be permitted:
(i). Reinforced Concrete and Masonry A concrete finish or pre-cast concrete panel (tilt-wall) must have an exposed aggregate, be hammered or sandblasted, or be covered with a cement-based acrylic coating to add visual interest. Masonry includes solid cavity faced or veneered-wall construction or materials. Brick material used for masonry should be composed of hard fire (kiln fired) all-weather common brick or other all weather facing brick.
(ii). Corrugated Metal or Aluminum Panels  The use of panels on front building facades or side building facades when
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 190
abutting a public or private street is prohibited. Corrugated metal or aluminum facades should be complemented with the use of masonry, weather brick, stone, stucco, split-face block, or broken up with the use of landscaping. Panels should have a depth of one (1) inch or greater and/or a thickness greater than U.S. Standard 26 gauge.
(iii). Stucco or Gypsum Concrete/Plaster  These materials should be complemented with the use of masonry, whether brick, stone, stucco, split-face block, or broken up with the use of landscaping.
(iv). Treated Wood Wood paneling or plywood should not be used on the front building façade or side building facades when abutting a public or private street.
(v). Structural Steel or Structural Aluminum
(vi). Glass
Reinforced concrete and masonry-type construction.
(b) All elevations of the building should be designed in a consistent and coherent architectural manner.
(c) Where a change in material, color, or texture along the exterior side of a building is proposed, the demarcation of the change should occur a minimum of twenty (20) feet on both adjacent sides of the building or to the natural dividing point established by the physical plan of the building.
(d) Building materials and design should be subject to the approval of the Plan Commission.
(7) Building Color: Building color should be limited to light, medium, and dark shades of earth tone gold and brown colors. Approximately 90 percent of each building wall surface should be light and medium colors. The remaining surfaces should be restricted to a darker color. The use of walls in a single color, with little detailing or completely blank, should not be permitted.
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 191
(8) Roofs: Careful consideration of durable materials, proportions, and shapes, emphasizing the importance of roofs as integral and embracing elements of the over-all design, is particularly important. Building roof tops should have at least two of the following features:
(a) Parapets concealing flat roofs and roof top equipment;
(b) Overhanging eaves; and
(c) Sloped roofs.
(9) Parking:
(a) Parking should be designed in a ways that do not dominate the character of the development nor appear as a dominant feature of the site.
(b) With the exception of customer/visitor parking, parking should be located to the rear and interior side of the building. Customer/visitor parking stalls should be located to the front or street side of the building, provided that it is designed as follows:
(i). The parking area should not exceed 30 percent of the overall parking area;
(ii). Parking should not span more than 50 percent of the lot width or depth;
(iii). Parking should not be located closer than 20 feet to the front or street-side property or lease line or 10 feet to the interior or rear lot lines;
(iv). Parking should be screened as required for parking visible from residential development; and

As Amended 4/09/2013 192
Customer/visitor parking in front of building.
(c) On-street parking or loading should be prohibited.
(d) Off-street parking and loading should be provided on the same lot as the use served except as otherwise approved as part of a shared parking concept.
(10) Access: Pedestrian access should be an integral part of the overall design of the development. The pedestrian access should provide not only safe and convenient access to and from off-street parking areas but should also connect with abutting properties and developments so as to accommodate an alternative means of transportation such as walking or biking to and from work and surrounding activities. Access to site or park amenities should also be provided.
(11) Sidewalks:
(a) Detached sidewalks at least 5 feet in width should be provided along all sides of a lot that abut a dedicated public or private street where sidewalks are required by the Citys public improvement manual and/or subdivision code. A continuous internal pedestrian sidewalk should be provided from the perimeter public sidewalk to the principal building entrance(s).
(b) Sidewalks should be provided along the full length of any facade featuring a customer entrance and along any facade abutting a public parking area. Such sidewalks should be located at least ten feet away from the building facade to provide planting areas for landscaping along the foundation of the building.
(12) ADA Compliance: All sidewalks, crosswalks, parking lots, or other areas of pedestrian circulation shall comply with ADA accessibility guidelines and standards (See Section 31-21(I)).
(K) Commercial and Industrial Building Appearance Guidelines, Landscaping and Screening.
(1) Landscaping Plan: Every site on which a building will be placed should be landscaped in accordance with plans and specifications
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 193
submitted to and approved the appropriate local reviewing agency. An on-site grading plan should be part of this landscape plan, which should be submitted along with the building plans.
(2) Installation: Required landscaping or screening should be installed at the time of building construction as the season permits. All other materials should be installed during the next planting season.
(3) Maintenance: The plan should include provision for ground maintenance such as an adequate supply of hose bibs. After completion, such landscaping should be maintained in a sightly and well-kept condition.
(4) Grass Sod and Seed, and Ground Cover: The required front and street side yards should be entirely graded and sodded or seeded from the existing or proposed street curb back to the building excepting only such areas used for plantings, drives, parking, or walks. Rear yards and interior side yards should be seeded or sodded except areas used for plantings, storage, parking, drives, or walks. Other types of ground cover in limited areas may be approved. All existing trees should be saved when possible.
(5) Street Trees: One street tree should be required for every 40 feet of street frontage. Street trees should be located in the street yard setback, and should not be located in the right-of-way.
(6) Landscape Materials: Landscape materials used for required landscaping and screening should be from an approved Permitted Plant Materials list, unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission. Evergreen trees and shrubs or approved deciduous trees and shrubs should be used as the primary landscape materials when required for screening.
(7) Roof Mounted Equipment: Roof mounted equipment, including ventilators, and satellite dishes greater than 30 should be screened from view (100% opacity) or isolated so as not to be visible from ground level of any adjacent public thoroughfare or residentially-zoned area, up to a maximum of three hundred feet (300) away. Screening should completely obscure from ground level all surfaces of the equipment. The appearance of roof screens should be coordinated with and integral to the building design to maintain a unified appearance, not merely a separately designed afterthought. It is not the intent of this requirement to increase the height of the screening significantly above that of the equipment in order to screen it from view from tall buildings or from higher ground.
(8) Utilities: All telephone and cable television lines, electrical services and distribution lines should be placed underground, except that this provision shall not include meters, electric and telephone service
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 194
pedestals, transformers, three-phase feeder lines, subtransmission and transmission lines, electrical substations and such other facilities as the utility may deem necessary to install utilizing overhead type construction. These aboveground utilities should be located as close to the building as permitted by the utility company and screened from view of public streets to the extent possible through the use of landscaping or screening walls that are integrated into the overall site design.
(9) Mechanical Equipment: All electrical and mechanical equipment located adjacent to the building and visible from any adjacent public thoroughfare or residentially-zoned area should be screened from view (100% opacity), up to a maximum of three hundred feet (300) away. Screening should completely obscure from ground level all surfaces of the equipment. Such screens and enclosures should be treated as integral elements of the buildings appearance.
(10) Trash: All trash, refuse, debris or garbage should be contained within an enclosed building or container designed for such purposes. Outdoor containers or dumpsters should be shielded on all sides by a wall or decorative fence constructed of the same or complementary materials to those used on the primary building. The use of landscaping to further decrease the visual impact of the trash enclosures is encouraged.
(11) Loading Docks:
(a) Loading areas should not be located at the front of the building, and where visible from the front of the building, should be screened from view from the street and neighboring properties.
(b) Where visible from a public street or residential-zoned property, the visual impact of loading docks should be minimized to the greatest extent possible through the use of landscaping, fences and berms.
(c) Where possible, the screening should be an integral part of the building structure and be used in conjunction with landscaping, ground cover, trees and shrubbery. If the screening is not an integral part of the building, then landscaping ground cover, trees and shrubbery should be used to screen the loading area.
(12) Exterior Storage: Except during permitted construction periods, all exterior storage of equipment, raw materials or finished products should be fully screened from the view of adjacent parcels and streets by a visual barrier such as a solid screen fence. Such exterior storage should not exceed the height of the barrier. The barrier should be a minimum of 6 feet in height. Additional height or screening such as
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 195
landscaping may be required based upon the height of the items to be screened. Chain-link fence with vertical slats should not be permitted.
(13) Parking: Parking lots should be screened from view from surrounding residential development. Such screening should be effective to a height of 42 inches for vehicles under 6 foot in height. For vehicles over 6 foot in height, the screen should be effective to a height of 6 foot. If landscaping is utilized to provide screening, the effective height should be reached upon maturity, but in no case should the initial effectiveness be less than 50% of the required effectiveness.
(14) Lighting:
(a) Light Mitigation: Cut-offs and lighting shields should be used to prevent spill over and glare onto adjoining streets and residential properties. Exposed lighting sources such as unshielded wall packs should not be permitted.
(b) Color: Lighting should predominantly consist of lights that have a warm appearance. Parking lot lighting should be of a type that provides sufficient lighting for safety and security without distorting the perception of color. Low-pressure sodium lights may not be used in parking areas or at main entrances.
(c) Coverage: Light coverage should be localized as part of an overall lighting plan. Light fixtures that broadcast light over large areas or that are a source of glare, sky-glow or other light pollution should not be permitted.
(d) Height:
(i). Building mounted lighting should not extend above the roof line of the building on which it is mounted.
(ii). Pole lighting heights should be a maximum of 14 feet.
(15) Signs:
(a) Types of Signs:
(i). On-Site Ground Sign - a sign on one or more supports erected parallel with (one-sided) or at right angles to (two-sided) the street frontage. The ground sign should not exceed (5) five feet in height from ground elevation, and should not exceed 50 square feet in area except as otherwise permitted in Section of this ordinance.
(ii). Wall Sign  a sign at the main entrance to the building displaying the company name and address only. Wall
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 196
signs should be limited to 5 square feet in area. Wall signs should be constructed of raised lettering of a single color complementary to that of the building, and should not project more than one foot from the face of the building.
(iii). On-Site Temporary Sign - ground or wall  a sign for the purposes of describing a construction or improvement project or advertising the lease of a site or buildings. The sign should be limited to 50 square feet and should not remain longer than completion of construction.
(b) Message: Signs should be limited to advertising only the names of the firms, companies or corporations operating the use conducted on the site or the products produced or sold thereon.
(c) Movement: Signs should not rotate, gyrate, blink or move in any animated fashion.
(d) Illumination: Illumination of the signs should be limited to 40 percent of the surface of the sign for non-neon lighting and 10 percent for neon lighting. In all instances, illumination should not be a nuisance to surrounding property nor conflictwith aircraft operations. All lighting should be shielded and confined within property lines. Internal illumination brightness level should be from 100-200 ft. lam.
(L) Residential Overlay District Development Guidelines
Good urban design can help new developments relate to adjacent developments to form strong neighborhoods. The land use pattern of a neighborhood plays a major role in determining its strengths and weaknesses Most older neighborhoods are linked in the traditional grid street pattern, which today is called a "neo-traditional" pattern. Neo-traditional concepts are encouraged in new infill development and in growth areas.
Residential land use should reflect a strong emphasis on the implementation and enforcement of the Zoning Regulations and Subdivision Regulations, while exploring innovative regulatory approaches in response to private sector development needs. The following section contains guidelines based on neo-traditional planning principles for new and infill development.
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 197
(1) Encourage the development of logical, interconnected street grids, and avoid angled street systems. Interconnected, grid-like street systems allow for a more dispersed traffic pattern because there are multiple routes to move from one place to another within the city. A grid configuration of streets helps to minimize peak hour traffic flows. In addition, these interconnected systems are more comprehensible and, thus, easier for visitors and residents alike to find their way around the city. On the contrary, angled street systems, with no apparent repetition or order, can be disorienting and tend to funnel traffic to collector-type roads, even for short distance travel. This situation contributes to unnecessarily heavy traffic on main roads at peak traffic periods. It should be noted that a grid street pattern does not necessarily require all streets to be straight. The design of the roadway system should work with the land. The basic goal for the city's overall road layout is a system of north-south roads that regularly intersect with east-west roads.
(2) Require the development of tree-lined streets. Street trees provide shade for streets and sidewalks, improve aesthetics, and generally encourage pedestrian use of sidewalks. Street trees also maintain a ceiling or canopy that further imbues a pedestrian scale to the streetscape.
(3) Require landscaping, primarily through preservation of mature trees and existing vegetation. Trees, shrubs, flowers, and other elements of the surrounding environment of a housing area greatly contribute to the quality of life within that area. Shade, wind breaks, beautification, and attraction of songbirds and other wildlife are all benefits of substantial plant communities within housing areas. By far the easiest way to capture these benefits for the residents of a housing area is to preserve the existing vegetation of a site as it is developed, rather than relying on newly planted materials to grow and mature, slowly recreating an environment which already existed in many cases.
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 198
(4) Require grass or planting strips between curbs and sidewalks. This space provides safety for pedestrians on the sidewalks and creates a visually appealing area.
(5) Encourage a diversity of housing façade styles and colors in new or infill developments. Repetitive or redundant façade styles within residential developments tend to diminish the visual interest and perception of quality in an area. Providing several façade styles allows for more individual expression of interest and taste.
(6) Encourage front porches on new houses. Front porches allow homeowners to comfortably spend more time near the front yard and street. This creates a greater opportunity to know ones neighbors, maintain a casual surveillance of the area, and thereby maintain a safe residential neighborhood. This also reinforces a small-town village ambiance.
(7) Sidewalks should be encouraged on both sides of residential streets. One of the most significant elements of small-town atmosphere and function is that residents can easily walk to other places within the community. By placing sidewalks on both sides of streets, pedestrian use is indicated as a priority in the community because of a prominent, safe, and accessible system.
(8) Encourage bike/hike paths connecting to existing or proposed trails. The development of bike/hike trails creates alternative modes of access and transportation for neighborhood children and adults. Links can provide access to parks, community centers and shopping areas while reducing a familys reliance on the automobile.
(9) Promote the creation of deeper lots for more green space. Deep residential lots allow for more green space within a residential community by providing room for more backyard shade trees, landscaping, and in instances where existing vegetation is nearby, more beneficial wildlife habitat. Houses should not be allowed to be pulled back off of the streets because of deeper lots as this diminishes the small-town pedestrian quality of the street environment. Yard setback requirements should also specify a "build-to" line.
(10) Encourage visually appealing, points of beautification and identification within subdivisions. The development of points of beautification within new
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 199
subdivisions can enhance the perception of neighborhood, a characteristic that is important in the development and maintenance of small-town atmosphere. Beautification areas should be encouraged particularly at entrances, including the inclusion of subdivision identification monument signs.
(11) Develop fence specifications to control type of fencing used in residential areas. Fences help individual property owners establish a clearly defined space around their homes, which is an important element in developing a sense of security in a residential area. Most fencing types should be allowed in residential areas, except privacy fences which prohibit visual access to property and makes casual surveillance by law enforcement and neighbors more difficult. Visual surveillance is an important part of creating a safe neighborhood environment.
(12) De-emphasize garages extending out from house fronts. Garages which extend out from the front of a house create an emphasis on the automobile system of a neighborhood, diminish the effects of inviting front doors and porches, and are simply less attractive than the house itself. All of these effects break down the pedestrian oriented quality, which is sought for new residential areas.
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25
As Amended 4/09/2013 200
(13) Design new subdivisions in order to minimize initial and future public and private costs. Clarify and enforce policies and regulations to assure that public improvements are paid for by private development rather than the city-at-large.

Applications, standards for review and design guidelines shall be available in the office of the Director of Community Development for distribution to the public.
(a) A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25A
As Amended 4/09/2013 217
and its site and environment.
(b) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
(c) Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.

(e) Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved.
(f) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
(g) Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.

ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-25A
As Amended 4/09/2013 218
to the average height of existing buildings on the streetscape. New construction that greatly varies in height from other buildings in the immediate vicinity shall be considered inappropriate.
(b) The scale, massing, and orientation of proposed buildings or additions to existing buildings shall be compatible with older buildings in the immediate vicinity.
(c) The emphasis or horizontality or verticality shall be compatible with the character of buildings in the immediate area.
(d) New construction or alterations must follow the existing setback pattern for residential dwellings or structures and shall maintain the same entry height as neighboring buildings.
(e) The sense of entry of primary entrance locations shall be compatible with existing patterns in the streetscape.
(f) Roof forms of new buildings and alterations should duplicate the existing or traditional roof shapes, pitches and materials found in the area.

(a) When a building or structure is to be moved from a landmark site or a historic district or conservation district, the factors to be considered shall include: the possibility that the building or structure may be demolished in its present location, the contribution that the building or structure makes in its present location and the effect of the new location on the historical and architectural qualities of the building or structure.
(b) When an application is made for moving a building or structure to a landmark site or a historic district or conservation district the factors to be considered shall include the architectural and historical integrity and craftsmanship of the building or structure, the impact on the site and area to which the building or structure will be moved, and the possibility that the building or structure may be demolished in its present location.
(c) For all applications, the HPC shall evaluate the evidence submitted on the feasibility of successfully moving the building or structure.
(8) Standards for Review; Demolition. In considering applications for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition, the HPC shall determine and consider:
(a) The propertys significance and integrity;
(b) The integrity of the streetscape and surrounding neighborhood;

including but not limited to, a structural stability report prepared by a licensed professional engineer, written justification, and a site plan and elevations for proposed infill, if applicable;
(d) Whether every reasonable effort has been made to rehabilitate, reuse, or relocate the property;
(e) The proposed reuse of the parcel and compatibility of proposed infill.

(E) Procedures for District Map or Text Amendments
(1) Zoning District Map Amendments
(a) Intent. It shall be the intent of the Board of Aldermen to reclassify property where:
(i) that circumstances and conditions affecting the property in question have so materially changed as to demand reclassification in the public interest; or
(ii) that the change is consistent with and in furtherance of the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan.
[Ord. # 6005, 04/25/2006]
It is intended under this Ordinance that the Planning Commission is the body responsible for the formulation and continuing review of the City's Zoning Ordinance and Comprehensive Plan and that the Commission shall be charged with the duty of periodically reviewing the policies and provisions of this Ordinance in light of its own initiative, such district reclassification or Ordinance amendments as may be deemed appropriate to secure the public welfare.
(b) Initiation of Amendments. Boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Ordinance, the classification of property uses therein, or other provisions of this Ordinance may be amended from time to time. Amendments of this Ordinance may be initiated by:
(i) The verified application of one or more owners of property requesting that the Ordinance be amended to reclassify their property.
(ii) The Board of Aldermen.
(iii) The City Planning Commission.
(c) Planning Commission Action. Following the public hearing as described in 31-26 (E)(1)(e), the Commission may act to recommend approval or disapproval of the request. The affirmative vote of a
majority of the Commission members present shall constitute a recommendation of approval of a zoning reclassification request. A failure of the Commission to consider a zoning reclassification request within sixty (60) days following receipt of the request shall constitute Commission recommendation of approval thereof. A recommendation
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-26
As Amended 4/09/2013 231
of the Commission shall forthwith be transmitted to the Board of Aldermen for its action.
(d) Board of Aldermen Action. Following receipt of any recommendation of the Commission, or on finding that the Commission has not con-sidered the request within the sixty (60) day limitation, The Board of Aldermen shall initiate final action on the request. The Board of Aldermen shall act to hold its own public hearing on the requested reclassification, at which time all interested parties shall have an opportunity to be heard. Proper notice of said hearing shall be given as provided in Section 31-26 (E)(1)(e).
Following the public hearing, the Board of Aldermen shall act to adopt or reject the reclassification request. In cases where the Commission has recommended disapproval of the reclassification, the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Board of Aldermen shall be required to enact the reclassification.
Furthermore, in case of a written protest against the reclassification request which is filed with the Department of Community Develop-ment and signed by the owners of thirty percent (30%) or more of the area of the lots included in the request, or by the owners of thirty percent (30%) or more of the property which is located within one hundred eighty-five feet (185') of the exterior parallel boundaries of the property being considered for classification, such request shall not be enacted except by the favorable vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Board of Aldermen.
(e) Notice and Hearing Requirements. Notice of the time and place of all public hearings to be held by the Planning Commission or Board of Aldermen shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the hearing. A reasonable effort shall be made to notify by regular mail those property owners whose property is being considered for reclassification and those adjacent owners of property within one hundred eighty-five feet (185') as measured parallel therefrom, prior to the first public hearing in which the reclassification request will be considered. Where the Commission or Board of Aldermen has set a public hearing on a reclassification request, the Department of Community Development shall take responsible steps to give notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing by a courtesy mailing to all property owners within one-hundred eighty-five feet (185') of the property as measured parallel for which reclassification is requested, and to the owner(s) of the property included in such request.
In all cases, however, the notice shall be mailed not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing announced therein. It shall be noted that this mailing is a courtesy mailing only and not required by State Statute.

(2) Zoning Text Amendment Procedure.
(a) Initiation and Commission Action. Any person may propose amendments to the provisions of this Ordinance by delivering a copy of the proposed amendment to the Department of Community Development. Such proposals shall be considered in regular session by the Planning Commission which will diligently act to set the proposal for public hearing as provided in Section 31-26 (E)(1)(e) of this Ordinance. Following the public hearing, the Commission may act to recommend approval or disapproval of the proposed amendment.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the Commission members present shall be required to constitute a recommendation of approval of the proposed amendments. The Commission's recommendation shall be forthwith transmitted to the Board of Aldermen for their action. A failure by the Commission to act within sixty (60) days following receipt of the proposed amendment shall constitute Commission recommendation of approval thereof.
(b) Board of Aldermen Action: Following receipt of the Commission's recommendation or expiration of the sixty (60) day limit for Commission action, the Board of Aldermen shall act to hold its own public hearing on the proposed amendment, at which all interested parties shall have an opportunity to be heard. At least fifteen (15) day's notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.
Following the public hearing, the Board of Aldermen shall adopt or reject the proposed amendment. In those cases where the Commission has recommended disapproval of the amendment, the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Board of Aldermen shall be required to enact the amendment.
(3) Application Schedule. Whenever any application shall have been denied by the Board of Aldermen, no new application covering the same property or the same property and additional property shall be filed with or considered by the Board of Aldermen until one year shall have elapsed from the date of filing the first application.
Under no circumstances shall the required fee and notice costs be refunded upon failure of a proposed application to be enacted into law.

As Amended 4/09/2013 233
(F) Conditional Use Procedures
(1) Intent. It is intended that a "Conditional use" means a use which, because of its unique or varying characteristics, cannot be properly classified as a permitted use in a particular district. After due consideration, as provided for this ordinance, of the impact of such use upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at a particular location, such conditional use may or may not be granted by the Board of Aldermen.
(2) Application Requirements. Any property owner or person representing the property owner may file an application to use a property for one of the Conditional Uses permitted in the district in which the property is located. All applications for a Conditional Use Permit shall be filed with the Department of Community Develop-ment. The applicant shall be required to supply all pertinent items of information required to review such application. Review of the application for a conditional Use Permit may be obtained by delivering two (2) copies of the completed application form to the Director together with payment of the required fee as specified in this Ordinance. Upon receipt of the completed forms and the required fee, the Director shall forthwith transmit one (1) copy of the form to the Planning Commission while retaining the original form as part of his permanent records. Prior to its review, the Planning Commission may require the applicant for a Conditional Use Permit to supply any further information beyond that contained in the application form where it reasonably considers such information necessary to make the determinations required by this Ordinance.
(3) Application Schedule. Whenever any application shall have been denied by the Board of Aldermen, no new application covering the same property or the same property and additional property shall be filed with or considered by the Board of Aldermen until one year shall have elapsed from the date of filing the first application.
Under no circumstances shall the required fee and notice costs be refunded upon failure of a proposed application to be enacted into law.
(Ord. #6116, 08/28/2007)
(4) Standards for Granting a Conditional Use Permit. No Conditional Use Permit shall be granted unless the Board of Aldermen determines, on the basis of specific information presented at the public hearings, or contained in the application for such use, that each of the following conditions have been satisfied:
(a) The proposed Conditional Use will comply with all applicable regulations of this Ordinance, including lot requirements, bulk regulations, use limitations, and all other standards or conditions contained in the provisions authorizing such use.
(b) Adequate utility, drainage and other necessary facility or improvements have been or will be provided.
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-26
As Amended 4/09/2013 234
(c) Adequate access roads or entrance and exit drives will be provided and will be designed so as to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic conflicts and congestion in public streets and alleys.
(d) All necessary permits and licenses required for the operation of the Conditional Use have been obtained, or it clearly appears that such permits are obtainable for the proposed Conditional Use on the subject property.
(e) All exterior lighting fixtures are shaded wherever necessary to avoid casting direct light upon any property located in a residential district.
(f) The location and size of the Conditional Use, the nature and intensity of the activities to be involved or conducted in connection with it, the size of the site in relation thereto, and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to the Conditional Use, shall be such
that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the district and neighborhood in which it is located.
(g) The location, nature and height of buildings, structures, walls, and fences on the site and the nature and extent of landscaping and screening on the site shall be such that the use will not reasonably hinder or discourage the appropriate development, use and enjoyment of the adjacent land, buildings and structures.
(h) The proposed Conditional Use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is located and will contribute to and promote the convenience and welfare of the public.
(i) Additional standards for granting a Conditional Use Permit for a change in nonconforming uses.
The granting of any Conditional Use permit under this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any other use not specifically listed as a Permitted or Conditional Use for the district.
The Planning Commission and Board of Aldermen may solicit the opinion or advice of its Staff or any other public agency or employee(s) whose advice it considers necessary to properly make the determinations required by this Section. Such opinions or advice shall be read or otherwise publicly presented at the public hearing and is specifically identified as a determining consideration in the Board of Aldermens final written decision.
(5) Public Hearing and Commission Action. Following receipt of the completed application form and any additional information required by the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider the application for a Conditional Use Permit.
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-26

Notice of the time and place of the public hearing shall be published in the newspaper of general circulation at least fifteen (15) days prior to such hearing. Proper notice of said hearing shall be given as provided in Section 31-26(E)(1)(e) of this Ordinance.
At the public hearing, all interested parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to appear and express their views on the application, either in person or by agent.
Following the public hearing, the Commission may act to recommend approval or disapproval of the request. The affirmative vote of the majority of the Commission members present shall be required to constitute a recommendation of approval of a Conditional Use. A failure of the Commission to consider a Conditional Use request within sixty (60) days following receipt of the request shall constitute Commission recommendation of approval thereof. A recommendation of the Commission shall forthwith be transmitted to the Board of Aldermen for its action.
(6) Public Hearings and Board of Aldermen Action. Following receipt of any recommendation of the Commission or on finding that the Commission has not considered the request within the sixty (60) day limitation, the Board of Aldermen shall initiate final action on the request. The Board of Aldermen shall act to hold its own public hearing on the requested conditional use at which time all interested parties shall have an opportunity to be heard. Proper notice of said hearing shall be given as provided in Section 31-26(E)(1)(e) of this ordinance.
Following the public hearing, the Board of Aldermen shall act to adopt or reject the Conditional Use request. In cases where the Commission has recommended disapproval of the Conditional Use, the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the Board of Aldermen shall be required to enact the Conditional Use.
(7) Conditions and Restrictions on the Conditional Use Permit.
(a) Imposition of Conditions and Restrictions. In granting a Conditional Use Permit, the Board of Aldermen may impose any conditions or restrictions it reasonably considers necessary to insure full compliance with the standards of Section 31-26(F)(3) to reduce or eliminate any detrimental effect of the proposed Conditional Use upon the neighborhood or the district, or to carry out the general purposes and intent of this Ordinance.
(b) Modification of Conditions and Restrictions. Any subsequent change or modification of a condition or restriction imposed by the Board of Aldermen in granting a Conditional Use Permit must be approved in the same manner and with the same requirements as the original application for Conditional Use Permit.
(c) Violation of Conditions and Restrictions. A violation of such conditions and restrictions, when made a part of the terms under which the Conditional Use Permit is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance.

(C) General Powers.

ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-27
As Amended 4/09/2013 238
alteration of buildings or structure (area variance), or where carrying out the strict letter of such regulations or provisions relating to the use of land would cause unnecessary hardship (use variance), so that the spirit of this Ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
(2) Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this Ordinance.
(3) Other Matters. To hear and decide all other matters referred to it or upon which it is required to pass under this Ordinance.
(D) Variance Procedure
(1) Application. Any person owning property may apply for a variance from the strict enforcement of the regulations or provisions of this Ordinance relating to the construction or alteration of buildings or structures or the use of land. All applications for a variance shall be filed with the Department of Community Development. The applicant shall be required to supply all pertinent items of information contained on the official application form as a condition to review such application. Review of the application for a variance may be obtained by delivering a copy of the completed application form to the Director or his designee together with payment of the required fee as specified in this Ordinance. Upon receipt of the completed forms and the required fee, the Director shall forthwith transmit a copy of the completed form to the Board, retaining the original form as part of his permanent records. Prior to its review, the Board may require the applicant to supply any additional information beyond that contained in the application form where it reasonably considers such information necessary to make the determination.
(2) Notice and Meeting Requirements. Following receipt of a completed application, the Board shall consider such application at a public hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the hearing and a courtesy notification sent by regular mail to all owners of property within one hundred eighty-five feet (185') of the property for which variance is sought. At the public hearing, all interested parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to appear and express their views on the application, either in person or by agent. A record of such meeting shall be entered into the minutes of the Board.
(E) Requirements for the Granting of a Variance.
The Board may grant a variance only under exceptional circumstances where practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship is so substantial, serious and compelling that relaxation of the general restrictions ought to be granted. No variance shall be granted unless the applicant shall show and the Board shall find all of the following:
(1) For an Area Variance:
(a) Hardship Due to Particular Property. This hardship relates to the particular property, because of size, shape, topography or other physical
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-27
As Amended 4/09/2013 239
conditions, rather than personal circumstances, and is unique, or nearly so, rather than one shared by surrounding properties; and
(b) Reasonable Use. If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of this Ordinance, he is unable to make reasonable use of the affected property; and
(c) No Self-Imposed Hardship. This hardship does not exist because of conditions created by the owner or previous owners of the property; and
(d) No Special Privileges. Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district; and
(e) Not Contrary to Public Interest or Property Values. Granting of the variance will not be contrary to the public interest, will not adversely affect other property in the vicinity, and will be in harmony with the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
(2) For a Use Variance:
(a) Unique Character of Property. Applicant must prove relief is necessary because of character of the particular property, rather than personal circumstances, and is unique, or nearly so, rather than one shared by surrounding properties; and
(b) Reasonable Return. The land in question cannot yield a reasonable return if used only for a purpose allowed in that zone; and
(c) Unique Circumstances. The owners plight is due to unique circumstances and not to general neighborhood conditions; and
(d) Character of Neighborhood. The grant of a variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood; and
(e) Comprehensive Plan. Granting a variance will not destroy preservation of the Comprehensive Plan; and
(f) Substantial Justice. Granting variance will result in substantial justice for all.
In ruling on a variance application, the Board may consider prospective financial loss or gain to the applicant, but such consideration shall not be the total reason for granting or denying a variance.

ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-27
As Amended 4/09/2013 240
(F) Conditions and Restrictions Attached to the Granting of a Variance.
In granting a variance, the Board may impose any conditions or restrictions it reasonably considers necessary to insure full compliance with the standards of Section 31-27(E) of this ordinance to reduce or eliminate any detrimental effect of the proposed variance upon the neighborhood or the public welfare, or to carry out the general purposes and intent of this ordinance. A time limit of one (1) year within which the contemplated construction must be underway or completed, or the variance approval would become null and void. Violation of such conditions and restrictions, when made a part of the terms under which a variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance. (Ord. #6116, 08/28/2007)
(G) Decisions and Records.
The Board shall render a written decision on an application for a variance within sixty (60) days after the close of the public hearing. The decision of the Board shall contain specific findings of fact supporting the granting or denial of the variance and shall clearly set forth any con-ditions or restrictions imposed pursuant to Section 31-27(F) of this Ordinance. It should be noted that, although variances have been determined to run with the land, a variance which has been granted by the Board is tied to the specific application and site plan reviewed by the Board at the time the variance was granted. Revisions of the approved site plan related to the approved variance shall be approved by the Board. The Board shall maintain complete records of all action with respect to applications for a variance.
(H) Appeals to the Board, Standards and Procedure
(1) Authorization. Appeals to the Board may be made by any person aggrieved or by any municipal officer, department, board or bureau affected by any order, require-ment, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this Ordinance.
(2) Procedure for Appeal. Appeals may only be filed within thirty (30) days immediately following the date of the administrative action which is the subject of the appeal. An appeal is filed by delivering to the Department of Community Develop-ment a completed application, together with the fee payment specified in this Ordinance. The Note of Appeal must, in addition to all other information required by the form, specify the particular grounds for the appeal. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all documents constituting the record upon which action appealed from was taken.
(3) Effects of Appeal. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board after the Notice of Appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
(4) Board Decision of Appeal. In exercising its powers of appeal, the Board may, in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from any
ORD. NO. 5631, APPROVED JUNE 10, 2003 31-27
As Amended 4/09/2013 241
may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that and shall have all powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
(I) Appeals from Board Decisions.
Appeals from action or decision of the Board shall be made in the manner as provided herein as follows:
Any person or persons, jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the Board, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality, may present to the Circuit Court of Jackson County a notarized petition, duly verified setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board.
Upon presentation of such petition, the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the Board to review such decision of the Board and shall prescribe therein the time within which a return thereto must be made and served upon the realtor's attorney, which shall not be less than ten (10) days and may be extended by the court. The allowance of the writ shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court may, on application, or notice to the Board and on due cause shown, grant a restraining order.
The Board shall not be required to return the original papers acted upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may be called by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth such order facts as may be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be verified.
If, upon the hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take additional evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court with the findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the determination of the court shall be made. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review.
Costs shall not be allowed against the Board unless it shall appear to the court that it acted with gross negligence, or in bad faith, or with malice in making the decision appealed from.
