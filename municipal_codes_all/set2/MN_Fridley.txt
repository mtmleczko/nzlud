preliminary to official action to the extent that he or she disclosed any such direct financial or

apply to political gifts that conform to the limitations prescribed by Minnesota Statutes for said
gifts.

days of the time of issuance of the notice pay the amount set forth on the notice, or may
request a hearing in writing, as provided for hereafter. The penalty may be paid in person
or by mail, and payment shall be deemed to be an admission of the violation.

Chapter may request a hearing before the Hearing Examiner. Such request shall be filed
in writing with the office of the Public Safety director within twenty (20) days of the
offense. The Public Safety Director shall notify the Hearing Examiner, who will notify

clerk and the City. Within ten (10) days after such hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall
affirm, repeal, or modify the charge against the licensee or sales clerk. Any person

pay the penalty, if an individual, the party will be charged with the criminal offense. If a
licensee, the Council will suspend the licensee’s tobacco license.
I. Disposition of Penalties. All penalties collected pursuant to this Chapter shall be
paid to the City’s treasurer and will be deposited in the City’s general fund.

City Council also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions
involving pawnbrokers. The City Council further finds that the pawn industry has outgrown the

CHAPTER 114. ABANDONED JUNK OR UNSAFE MOTOR VEHICLES
(Ref. 295, 1068, 1093, 1236)
114.01. PURPOSE
Abandoned junk and unsafe motor vehicles constitute a hazard to the health and welfare of the
residents of the community in that such vehicles can harbor noxious diseases, furnish shelter and
breeding places for vermin, and present physical dangers to the safety and well being of children
and other citizens. Motor vehicles contain fluids that if released into the environment can and do
cause significant health risks to the community. The condition of vehicles that are junked and
abandoned, junk or unsafe significantly increase the likelihood that these dangerous fluids might
be so released. Abandoned, junk or unsafe motor vehicles and other scrap metals also constitute
a blight on the landscape of the city and therefore are detrimental to the environment. The
abandonment and retirement of motor vehicles and other scrap metal constitutes a waste of a
valuable source of useful metal. It is therefore in the public interest that the present accumulation
of abandoned, junk or unsafe motor vehicles and other scrap metals be eliminated, that future
abandonment of motor vehicles and other scrap metals be prevented, and that other acceptable
and economically useful methods for the disposal of abandoned junk or unsafe motor vehicles
and other forms of scrap metal be utilized. (Ref. 1236)
114.02. DEFINITIONS
1. Abandoned Motor Vehicle.
A motor vehicle that has remained outdoors on property within the City for a period of more than
48 hours on public property illegally or has remained for a period of more than 48 hours on
private property without consent of the person in control of such property or in an inoperable
condition such that it has no substantial potential for further use consistent with its usual
functions, unless it is kept in an enclosed garage or storage building. It shall also mean a motor
vehicle voluntarily surrendered by its owner to the City or a duly authorized agent of the City. A
classic car or pioneer car, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, shall not be considered an abandoned
motor vehicle within the meaning of this Section.
2. Unsafe Motor Vehicle.
Any vehicle located outdoors on property within the city in which any systems including
braking, steering, suspension, electrical, lighting, motor, drive train system are not functioning or
a vehicle that cannot legally be driven or is in violation of any state, federal or local vehicle
equipment or safety regulation including, but not limited to Minnesota statutes.
Fridley City Code Section 114.03.B.

4-wheelers and snowmobiles.
114.03. ABATEMENT

that set forth herein) has been securely attached to and conspicuously displayed on the vehicle
for a period of five days prior to such impoundment excluding Saturdays, Sundays and city
holidays for the following reasons:
A. When such vehicle is parked and/or used in violation of any law, ordinance or
regulation; or
B. When such vehicle is abandoned, junk or unsafe.
Fridley City Code Section 114.06.2
114.04. VEHICLES IMMEDIATELY SUBJECT TO PUBLIC SALE
When an abandoned motor vehicle is more than seven (7) model years of age, lacks vital
component parts and does not display a license plate currently valid in Minnesota or in any other
state or foreign country, it shall immediately be eligible for sale by a duly authorized agent of the
City or at public auction and shall not be subject to the notification or reclamation procedures
established by this Chapter. (Ref 1236)
114.05. NOTICE
1. When an abandoned motor vehicle does not fall within the provisions of Section 114.04,
the City shall give notice of the taking within ten (10) days. The notice shall set forth the date

unsafe motor vehicle and the place where the vehicle is being held, shall inform the owner and
any lienholders of their right to reclaim the vehicle under Section 114.06 and shall state that
failure of the owner or lienholders to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle shall be deemed a
waiver by them of all rights, title and interest in the vehicle and a consent to the sale of the
vehicle at a public auction pursuant to Section 114.07.
2. The notice shall be sent by mail to the registered owner, if any, of the abandoned, junk or
unsafe motor vehicle and to all readily identifiable lienholders of record. The notice shall be

one who claims to be the registered owner of the vehicle, is residing or in custody at some
different address, a copy of the notice shall be mailed or personally delivered to such owner or
claimant in a manner designed, as nearly as may be practicable, to give actual notice to him or
her. If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and address of the
registered owner and all lienholders, the notice shall be published once in a newspaper of general
circulation in the area where the motor vehicle was abandoned junk or unsafe. Published notices
may be grouped together for convenience and economy.
114.06. RECLAIM
1. The owner or any lienholder of an abandoned, junk or unsafe motor vehicle shall have a
right to reclaim such vehicle from the City upon payment of all towing and storage charges
resulting from taking the vehicle into custody within fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice
required by Section 114.05.
2. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to impair any lien of a garagekeeper under the
laws of this State, or the right of a lienholder to foreclose. For the purposes of this Section,
"garagekeeper" is an operator of a parking place or establishment, an operator of a motor vehicle
storage facility, or an operator of an establishment for the servicing, repair or maintenance of
motor vehicles.
Fridley City Code Section 114.08.2
3. To reclaim a motor vehicle impounded pursuant to this ordinance, the owner or
lienholder must pay any costs and administrative fees incurred by the city and must agree to
relocate the vehicle in accordance with local state and federal regulations. The owner or
lienholder reclaiming such vehicle shall sign a “Release of Property” and shall agree to
immediate impoundment without notice if such vehicle again violates this section. In addition,
the City may require a bond to be posted if said vehicle has been subject to a prior impoundment.

Any property owner who feels aggrieved by an impoundment of a vehicle under this chapter may
request a hearing before the Hearing Examiner. Such request shall be filed in writing with the
office of the Community Development Director within twenty (20) days after the date of service
of the notice by the City or other duly authorized agent. The Community Development Director

Hearing Examiner, the property owner and the City. Both the property owner and the city may

determined by the Hearing Examiner to be relevant. Within ten (10) days after such hearing, the
Hearing Examiner shall affirm, repeal or modify the order of the City or other duly authorized
agent. Notice of the decision shall be mailed to the owner at the address given in the hearing
request. The Hearing Examiner’s order shall be accompanied by written findings of fact, and

decision of the Hearing examiner may appeal that decision to the City Council by filing notice of
such appeal with the Community Development Director within twenty (20) days of the mailing
of the Hearing Examiner’s decision. At its next available regular meeting following the filing of
a notice of appeal, the Council shall review the decision and findings of fact of the Hearing
Examiner and shall affirm, repeal or modify that decision. If the Council affirms the Hearing
Examiner’s decision declaring that a violation of this chapter exists, the City shall proceed to sell

CHAPTER 125. MASSAGE THERAPY BUSINESSES AND MASSAGE THERAPISTS
(Ref. 745, 757, 967, 969, 1035, 1356, 1375)
125.01. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS
1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter of the city code is to prohibit the operation of massage
businesses and the offering of massage services to the public except by those licensed as
massage therapy businesses and massage therapists pursuant to this chapter. The licensing
regulations prescribed herein are necessary in order to protect legitimate businesses, to prevent
criminal activity, and to protect the health and welfare of the community. The purpose of this
section is not to impose restrictions or limitations on the freedom of protected speech or
expression.
2. Findings of the City Council. The city council makes the following findings regarding the need
to license massage therapy businesses and massage therapists and to prohibit all other types of
massage businesses and services to the public:
A. Persons who have bona fide and standardized training in therapeutic massage, health, and
hygiene can provide a legitimate and necessary service to the general public.
B. Health and sanitation regulations governing massage therapy businesses and therapists can
minimize the risk of the spread of communicable diseases and can promote overall health
and sanitation.
C. Establishing license qualifications for massage therapy businesses and therapists can
minimize the risk that such businesses and persons will facilitate prostitution and other
criminal activity in the community.
D. Massage therapy businesses which employ persons with no specialized and standardized
training can tax law enforcement services because such businesses are more likely to be
operated as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity than operations established by
persons with standardized training.
E. The training of professional massage therapists at accredited institutions is an important
means of ensuring the fullest measure of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.

exist. The Council finds that these conditions present health and safety risks to residents,
occupants and visitors through fire, explosion, skin and respiratory exposure and related

be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the Ordinance as a whole or any part
thereof, other than the provision declared invalid.

204.01. EXTENSION OF NEIGHBOR SYSTEM
For the purpose of providing to every building and lot a street address by number which is
consistent with the address of every other building and lot, there is established in the City of
Fridley a system of numbering wherein the numbers provided for such buildings and lots
correspond, wherever reasonably possible, with the numbers already in common use in the City
and as are an extension of the numbers in common use in the adjacent areas of the City of
Minneapolis, and the City of Columbia Heights, whenever a road or street of the City upon
which building or lot is located is an extension of the same or a corresponding road of either of
such cities. Further, so far as the same can reasonably be avoided, the numbers shall not conflict
with those used in any other city or municipality which is adjacent or contiguous to the City of
Fridley. (Ref. 158)
204.02. SEPARATE NUMBERS
Each lot or parcel of land on every road or street shall have a separate number different from
every other lot or parcel on such road or street; and every building thereon shall have a number
separate and distinct itself, without regard to whether such building is a house or dwelling of any
kind, or otherwise.
204.03. UNIFORM
The numbers in each block on any road or street shall be a uniform series in simple arithmetical
progression from one end of the block to the other. They shall be consistent also from block to
block with the numbers in adjacent blocks and shall not exceed across any intersecting streets,
except as necessary to make the system uniform as a whole.
204.04. ODD AND EVEN NUMBERING
With respect to roads and streets running generally in a north and south direction, all lots and
buildings on the west side of the road or street shall have an even number; and all lots and
buildings on the east side shall have an odd number. With respect to roads and streets running
generally in an east and west direction, all lots and buildings on the south side shall have an even
number; and all lots and buildings on the north side shall have an odd number. As to roads or
streets which are in fact circular or so curved as not to run generally in one direction, the
numbers used shall be consistent with those in use on the nearest roads or streets which do.

or street, so that whenever an intersecting road or street has a name such as "49th Street", "72nd
Way" or the like, then the numbers on each side thereof shall reflect the same and not be in
conflict therewith.
204.06. RECORDS BY CLERK
It is the duty of the City Clerk to provide for and establish the records for said address and
numbering system of the City and to prepare and keep in the Clerk's office plats of the lots and
blocks in the City of Fridley, and to enter thereon, in such a manner as will enable all parties
interested readily to ascertain the same, the number of every lot or parcel as well as every building
in the City in accordance with this Chapter. Further, the Clerk shall make additions thereto from
time to time as may be necessary to keep such plats current. Where appropriate, two or more
numbers shall be assigned to the same lot or parcel so that the separate buildings thereon may
themselves have separate numbers; and where proper, as in the case of multiple dwellings and
buildings similar thereto, several numbers may be assigned to the same building. Any person
desiring to ascertain the number of any lot or parcel or any building thereon shall be so informed
by the City Clerk or any assistant thereof. Copies of such plats may be kept and maintained for
ready reference in the office of the City Engineer or elsewhere as the Clerk directs.
204.07. SIZE
It is the duty of the owner or owners of every lot or parcel of land in the City, fronting any road or
street, to ascertain the number or numbers assigned to their lot or parcel, as well as any buildings
thereon, and to place and keep in a conspicuous place on the front of any building thereon, the
proper number of such buildings. Such number shall be of visible size, make and design, and of
such materials as will make the same readily visible and readable under ordinary light during the
day time from the street upon which such building fronts. At night, such numbers shall be lighted,
or if not lighted, contain reflectorizing or other similar type material which will glow or readily
emit light so that such number can be easily read from the street when a light is placed nearby.
Such numbers shall be regular in shape, uniform in size, and not less than (3) inches in height.
204.08. REMOVAL
The City Clerk has the duty and authority to order any owner or owners of any lot or parcel of any
building thereon to remove from any building any number which is in conflict with the number
assigned to such building on plats of the City and to post thereon the correct number. Also, the
Clerk has the duty and authority to order the removal of any number which cannot be
Fridley City Code Chapter 204 Section 204.10
easily read from the street upon which such building fronts or is in violation of this Chapter in
any way, and to direct the posting of a number which is not in violation of this Chapter and can
be so easily read, both during the periods of light and of dark. A failure to comply with such
order within a period of ten (10) days of receipt of the order is a violation of this Chapter.
204.09. ENFORCEMENT
The enforcement of this Chapter and performance of the duties herein may be delegated by the
City Clerk to one or more assistants in the Clerk's office, and by resolution of approval thereto
by the Council, may be assigned to any other employee of the City.
204.10. PENALTIES

limited to lot coverage, setbacks, and height.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.04.3.F.(4)
(2) Application.
In order to be able to legally expand a structure that is non-conforming, an application

lines existing and proposed structures, driveways and parking areas, setbacks,
easements, significant topographical features, and mature trees;

(d) Such other documentation as may be required by the City.
(3) Decisions.
The City shall make its decision subject to condition within sixty (60) days of receipt
of completed application. An expansion permit for a non-conforming structure may
be granted by the Community Development Director or Planning Manager if the
applicant meets the burden of proving:
(a) The expansion does not increase or intensify the existing non-conformity;
(b) The expansion would be architecturally compatible with the existing principal
structure;
(c) Adequacy of off-street parking for the expansion;
(d) Absence of adverse off-site impacts from such things as traffic, vision safety,

conditions related to health and safety. All other applicable permits will need to be
obtained by the applicant in addition to the expansion permit.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.04.4.C.
(5) Terms of Expansion Permit.
An expansion permit granted by the City will run with the land and will be perpetual
unless no building permit has been issued or substantial work performed within one
year of the approval, in which case the permit will be null or void. The planning staff
may extend the period for construction upon finding that the interest of the owners of
neighboring properties will not be adversely affected by such extension. If the
expansion permit is part of an approved site and building plan, extension of the time
period of construction will be contingent upon a similar extension of the time period
for the site and building plan by City staff. Once the project is completed as
approved, the expansion permit becomes perpetual.

misdemeanor. A violation of the expansion permit shall result in revocation of the
expansion permit. Revocation shall occur after a public hearing by the City Council

a public nuisance that may be abated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
128.

more or less of this mean depth of the adjacent structures but in no case shall it be less
than the required front yard setback. In the case where one of the adjacent properties is
vacant, the assumed setback will be the minimum front yard setback requirement of the
zoning district that applies to the property.
G. In computing the depth of a rear yard setback for any building where the rear line of the
lot adjoins an alley, one half (1/2) of the width of the alley may be included as rear yard

hour storm with a 100 year return frequency. All run-off shall be properly channeled
into a storm drain water course, ponding area or other public facility designed for that
purpose. Any change in grade affecting water run-off onto an adjacent property must

without any substantial number of buildings located therein, as are of a type, size, style
and design as are deemed by the City and its inhabitants to meet the needs and the
purposes of residential, commercial or industrial uses; and, to enable an owner to make a

Statutes Chapter 103F and Chapter 462 delegated the responsibility to local government units
to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of
Fridley, Minnesota, does ordain as follows.
1.2 Purpose:
1.21 This ordinance regulates development in the flood hazard areas of Fridley, Minnesota.
These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare by minimizing these losses and
disruptions.
1.22 National Flood Insurance Program Compliance. This ordinance is adopted to comply
with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44
Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the
community’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
1.23 This ordinance is also intended to preserve the natural characteristic and function of
water courses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and storm water impacts,
improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community
and economic development.
SECTION 2.0 GENERAL PROVISIONS
2.1 How to Use This Ordinance: This ordinance adopts the floodplain maps applicable to
Fridley and includes three floodplain districts: Floodway, Flood Fringe, and General
Floodplain.
2.11 Where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps, the
standards in Sections 4 or 5 will apply, depending on the location of a property.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.2.51
2.12 Locations where Floodway and Flood Fringe districts are not delineated on the
floodplain maps are considered to fall within the General Floodplain district. Within
the General Floodplain district, the Floodway District standards in Section 4 apply
unless the floodway boundary is determined, according to the process outlined in
Section 6. Once the floodway boundary is determined, the Flood Fringe District
standards in Section 5 may apply outside the floodway.
2.2 Lands to Which Ordinance Applies: This ordinance applies to all lands within the City of
Fridley shown on the official zoning map which are within the boundaries of the Floodway,
Flood Fringe, or General Floodplain districts.
2.3 Incorporation of Maps by Reference: The following maps together with all attached
material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the Official Zoning
Map and this ordinance. The attached material includes the Flood Insurance Study for
Anoka County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas and the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated below, all dated December 16, 2015 and all prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. These materials are on file in the Planning Division of the City
Office.

Approved Letters of Map Change (LOMC) existing on December 16, 2015 are also herein
incorporated by reference.
2.4 Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation: The regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE)
is an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any
increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from
designation of a floodway.
2.5 Interpretation: The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by scaling distances
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
2.51 Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the official zoning
map and actual field conditions, the flood elevations shall be the governing factor. The
Zoning Administrator must interpret the boundary location based on the ground
elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first National Flood Insurance
Program map showing the area within the regulatory floodplain, and other available
technical data.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.2.914(b)
2.52 Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a reasonable
opportunity to present their technical evidence to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, according to the Code of Federal Regulations 44, part 65, and may apply to
FEMA for revisions, changes, or amendments to maps in Section 2.3 .
2.6 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions: It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or other private agreements.
However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this ordinance
prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.
2.7 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability: This ordinance does not imply that areas outside the
floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or
flood damages. This ordinance does not create liability on the part of the City of Fridley or
its officers or employees for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or
any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
2.8 Severability: If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this ordinance is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be
affected and shall remain in full force.

less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be selfpropelled
or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and is designed primarily not
for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational,
camping, travel, or seasonal use. For the purposes of this ordinance, the term
recreational vehicle is synonymous with the term “travel trailer/travel vehicle.”
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.2.940(b)
2.934 Regional Flood - a flood which is representative of large floods known to have
occurred generally in Minnesota and reasonably characteristic of what can be expected
to occur on an average frequency in the magnitude of the 1% chance or 100-year
recurrence interval. Regional flood is synonymous with the term "base flood" used in
a flood insurance study.
2.935 Regulatory Flood Protection Elevation (RFPE) - an elevation not less than one foot
above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused
by encroachments on the floodplain that result in designation of a floodway.
2.936 Repetitive Loss -Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two separate
occasions during a ten year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each
such flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25% of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.

reconstruction, rehabilitation (including normal maintenance and repair), repair after
damage, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred
“substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include either:
(a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or
local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure
safe living conditions.
(b) Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.” For the
purpose of this ordinance, “historic structure” is as defined in 44 Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 59.1.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.3.23
2.10 Annexations: The Flood Insurance Rate Map panels adopted by reference into Section 2.3
above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the City
of Fridley at the time of adoption of this ordinance. If any of these floodplain land areas are
annexed into the City after the date of adoption of this ordinance, the newly annexed
floodplain lands will be subject to the provisions of this ordinance immediately upon the
date of annexation.

explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
(b) Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain
must be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other
acceptable method. Permanent sand and gravel operations and similar uses must be
covered by a long-term site development plan.
(c) Temporary placement of fill, other materials, or equipment which would cause an
increase to the stage of the 1% percent chance or regional flood may only be
allowed if the City has approved a plan that assures removal of the materials from
the floodway based upon the flood warning time available.
4.43 Accessory Structures:
(a) Accessory structures must not be designed for human habitation.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.4.45
(b) Accessory structures, if permitted, must be constructed and placed on the building
site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood waters:
(1) Whenever possible, structures must be constructed with the longitudinal axis
parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
(2) So far as practicable, structures must be placed approximately on the same
flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
(c) Accessory structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in
accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in the State
Building Code. All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following
additional standards:
(1) The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or
lateral movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls; and
(2) Any mechanical and utility equipment in the structure must be elevated to or
above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed.
(d) As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet floodproofed to the
FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code, provided the
accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment and does not exceed 576
square feet in size. A detached garage may only be used for parking of vehicles and
limited storage. All structures must meet the following standards:
(1) To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum
of two “automatic” openings in the outside walls of the structure, with a total
net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding; and
(2) There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of
all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to
the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding
will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings.
4.44 Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section
of protected wetlands or public waters are subject to the provisions of Minnesota
Statutes, Section 103G.245.
4.45 A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must not cause an increase to
the 1% chance or regional flood. The technical analysis must assume equal conveyance
or storage loss on both sides of a stream.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.5.26

underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the standards in Section 5.2.
5.2 Standards for Flood Fringe Permitted Uses:
5.21 All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest
floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished
fill elevation for structures must be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill must extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet
beyond the outside limits of the structure unless alternative methods of protection are
provided in accordance with Section 5.46.
(a) All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or water-tight to
prevent infiltration of floodwaters.
(b) As an alternative to elevation on fill, an accessory structure that constitutes a
minimal investment and that does not exceed 576 square feet in size may be
internally floodproofed in accordance with Section 4.43.
5.22 The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel must not exceed 1,000
cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance
with Section 5.21 of this ordinance, or if allowed as a provisional use under Section
5.33 below.
5.23 The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill to the regulatory
flood protection elevation.
5.24 The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable,
explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited.
5.25 Fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly protected by the use
of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
5.26 All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not
more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation, or must have a
flood warning /emergency evacuation plan acceptable to the City.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.5.42(b)
5.27 Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at an elevation
lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, any facilities used by
employees or the general public must be designed with a flood warning system that
provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity
such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would
exceed a product of four upon occurrence of the regional (1% chance) flood.
5.28 Interference with normal manufacturing/industrial plant operations must be minimized,
especially along streams having protracted flood durations. In considering permit
applications, due consideration must be given to the needs of industries with operations
that require a floodplain location.
5.29 Flood fringe developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the
channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system.
5.30 Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the standards of Section 9 of
this ordinance.
5.3 Provisional Uses: The following uses and activities may be allowed as provisional uses, if
allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any applicable overlay district, following the
procedures in Section 10.4 of this ordinance. Provisional uses must meet the standards in
Sections 5.21 through 5.30 and Section 5.4.
5.31 Any structure that is not elevated or floodproofed in accordance with Section 5.21 of
this ordinance.
5.32 Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood protection elevation.
5.33 The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill when the fill is not
being used to elevate a structure in accordance with Section 5.21 of this ordinance.
5.4 Standards for Flood Fringe Provisional Uses:
5.41 The standards listed in Sections 5.24 through 5.30 apply to all provisional uses.
5.42 Basements, as defined by Section 2.913 of this ordinance, are subject to the following:
(a) Residential basement construction is not allowed below the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
(b) Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection
elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with
Section 5.43 of this ordinance.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.5.46(a)
5.43 All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be placed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation must be floodproofed in accordance with the
structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the State Building Code. Structurally
dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the State
Building Code, which requires making the structure watertight with the walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components
capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
Structures wet floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification are not permitted.
5.44 The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material on a
parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a structure to the regulatory flood
protection elevation) must comply with an approved erosion/sedimentation control
plan.
(a) The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a
flood event at a minimum of the regional (1% chance) flood event.
(b) The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or
other qualified individual acceptable to the City.
(c) The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from
the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
5.45 Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood protection elevation
must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for removal of such
materials within the time available after a flood warning.
5.46 Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a
structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These
alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or abovegrade,
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of
an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure’s basement or
lowest floor if: 1) the enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure;
2) it is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials; and
3) it is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted
alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards:
(a) Design and Certification - The structure’s design and as-built condition must be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance
with the general design standards of the State Building Code and, specifically,
that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection
elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating
within these components during times of flooding.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.6.22
(b) Specific Standards for Above-grade, Enclosed Areas - Above-grade, fully
enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to
internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
(1) The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be
used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two openings
on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no
higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a
minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or
architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic
openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or
devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters
without any form of human intervention; and
(2) That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in
accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the State Building Code
and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles or storage.
SECTION 6.0 GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT (GF)
6.1 Permitted Uses:
6.11 The uses listed in Section 4.1 of this ordinance, Floodway District Permitted Uses, are
permitted uses.
6.12 All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria specified in
Section 6.2 below. Section 4.0 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the
Floodway District. Section 5.0 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the
Flood Fringe District.
6.2 Procedures for Floodway and Flood Fringe Determinations:
6.21 Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the General
Floodplain District, the Zoning Administrator must obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or
other source.
6.22 If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, the applicant
must furnish additional information, as needed, to determine the regulatory flood
protection elevation and whether the proposed use would fall within the Floodway or
Flood Fringe District. Information must be consistent with accepted hydrological and
hydraulic engineering standards and the standards in 6.23 below.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.7.21
6.23 The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the following
components, as applicable:
(a) Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (1% chance) flood.
(b) Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic
analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas.
(c) Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without
increasing flood stages more than one-half (0.5) foot. A lesser stage increase than
0.5 foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase, increased flood damages
would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within
the reach must be assumed in computing floodway boundaries.
6.24 The Zoning Administrator will review the submitted information and assess the
technical evaluation and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District
boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of previous floodway
encroachments. The Zoning Administrator may seek technical assistance from a
designated engineer or other expert person or agency, including the Department of
Natural Resources. Based on this assessment, the Zoning Administrator may approve
or deny the application.
6.25 Once the Floodway and Flood Fringe District boundaries have been determined, the
Zoning Administrator must process the permit application consistent with the
applicable provisions of Section 4.0 and 5.0 of this ordinance.

must be prepared by a registered engineer or other qualified individual, and must
demonstrate that adequate time and personnel exist to carry out the evacuation.
7.23 For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the Floodway and Flood Fringe District
boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all
access roads must be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and platting
documents.
7.24 In the General Floodplain District, applicants must provide the information required in
Section 6.2 of this ordinance to determine the regional flood elevation, the Floodway
and Flood Fringe District boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation for
the subdivision site.
7.25 If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood prone area,
any such proposal must be reviewed to assure that:
(a) All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within
the flood prone area,
(b) All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems
are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and
(c) Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure of flood hazard.
7.3 Building Sites: If a proposed building site is in a flood prone area, all new construction and
substantial improvements (including the placement of manufactured homes) must be:
(a) Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent floatation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
(b) Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
(c) Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and
(d) Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to
prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.

the floodplain must comply with Sections 4.0 and 5.0 of this ordinance. These transportation
facilities must be elevated to the regulatory flood protection elevation where failure or
interruption of these facilities would result in danger to the public health or safety or where
such facilities are essential to the orderly functioning of the area. Minor or auxiliary roads or
railroads may be constructed at a lower elevation where failure or interruption of
transportation services would not endanger the public health or safety.
8.3 On-site Water Supply and Sewage Treatment Systems: Where public utilities are not
provided: 1) On-site water supply systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 2) New or replacement on-site sewage
treatment systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into
the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and they must not be subject
to impairment or contamination during times of flooding. Any sewage treatment system
designed in accordance with the state’s current statewide standards for on-site sewage
treatment systems is considered to be in compliance with this Section.
SECTION 9.0 MANUFACTURED HOMES, MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS, AND
RECREATIONAL VEHICLES

manufactured homes in Section 9.22.
(f) An accessory structure must constitute a minimal investment.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.10.22
9.23 Recreational vehicles that are exempt in Section 9.22 lose this exemption when
development occurs on the site that exceeds a minimal investment for an accessory
structure such as a garage or storage building. The recreational vehicle and all
accessory structures will then be treated as new structures subject to the elevation and
floodproofing requirements of Section 5.0 of this ordinance. No development or
improvement on the parcel or attachment to the recreational vehicle is allowed that
would hinder the removal of the vehicle should flooding occur.
SECTION 10.0 ADMINISTRATION
10.1 Zoning Administrator: The Zoning Administrator or other official designated by the City
Council to administer and enforce this ordinance.
10.2 Permit Requirements:
10.21 Permit Required. A Building or Land Alteration Permit must be obtained from the
City prior to conducting the following activities within a floodplain:
(a) The erection, addition, modification, rehabilitation, or alteration of any building,

Administrator must also maintain a record of the elevation to which structures and
alterations or additions to structures are floodproofed.
10.26 Notifications for Watercourse Alterations. Before authorizing any alteration or
relocation of a river or stream, the Zoning Administrator must notify potentially
impacted communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work in public
waters pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, Section 103G.245, this will suffice as adequate
notice. A copy of the notification must also be submitted to the Commissioner of the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
10.27 Notifications to FEMA When Physical Changes Increase or Decrease Base Flood
Elevations. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
supporting information becomes available, the Zoning Administrator must notify the
Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy of the relevant
technical or scientific data.
10.3 Variances:
10.31 Variance Applications. An application for a variance to the provisions of this
ordinance will be processed and reviewed in accordance with applicable state statutes
and Section 205.05.6 of the zoning ordinance.
10.32 Adherence to State Floodplain Management Standards. A variance must not allow a
use that is not allowed in that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than
the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards
lower than those required by state law.

10.33 Additional Variance Criteria. The following additional variance criteria of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied:
(a) Variances must not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(b) Variances may only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting
of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(c) Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief of documented
exceptional hardship.
10.34 Flood Insurance Notice. The Zoning Administrator must notify the applicant for a
variance that: 1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance; and 2) Such
construction below the base or regional flood level increases risks to life and property.
Such notification must be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
10.35 General Considerations. The community may consider the following factors in
evaluating variance requests and imposing conditions on variances and provisional
uses in floodplains:
(a) The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments;
(b) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the
injury of others;
(c) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the ability of these
systems to minimize the potential for disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions;
(d) The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood damage and the
effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(e) The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use to the
community;
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.10.42
(f) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
(g) The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use that are not
subject to flooding;
(h) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
(i) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and
flood plain management program for the area;
(j) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles; and
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
flood waters expected at the site.
10.36 Submittal of Hearing Notices to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The
Zoning Administrator must submit hearing notices for proposed variances to the DNR
sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days’ notice of the hearing. The notice
may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist.

must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action. The notice may be sent
by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist.
10.38 Record Keeping. The Zoning Administrator must maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and must report such variances in an
annual or biennial report to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance
Program, when requested by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
10.4 Provisional Uses:
10.41 Administrative Review. An application for a provisional use permit under the
provisions of this ordinance will be processed and reviewed by the Zoning
Administrator or designee, who will provide a copy of the provisional use permit to
the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources within ten (10) days of its
issuance..
10.42 Factors Used in Decision-Making. In passing upon provisional use applications, the
City must consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this ordinance, and
those factors identified in Section 10.35 of this ordinance.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.11.12

meet the requirements of Section 4.0 or 5.0 of this ordinance for new structures,
depending upon whether the structure is in the Floodway or Flood Fringe District.
SECTION 12.0 PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT
12.1 Violation Constitutes a Misdemeanor: Violation of the provisions of this ordinance or
failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with grants of variances or provisional uses) constitute
a misdemeanor and will be punishable as defined by law.
12.2 Other Lawful Action: Nothing in this ordinance restricts the City from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. If the responsible party
does not appropriately respond to the Zoning Administrator within the specified period of
time, each additional day that lapses will constitute an additional violation of this ordinance
and will be prosecuted accordingly.
Fridley City Code Section 205.27.13.3
12.3 Enforcement: In responding to a suspected ordinance violation, the Zoning Administrator
and City may utilize the full array of enforcement actions available to it including but not
limited to prosecution and fines, injunctions, after-the-fact permits, orders for corrective
measures or a request to the National Flood Insurance Program for denial of flood insurance
availability to the guilty party. The City must act in good faith to enforce these official
controls and to correct ordinance violations to the extent possible so as not to jeopardize its
eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
12.31 When a violation is either discovered by or brought to the attention of the Zoning
Administrator, the Zoning Administrator shall immediately investigate the situation
and document the nature and extent of the violation of the official control. As soon as it
is reasonably possible, this information will be submitted to the State Department of
Natural Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency regional office along
with the City's plan of action to correct the violation to the degree possible.
12.32 The Zoning Administrator shall notify the suspected party of the requirements of this
chapter and all other official controls and the nature and extent of the suspected
violation of these controls. If the structure or use is under construction or development,
the Zoning Administrator may order the construction or development immediately
halted until a proper permit or approval is granted by the city. If the construction or
development is already completed, the Zoning Administrator may either: 1) issue an
order identifying the corrective actions that must be made within a specified time
period to bring the use or structure into compliance with the official controls; or 2)
notify the responsible party to apply for an after the fact permit/development approval
within a specified period of time not to exceed 30 days.
SECTION 13.0 AMENDMENTS
13.1 Floodplain Designation – Restrictions on Removal: The floodplain designation on the
Official Zoning Map must not be removed from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that
the designation is in error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the
regulatory flood protection elevation and is contiguous to lands outside the floodplain.
Special exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the Commissioner of the Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) if the Commissioner determines that, through other measures,
lands are adequately protected for the intended use.
13.2 Amendments Require DNR Approval: All amendments to this ordinance must be
submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources
(DNR) prior to adoption. The Commissioner must approve the amendment prior to
community approval.

5. WETLAND OVERLAY DISTRICT REGULATIONS
A. No development shall be allowed within a wetland overlay district without first:
(1) Having the City or the Local Government Unit certify that the activity is exempt as
defined in Section 205.29.06, or
(2) Having the City or the Local Government Unit certify an acceptable wetland
replacement plan submitted by the applicant for compliance with the Act.
B. Prior to the issuance of a City permit, the petitioner must show proof of compliance or
exemption from the DNR and Corps of Engineers regulations concerning drainage,
grading, or filling of wetlands. In addition, the application must show consideration of the
affected wetland values for stormwater runoff storage and detention, sedimentation and
nutrient trapping and retention, fish and wildlife habitat, and the recreation and open
space needs of the community.
C. Sequencing
(1) The following principles of wetland mitigation are listed in descending priority. A
wetland replacement plan shall not be approved unless the applicant has demonstrated
that the activity impacting a wetland has complied with the highest priority possible:
(a) Avoids direct or indirect impacts to the wetland that may destroy or diminish the
wetland;
(b) Minimizes the impact to the wetland by limiting the degree or magnitude of the
wetland activity and its implementation;
(c) Rectifies the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland;
(d) Reduces or eliminates the impact to the wetland over time by preservation and
maintenance operations; and
(e) Replaces unavoidable impacts to the wetland by restoring or creating substitute
wetland areas having equal or greater public value.
(2) The applicant may either submit the information required for sequencing analysis as
part of the application for replacement plan approval or apply for a preliminary
sequencing determination from the City. For projects impacting wetland areas less
than 4,356 square feet, the City may provide on-site sequencing determinations
without written documentation from the applicant.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.29.5.D.(3)
D. Sequencing Determinations
(1) The City shall determine whether any feasible and prudent alternatives are available
that would avoid impacts to wetlands. An alternative shall be considered feasible and
prudent if:
(a) It is in accordance with accepted engineering standards and practices;
(b) It is consistent with reasonable requirements of the public health, safety and
general welfare;
(c) It is an environmentally preferable alternative based on a review of social,
economic, and environmental impacts; and
(d) It would create no truly unusual problems.
(2) The City shall consider the following in evaluating alternatives:
(a) The basic project purpose can be reasonably accomplished using one or more
other sites in the same general area that would avoid wetland impacts. An
alternate site may not be excluded from consideration only because it includes or
requires an area not owned by the applicant that could be easily obtained, used,
expanded, or managed to fulfill the basic purpose of the proposed project;
(b) The general suitability of alternate sites considered by the applicant;
(c) Whether reasonable modification of the size, scope, configuration, or density of
the project would avoid impacts to wetlands;
(d) Efforts by the applicant to accommodate or remove constraints on alternatives
imposed by zoning standards or infrastructure, including requests for special use
permits, variances, or planned unit developments; and
(e) The physical, economic, and demographic requirements of the project. Economic
considerations alone do not make an alternative not feasible and prudent.
(3) If the City determines that a feasible and prudent alternative exists that would avoid
impacts to wetlands, it shall deny the replacement plan.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.29.D.(6)(a)
(4) If no feasible and prudent alternative is available that would avoid impacts to
wetlands, the City shall evaluate the replacement plan to determine that it will
minimize impacts to wetlands. The City shall use the following criteria to determine
the sufficiency of the applicant's efforts to minimize impacts to wetlands:
(a) The spatial requirements of the project;
(b) The location of existing structural or natural features that may dictate the
placement or configuration of the project;
(c) The purpose, of the project and how the purpose relates to the placement,
configuration, or density;
(d) The sensitivity of the site design to the natural features of the site, including
topography, hydrology, and existing vegetation;
(e) The value, function, and spatial distribution of wetlands on the site;
(f) Individual and cumulative impacts, and
(g) An applicant's efforts to:
((1)) Modify the size, scope, configuration or density of the project;
((2)) Remove or accommodate site constraints including zoning, infrastructure,
access, or other features; and
((3)) Minimize other impacts.
(5) If the City finds that an applicant has not complied with the requirements to minimize
wetland impacts, the City shall list, in writing, its objections to the project. If, within
30 days, the applicant does not withdraw the project proposal or indicate intent to
submit an amended project proposal satisfying the City's objections, the statement of
objections shall constitute a denial.
(6) Temporary impacts to a wetland shall be rectified by repairing, rehabilitating, or
restoring the affected wetlands The City may determine that an applicant's activity
may qualify for a no-loss determination if the following criteria are met:
(a) The physical characteristics of the affected wetlands including ground elevations,
contours, inlet dimensions, outlet dimensions, substrate, hydrologic regime, are
restored to pre-project conditions sufficient to ensure that all pre-project functions
and values are restored;
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.29.6.A.(2)
(b) The activity is completed and the physical characteristics of the wetland are
restored within six months-of the start of the activity;
(c) The party responsible for the activity provides a performance bond to the City for
an amount sufficient to cover the estimated cost to restore the wetland to
preproject conditions. The City shall return the performance bond to the
responsible party upon a determination by the City that the conditions in Section
205.27.5.D. (6). (c) and Section 205.27.5.D.(4) are met.
(d) An applicant shall be granted a no-loss determination under the criteria a through
c above once in a ten-year period for a particular site within a wetland, except that
repairs to the original project shall be allowed under the no-loss determination, if
the City determines the request to be necessary and reasonable.
(7) After an activity is completed, further wetland impacts from the draining or filling
must be reduced or eliminated by maintaining, operating, and managing the project in
a manner that preserves and maintains remaining wetland functions and values. The
City will require applicants to implement best management practices to protect
wetland functions and values.
(8) Unavoidable wetland impacts that remain after efforts to minimize, rectify, reduce, or
eliminate them must be replaced.
6. EXEMPTIONS
A. The following activities are exempt from the 0-4. Wetland Overlay District regulations:
(1) Activities in a wetland created solely as a result of:

roads, streets, and bridges, provided the activities so not result in additional intrusion
into the wetland outside of the existing right of way;
(6) Emergency repair and normal maintenance of existing public works, provided the
activity does not result in additional intrusion of the public works into the wetland
and do not result in the draining or filling, wholly or partially, of a wetland.
(7) Normal maintenance and repair of structures causing no additional intrusion of an
existing structure into the wetland, and maintenance and repair of private crossings
that do not result in the draining or filling, wholly or partially, of a wetland. This
exemption applies to private structures, such as buildings or road crossings;
(8) Activities that result in the draining or filling of less than 400 square feet of wetlands.
This exemption applies if the total wetland loss by draining and filling will be less
than 400 square feet per year per landowner, and the cumulative impact by all persons
on a wetland over time after January 1, 1992, does not exceed five percent of the
wetland's area.

(w) Other information considered for evaluation of the project by the City.
(5) The applicant must provide information considering the special considerations criteria
in Section 205.27.8.G.
9. REPLACEMENT PLAN EVALUATION CRITERIA
A. Before consideration or approval of the replacement plan, the City shall ensure that the
applicant has exhausted all possibilities to avoid and minimize possibilities to avoid and
minimize adverse impacts according to sequencing in Section 5D.
B. The order of preference for the method of replacement, from the most preferred to least
preferred:
(1) Project-specific restoration;
(2) Project-specific creation;
(3) Wetland banking.
Modification or conversion of non-degraded wetland from one wetland type to
another does not constitute adequate replacement. Wetlands drained or filled under an
exemption may not be restored for replacement credit for ten years after draining or
filling.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.29.9.G.(5)
C. Replacement of wetland values shall be completed before or concurrent with the actual
draining or filling of a wetland, unless an irrevocable bank letter of credit or other
security acceptable to the City is submitted to the City to guarantee successful completion
of the replacement. All wetlands to be restored or created as part of an approved
replacement plan shall be clearly designated prior to approval of the replacement plan by
the City.
D. Replacement wetlands shall be located in the same watershed as the impacted wetlands,
or the ratio in Section 205.27.10 shall apply.
E. Replacement wetlands must be of a size sufficient to ensure that they provide equal or
greater public value than the wetland that was drained or filled. The minimum size of the
replacement wetland must be in the ratio of two acres of replaced wetland for each acre
of drained or filled wetland. The actual replacement ratios required for a replacement
wetland may be more than the minimum, subject to the evaluation of wetland functions in
Section 9. Future owners may make no use of the wetland after it is altered for a period of
ten years unless future replacement to achieve a 2:1 ratio occurs. The landowner shall
record a notice of this restriction in the office of the county recorder in which the project
is located.
F. Restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished according to the ecology
of the landscape area affected. A replacement plan that would result in wetlands or
wetland characteristics that do not naturally occur in the landscape area in which the
replacement will occur will not be approved.
G. The following factors when, applicable to an impact or replacement site, shall be
considered by the City:
(1) The site contains endangered species listed in Minnesota Rules, parts 6134.0200 to
6134.0400 and the proposed activities would take those species, the replacement plan
shall not be approved.
(2) The site contains a rare natural community, and the proposed activity would
adversely affect the community, the replacement plan shall not be approved.
(3) The site contains a significant fish and wildlife resource; including but not limited to
fish passage and spawning areas, colonial waterbird nesting colonies, migratory
waterfowl concentration areas, deer wintering areas, or wildlife travel corridors, and
the proposed activity would adversely impact those resources, the replacement plan
shall not be approved.
(4) The site contains archaeological or historic areas, and the activity would adversely
affect those areas, the replacement plan shall not be approved.
(5) The proposed activity would have significant adverse impact on the groundwater
quality, the replacement plan shall not be approved.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.29.10.C.(3)
(6) The proposed activity would have significant adverse impact on the water quality of
outstanding resource value waters as listed in Minnesota Rules, 7050.0180 or on trout
waters, the replacement plan shall not be approved.
(7) Wetlands used for educational or research purposes shall be maintained or adequately
replaced.
(8) The proposed activity involves known or potential hazardous wastes. Such activities
shall be conducted in accordance with applicable federal or state standards.
(9) The proposed activity shall be consistent with other plans, including, but not limited
to zoning, comprehensive, watershed management, and land use plans.
10. EVALUATION OF WETLAND FUNCTIONS AND VALUES
A. Replacement wetlands shall replace the functions and values that are lost that are lost
from a wetland that is drained or killed. A replacement wetland should replace the same
combination or functions and values provided by the impacted wetland. The wetland
type index system in Minnesota Rules 8420.0540, subpt 10, item B, uses relative values
of wetland functions compared across wetland types to evaluate the adequacy of wetland
replacement. The City may allow the evaluation of wetlands by measuring and
comparing public values specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 103b. 3355, with the
current version of the Minnesota wetland evaluation methodology or another
scientifically acceptable methodology.
B. Table 4, Minnesota Rules, part 8420.0550, provides technical specifications for
constructing wetland types. In evaluating a wetland replacement plan, the City shall
determine whether the wetland type stated as the replacement plan goal will result from
the replacement plan specifications. If a wetland type other than the replacement plan
goal is likely to result, the City shall evaluate the plan based on this determination.
C. The City may consider allowing constructed stormwater detention basins for replacement
credit if the basin conforms to the following specifications:
(1) The basin design uses a two-cell system in which the upstream cell has a 24-hour
retention time for a two-year storm event;
(2) The downstream cell is designed for a maximum 12-inch rise in water level for a
ten-year storm event;
(3) The standards in Minnesota Rules, part 8420.0550 are followed;
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.29.10.E.(2)
(4) The design goal is a palustrine emergent wetland that meets all statutory definitions
of a wetland, for example, soils, hydrology, and vegetation. Only the downstream cell
can be counted for wetland credit, and the replacement plan must include a plan and
schedule for maintenance of the storm water basin system. Storm water basins which
allowed for replacement are not eligible for an exemption; and
(5) Storm water management basins constructed for the primary purpose of controlling or
treating stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces or developed areas, not
conforming to the units in 1-4 above, are not considered wetlands. These are therefore
exempt from replacement plan requirements when constructed in non-wetlands, and
also cannot be considered for credit as part of a replacement plan, regardless of their
location.
D. When wetland functions lost as a result of drainage or filling are replaced by restoring a
wetland of the same type and in the same watershed with the same inlet and outlet
characteristics as described in Section 205.27.9.E, and related definitions, the
replacement shall be considered to be in-kind and the minimal replacement ratio shall be
used to determine the necessary size of the replacement wetland. The minimum
replacement ratio is 2:1, requiring two times the impacted area be replaced.
E. If the wetland functions lost as a result of drainage or filling are to be replaced by
creating a wetland or restoring a wetland of a different type than the impacted wetland, or
if the replacement wetland is in a watershed other than the impacted wetland or had
different inlet and outlet characteristics than the impacted wetland, the replacement shall
be considered out of kind, and the City shall use the replacement ratios in Minnesota
Rules, 8420.0540, subpt b, item D, Table 2, to determine the amount of replacement
wetland needed to replace the lost wetland values.
(1) Differences in wetland functions and values among wetland types are to be evaluated
and replaced using the wetland type ratio table located and, to be applied as specified
in Administrative Rules, 8420.0540, subpt 10, Table 2. The wetland type ratio table
incorporates an evaluation of public values as specified in Minnesota Statutes, section
103B.3355, for the purposes of comparison among wetland types.
(2) If a wetland to be drained or filled exhibits more than one wetland type as determined
by the Technical Evaluation Panel, and more than one wetland type is proposed to be
drained or filled, the City shall use the following procedure to determine needed
replacement. The acreage of each wetland type to be converted to non-wetland shall
be determined. The wetland type ratio table shall then be used to determine the
amount of replacement wetland for each wetland type. The sum of the replacement
for each wetland type shall be the resultant acreage requirement for the wetland type
ratio.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.29.10.E.(9)
(3) When a replacement wetland is located in a different hydrologic unit than the
impacted wetland, as indicated by-the USGS Hydrologic Unit Map for Minnesota, the
ratios in Minnesota Rules 8420.0540 must be followed.
(4) If the inlet and outlet characteristics of a replacement wetland differ from those of the
impacted wetland, the ratios in Minnesota Rules 8420.0540 Table 3 shall be applied.
(5) The City may, by local ordinance, establish additional local public value to address
wetland conservation or preservation issues of local concern. These ratios shall have a
minimum value of zero and shall be based on wetland management objectives of a
local water management plan adopted under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 103B or
1036.
(6) The required replacement ratio for out-of kind replacement shall be the sum of the
wetland type ratio plus the hydrologic unit ratio plus the inlet and outlet characteristic
ratio plus the local public value ratio. If this ratio is less than the minimum in-kind
ratio, the minimum in-kind ratio shall be the required replacement ratio.
(7) In cases of partial drainage, the amount of wetland to be replaced shall be calculated
using the formulas in Minnesota Rules 8420.0540, Item E.
(8) In cases where partially drained wetlands are restored to their former state, credit may
be received as calculated in Administrative Rules 8420.0540, Item F.
(9) For projects of unusual complexity, or replacement plans that have been denied and
are being appealed, and for which the City believes an alternative evaluation process
may produce a substantially different replacement requirement, the City may evaluate
the replacement plan using the current version of the Minnesota wetland evaluation
methodology or another scientifically accepted methodology approved by the board,
in consultation with the Commissioner, that evaluates all wetland functions and
values for both the impacted and replacement wetlands.
When using the Minnesota wetland evaluation methodology or another board, in
consultation with the Commissioner, approved methodology to evaluate replacement
plans, the ratio of impact wetland to replacement wetland shall not be less than the
minimum required. Further, the hydrologic unit ratio, the inlet and outlet
characteristics ration, and the local public value ratio, shall also be considered when
using the Minnesota wetland evaluation methodology or another board, in
consultation with the Commissioner, approved methodology.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.29.11.B.(5)
(10) A replacement plan that fails to meet the requirements in items 1-8 shall be
considered inadequate in replacing lost functions and values and shall not be
approved by the City. A replacement plan that has been considered by the City and
not approved may be revised and resubmitted for consideration by the City. The
decision of the City to approve, approve with conditions, or not approve a
replacement plan becomes final if not appealed to the board within 30 days after the
date on which the decision is mailed to those required to receive notice of the
decision. Before construction of the wetland, a notice as required in Section
205.27.7.4.9 must be recorded and proof of recording provided to the City.
11. WETLAND REPLACEMENT STANDARDS
A. The standards and guidelines in this part shall be used in wetland creation wetland
creation and restoration efforts to ensure adequate replacement of wetland functions and
values. Minnesota Rules 8420.0540, Table 4 provides general guidelines for the physical
characteristics that each type of replacement wetland should have
B. The standards in items 1 to 8 shall be followed in all wetland replacements unless the
technical evaluation panel determines that a standard is clearly not appropriate.
(1) Water control structures must be constructed using specification provided in the
Minnesota Wetland Restoration Guide or their equivalent. Control structures may be
subject to the department dam safety regulations.
(2) Best management practices must be established and maintained to the entire
perimeter of all replacement wetlands.
(3) For replacement wetlands where the dominant vegetation of the wetland type
identified as the replacement goal in Section 205.27.7.A.4.1, is not likely to recover
naturally in a five-year period, wooded and shrub wetlands especially, the
replacement wetland must be seeded or planted with appropriate wetland origin
species, as determined by the soil and water conservation district, the seed or planting
stock should be of local to preserve local genotypes. During the monitoring period,
the applicant must take reasonable steps to prevent invasion by any species, for
example, purple loosestrife and Eurasian water milfoil, that would defeat the
re-vegetation goal of the replacement plan.
(4) Erosion control measures as determined by the soil and water conservation district
must be employed during construction and until permanent ground cover is
established to prevent siltation of the replacement wetland or nearby water bodies.
(5) For all restored wetlands where the original organic substrate has been striped away
and for all created wetlands, provisions must be made for providing an organic
substrate. When feasible, the organic soil used for backfill should be taken from the
drained or filled wetland.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.29.12.D.(5)
(6) The bottom contours of created types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands should be undulating,
rather than flat, to provide a variety of water depth.
(7) Sideslopes of created wetlands and buffer strip must not be steeper than 5:1, five feet
horizontal for every one foot vertical as averaged around the wetlands Sideslopes of
10:1 and 15:1 are preferred.
(8) Created wetlands should have an irregular edge to create points and bays to be
consistent with Section 205.27.8.F.
12. MONITORING ANNUAL REPORT
A. The purpose of wetland value replacement monitoring is to ensure that the replacement
wetland achieves the goal of replacing lost functions and values.
B. The applicant shall submit the annual report to the City on a date determined by the City
until the applicant has fulfilled all of the requirements of the City.
C. The purpose of the annual report is to describe actual wetland restoration or creation
activities completed during the past year, activities planned for the upcoming year, and
the information in Section B.
D. The annual report shall include the following information and other site-specific
information identified by the City:
(1) A description of the project location, size, current wetland type (Cowardin
classification), and desired wetland type (goal);
(2) A comparison of the as-built specifications versus the design specifications (first
annual plan only) and a rationale for significant changes;
(3) Hydrology measurements: seasonal water level elevations during the period April
through October (msl or referenced to a known benchmark);
(4) A list of the dominant vegetation in the wetland, including common names of the
vegetation exceeding 20 percent coverage and an estimate of coverage.
(5) Color photographs of the project area taken anytime during the period June through
August, referenced to the fixed photo reference points identified on the wetland
replacement plan and labeled accordingly.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.29.13.E.
13. MONITORING DETERMINATIONS BY THE CITY
The City:
A. Shall inspect the project when construction is complete and certify compliance with
construction specifications, and may inspect the project at any time during the
construction and monitoring period, and any time after that to assess the long-term
viability of the replaced wetland. When the City certifies that the construction
specifications have been met, the City shall so advise the applicant and return any bond
or other security that the applicant had provided;
B. May order corrective action at any time during the required monitoring period if it
determines that the goal of the approved replacement plan will not be met, and may
require the applicant to prepare an amended wetland value replacement plan for review
and approval by the City, which describes in detail the corrective measures to be taken to
achieve the goal of replacing the lost wetland functions and values;
C. Shall make a finding based on a site visit at the end of the monitoring period as to
whether the goal of the replacement plan has been met. If the goal of the replacement
plan has not been met, the City shall order corrective action and extend the monitoring
period; and
D. Shall require one or more of the following actions if, during the monitoring period, the
City finds that the goal of the replacement plan will not be met:
(1) Order the applicant to prepare and implement a new replacement plan;
(2) Issue a cease and desist order on the draining and filling activity if it has not been
completed;
(3) Order restoration of the impacted wetland;
(4) Obtain forfeiture of a bond or-other security and use the proceeds to replace the lost
wetland values;

for a determination. The City shall keep on file all documentation and findings of fact concerning
no-loss determinations for a period of ten years.
The landowner applying for a no-loss determination is responsible for submitting the proof
necessary to show qualification for the claim.
The City shall issue a no-loss certificate if:
A. The work will not drain or fill a wetland;
B. Water level management activities will not result in the conversion of a wetland to
another use;
C. The activities are in a surface impoundment for containment of fossil fuel combustion
waste or water retention, and are not part of a compensatory wetland mitigation program;
or
D. The activity is being conducted as part of an approved replacement plan or is conducted
or authorized by public agencies for the purpose of wetland restoration and the activity is
restricted to placing fill in a previously excavated drainage system to restore a wetland to
its original condition.
E. The activity meets the conditions in Section 205.27.5.D.6.

determinations or recommendations without at least one member having made an on-site
inspection. Panel determinations and recommendations must be endorsed by at least two of the
three members.
The panel, or one of its members when so authorized by all of the members, may assist the City
in making wetland size and type determinations when asked to do so by the City as part of
making an exemption or no-loss determination.
If requested by the City, the landowner, or a member of the Technical Evaluation Panel, the
panel shall answer technical questions or participate in the monitoring of replacement wetlands
according to Section 205.27.13.
16. APPEAL OF CITY DECISIONS

after first exhausting all local administrative appeal options.
E. Those required to receive notice of replacement plan decisions as provided for in Section
205.27.6.B may petition the board to hear an appeal from an exemption or no-loss
determination. The board shall grant the petition unless it finds that the appeal is
merit-less, trivial, or brought solely for the purposes of delay. In determining whether to
grant the appeal, the board shall give consideration to the size of the wetland, other
factors in controversy, any patterns of similar acts by the City or landowner of petition,
and the consequences of the delay.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.29.18.G.

under Minnesota Statutes, section 14.63 to 14.69.
18. COMPENSATION
A. Replacement plan applicants who have completed the City's process and the board appeal
process, and the plan has not been approved as submitted, may apply to the board for
compensation under Minnesota Statutes, section 103G.237.
B. The application must identify the applicant, locate the wetland, and refer the board to its
appeal file in the matter.
C. The application must include an agreement that in exchange for compensation the
applicant will convey to the state a perpetual conservation easement in the form required
by Minnesota Statutes, section 103F.516. The applicant must provide an abstract of title
demonstrating the ability to convey the easement free of any prior title, lien, or
encumbrance. Failure to provide marketable title negates the state's obligation to
compensate.
D. The applicant must submit official documentation from the US Army Corps of engineers,
the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the watershed district or water management
organization if any, the county, and the City, as applicable, that the proposed drain or fill
activity and the proposed subsequent use of the wetland are lawful under their respective
legal requirements.
E. The landowner must demonstrate that the proposed drain or fill is a feasible and prudent
project and that the replacement plan as proposed is a reasonable good faith effort to
fulfill the replacement requirements of Sections 205.27.7 to 205.27.10 and the Act.
F. If the plan was approved, but with conditions or modifications, the applicant must show
that the conditions or modifications make the replacement unworkable or not feasible. A
plan is unworkable or not feasible if the replacement must be on land that the applicant
does not own, the applicant has make good faith efforts to acquire a replacement site and
not succeeded, and there is not a qualifying replacement available in a wetland bank. A
plan is also unworkable or not feasible if it is not possible to carry out for engineering
reasons. The applicant must show that not going ahead with the project will cause the
applicant damages and that disallowing the proposed use will enhance the public values
of the wetland.
G. The applicant must submit the requirements of this Section in writing, by certified mail,
to the board. If the applicant wants to make oral argument to the board, it must be
indicated art of the application. The board may require that the applicant appear before
the board.

H. If the board finds that the applicant has submitted a complete application and proved the
requirements in this Section, the board shall compensate the applicant as required by law
within 90 days after the board received a completed application, provided that within the
same time period the applicant must convey to the board a conservation easement in the
form required by Minnesota Statutes, section 103F.516. If the board does not provide the
required compensation in exchange for the conservation easement, the applicant may
drain or fill the wetland in the manner proposed, without replacement.
19. WETLAND BANKING
The applicant may use wetland banking credits if the project complies with Minnesota Rules
8420.0740 subparagraph 2 if no alternative site is available.
20. PENALTIES

All new development or redevelopment TOD proposals requiring a building permit after the
effective date of this ordinance must meet the following design criteria standards designed to
enhance the pedestrian scale and safety of the development. Single family construction projects
located within the Hyde Park Zoning Overlay District are exempt from following the TOD
design standards. In situations where an existing building is being partially expanded, the new
standards will only apply to the new addition, except as provided in Section 205.33.08.B,
Setbacks. Landscaping and streetscape design features shall be specified in a project’s Master
Plan to match the models shown in Appendix B of this code section.
1. Dimensional Requirements
A. Lot Coverage
Lot coverage may exceed 40% in cases where vehicle parking is shared, underground,
or structured, provided all landscaping requirements are met. Allowances exceeding
the 40% lot coverage limit will be made in designs that finance the creation and
maintenance of public open space for commuters nearby.
Fridley City Code Section 205.33.08.1.B.(3)
Alternative storm water treatment methods such as permeable pavers, porous asphalt,
vegetated roof areas, especially at the top of structured parking facilities, and other
innovative techniques to reduce stormwater run-off are encouraged.
B. Setbacks
Exceptions to the following setback requirements will be granted to building
additions to structures located on property zoned M-2, Heavy Industrial, at the date of
the creation of this TOD zoning district.
(1) Front Yard
a. Except for individual, detached, single-family homes in the Hyde Park overlay
zoning district, buildings shall be set back no further from the front property line
than 15 feet.
b. Corner Lots: On corner
lots, the buildings shall
have front and side
facades aligned no further
back than 15 feet from the
corner lot lines.
c. Double Frontage: In
cases of double frontage,
buildings on both fronts
may be set back at 15 feet.
On three or four-sided
lots, buildings would not be required to meet the minimum 15 foot setback on
more than one corner.
(2) Side Yard
Buildings may be set back as close as 15 feet to the property line. On corner lots,
the maximum allowable building setback is 15 feet.

B. Façade Articulation
Building widths of 40 feet or less are encouraged. New buildings of more than 40 feet in
width shall be divided into smaller increments, between 20 and 40 feet in width, through
articulation of the façade. This can be achieved through combinations of the following
techniques, and others that may meet the intent of this section.
(1) Façade Modulation – Stepping back or extending forward a portion of the façade.
(2) Vertical Division – Using different textures or materials, provided materials are
drawn from a common palette.
(3) Storefronts – Division of building
face into distinct storefronts with
separate entrances and display
windows
.
(4) Roof Lines – Varied roof lines
with alternating dormers, stepped
roofs, gables, or other roof
elements to reinforce the
modulation or articulation
interval.
(5) Articulation Interval – Placement
of arcades, awnings, window bays, arched windows, or balconies at intervals
equal to the articulation interval.
Fridley City Code Section 205.33.08.2.F.
C. Building Face
No blank walls shall be permitted to face the public street, sidewalk, or other public
spaces, such as plazas. Elements such as windows, doors, columns, changes in material,
and similar details should be used to add visual interest.
Buildings shall be designed with a base, middle, and a top, created by variations in
detailing, color, and material. Articulated tops shall be considered in the design of all new
buildings. This articulation may consist of pitched roofs, dormers, gable ends, or cornice
detailing. The base of the building shall include human scale elements, such as doors,
windows, projections, awnings, canopies, and ornamentation.
D. Door and Window Openings
In new commercial, mixed-use and civic buildings, window and door openings shall
comprise at least fifty (50) percent of the length of the main floor of the primary street
façade. Window openings shall be located at a pedestrian sight level.

shadow.
(2) Glass on windows and doors on the primary street façade shall be clear or slightly
tinted, allowing views into and out of the building interior or, as an alternative,
used as display windows enclosed by walls inside the building. Where security
needs warrant it, Spandrel glass may be used in the primary street façade windows
subject to City approval in the plan review process.
(3) Window shape, size and patterns shall emphasize the intended organization of the
façade and the definition of the building.
E. Loading Docks
Outside loading docks shall be located in the rear or side yard and be screened from view
from any public right-of-way. The space needed for the loading dock must be adequate to
handle the loading and unloading needs of the building without obstructing the public
right-of-way.
F. Building Materials
All buildings except single family shall primarily be constructed of high-quality materials
such as brick, stone, textured cast stone, EFIS, or tinted masonry units. The following
materials are generally not acceptable: Plain or painted concrete block, sheet metal
panels, reflective glass, or aluminum, vinyl, fiberglass, asphalt or fiberboard siding.
Fridley City Code Section 205.33.09.C.

compatible with the adjoining structure(s).
G. Refuse/Recycling Storage
Multi-tenant buildings shall share a common refuse/recycling storage area.
Refuse/recycling collection areas must be screened from view form any public right-ofway
and are encouraged to be enclosed inside a building.
205.33.09 Parking Requirements
A. Reduction of Parking
Reduction of the parking stall dimensions and number of parking stalls required in the
underlying zoning district may be allowed due to the nature of the proposed use or
agreements in place with surrounding businesses for shared parking.
(1) The number of required parking stalls may be reduced by no more than 50%
of the minimum required in the underlying zoning district for the proposed
use.
(2) The maximum number of parking stalls shall not exceed 120% of the
minimum number of parking stalls required by the use in the underlying
zoning district. This maximum provision shall not apply to park-and-ride or
other transit facilities.

additional off-street parking be provided.
C. Drive-Through Service
Drive-through service designs are allowed and will not require a special use permit as
underlying zoning may require.
Fridley City Code Section 205.33.10.1.B.
205.33.10 Landscape and Streetscape Requirements
1. Landscaping
A. Scope
A landscaping plan shall be submitted according to the requirements of the underlying
zoning district, except for as provided in Section 205.33.10.B.1. Mixed use projects must
have a unified landscaping scheme. The landscaping requirements in this Chapter will
only apply to new construction projects or projects where existing buildings are expanded
to the reduced 15 foot setback.
B. Plant Materials Substitutions
The landscaping requirements in the underlying zoning district shall apply to properties
in the TOD Overlay District with some exceptions.
1) TOD landscape plans for redevelopment of property located in the underlying
Hyde Park zoning district must follow the landscape requirements for the
zoning district that most closely represents the use proposed.
2) In the TOD Overlay District, one ornamental tree will count as one over-story
deciduous tree. In addition, ornamental trees may exceed 50 percent of the
required trees.
3) Due to the amount of hardscape needed for pedestrian walkways, if the level
of open space for planting restricts the ability to provide adequate growth
space for tree roots, perennial planting beds and permanent planters may be
substituted for over-story trees at a rate of 36 square feet of plant area per tree
substitution.
4) Decorative walkway light poles meeting the design specified in the Fridley
Northstar TOD TIF District Master Plan as shown in Appendix B may be
substituted at a ratio of one light pole for two trees if the site design warrants
additional walkway lighting.
5) Street-side sculptures, public art, permanent or movable planters, light pole
banners, clock towers, arbors, seating benches, or similar ornamentation may
be considered as substitution to meet landscaping requirements.
If it is not feasible to meet the landscaping requirements of the underlying zoning district
with the allowed substitutions above, the City may approve a monetary payment per fees
established in Chapter 11 into the TOD Capital Project Fund for the purpose of funding
streetscape amenities within the street rights of ways within the TOD overlay district.
Fridley City Code Section 205.33.10.2.B.
C. Water
Drip irrigation systems are encouraged to reduce water consumption and to prevent wet
walkways. Examples of alternative storm water treatments are permeable pavers, porous
asphalt, vegetative roof areas, rain gardens, infiltration basins, tree trenches, green walls,
grass swales, filter strips, cisterns, underground detention/retention, or other innovative
techniques used to reduce storm water runoff.
2. Streetscaping
A. Sidewalks and Pedestrian Connections
Sidewalks of a minimum six foot width
must be provided on all street
frontages. Sidewalk design detail will
need to be approved by the City as part
of a development’s TOD master plan in
accordance with the design criteria in
the Northstar TOD TIF District Master
Plan, as shown in Appendix B to this
Chapter, on public right of ways
adjacent to the proposed development.
Scored concrete, colored concrete,
permeable and concrete pavers are
suggested pavement options for
sidewalks. Paved connections to building entrances, crosswalks, and adjacent bus stops
must also be incorporated into any site design. A colorized pavement pattern connecting
the sidewalk on each side of the driveway shall be incorporated into driveways, warning
drivers of the sidewalk connection on each side of the driveway. Such connection shall be
accessible in accordance with ADA standards.
B. Lighting
Street and pathway lighting types, styles, and colors shall be provided according to the
specifications in Appendix B and coordinated with the overall design of City-installed
lighting in the TOD District. Pedestrian-oriented lighting is required on all streets, trails,
sidewalks, and public gathering places within the district. A lighting plan and fixture
specification schedule shall be included in the documents submitted to the City for
approval. Energy efficiency is encouraged in all aspects of a project’s Master Plan.
Fridley City Code Section 205.33.11.
C. Signs
Changeable electronic signs will only be allowed on free-standing signs according to the
requirements in Chapter 214 of the City Code and will not be allowed as wall signs in the
TOD District. Door and window awnings are encouraged and will not count towards wall
signage percentage allowed on a building face.
D. Fencing, Walls, Bike Racks, Benches, Waste Receptacles, and Dumpster Enclosures
Decorative fencing, railings, walls, bike racks, benches, waste receptacles, and dumpster
enclosures that are incorporated into landscape designs shall match features designated in
Appendix B or similar design approved by the City. Public transit benches located in the
Northstar TOD District shall also meet the TOD design criteria shown in Appendix B.
E. Outdoor Dining
Outdoor dining areas may be incorporated into the front and side yard setbacks up to five
feet from the property line, leaving six feet for the sidewalk. The dining area shall be
designed with safety protections that reasonably attempt to prevent vehicles from
accidentally encroaching into the dining area. Store locations that serve alcohol must
apply for a patio endorsement on their liquor license pursuant to Chapter 602.26 of the
City Code.
F. Farmer’s Market
Farmers Market shall meet the
requirements for a City-issued
Farmers Market permit per the
requirements of Chapter 205.
205.33.11 Maintenance
In addition to the maintenance requirements of the underlying zoning district, property owners in
the TOD district are required to maintain the landscape and streetscape abutting their property.
This includes the removal of debris and snow on trails and walkways and at bus stops and the
irrigation of planters on their own private property and those in the public right-of-way adjoining
the property. Further details of the maintenance requirements shall be addressed in a
development agreement approved by the City.

(Ref. 1295)
1. PURPOSE
The objective in establishing a PUD District is to eliminate the comingling of different,
incompatible uses in one zoning classification. This commingling causes harm to surrounding
properties because of the possibility that the zoned property will be used for a use different from
the particular use contemplated at the time of enactment of the Zoning Chapter.
It is, therefore, the purpose of this Chapter to provide for the health, safety, order, convenience,
prosperity and general welfare by setting forth in this Chapter all of the regulations and
procedures in connection with the zoning of property for a planned unit development use.
2. PROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHING A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
There shall be provided by the applicant, prior to acceptance of the petition for reclassification,
a General Plan of Development consisting of maps, descriptive statement of objectives,
principles and standards used in its formulation and including the following components:
A. Land Use Component.
The Land Use Component shall consist of a map or set of maps, setting forth the
distribution, location and extent of the acres of land devoted to each category of land use
proposed as part of the General Plan of Development. Such uses may include single
multiple family residential, mixed types of residential; neighborhood retail shopping
facilities, community retail shopping facilities, regional retail shopping facilities, office
facilities; service facilities; wholesale or goods distribution facilities, industrial facilities;
education, religious, recreation, open space, public and semi-private facilities; or other
categories of public or private uses of land as allowed in any district in the City. Said
component shall also contain a descriptive statement of objectives, principles and
standards used for its formulation.
B. Circulation Component.
The Circulation Component shall consist of a map or set of maps, setting forth the
general location and extent of all transportation facilities proposed as part of the General
Plan of Development. It shall include arterial, collector and local streets, transportation
routes, terminals, heliports, and the delineation of such systems on the land; one-way
streets, street widths; grade separations, divided roads; left-turn lanes; pedestrian and

within the planned unit development. Said Component shall also contain a descriptive
statement of objectives, principles and standards used for its formulation.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205 (Zoning) Section 205.21.2.G.
C. Population Component.
The Population Component shall contain a descriptive statement of the population
density and building intensity for the various proposed land uses, including an estimate of
future population characteristics and changes within the planned unit development
correlated with the other Components of the General Plan of Development. The
supporting data shall include dwelling units per acre for the various residential uses,
square footage by type for the various offices and retail facilities including sufficient data
to calculate traffic generation, parking requirements, water consumption, sewage needs
and the necessary capacity of related utilities and services traditionally rendered by public
or private organizations for a population of the size projected for the completed
development.
D. Subdivision Design Component.
The Subdivision Design Component shall contain a descriptive statement of the
principles governing the proposed subdivision of land including lot design for various
proposed land uses.
E. Services And Facilities Component.
The Services and Facilities Component shall contain a map or set of maps setting forth
the general location and extent of any and all existing and proposed systems for sewage,
domestic water supply and distribution, refuse disposal, drainage, local utilities and
rights-of-way, easements, facilities and necessary appurtenances. Said component shall
also contain a descriptive statement setting forth the objectives, principles and standards
used for its formulation, as well as a detailed statement describing the proposed
ownership, method of operation and maintenance of each service and facility,
F. Construction Order Component.
The Construction Order Component shall contain a map or set of maps setting forth the
proposed chronological order of construction relating each proposed use and structure to
the construction of the various services and facilities, as a part of the General Plan of
Development. Said Component shall include estimated completion dates and shall
specify the proposed order of request for utility release or other authority to occupy
completed structures so as to provide a basis for determining the adequacy of the related
services and facilities for each separate construction phase.
G. Additional Components.
The General Plan of Development may include any additional components including an
economic feasibility study or an economic benefits analysis if either of such is considered
necessary by the applicant or required by the Planning Commission or City Council for

Lot area and width standards for residential development shall be regulated per the underlying zoning
district in Chapter 205 of City Code.
8. PLACEMENT, DESIGN, AND HEIGHT OF STRUCTURES
A. Placement of structures on lots. When more than one setback applies to a site, structures and
facilities must be located to meet all setbacks. Where structures exist on the adjoining lots on both
sides of a proposed building site, structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to conform
to the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water level, provided the proposed building site
is not located in a shore impact zone or in a bluff impact zone. Structures shall be located as
follows:
(1) Required setbacks. All required rear yard, side yard and front yard setbacks shall be met per
the underlying zoning district.
(2) Ordinary high water level setback. Structure setbacks (in feet) from the ordinary high water
level.
Classes of Public Waters Structure Setbacks

not be placed within bluff impact zones.
(5) Height of structures. Maximum allowable height for all structures shall be regulated per
underlying zoning district in Chapter 205 of City Code.
B. Shoreland alterations. Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated to prevent
erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values,
prevent bank slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat.
(1) Vegetation alteration. Removal or alteration of vegetation is allowed subject to the following
standards:
a. Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes
is not allowed.
b. In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited clearing of trees and shrubs
and cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is allowed to provide a view to the water from
the principal dwelling site and to accommodate the placement of stairways and landings,
picnic areas, access paths, beach and watercraft access areas, and permitted wateroriented
accessory structures or facilities provided that:
((i)). The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed from the water,
assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not substantially reduced.
((ii)). Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is preserved.
((iii)). The above provisions are not applicable to the removal of trees, limbs, or branches
that are dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards and the removal of plants deemed
noxious under the Minnesota Noxious Weed Law.
(2) Building permit. Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the construction of
structures and driveways under validly issued building permits for these facilities do not
require the issuance of a separate shoreland grading and filling permit.

(4) Conditions. The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to during the
issuance of building permits, land alteration permits, special use permits, variances and
subdivision approvals:
a. Grading or filling in any type 2-8 wetland must be evaluated to determine how
extensively the proposed activity would affect the following functional qualities of the
wetland (This evaluation shall also include a determination of whether the wetland
alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews, or approvals by other local, state, or
federal agencies such as a watershed district, the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources, or the United States Army Corps of Engineers):
((i)) Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention.
((ii)) Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage.
((iii)) Fish and wildlife habitat.
((iv)) Recreational use.
((v)) Shoreline or bank stabilization.
((vi)) Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as historic significance, critical
habitat for endangered plants and animals, or others.
b. Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that ensures only the smallest
amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest time possible.
c. Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for temporary bare soil
coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover must be established as soon as possible.
d. Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before they reach any surface
water feature must be used.
e. Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control standards consistent with
the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation districts and the
United States Soil Conservation Service.
f. Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that creates an unstable slope.
g. Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must be reviewed by qualified
professionals for continued slope stability and must create finished slopes of less than 3:1
slope.
h. Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff impact zones.
i. Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public waters must first be
authorized by the commissioner under Minn. Stat. § 103G.245.
j. Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are accessory to permitted or
special uses and do not adversely affect adjacent or nearby properties.
Fridley City Code Chapter 205.32.8.C.(2)a.((iv))
k. Placement of natural rock rip rap, including associated grading of the shoreline and
placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished slope does not exceed three feet
horizontal to one foot vertical, the landward extent of the rip rap is within ten feet of the
ordinary high water level, and the height of the rip rap above the ordinary high water
level does not exceed three feet. Must be done in accordance with other State and
Federal regulations. Permit from DNR is required.
(5) Connections to public waters. Excavations where the intended purpose is connection to a
public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors, must be controlled by local
shoreland controls. Permission for excavations may be given only after written authorization
has been obtained from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources approving the
proposed connection to public waters.
C. Stormwater management. The following general and specific standards shall apply:
(1) General standards.
a. When possible, existing natural drainage-ways, wetlands, and vegetated soil surfaces
must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater runoff before discharge to
public waters.
b. Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will minimize the extent
of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential, and reduce and delay runoff
velocities, erosion potential, and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must
be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain
sediment on the site.
c. When development density, topographic features, and soil and vegetation conditions are
not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff using natural features and
vegetation, various types of constructed facilities such as diversions, settling basins,
skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used. Preference must be given
to designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried pipes and
manmade materials and facilities.
(2) Specific standards.
a. Impervious surface lot coverage shall not exceed 35 percent of the lot area, except as a
variance, which shall comply with the following standards:
((i)) All structures, additions or expansions shall meet setback and other requirements
of this Code.
((ii)) The lot shall be served with municipal sewer and water.
((iii)) The lot shall provide for the collection and treatment of stormwater in compliance
with Chapter 208 of City Code if determined that the site improvements will result
in increased runoff directly entering a public water. All development plans shall
require review and approval by the city engineer and the underlying watershed
district.
((iv)) Measures to be taken from the treatment of stormwater runoff and/or prevention of
stormwater from directly entering a public water. The measures may include, but
not be limited to the following:
Fridley City Code Chapter 205.32.9.C.
(A) Appurtenances as sedimentation basins debris basins, desilting basins, or silt
traps.
(B) Installation of debris guards and microsilt basins on storm sewer inlets.
(C) Use where practical, oil skimming devices or sump catch basins.
(D) Direct drainage away from the lake and into pervious, grassed, yards through
site grading, use of gutters and down spouts.
(E) Construction sidewalks of partially pervious raised materials such as decking
which has natural earth or other pervious material beneath or between the
planking.
(F) Use grading and construction techniques which encourage rapid infiltration,
e.g., sand and gravel under impervious materials with adjacent infiltration
swales graded to lead into them.
(G) Install berms, water bars, or terraces which temporarily detain water before
dispersing it into pervious area.
b. When constructed facilities are used for stormwater management, documentation must be
provided by a qualified individual that they are designed and installed consistent with the
field office technical guide of the local soil and water conservation districts.
c. New constructed stormwater outfall to public waters must provide for filtering or settling
of suspended solids and skimming or surface debris before discharge.
(3) Nonconformities. All legally established nonconformities as of the date of this section may
continue, but they will be managed according to section 205.32.5.B of this Code with the
following exceptions:
a. Decks are allowed as a conforming use provided all of the following criteria and standards
are met:
((i)). The principle structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were established.

erosion and sedimentation within the City of Fridley. It establishes standards and specifications
for conservation practices and planning activities, which minimize storm water pollution, soil
erosion and sedimentation.
208.02 SCOPE
Except where a variance is granted, any person, firm, sole proprietorship, partnership,
corporation, state agency, or political subdivision proposing a land disturbance activity within
the City of Fridley shall apply to the city for the approval of the storm water pollution control
plan. No land shall be disturbed until the plan is approved by the city and conforms to the
standards set forth herein.
208.03 DEFINITIONS
These definitions apply to this ordinance. Unless specifically defined below, the words or
phrases used in this ordinance shall have the same meaning as they have in common usage.
When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future tense,
words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number
include the plural number. The words “shall” and “must” are always mandatory and not merely
directive.
1. Applicant: Any person or group that applies for a building permit, subdivision approval, or a
permit to allow land disturbing activities. Applicant also means that person's agents, employees,
and others acting under this person's or group’s direction. The term “applicant” also refers to the
permit holder or holders and the permit holder’s agents, employees, and others acting under this
person's or group’s direction.
2. Best Management Practices (BMPs): Erosion and sediment control and water quality
management practices that are the most effective and practicable means of controlling,
preventing, and minimizing the degradation of surface water, including construction-phasing,

D. Tilling, planting, or harvesting of agricultural, horticultural, or forest crops.
E. Emergency work to protect life, limb, or property and emergency repairs, unless the land
disturbing activity would have otherwise required an approved erosion and sediment
control plan, except for the emergency. If such a plan would have been required, then
the disturbed land area shall be shaped and stabilized in accordance with the City of
Fridley’s requirements as soon as possible.
F. Street and utility reconstruction projects that result in a net increase in impervious area
of less than 5%.

“Ordinary high water level” as the boundary of waterbasins, watercourses, public waters, and
public waters wetlands, and:
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.03.27.
A. the ordinary high water level is an elevation delineating the highest water level that
has been maintained for a sufficient period of time to leave evidence upon the
landscape, commonly the point where the natural vegetation changes from
predominantly aquatic to predominantly terrestrial;
B. for watercourses, the ordinary high water level is the elevation of the top of the bank
of the channel; and
C. for reservoirs and flowages, the ordinary high water level is the operating elevation of

208.05 STORMWATER POLLUTION CONTROL PLAN
Every applicant for a building permit, subdivision approval, or a permit to allow land disturbing
activities must submit a storm water pollution control plan to the city engineer. No building
permit, subdivision approval, or permit to allow land disturbing activities shall be issued until
the city approves this plan.
1. Storm Water Runoff Rates. Release rates from storm water treatment basins shall not
increase over the predevelopment twenty-four (24) hour two (2) year, ten (10) year and one
hundred (100) year peak storm discharge rates, based on the last ten (10) years of how that land
was used. Accelerated channel erosion must not occur as a result of the proposed activity. For
discharges to wetlands volume control is more important than discharge rate control.
2. The Storm Water Pollution Control Plan and the Grading Plan. The storm water pollution
control plan’s measures, the limit of disturbed surface shall be marked on the approved grading
plan, and identified with flags, stakes, signs etc. on the development site before work begins.
3. Inspections of the Storm Water Pollution Control Plan’s Measures. At a minimum, such
inspections shall be done weekly by the developer or the developer’s designated representative,
and within twenty-four (24) hours after every storm or snow melt event large enough to result in
runoff from the site (approximately 0.25 inches or more in twenty-four (24) hours). At a
minimum, these inspections shall be done during active construction.
4. Minimum Requirements of the Storm Water Pollution Control Plan. The plan shall contain
or consider:
A. The name and address of the applicant and the location of the activity.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.05.5.G.
B. Project description: the nature and purpose of the land disturbing activity and the
amount of grading, utilities, and building construction involved.
C. Phasing of construction: time frames and schedules for the project’s various aspects.
D. A map of the existing site conditions: existing topography, property information, steep
and very steep slopes, existing drainage systems/patterns, type of soils, waterways,
wetlands, vegetative cover, and one hundred (100) year flood plain boundaries.
E. A site construction plan that includes the location of the proposed land disturbing
activities, stockpile locations, erosion and sediment control plan, construction schedule,
and the plan for the maintenance and inspections of the storm water pollution control
measures.
F. Adjacent areas: neighboring streams, lakes, residential areas, roads, etc., which might be
affected by the land disturbing activity.
G. Designate the site’s areas that have the potential for serious erosion problems.
H. Erosion and sediment control measures: the methods that will be used to control erosion
and sedimentation on the site, both during and after the construction process.
I.Permanent stabilization: how the site will be stabilized after construction is completed,
including specifications, time frames or schedules.
J. Calculations: any that were made for the design of such items as sediment basins, wet
detention basins, diversions, waterways, infiltration zones and other applicable practices.
5. General Storm Water Pollution Control Plan Criteria. The plan shall address the following:
A. Stabilizing all exposed soils and soil stockpiles and the related time frame or schedule.
B. Establishing permanent vegetation and the related time frame or schedule.
C. Preventing sediment damage to adjacent properties and other designated areas such as
streams, wetlands, lakes and unique vegetation (Oak groves, rare and endangered
species habitats, etc.)
D. Scheduling for erosion and sediment control practices.
E. Where permanent and temporary sedimentation basins will be located.
F. Engineering the construction and stabilization of steep and very steep slopes.
G. Measures for controlling the quality and quantity of storm water leaving a site.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.05.6.E.
H. Stabilizing all waterways and outlets.
I. Protecting storm sewers from the entrance of sediment.
J. What precautions will be taken to contain sediment, when working in or crossing water
bodies.
K. Restabilizing utility construction areas as soon as possible.
L. Protecting paved roads from sediment and mud brought in from access routes.
M. The eventual disposing of temporary erosion and sediment control measures.
N. How the temporary and permanent erosion and sediment controls will be maintained.
O. The disposal of collected sediment and floating debris.
6. Minimum Storm Water Pollution Control Measures and Related Inspections. These
minimum control measures are required where bare soil is exposed. Due to the diversity of
individual construction sites, each site will be individually evaluated. Where additional control
measures are needed, they will be specified at the discretion of the city engineer. The city will
determine what action is necessary.
A. All grading plans and building site surveys must be reviewed by the city for the
effectiveness of erosion control measures in the context of site topography and drainage.
B. Sediment control measures must be properly installed by the builder before construction
activity begins. Such structures may be adjusted during dry weather to accommodate
short term activities, such as those allowing the passage of very large vehicles. As soon
as this activity is finished or before the next runoff event, the erosion and sediment
control structures must be returned to the configuration specified by the city. A sediment
control inspection must then be scheduled, and passed before a footing inspection will
be done.
C. Diversion of channeled runoff around disturbed areas, if practical, or the protection of
the channel.
D. Easements. If a storm water management plan involves directing some or all of the site’s
runoff, the applicant or his designated representative shall obtain from adjacent property
owners any necessary easements or other property interests concerning the flowing of
such water.
E. The scheduling of the site’s activities to lessen their impact on erosion and sediment
creation, so as to minimize the amount of exposed soil.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.05.6.G.(1)
F. Control runoff as follows (Either 1 and 2 or 1 and 3):
(1) Unless precluded by moderate or heavy snow cover (Mulching can still occur if a
light snow cover is present.), stabilize all exposed inactive disturbed soil areas within
two hundred (200) feet of any water of the state, or within two hundred (200) feet of
any conveyance (curb, gutter, storm sewer inlet, drainage ditch, etc.) with sod, seed
or weed-free mulch. This must be done, if the applicant will not work the area for
seven (7) days on slopes greater than three (3) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical
(3:1), fourteen (14) days on slopes ranging from 3:1 to 10:1 and twenty-one (21)
days for slopes flatter than 10:1.
(2) For disturbed areas greater than five (5) acres construct temporary or permanent
sedimentation basins. Sedimentation basins must have a minimum surface area
equal of at least 1% of the area draining to basin, and be constructed in accordance
with accepted design specifications including access for operations and maintenance.
Basin discharge rates must also be controlled to prevent erosion in the discharge
channel.
(3) For disturbed areas less than five (5) acres sedimentation basins are encouraged, but
not required, unless required by the city engineer. The applicant shall install erosion
and sediment controls at locations directed by the city. Minimum requirements
include silt fences, rock check dams, or other equivalent control measures along
slopes. Silt fences are required along channel edges to reduce the amount of
sediment reaching the channel. Silt fences, rock check dams, etc. must be regularly
inspected and maintained. The applicant is also required to obtain a National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System/State Disposal System (NPDES/SDS)
construction storm water permit from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for
any project that disturbs one (1) acre or more of land. This one acre value also
applies to a common plan of development or sale.
G. Sediment basins related to impervious surface area. Where a project's ultimate
development replaces surface vegetation with one (1) or more acres of cumulative
impervious surface, and all runoff has not been accounted for in a local unit of
government's existing storm water management plan or practice, the runoff must be
discharged to a wet sedimentation basin prior to entering waters of the state.
(1) At a minimum the work shall conform with the current version of the Minnesota
Pollution Control Agency’s publication, “Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas,”
and the current requirements found in the same agency’s NPDES/SDS permits for
storm water associated with construction activities.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.05.6.N.
H. Generally, sufficient silt fence shall be required to hold all sheet flow runoff generated at
an individual site, until it can either infiltrate or seep through silt fence’s pores.
I. Temporary stockpiling of fifty (50) or more cubic yards of excess soil on any lot or other
vacant area shall not be allowed without issuance of a grading permit for the earth
moving activity in question.
J. For soil stockpiles greater than ten (10) cubic yards the toe of the pile must be more than
twenty-five (25) feet from a road, drainage channel or storm water inlet. If such
stockpiles will be left for more than seven (7) days, they must be stabilized with mulch,
vegetation, tarps or other means. If left for less than seven (7) days, erosion from
stockpiles must be controlled with silt fences or rock check dams.
(1) If for any reason a soil or non-soil stockpile of any size is located closer than twentyfive
(25)feet from a road, drainage channel or storm water inlet, and will be left for
more than seven (7) days, it must be covered with tarps or controlled in some other
manner.
(2) All non-soil (clean sand, gravel, concrete or bituminous) must at a minimum have a
silt fencing or other effective sediment control measures installed.
K. All sand, gravel or other mining operations taking place on the development site shall
apply for a Minnesota Pollution Control Agency National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System General Storm Water permit for industrial activities and all required
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources permits.
L. Temporary rock construction entrances, or equally effective means of preventing
vehicles from tracking sediment from the site, may be required wherever vehicles enter
and exit a site.
(1) Vehicle tracking of sediment from the site must be minimized by BMPs such as
stone pads, concrete or steel wash racks, or equivalent systems. Street sweeping
must be used if such BMPs are not adequate.
M. Parking is prohibited on all bare lots and all temporary construction entrances, except
where street parking is not available. Gravel entrances are to be used for deliveries only
as per the development contract.
N. Streets must be cleaned and swept whenever tracking of sediments occurs. Sediment
shall not be allowed to remain on the streets if the site is to be left idle for weekends or
holidays. A regular sweeping schedule should be established.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.05.6.U.
O. Water (impacted by the construction activity) removed from the site by pumping must
be treated by temporary sedimentation basins, geotextile filters, grit chambers, sand
filters, up-flow chambers, hydro-cyclones, swirl concentrators or other appropriate
controls. Such water shall not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion or flooding
of the site, receiving channels, adjacent property or a wetland.
P. All storm drain inlets must be protected during construction until control measures are in
place with either silt fence or an equivalent barrier that meets accepted design criteria,
standards and specifications as contained in the latest version of the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency’s publication, ”Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas.”
Q. Roof drain leaders. All newly constructed and reconstructed buildings shall route roof
drain leaders to pervious areas (not natural wetlands) where the runoff can infiltrate
whenever practical. The discharge rate shall be controlled so that no erosion occurs in
the pervious areas.
R. Removal from the project’s site of more than one (1) acre of topsoil shall not be done,
unless written permission is given by the city engineer. Excessive removal of topsoil
from the project’s site can cause significant current and future soil erosion problems.
S. Inspection and maintenance. All storm water pollution control management facilities
must be designed to minimize the need of maintenance, to provide easy vehicle
(typically eight (8) feet or wider) and personnel access for maintenance purposes and be
structurally sound. These facilities must have Storm Water Maintenance Agreement that
ensures continued effective removal of the pollutants carried in storm water runoff. The
owner shall inspect all storm water management facilities during construction, twice
during the first year of operation and at least once every year thereafter. The city will
keep all inspection records on file for a period of six (6) years.
(1) Inspection and maintenance easements. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant
to obtain any necessary easements or other property interests to allow access to the
storm water management facilities for inspection and maintenance purpose.
T. Follow-up inspections must be performed by the owner on a regular basis to ensure that
erosion and sediment control measures are properly installed and maintained. In all
cases the inspectors will attempt to work with the applicant and/or builder to maintain
proper erosion and sediment control at all sites.
(1) In cases where cooperation is withheld, construction stop orders may be issued by
the city, until all erosion and sediment control measures meet specifications. A
second erosion and sediment control/grading inspection must then be scheduled and
passed before the final inspection will be done.
U. All infiltration areas must be inspected to ensure that sediment from ongoing
construction activities is not reaching infiltration areas, and that these areas are also
being protected from soil compaction from the movement of construction equipment.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.05.7.D.
7. Permanent Storm Water Pollution Controls.
A. The applicant shall install and construct all permanent storm water management
facilities necessary to manage increased runoff, so that the discharge rates from storm
water treatment basins, such that the predevelopment twenty-four (24) hour two (2) year,
ten (10) year, and one hundred (100) year peak storm discharge rates are not increased.
These predevelopment rates shall be based on the last ten (10) years of how that land
was used. Accelerated channel erosion must not occur as a result of the proposed land
disturbing or development activity.
(1) All calculations and information used in determining these peak storm discharge
rates shall be submitted along with the storm water pollution control plan.
B. The applicant shall consider reducing the need for permanent storm water management
facilities by incorporating the use of natural topography and land cover such as natural
swales and depressions as they exist before development to the degree that they can
accommodate the additional flow of treated (e.g., settled) water without compromising
the integrity or quality of the wetland or pond.
C. The following permanent storm water management practices must be investigated in
developing the storm water management part of the storm water pollution control plan in
the following descending order of preference:
(1) Protect and preserve as much natural or vegetated area on the site as possible,
minimizing impervious surfaces. Direct runoff to vegetated areas rather than to
adjoining streets, storm sewers and ditches.
(2) Flow attenuation of treated storm water by the use of open vegetated swales and
natural depressions.
(3) Storm water ponding facilities (including percolation facilities); and
(4) A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable
minimum control requirements specified in subsection (C) above. The applicant
shall provide justification for the method selected.
D. Redevelopment of existing parcels must provide treatment of stormwater from
impervious surfaces even if the amount of impervious remains the same or is reduced.
Treatment may be accomplished through the use of ponding areas, infiltration areas, or
structural stormwater treatment devices.
The applicant shall submit documentation showing the chosen method will remove in
excess of 80% of suspended solids and other pollutants from a 1.5 inch 24 hour storm
event.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.05.10.
E .The applicant shall be required to sign and file a Stormwater Maintenance Agreement
that ensures continued effective removal of the pollutants carried in storm water runoff.
The Agreement also ensures continued maintenance, cleaning and upkeep of the facility.
8. Minimum Design Standards for Storm Water Wet Detention Facilities. At a minimum these
facilities must conform to the most current technology as reflected in the current version of the
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s publication, “Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas”
and the current requirements found in the same agency’s NPDES permits for storm water
associated with construction activities.
9. Minimum Protection for Natural Wetlands.
A. Runoff must not be discharged directly into wetlands without appropriate quality (e.i.,
treated) and quantity runoff control, depending on the individual wetland’s vegetation
sensitivity. See the current version of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s
publication, “Storm-Water and Wetlands: Planning and Evaluation Guidelines for
Addressing Potential Impacts of Urban Storm-Water and Snow-Melt Runoff on
Wetlands” for guidance.
B. Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially, unless replaced by either
restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value. Compensation,
including the replacement ratio and quality of replacement should be consistent with the
requirements outlined in the Board of Water and Soil Resources rules that implement the
Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act of 1991 including any and all amendments to it.
C. Work in and around wetlands must be guided by the following principles in descending
order of priority:
(1) Avoid both the direct and indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish
the wetland.
(2) Minimize the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland related
activity.
(3) Rectify the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland
environment with one of at least equal public value.
(4) Reduce or eliminate the adverse impact over time by preservation and maintenance
operations during the life of the activity.
10. Models/Methodologies/Computations. Hydrologic models and design methodologies used
for the determining runoff characteristics and analyzing storm water management structures
must be approved by the city engineer. Plans, specifications and computations for storm water
management facilities submitted for review must be sealed and signed by a registered
professional engineer. All computations must appear in the plans submitted for review, unless
otherwise approved by the city engineer.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.08.A.
208.06 REVIEW
The city engineer shall review the storm water pollution control plan.
1. Permit Required. If the city determines that the storm water pollution control plan meets the
requirements of this ordinance, the city shall issue a permit valid for a specified period of time,
that authorizes the land disturbance activity contingent on the implementation and completion
of the storm water pollution control plan.
2. Permit Denial. If the city determines that the storm water pollution control plan does not
meet the requirements of this ordinance, the city shall not issue a permit for the land disturbance
activity.
A. All land use and building permits for the site in question must be suspended until the
applicant has an approved storm water pollution control plan.
3. Permit Suspension and Revocation If the storm water pollution control plan is not being
implemented the city can suspend or revoke the permit authorizing the land disturbance activity.
208.07 MODIFICATION OF PLAN
An approved storm water pollution control plan may be modified on submission of a written
application for modification to the city, and after written approval by the city engineer. In
reviewing such an application, the city engineer may require additional reports and data.
1. Records Retention. The city shall retain the written records of such modifications for at least
three ( 3 ) years.
208.08 FINANCIAL SECURITIES
The applicant shall provide a financial security for the performance of the work, in conjunction
with a building permit or land alteration permit, described and delineated on the approved
grading plan involving the storm water pollution control plan and any storm water and pollution
control plan related remedial work in, at a rate of three thousand dollars ($3,000) per acre for
the maximum acreage of soil that will be simultaneously exposed to erosion during the project’s
construction. (See the definitions of “exposed soil area” and “final stabilization” for
clarification.) This security must be available prior to commencing the project. The form of the
security must be:
A. By cash security deposited to the city for thirty percent (30%) of the total financial
security when less than five (5) acres of soil will be simultaneously exposed. When over
five (5) acres of soil will be simultaneously exposed to erosion, then the cash security
increases to the first five thousand dollars ($5,000) or ten percent (10%) of the total
financial security, whichever is greater.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.08.3.
B. The remainder of the financial security shall be placed either with the city, a responsible
escrow agent, or trust company, at the option of the city, money, an irrevocable letter of
credit, negotiable bonds of the kind approved for securing deposits of public money or
other instruments of credit from one or more financial institutions, subject to regulation
by the state and federal government wherein said financial institution pledges that the
funds are on deposit and guaranteed for payment. This security shall save the city free
and harmless from all suits or claims for damages resulting from the negligent grading,
removal, placement or storage of rock, sand, gravel, soil or other like material within the
city. The type of security must be of a type acceptable to the city.
C. The city may request a greater financial security, if the city considers that the
development site is especially prone to erosion, or the resource to be protected is
especially valuable.
D. If more soil is simultaneously exposed to erosion than originally planned, the amount of
the security shall increase in relation to this additional exposure.
1. MAINTAINING THE FINANCIAL SECURITY
If at anytime during the course of the work this amount falls below 50% of the required deposit,
the applicant shall make another deposit in the amount necessary to restore the deposit to the
required amount within five (5) days. Otherwise the city may:
A. Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy.
B. Revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant for the site in question and any
other of the applicant’s sites within the city’s jurisdiction.
2. PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION OF THE FINANCIAL SECURITY
When more than one-third of the applicant’s maximum exposed soil area achieves final
stabilization, the city can reduce the total required amount of the financial security by one-third,
if recommended in writing by the city engineer. When more than two-thirds of the applicant’s
maximum exposed soil area achieves final stabilization, the city can reduce the total required
amount of the financial security by two-thirds of the initial amount, if recommended in writing
by the city engineer.
3. ACTION AGAINST THE FINANCIAL SECURITY
The city may act against the financial security, if any of the conditions listed below exist. The
city shall use funds from this security to finance any corrective or remedial work undertaken by
the city or a contractor under contract to the city and to reimburse the city for all direct cost
incurred in the process of remedial work including, but not limited to, staff time and attorney's
fees.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.09.1.
A. The applicant ceases land disturbing activities and/or filling and abandons the work site
prior to completion of the city approved grading plan.
B. The applicant fails to conform to any city approved grading plan and/or the storm water
pollution control plan as approved by the city, or related supplementary instructions.
C. The techniques utilized under the storm water pollution control plan fail within one (1)
year of installation.
D. The applicant fails to reimburse the city for corrective action taken under 208.09.
E. Emergency action under either 208.08.4 (below) or any part of 208.09.
4. EMERGENCY ACTION
If circumstances exist such that noncompliance with this ordinance poses an immediate danger
to the public health, safety and welfare, as determined by the city engineer, the city may take
emergency preventative action. The city shall also take every reasonable action possible to
contact and direct the applicant to take any necessary action. Any cost to the city may be
recovered from the applicant’s financial security.
5. RETURNING THE FINANCIAL SECURITY
Any unspent amount of the financial security deposited with the city for faithful performance of
the storm water pollution control plan and any storm water and pollution control plan related
remedial work must be released not more than one (1) full year after the completion of the
installation of all such measures and the establishment of final stabilization.
208.09 NOTIFICATION OF FAILURE OF THE STORM WATER POLLUTION
CONTROL PLAN
The city shall notify the applicant, when the city is going to act on the financial securities part
of this ordinance.
1. NOTIFICATION BY THE CITY
The initial contact will be to the party or parties listed on the application and/or the storm water
pollution control plan as contacts. Except during an emergency action under 208.08.4, fortyeight
(48) hours after notification by the city or seventy-two (72) hours after the failure of
erosion control measures, whichever is less, the city at its discretion, may begin corrective
work. Such notification should be in writing, but if it is verbal, a written notification should
follow as quickly as practical. If after making a good faith effort to notify the responsible party
or parties, the city has been unable to establish contact, the city may proceed with the corrective
work.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.09.4.D.
A. There are conditions when time is of the essence in controlling erosion. During such a
condition the city may take immediate action, and then notify the applicant as soon as
possible.
2. EROSION OFF-SITE
If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the applicant shall immediately develop a cleanup
and restoration plan, obtain the right-of-entry from the adjoining property owner, and
implement the cleanup and restoration plan within forty-eight (48) hours of obtaining the
adjoining property owner's permission. In no case, unless written approval is received from the
city, shall more than seven (7) calendar days go by without corrective action being taken. If in
the discretion of the city, the applicant does not repair the damage caused by the erosion, the
city may do the remedial work required and charge the cost to the applicant.
3. EROSION INTO STREETS, WETLANDS OR WATER BODIES
If eroded soils (including tracked soils from construction activities) enter or appear likely to
enter streets, wetlands, or other water bodies, prevention strategies, cleanup and repair must be
immediate. The applicant shall provide all traffic control and flagging required to protect the
traveling public during the cleanup operations.
4. FAILURE TO DO CORRECTIVE WORK
When an applicant fails to conform to any provision of 208.08 or 208.09 within the time
stipulated, the city may take the following actions:
A. Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy.
B. Suspend or revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant for the site in question or
any other of the applicant’s sites within the city’s jurisdiction.
C. Direct the correction of the deficiency by city forces or by a separate contract. The
issuance of a permit for land disturbance activity constitutes a right-of-entry for the city
or its contractor to enter upon the construction site for the purpose of correcting erosion
control deficiencies.
D. All costs incurred by the city in correcting storm water pollution control deficiencies
must be reimbursed by the applicant. If payment is not made within thirty (30) days after
costs are incurred by the city, payment will be made from the applicant’s financial
securities as described in 208.08.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.11.
E. If there is an insufficient financial amount in the applicant’s financial securities as
described in 208.08, to cover the costs incurred by the city, then the city may assess the
remaining amount against the property. As a condition of the permit for land disturbance
activities, the owner shall waive notice of any assessment hearing to be conducted by the
city, concur that the benefit to the property exceeds the amount of the proposed
assessment, and waive all rights by virtue of Minnesota Statute 429.081 to challenge the
amount or validity of the assessment.
208.10 VARIANCE
In any case where, upon application of the responsible person or persons, the city finds that by
reason of exceptional circumstances, strict conformity with this ordinance would be
unreasonable, impractical, or not feasible under the circumstances; the city in its discretion may
grant a variance therefrom upon such conditions as it may prescribe for prevention, control, or
abatement of pollution in harmony with the general purposes of this ordinance. The public shall
be a given the opportunity for comment.
1. Variance Request. The variance request must be in writing in a form acceptable to the city.
2. Variance Public Notice. The variance request shall be public noticed in the normal manner
used for city council meeting items, to allow the public an opportunity for comment.
3. Variance Determination. After the public has been given the right to comment, the variance
shall either be approved or disapproved by a vote of the city council.
4. Variance Response. The variance response must be in writing, and include the justification
for either granting or denying the requested variance. A favorable response shall also include
any special conditions imposed by the city.
5. Time Limit. If the variance is not acted upon within one (1) year of being granted, the
variance shall become void.
6. Revocation. If any of the variance’s conditions are violated, the city may revoke the
variance.
208.11 ENFORCEMENT
The city shall be responsible enforcing this ordinance.
Fridley City Code Chapter 208 Section 208.14.
1. Penalties. Any person, firm, or corporation failing to comply with or violating any of these
regulations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a fine or imprisonment
or both as defined in Chapter 901. All land use and building permits shall be suspended until the
applicant has corrected the violation. Each day that a separate violation exists shall constitute a
separate offense.
208.012 RIGHT OF ENTRY AND INSPECTION
1. Powers. The applicant shall promptly allow the city and their authorized representatives,
upon presentation of credentials to:
A. Enter upon the permitted site for the purpose of obtaining information, examination of
records, conducting investigations, inspections or surveys.
B. Bring such equipment upon the permitted site as is necessary to conduct such surveys
and investigations.
C. Examine and copy any books, papers, records, or memoranda pertaining to activities or
records required to be kept under the terms and conditions of this permitted site.
D. Inspect the storm water pollution control measures.
E. Sample and monitor any items or activities pertaining to storm water pollution control
measures.
F. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to the safe and easy access of such an
inspection shall be promptly removed upon the inspector’s request. The cost of
providing such access shall be born by the applicant.
208.13 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
It is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this
ordinance shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
208.14 SEVERABILITY
The provisions of this ordinance are severable, and if any provisions of this ordinance, or
application of any provision of this ordinance to any circumstance, is held invalid, the
application of such provision to other circumstances, and the remainder of this ordinance must
not be affected thereby.

subject to and shall conform to these regulations and other applicable law and shall conform to
the land use plan, the major thoroughfare plan, the official map, the Zoning Chapter and other
City plans, ordinances, chapters and regulations.
1. Lot Split.
Any existing lot, parcel or tract of land may be subdivided into two (2) or more parcels by means
of a "lot split" when each parcel within the subdivision can be described as a simple fractional
part of an existing City approved plat, Auditor's Subdivision, or Registered Land Survey.
A. Application
Application for a lot split shall be made on forms furnished by the City and shall include
a Certificate of Survey showing:
(1) scale and north arrow;
(2) dimensions of the property;
(3) names and locations of adjacent streets;
(4) location of any existing structure; and,
(5) any other information as may be necessary to determine if the lot split meets the
intent and requirements of this Chapter.
B. Review
(1) The proposed lot split shall be informally heard by the Planning Commission within
forty (40) days of the filing of an application for lot split. Notices shall be mailed to
all owners of property within 350 feet of the parcel included in the request, not less
than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days prior to the hearing. Failure of a
property owner to receive notice shall not invalidate any such proceedings as set forth
within this chapter. (Ref. 1026)

application.
Fridley City Code Chapter 211 Section 211.04.2.B.(1)
Whenever any lot split is to be made, such subdivision can be made without further
platting with approval of the council if the council shall find that such subdivision
facilitates and does not hinder the transfer and conveyance of the land; does not
hinder the making of assessments and keeping of records connected therewith; that it
does not result in the creation of any parcel (within or without the subdivision) of a
size in area or frontage which is less than is required for purposes of construction of a
building on such parcel under the zoning laws and building regulations of the City;
and that the subdivision to be made is not made for the purpose of avoiding such
conditions and restrictions with respect to the land as might be imposed upon a plat.
(Ref. 207)
C. Certification and Recording
(1) After final approval, a certified copy of the resolution approving the lot split shall be
forwarded to the applicant. The lot split, together with a certified copy of the
resolution, shall thereafter be recorded among the records of the County within one
hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the resolution, unless a longer period of
time is granted and provided for recording at the time of approval.
(2) A lot split not recorded within a period of one hundred eighty (180) days or the
approved extension time, is deemed to be one, that is not approved and such lot split
is not entitled to be recorded; and the same shall not thereafter be recorded except and
unless it is presented to the Planning Commission and Council and re-approved.
D. Division of Taxes
Any lot, parcel, or tract of land that is less than a whole parcel of land as charged in the
tax lists must receive City Council approval before there is a division of taxes.
2. Plat and Registered Land Survey Process.
A. Scope

and unless it shall have again been presented to the Planning Commission and
Council and approved for recording.
(g) Time Extension
A time extension for recording a plat shall be granted upon application duly made
to the Council unless the Council finds after a hearing that the delay and failure to
record within the period of time allowed was without justifiable cause and that the
conditions and circumstances attendant to the land within the plat and in the
immediate surrounding area as is affected thereby are materially and substantially
different from those present at the time such plat was originally approved and that
the plat as made is no longer deemed an appropriate plat with the conditions and
circumstances present. In making such determination, the Council can consider

FRIDLEY CITY CODE
CHAPTER 212. MINING
(Ref . 649)
212.01. FINDING AND PURPOSE
1. The City of Fridley recognizes that surface mining exists and that this mining can be an aid
to the preparation of development sites. The City further finds that it is not practicable to mine
minerals required by society without disturbing the surface of the earth and producing waste
materials. The danger exists that non-compatible land uses could unnecessarily deny the benefit
of these materials to society in the future. It is further found that the character of mining may
create undesirable land and water conditions which can be detrimental to the health, safety,
welfare and property rights of the citizens of the City of Fridley. However, if properly regulated
and if reclamation of surface mined lands is required, mining can take place within the City in
such a manner that undesirable side effects of the operation may be restricted to an acceptable
level.
2. The purposes of this Chapter are as follows:
A. To provide for the economical availability of sand, gravel, rock, soil and other materials.
B. To establish uniform and reasonable limitations, safeguards and controls in the City, for
the future mining of said materials.
C. To control the effect of the mining operation upon adjacent property and other areas of
the City.
D. To provide for the restoration of the mining operation and mining area during, and after
termination of, the removal operation.
E. To control and minimize pollution caused by erosion or sedimentation, all in furtherance
of the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Fridley, Minnesota.
212.02. RELATIONSHIP TO ZONING ORDINANCE
This Chapter shall apply to areas within the City of Fridley in which the removal of minerals,
including sand and gravel, is a permitted or special use. The standards and requirements set by
this Chapter shall govern the issuance, renewal and termination of the mining permit.
212.03. DEFINITIONS
1. Dust.
Air-borne, inorganic particulate matter other than smoke.
Fridley City Code Chapter 212 Section 212.05.1.
2. Minerals.
Nonmetalic material found in the earth including, but not limited to, sand, gravel, rock and soil,

names of persons employed, hours worked and such other information and records as may be
required by the City Council. Further, the City Manager shall have immediate charge of all
employees necessary to the operation of the said utilities of the City. (Ref. 113)
402.02. POLICY
The City shall eliminate hazards to safety and health arising from defective water systems, sanitary
sewer systems, and storm water systems in the City of Fridley; and for such purposes shall extend
its municipal or public sewers to all lands of the City and require connection of all failing
Individual Sewage Treatment Systems (ISTS) to said systems.
402.03. CONNECTION SERVICE
No person shall make any type of connection to the municipal water system, the sanitary sewer
system or the storm water system except upon making an application therefore on a form provided
by the City and receiving a permit issued by the City for such purpose. The application shall

402.04. PROPORTIONATE SHARE
No connection shall be made or continued in use at any time with respect to any sewer or water
connection serving property if any person or occupants of the land, parcel or premises affected
have not paid or provided for the payment of the full and proportionate share of the systems,
services or improvements to be used as determined by the City Council, which share of the cost of
said system, service or improvement shall be payable as follows:
Fridley City Code Section 402.06
A. For service to property to which service lines have not been previously run from the street
laterals to the property line, the owner, occupant or user shall pay into the City Treasury (Water
and Sewer Utility Fund) an amount not less than the cost of making connections, taps and
installation of necessary pipe and appurtenances to provide service to the property and
necessary street repairs. Alternately, the City shall allow the owner to contract directly with an
approved firm to install such connection and restoration subject to approval and inspection by
the City.
B. For service to property to which service lines have been run previously to the property line but
have not been paid for, the owner, occupant or user shall pay in cash or agree to pay charges in
the form of Special Assessments to be levied against the property to be spread over a number
of years coincident with the maturity requirements of any Special Improvement Bonds sold for
the purpose of financing the construction of such water and sewer lines and service connections
serving the property. Said cash payment or Assessment charge shall be in principal amount not
less than the payments made by or charges placed against comparable properties for like
services of such water or sewer, i.e. FOR AN "EQUIVALENT LATERAL ASSESSMENT",
or an amount as may be established by the City Council. In the instance of services run to the
property lines as provided under Section 402.03.A, the payment to the City Treasury of any
amount required under Section 402.03.B shall be reduced by the amount paid to the City under
Section 402.03.A. Payment to the City Treasury in the form of a Special Assessment charge
shall be in the form of equal annual installments together with interest on the unpaid balance
from year to year, which interest shall be computed at the current rate of assessment.
402.05. PERMIT FEE
Prior to constructing or repair of any water or sewer line connecting the existing municipal system
and any house or building for which the application is made, the owner or contractor shall be
required to obtain a permit for such connection, and shall pay a permit fee as provided in Chapter
11 of this Code. After such connection has been made, the Water and Sewer Department shall be
notified. It shall be unlawful to cover any connecting line until an inspection has been made and
such connection and the work incident thereto has been approved by the City as a proper and
suitable connection.
402.06. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE TO CONNECTION
After the initial connection has been made to the water service curb stop box or the sewer lead at
the property line or a water service or sewer lead has been extended to the property line for
connection, the applicant, owner, or the occupant or user of such premises shall be liable for all
repairs required to any water line or any sewer lines necessary for connection of the premises from
the main to the premises. If the property owner requests maintenance services or repairs be
performed by the City, the property owner shall be charged for the costs of the maintenance and/or
repairs, including any necessary street repairs, at a rate set annually by an administrative policy. It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant, owner, occupant or user to perform standard
maintenance of the sewer service line from the premises to the main including debris clearing or
root cutting and to maintain the water service curb stop box for operability and at such height as
will ensure that it remains above the finished grade of the land or property. (Ref. 638, 1156, 1191)
Fridley City Code Section 402.08
402.07. CONSTRUCTION OF PRIVATE SEWER SYSTEMS PROHIBITED
The construction of new individual sewage treatment systems (ISTS) is prohibited in the City of
Fridley. Existing individual sewage treatment systems meeting MN Rules Chapter 7080 standards
may and shall be permitted to continue in use and operation until system is deemed failing by a
licensed inspector during a biennial inspection or the property owner expands kitchen, bathroom, or
bedroom areas. The use of a cesspool, outside toilet, or any other individual sewage treatment system
not meeting standards set forth in MN Rules Chapter 7080 is strictly prohibited.
1. New Construction. All new houses, buildings, businesses, facilities, etc., producing wastes or
discharges must be properly connected to the City of Fridley sewer system. Application for
connection shall be made to the City Building Department and all connection fees shall be
paid as provided by City Ordinances. No building permit shall be issued by the City after the
effective date of this ordinance, unless the applicant shows compliance with the terms of this
ordinance.
2. Existing Structures. Any existing houses, buildings, business or facilities presently utilizing
their own septic systems, drainfield, soil absorption system, etc., shall be inspected by
November 1, 2000 by a licensed inspector. After the initial inspection, systems must be
inspected biennially by a licensed inspector and inspection results presented to the City of
Fridley Building Department. All systems shall also be inspected prior to sale and/or transfer
of title. All properties utilizing on site sewage treatment shall be connected to the City Sewer
system prior to the issuance of any building permits for kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom
expansions. Further, any such system presently in use, but which is revealed to be a failing
system by inspection, shall be connected to the City of Fridley sewer system as soon as is
practical but within 6 months of the time of failure. If the system is determined to be an
immediate health hazard, the system must be connected immediately.
3. Abandoned Sewage Treatment Systems. All existing cesspools, drywells, septic tanks, or any
other on-site sewage treatment systems which are abandoned and not in use shall be properly
removed and/or filled immediately to State standards so as not to pose a danger to health and
safety.
402.08. NUISANCE
Hereafter, whenever and wherever any such private septic tank, cesspool or other type of private
sewage system is damaged or defective and as a result thereof operates improperly creating an
immediate health threat by exposing raw sewage to the grounds surface, then except as is further
provided herein, connection shall be made to a public sewer immediately. Use of a defective
system, or one in need of repair to eliminate a hazard to safety or health is deemed maintenance of
a nuisance and is prohibited; and such nuisance may be abated according to law.

402.29. INDUSTRIAL USER STRENGTH CHARGE
1. Recitals.
The Metropolitan Council Environmental Services (MCES), a metropolitan commission organized
and existing under the laws of the State of Minnesota (the “MCES”), in order to receive and retain
grants in compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and
regulations thereunder (the "Act"), has determined to impose an industrial user sewer strength
Fridley City Code Section 402.29.4
charge upon users of the Metropolitan Disposal System, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, Section
473.121, Subdivision 24, and to recover operation and maintenance costs of treatment works
attributable to the strength of the discharge of industrial waste, such sewer strength charge being in
addition to the charge based upon the volume of discharge. In order for the City to pay such costs
based upon strength of industrial discharge allocated to it each year by the MCES it is hereby
found, determined and declared to be necessary to establish sewer strength charges and a formula
for the computation thereof for all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or
served by the City. Furthermore, Minnesota Statutes, Section 444.075, Subdivision 3, empowers
the City to make such sewer charge a charge against the owner, lessee, occupant or all of them and
certify unpaid charges to the County Auditor as a tax lien against the property served.
2. Establishment of Strength Charges.
For the purpose of paying the costs allocated to the City each year by the MCES that are based
upon the strength of discharge of all industrial users receiving waste treatment services within or
served by the City, there is hereby approved, adopted and established, in addition to the sewer
charge based upon the volume of discharge, a sewer charge upon each company or corporation
receiving waste treatment services within or served by the City, based upon strength of industrial
waste discharged into the sewer system of the City (the "Strength Charge").
3. Establishment of Strength Charge Formula.
For the purpose of computation of the Strength Charge established by Section 402.29.2, there is
hereby established, approved and adopted in compliance with the Act the same strength charge
formula designated in Resolution No. 76-1972 adopted by the governing body of the MCES on
June 15, 1976, such formula being based upon pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of the
sewage produced through an evaluation of pollution qualities and quantities in excess of annual
average base and the proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of waste treatment services
provided by the Commission. (Ref 1191)
4. Strength Charge Payment.
It is hereby approved, adopted and established that the Strength Charge established by Section
402.29.2 above shall be paid by each industrial user receiving waste treatment services and subject
thereto before the twentieth (20th) day next succeeding the date of billing thereof to such user by or
on behalf of the City, and such payment thereof shall be deemed to be delinquent if not so paid to
the billing entity before such date. Furthermore, it is hereby established, approved and adopted that
if such payment is not paid before such date an industrial user shall pay interest compounded
monthly at the rate of two-thirds of one percent (2/3%) per month on the unpaid balance due.
Fridley City Code Section 402.32.1
5. Establishment of Tax Lien.
As provided by Minnesota Statutes, Section 444.075, Subdivision 3, it is hereby approved, adopted
and established that if payment of the Strength Charge established by Section 402.29.2 above is not
paid before the sixtieth (60th) day next succeeding the date of billing thereof to the industrial user
by or on behalf of the City, said delinquent sewer strength charge, plus accrued interest established
pursuant to Section 402.29.4, shall be deemed to be a charge against the owner, lessee and
occupant of the property served, and the City or its agent shall certify such unpaid delinquent
balance to the County Auditor with taxes against the property served for collection as other taxes
are collected; provided, however, that such certification shall not preclude the City or its agent
from recovery of such delinquent sewer strength charge and interest thereon under any other
available remedy. (Ref. 629)
402.30. TAMPERING
It shall be unlawful for any person to tamper with, use, alter or damage any water line or
connection of any type or part thereof or any fire hydrant, water service curb or valve box or street
valves or any sewer line or connection of any type or part thereof without authority from the City.
Any person who shall damage any part of the municipal water system, or any pipe or connection of
any type or part thereof, including any hydrant or valve, or any part of the municipal sewer system
or any pipe or connection of any type or part thereof, shall be liable for the damage or loss to the
City caused thereby.
402.31. SURFACE WATER INTO SANITARY SEWER
It shall be unlawful for any owner, occupant or user of any premises to direct into or allow any
surface water to drain into the sanitary sewer system of the City of Fridley. (Ref 1191)
402.32 CITY INSPECTION
1. All installation work or repair of connections to the municipal sewer and water system,
including grades, bends and back-filling shall be performed under the direction and supervision
of the City Manager or the City Manager's designee. No work shall be covered or back-filled
until directed by the City Manager or the City Manager's designee. All work and excavations
shall be protected by barricades and warning markers and lights reasonable and suitable to the
purpose. The City shall be held harmless of any claim or loss as might otherwise arise for
damage or loss of injury caused by or arising by reason of such work being performed; and the
applicant, owner or user performing or causing such work to be done shall give a report to the
City with respect thereto.. No digging on any permanent type street shall be permitted except
by special permission from the City.
Fridley City Code Section 402.36
2. Whenever a water user questions the accuracy of the meter, and desires that such meter be
tested, such person shall reimburse the city for all testing costs plus an administrative fee set
annually by an administrative policy if the meter tests accurate within a range of minus three
percent (-3%) to plus one and one half percent (1-1/2%). If it is not accurate within this range,
no charge will be made for testing and any administrative costs incurred. An adjustment on the
water bill will be made for the period of time that the meter is assumed to be inaccurate. (Ref
1191)
402.33. WATER CONSERVATION
In order to ensure an adequate water supply for human consumption, sanitary purposes, and fire
fighting purposes, the City Council may establish by resolution water conservation regulations as
they may be required from time to time. (Ref. 922)
402.34. TERMINATION NOTICE
Requests for turning off the water shall be made in writing thirty (30) days prior to the time for
which payment has been made. Otherwise, the owner of the premises shall be liable for water rent
for the next period.
402.35. INSPECTION & CORRECTION
The City Manager or any authorized employee or agent of the City shall have right to enter and be
admitted to any lands and property in the City for the purpose of inspection of materials, plumbing
work and fixtures of all kinds used by or in connection with the water and sewer systems. Any and
all work, construction, alteration, repair, addition to, remodeling, moving, use, maintenance and
occupancy of any building and the work and installation of any utility and appliance thereof and in
use therewith to which the codes herein referred to apply shall be done and performed strictly in
accordance with this Code. If, after inspection, any of the same are found not to be in accord with
this Code, then the same shall be corrected upon notice from any duly authorized representative of
the City of Fridley authorized to give such notice. If, after such written notice to any person
performing any work which requires correction thereof, such person neglects or refuses to correct
such work and fails to make the same conform to this and to the order of the City’s representative,
the City by any of its duly authorized representatives may remove such work and charge the cost
thereon to the person installing the same. No person shall cover any such work without the same
being first duly inspected.

FRIDLEY CITY CODE
CHAPTER 403. SANITARY SEWER CONNECTIONS
(Ref. 1044)
403.01. PURPOSE
In adopting this ordinance, the City Council finds that the discharge of water from any roof,
surface, ground, sump pump, footing tile or other natural precipitation into the City sewage
system will and has on numerous occasions in the past, flooded and overloaded the sewage
system to such an extent as to cause significant and grave damage to the property of large
numbers of city residents. Such damage is caused by the backup of sewage into the living
quarters of residents, an increase in sewage treatment costs, and in addition to other damage
creates a hazard to health. The City Council, therefore, finds it essential to the maintenance of
health and to minimize sewage treatment costs and damage to property that the provisions of this
ordinance be strictly enforced to avoid emergencies in the future.
403.02. DEFINITION AND METHOD
No water from any roof, surface, ground, sump pump, footing tile, or other natural precipitation
shall be discharged into the sanitary sewage system. Dwellings and other buildings and structures
which require, because of the infiltration of water into basements, crawl spaces and the like, a
sump pump system to discharge excess water, shall have a permanently installed discharge line
which shall not at any time discharge water into the sanitary sewage system. A permanent
installation shall be one which provides for year-around discharge capability to either the outside
of the dwelling, building or structure, or is connected to the City storm sewer or discharges to the
street or drainage easement. It shall consist of a rigid discharge line, without valving or quick
connections for altering the path of discharge.
403.03. DISCONNECTION
Before July 1, 1995, any person, firm or corporation having a roof, surface, ground, sump pump,
or footing tile now connected and/or discharging into the sanitary sewer system shall disconnect
and/or remove same. Any disconnects or openings in the sanitary sewer shall be closed or
repaired in an effective, workmanlike manner, as approved by the City Building Inspector.
403.04. INSPECTION
Every person owning improved real estate that discharges into the City's sanitary sewer system
shall allow an employee of the City of Fridley or their designated representative to inspect the
buildings to confirm that there is no sump pump or other prohibited discharge into the sanitary
sewer system. In lieu of having the City inspect their property, any person may furnish a
certificate certifying that their property is in and will remain in compliance with this Ordinance.
Any person refusing to allow their property to be inspected or refusing to furnish a certificate
within (14) days of the date City employees or their designated representatives are denied
admittance to the property, shall become subject to the surcharge hereinafter provided for. Any
property found to violate this Ordinance shall make the necessary changes to comply with the
Ordinance and furnish poof of the changes to the City.
Fridley City Code Section 403.09.
403.05. FUTURE INSPECTIONS
At any future time, if the City has reason to suspect that an illegal connection may exist in a
premises, the owner, by written notice shall comply with the provisions of Paragraph 4 above.
403.06. INCENTIVE
There are a number of methods to dispose of sump pump effluent. The City's recommended
solution is to pump the water into a cistern. Any property which has an existing illegal
connection may apply for City financial assistance by requesting a City inspector to verify the
illegal connection, have the repair completion verified and submit a receipt for labor and/or
materials (self-help labor rate valued at $40). Upon verification of the corrective action and
costs, the City will remit to the property owner one-half of the cost to correct the illegal
connection to a maximum of $450 per installation. The property owner may petition the City to
abate the problem and assess the property owners cost for the corrective work over a 3-year
period. This incentive program is in effect until December 31, 1996.
403.07. SURCHARGE
A surcharge of $300 per quarter is hereby imposed and added to every sewer billing mailed on
and after July 1, 1995 to property owners that are not in compliance with this ordinance. The
surcharge shall be added for the entire quarter until the property is in compliance.
403.08. PENALTIES
Any violation of this Chapter is a misdemeanor and is subject to penalties provided for such
violations under provision of Chapter 901 of this Code.
403.09. EFFECTIVE DATE
This ordinance shall be effective from, and after its adoption and publication as provided by City
Charter.

available to the City for noncompliance with this section. Given the remedy outlined in this
Chapter 404.3.4 available to the City for noncompliance by the Company, the City hereby
waives any requirement for the Company to post a construction performance bond, certificate of

underground sewer and water mains and service connections to the property line abutting the
streets prior to a permanent paving or resurfacing of such streets, and the Company’s main is
located under such street, the City may require the Company to install gas service connections

Fridley City Code Section 404.04.3.
404.04. RELOCATIONS.
1. Relocation of Gas Facilities in Public Ways.
If the city determines by the property exercise of its police power to vacate a Public Way for a
City improvement project, or to grade, re-grade or change the alignment of an Public way, or
construct or reconstruct any City Utility System in any Public Way, the City may order the
Company to relocate its Gas Facilities at the Company’s expense. The City must give the
Company sufficient notice of plans to vacate for a City improvement project, or to grade, regrade,
or change the alignment of any Public way or to construct or reconstruct any City Utility
System. If a relocation is ordered within five (5) years of a prior relocation of the same Gas
Facilities, which was made at Company expense, the City will reimburse the Company on a time
and material basis for Non-Betterment Costs. If any subsequent relocation is required because of
the extension of a City Utility System to a previously unserved area, the City may require the
Company to make the subsequent relocation at the Company’s expense. Nothing in this Chapter
requires the Company to relocate, remove, replace or reconnect its Facilities at the Company’s
expense where such relocation, removal, replacement or reconstruction is solely for the
convenience of the city and is not reasonably necessary for the construction or reconstruction of
a Public Way or City Utility System or other City improvement. The City will not require the
removal of abandoned natural gas facilities, unless these facilities are in direct conflict with a
Public Way grade change or proposed City Utility System or City improvement. The provisions
of this section 4.1 apply only to Gas Facilities constructed in reliance on this franchise and the
Company does not waive its rights under an easement in the Public Way.
2. Relocation of Gas Facilities in Public Ground.
The City may, by the proper exercise of its police power, require the Company to relocate the
Gas Facilities within or remove the gas Facilities from Public Ground upon a finding by City that
the Gas Facilities have become or will become a substantial impairment of the public use or
enjoyment to which the Public Ground is or will be put. The relocation or removal will be at the
Company’s expense. The provisions of this Chapter 4.2 apply only to Gas Facilities constructed
in reliance on this franchise and the Company does not waive its rights under an easement or
prescriptive right in the Public Ground. The City will not require the removal of abandoned Gas
Facilities in Public Ground, unless these facilities have become or will become a substantial
impairment of the public use or enjoyment to which the Public Ground is or will be put.
3. Vacation of Public Ways.
The City must give the Company at least three weeks Notice of the proposed vacation of a Public
Way. Except where required for a City street or other improvement project or as otherwise
provided in Chapter 4.1, the Vacation of a Public Way, after the installation of Gas Facilities,
does not deprive the Company of its rights to operate and maintain the Gas Facilities until the
reasonable cost of relocating the same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation
are first paid to the Company by the City. If the vacation of Public way does not require the
relocation of existing Gas Facilities, the City shall reserve a utility easement to the Company,
created by and within the document establishing the vacation, or the City will preserve a right-ofway
in the manner permitted by law.
Fridley City Code Section 404.06.
4. Projects with Federal Funding.
Relocation, removal or rearrangement of any Gas Facilities made necessary because of the
extension into or through the City of a federally-aided highway project shall be governed by the
provisions of Minnesota Statutes, Section 161.46.
404.05. DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION.
1. Terms.
The Company shall indemnify, keep and hold the City, its elected officials, officers, employees,
and agents free and harmless from any and all claims and actions on account of injury or death of
persons or damage to property occasioned by the construction, maintenance, repair, or removal
of Gas Facilities on or across the Public Way and the Public Ground of the City, unless or
operation of the Company's property located in, on, over, under, or across the Public Ground of
the Municipality, unless such injury or damage is the result of the negligence of the City, its
elected officials, employees, officers, or agents. The City shall not be entitled to reimbursement
for its costs incurred prior to notification to the Company of claims or actions and a reasonable
opportunity for the Company to accept and undertake the defense.
2. Litigation.
If such a suit is brought against the City under circumstances where the agreement in this Section
5 as to indemnify applies, the Company, at its sole cost and expense, shall defend the City in
such suit if Notice thereof is promptly given to the Company within a reasonable period. If the
Company is required to indemnify and defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation,
but the Company may not settle such litigation without the consent of the City, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld. This section is not as to third parties a waiver of any defense
or immunity otherwise available to the City; and the Company, in defending any action on behalf
of the City is entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert
in its own behalf.
404.06. SUCCESSORS IN INTEREST

City has the authority to require a franchise fee or impose a tax. The Company may petition the
City to exempt the franchise fee applicable to customers who (i) physically bypass or (ii)
unequivocally document in writing their intention and ability to physically bypass the
Company’s Gas Facilities for economic reasons, including the existence of a franchise fee The
City shall not unreasonably without such exemption in franchise fees for such customers.

The City may impose the franchise fee: (i) as a combination of percentage of gross revenues
received from customers in the Residential Customer Class for its utility operations within the
City and as a flat meter fee per customer, for customers in non-residential customer classes, or

method (iii), as a way of collecting fees. If the percentage of gross revenue method (I) has
previously been implemented, it must be changed to method (ii) or method (iii).

The franchise fee will be payable not less than quarterly and based on any of the alternative
formulas described in Chapter 407.3 during complete billing months of the period for which
payment is to be made. The franchise fee formula may be changed by ordinance from time to
time, however, each change must meet the same notice requirements and may not be made more
often than annually. The fee may not exceed any amount that the Company may legally charge
to its customers, prior to payment to the City, by imposing a surcharge equivalent to such fee in
its rates of gas service. The Company may pay the City the fee based upon the surcharge billed,
subject to subsequent reductions for uncollectibles or customer refunds. The Company agrees to
make available for inspection by the City at reasonable times all records necessary to audit the
company’s determination of the franchise fee payments
404.08. LIMITATION ON APPLICABILITY.

provision of this franchise inures to the benefit of any third person, including the public at large,
so as to constitute any such person as a third-party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or
more of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action for any person not a party
hereto.

and to help achieve a continued advanced and modern System, the following evaluation
provisions will apply:
A. The City reserves the right to adopt rules and regulations controlling the
procedures as set forth below and the subjects for Evaluation and Renegotiation Sessions.
In the absence of any City action taken to exercise these rights, Grantee shall be subject
to at least the procedures and subjects described in this section.
B. The City may require, at its sole discretion, evaluation sessions at any time during
the term of this Franchise; provided, however, there shall not be more than one evaluation
session during any calendar year. At a minimum, such evaluation sessions shall be
conducted by the City within thirty (30) days of the fifth (5th) and tenth (10th)
anniversary dates of the acceptance of this Franchise.
C. Topics which may be discussed at any evaluation and session include, but are not
limited to, channel capacity, the System performance, programming, access, municipal
uses of cable, Subscriber complaints, judicial rulings, FCC rulings and any other topics
the City or Grantee deem relevant.
D. During an evaluation session, Grantee shall fully cooperate with the City and shall
provide without cost such information and documents as the City may request to perform
the evaluation.
E. If at any time during its evaluation, the City determines that reasonable evidence
exists of inadequate System performance, the City may require Grantee to perform tests
and analysis directed toward such suspected inadequacies at Grantee's expense. Grantee
shall fully cooperate with the City in performing such testing and any report prepared by
Grantee shall include at least:
Fridley City Code 405A.09.2.
(1) A description of the problem in the System performance which
precipitated the special tests.
(2) The System component tested.
(3) The equipment used and procedures employed in testing.
(4) The method, if any, by which such System performance problem was
resolved.
(5) Any other information pertinent to said tests and analysis which may be
required by the City, or determined when the test is performed.
If after receiving Grantee's report the City determines that reasonable evidence still exists
of inadequate System performance, the City may enlist an independent engineer, to
perform tests and analysis directed toward such suspected inadequacies. The expense of
such testing shall be subject to those provisions set forth at 405A.05(7) hereof.
F. As a result of an Evaluation and Renegotiation Session, the City or Grantee may
determine that a change in the terms of the Franchise may be required, that the System or
Franchise requirements should be updated, changed or that additional services should be
provided. If the change is consistent with the terms of this Franchise, the needs of the
City and existing state-of-the-art (or due to regulatory, technical, financial, marketing,
inflation or legal requirements) and implementation of a change would not unreasonably
add to the cost of providing Cable Services, Grantee and the City will, in good faith,
negotiate the terms of the change and any required amendment to this Franchise. Upon
adoption of such a Franchise amendment, if one is required, the change will become
effective and Grantee shall accept the same. In the event Grantee fails to negotiate a
requested change of the City, the City may enforce the procedures of this section by any
available remedy.

(1) A Subscriber requests total disconnection from the System; or
(2) A Subscriber requests the downgrade within a thirty (30) day period
following any rate increase relative to the service in question.
B. If a Subscriber requests disconnection from service prior to the effective date of
an increase in rates, the Subscriber shall not be charged the increased rate if Grantee fails

405A.10. GENERAL FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE PROVISIONS
1. Payment to City.
A. Grantee shall pay to the City an annual amount equal to five percent (5%) of its
Gross Revenues. The foregoing payment shall be compensation for use of Streets and
other public property.
B. Payments due the City under this provision shall be computed at the end of each
quarter year for that quarter year. Payments shall be due and payable for each quarter or
a portion of a quarter year within thirty (30) days thereof. Each payment shall be
accompanied by a brief report showing the basis for the computation and such other
relevant facts as may be required by the City.
C. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a
release of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable under the
provisions of this Franchise. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and
recomputation by the City.
D. The Grantee shall provide the City with an annual written statement of the Gross
Revenues for the preceding year, certified by an officer of the Grantee. This statement
shall be used to determine the exact amount of payments due the City and to correct any
overpayments or underpayments by Grantee.
E. In the event any payment is not made on the due date, interest on the amount due
shall accrue from such date at the annual rate of one hundred twenty five percent (125%)
of the lowest prime commercial lending rate established by any bank in the City at the
time the delinquency occurs.
F. For purposes of determining gross revenues under Section 405A.10.1A from any
subscriber who has been provided “bundled services,” including telephony, internet
connection services, cable television services and other services that Grantee may
provide, Grantee, subject to applicable state or federal law, shall not discount the cable
television portion of gross revenues from these “bundled services” at a higher rate than it
uses for any of the other services included in the subscriber’s bundle.
G. Equipment Grant. Upon adoption of this Franchise, Grantee shall immediately
pay to the City the amount of $450,000.00 (four hundred fifty thousand dollars) which
shall be used by the City solely and exclusively for the purpose of maintenance of
equipment, leasing and purchase of equipment for PEG access purposes. “Equipment”
shall include projection equipment, monitors, screens and all cable television equipment
necessary to produce, edit and broadcast City Council and other public meetings.
Fridley City Code 405A.10.2.D.
H. The City shall segregate the equipment grant into a separate fund. The equipment
grant may only be used for those purposes outlined in paragraph (G) above. The City
shall take reasonable steps to insure that the City’s annual audit will include a review for
compliance with the requirements associated with the equipment grant.
I. The Franchisee shall have the right to obtain a copy of the City’s annual
independent audit of fund accounts to verify that any monies expended under this grant in
any given year were for the purposes stated herein. The Franchisee may at any time and
its own expense, conduct its own independent audit of City accounts to verify that any
funds spent by the City from this grant were spent for the intended purposes as stated
herein. Any equipment purchased by the City with equipment grant money remains the
exclusive property of the City.
J. In the event that the equipment grant is used for purposes inconsistent with
paragraph (G) above, the Franchisee may pursue any and all available remedies.
2. Performance Bond.
A. At the time this Franchise is accepted, Grantee shall deliver to the City a
performance bond in the amount of Twenty-Five Thousand ($25,000.00) dollars as a
common security for the faithful performance by it of all the provisions of this Franchise
and compliance with all orders, permits and directions the City and the payment by
Grantee of any claim, liens and taxes due the City which arise by reason of the
construction, operation or maintenance of the System. The bond shall be subject to the
approval of the City and shall contain the following endorsement:
“It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be cancelled without
sixty (60) days prior written notice to the City by registered mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice of intent to cancel or not to renew.”
B. Provision shall be made to permit the City to withdraw funds from the
performance bond. Grantee shall not use the performance bond for other purposes and
shall not assign, pledge or otherwise use this performance bond as security for any
purpose. The City reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reduce the required amount
of the performance bond.
C. Within thirty (30) days after notice to it that any amount has been withdrawn by
the City from the performance bond pursuant to (A) of this section, Grantee restores the
performance bond to the required amount.
D. If Grantee fails to pay to the City any taxes due and unpaid; or, fails to repay to
the City, any damages, costs or expenses which the City shall be compelled to pay by
reason of any act or default of the Grantee in connection with this Franchise; or fails,
after thirty (30) days notice of such failure by the City to comply with any provision of
the Franchise which the City reasonably determines can be remedied by an expenditure
Fridley City Code 405A.10.4.A.(1)
of the performance bond, the City may then seek to withdraw such funds from the
performance bond.
3. Penalties from Performance Bond.
In addition to any other remedies provided herein, penalties for violations of this Franchise are
set forth below. As a result of any acts or omissions by Grantee pursuant to the Franchise, the
City may charge to and collect from the performance bond the following penalties:
A. For failure to provide data, documents, reports or information or to cooperate or
participate with the City during a renewal process or the System review, the penalty shall
be Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) per day.
B. For failure to comply with any provision of this Franchise, for which a penalty is
not otherwise specifically provided, the penalty shall be One Hundred Dollars ($100.00)
per day.
C. For failure to test, analyze and report on the performance of the System following
a request by the City the penalty shall be Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) per day.

standards, the penalty shall be Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) per day.
E. For failure to comply with all conditions of the City permits to disturb streets,
repair streets, or other terms or conditions of the City, the penalty shall be Two Hundred
Dollars ($200.00) per day.
4. Procedure for Imposition of Penalties.
A. Whenever the City finds that Grantee has allegedly violated one (1) or more
terms, conditions or provisions of this Franchise, a written notice shall be given to
Grantee. The written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the alleged violation so as
to afford Grantee an opportunity to remedy the violation. Grantee shall have thirty (30)
days subsequent to receipt of the notice in which to correct the violation before the City
may resort to the performance bond. Grantee may, within ten (10) business days of
receipt of notice, notify the City that there is a dispute as to whether a violation or failure
has, in fact, occurred. Such notice by Grantee to the City shall specify with particularity
the matters disputed by Grantee and shall stay the running of the above-described time.
(1) The City shall hear Grantee's dispute at a regularly or specially scheduled
Council meeting. Grantee shall have the right to subpoena and crossexamine
witnesses. The City shall determine if Grantee has committed a
violation and shall make written findings of fact relative to its
determination. If a violation is found, Grantee may petition for
reconsideration.
Fridley City Code 405A.10.5.B.(1)
(2) If after hearing the dispute the claim is upheld by the City, Grantee shall
have thirty (30) days from such a determination to remedy the violation or
failure, before the City may require payment of all penalties due.
B. The time for Grantee to correct any alleged violation shall be extended by the City
if the necessary action to correct the alleged violation is of such a nature or character to
require more than thirty (30) days within which to perform provided Grantee commences
the corrective action within the fifteen (15) day period and thereafter uses reasonable
diligence, as determined by the City, to correct the violation.
C. The performance bond deposited pursuant to this Section shall become the
property of the City in the event that the Franchise is cancelled by reason of the default of
Grantee or revoked for cause. Grantee, however, shall be entitled to the return of such
performance bond, or portion thereof, as remains on file with the City at the expiration of
the term of the Franchise.
D. The rights reserved to the City with respect to the performance bond are in
addition to all other rights of the City whether reserved by this Franchise or authorized by
law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such performance
bond shall affect any other right the City may have.
E. The City shall stay or waive the imposition of any penalties set forth above upon a
finding that any failure or delay is a result of an act of God or due to circumstances
beyond the reasonable control of Grantee.
5. Damages and Defense.
A. Grantee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City for all damages and
penalties, at all times during the term of this Franchise, as a result of Grantee's exercise of
this Franchise. These damages and penalties shall include, but shall not be limited to,
damages arising out of personal injury, property damage, copyright infringement,
defamation, antitrust, errors and omission, theft, fire, and all other damages arising out of
Grantee's exercise of this Franchise, whether or not any act or omission complained of is
authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Franchise; such indemnification shall include,
but not be limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and costs. Grantee’s obligations
hereunder shall not extend to any claims or loss arising from the City’s negligence or
willful misconduct.
B. In order for the City to assert its rights to be indemnified, defended, and held
harmless, the City must:
(1) Promptly notify Grantee of any claim or legal proceeding which gives rise
to such right;
Fridley City Code 405A.10.6.C.
(2) Afford Grantee the opportunity to participate in and fully control any
compromise, settlement or other resolution or disposition of such claim or
proceeding; unless, however, the City, in its sole discretion, determines
that its interests can not be represented in good faith by Grantee; and
(3) Fully cooperate with the reasonable requests of Grantee, at Grantee's
expense, in its participation in, and control, compromise, settlement or
resolution or other disposition of such claim or proceeding subject to
paragraph (2) above.
(4) In the event the City, in its sole discretion, determines that its interests
cannot be represented in good faith by Grantee, Grantee shall pay all
expenses incurred by the City in defending itself with regard to all
damages and penalties mentioned in paragraph A above. These expenses
shall include all out of pocket expenses, such as attorney’s fees and costs.
6. Liability Insurance.
A. Grantee shall maintain, throughout the term of the Franchise, liability insurance
with a company licensed to do business in the State of Minnesota with a rating by Best of
not less than A-, insuring Grantee and the City with regard to all damages mentioned in

(1) person;
(2) Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) for claims resulting from any one
occurrence;
(3) Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) for all other types of liability.
B. At the time of acceptance, Grantee shall furnish to the City a certificate
evidencing that a satisfactory insurance policy has been obtained. Such insurance policy
shall require that the City be notified thirty (30) days prior to any expiration or
cancellation.
C. All insurance policies maintained pursuant to this Section 405A.10 shall contain
the following or similar endorsement:
“It is hereby understood and agreed that this insurance policy may not be canceled
by the surety, nor may the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until
thirty (30) days after receipt by the City of Fridley, Minnesota, by registered mail,
of a written notice of such intention to cancel or renew.”
Fridley City Code 405A.10.8.C.
7. City's Right to Revoke.
In addition to all other rights which the City has pursuant to law or equity, the City reserves the
right to revoke, terminate or cancel this Franchise, and all rights and privileges pertaining
thereto, in the event that:
A. Grantee substantially violates any material provision of this Franchise; or
B. Grantee attempts to evade any of the material provisions of the Franchise; or
C. Grantee practices any fraud or deceit upon the City or Subscriber; or
D. Grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts, or is adjudged a
bankrupt; or
E. Grantee materially misrepresents a fact in the application for or negotiation of, or
renegotiation of, or renewal of, the Franchise.
8. Revocation Procedures.
In the event that the City determines that Grantee has violated any provision of the Franchise, the
City may make a written demand on Grantee that it remedy such violation and that continued
violation may be cause for revocation. If the violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect is not
remedied to the satisfaction of the City within thirty (30) days following such demand, the City
shall determine whether or not such violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect by Grantee is
due to acts of God or other causes which result from circumstances beyond Grantee's control.
A. A public hearing shall be held and Grantee shall be provided with an opportunity
to be heard upon fourteen (14) days written notice to Grantee of the time and the place of
the hearing. The causes for pending revocation and the reasons alleged to constitute such
cause shall be recited in the notice. Said notice shall affirmatively recite the causes that
need to be shown by the City to support a revocation.
B. If notice is given and, at Grantee's option, after a full public proceeding is held,
the City determines there is a violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect by Grantee, the
City shall direct Grantee to correct or remedy the same within such additional time, in
such manner and upon such terms and conditions as City may direct.
C. If after a public hearing it is determined that Grantee's performance of any of the
terms, conditions, obligations, or requirements of Franchise was prevented or impaired
due to any cause beyond its reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable, such
inability to perform shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be
imposed as a result thereof, provided Grantee has notified City in writing within thirty
(30) days of its discovery of the occurrence of such an event. Such causes beyond
Grantee's reasonable control or not reasonably foreseeable shall include, but shall not be
limited to, acts of God, civil emergencies and labor strikes.
Fridley City Code 405A.11.2.B.
D. If, after notice is given and, at Grantee's option, a full public proceeding is held,
the City determines there was a violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect, then the City
may declare, by resolution, the Franchise revoked and cancelled and of no further force
and effect unless there is compliance within such period as City may fix, such period not
to be less than thirty (30) days, provided no opportunity for compliance need be granted
for fraud, misrepresentation, or violation of privacy rights.
E. The issue of revocation shall automatically be placed upon the City Council
agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance. The City then may
terminate Franchise forthwith upon finding that Grantee has failed to achieve compliance
or may further extend the period, in its discretion.
F. If the City, after notice is given and, at Grantee's option, a full public proceeding
is held and appeal is exhausted, declares the Franchise breached, the parties may pursue
their remedies pursuant to Franchise or any other remedy, legal or equitable.
405A.11. FORECLOSURE, RECEIVERSHIP AND ABANDONMENT
1. Foreclosure.
Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of the System, Grantee shall promptly notify the City
of such fact and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of
Grantee has taken place, and the provisions of this Franchise governing the consent to transfer or
change in ownership shall apply without regard to how such transfer or change in ownership
occurred.
2. Receivership.
The City shall have the right to cancel this Franchise subject to any applicable provisions of
Minnesota law, including the Bankruptcy Act, one hundred and twenty (120) days after the
appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of Grantee, whether in
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership
or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred twenty (120)
days, or unless:
A. Within one hundred twenty (120) days after his election or appointment, such
receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of this Franchise and
remedied all defaults thereunder; and
B. Such receiver or trustee, within said one hundred twenty (120) days, shall have

compensating the City for damages resulting from the abandonment.

1. Removal After Revocation or Expiration.
A. At the expiration of the term (and denial of any renewal) for which the Franchise
is granted, or upon its revocation, as provided for, the City shall have the right to require
Grantee to remove, at Grantee's expense, all or any portion of the System from all Streets
and public property within the City. In so removing the System, Grantee shall refill the
compact at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made and shall leave all streets,
public property and private property in as good a condition as that prevailing prior to
Grantee's removal of the System, and without affecting, altering or disturbing in any way
electric, telephone or utility, cables, wires or attachments. The City, or its delegate, shall
have the right to inspect and approve the condition of such Streets and Public Property
after removal. The performance bond, insurance, indemnity and penalty provision of the
Franchise shall remain in full force and effect during the entire term of removal.
B. If Grantee has failed to commence removal of the System, or such part thereof as
was designated within thirty (30) days after written notice of the City's demand for
removal is given, or if Grantee has failed to complete such removal within one (1) year
after written notice of the City's demand for removal is given, the City shall have the
right to exercise one of the following options:
(1) Declare all right, title and interest to the System to be in the City or its
delegate with all rights of ownership including, but not limited to, the right
to operate the System or transfer the System to another for operation by it;
or
(2) Declare the System abandoned and cause the System, or such part thereof
as the City shall designate, to be removed at no cost to the City. The cost
of said removal shall be recoverable from the performance bond,
indemnity and penalty section provided for in the Franchise, or from
Grantee directly.
2. Sale or Transfer of Franchise.
A. This Franchise shall not be sold, assigned or transferred, in whole or in part, or
leased or sublet in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable, or any
right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any Person without full compliance
with the procedure set forth in this Section.
Fridley City Code 405A.12.2.D.
B. The provisions of this Section shall only apply to the sale or transfer of all or a

controlling interest. The term “controlling interest” as used herein is not limited to
majority stock ownership, but includes actual working control in whatever manner
exercised.
(1) The parties to the sale or transfer shall make a written request to the City
for its approval of a sale or transfer.
(2) The City shall then make a determination pursuant to this Franchise as to
the exercise of its first right of refusal to purchase the System.

hearing is necessary due to potential adverse effect on Grantee's
Subscribers.

such hearing shall be commenced within thirty (30) days of such
determination and notice of any such hearing shall be given fourteen (14)
days prior to the hearing by publishing notice thereof. The notice shall

copy of the deed, agreement, mortgage, lease or other written instrument
evidencing such sale, transfer of ownership or control or lease, certified
and sworn to as correct by the Grantee.
C. In reviewing a request for sale or transfer pursuant to paragraph (A) above, the
City may inquire into the legal, technical and financial qualifications of the prospective
controlling party, including the adequacy of the support for local programming and
Grantee shall assist the City in so inquiring. The City may condition said transfer upon
such terms and conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate; provided, however, the
City shall not unreasonably withhold its approval. In no event shall a transfer of the
Franchise be approved without the transferee becoming a signatory to this Franchise.
D. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no consent of the City shall be required
for the transfer or assignment of the Franchise to any Person controlling, controlled by or
under the same common control as Grantee.

receipt from Grantee of a copy of written bona fide offer.

Exhibit A
Subpart K-Technical Standards
47CFR (76.601 to 76.617)
§ 76.601 Performance tests.
(a) The operator of each cable television system shall be responsible for insuring that each
such system is designed, installed, and operated in a manner that fully complies with the
provisions of this subpart.
(b) The operator of each cable television system shall conduct complete performance tests of
that system at least twice each calendar year (at intervals not to exceed seven months),
unless otherwise noted below. The performance tests shall be directed at determining the
extent to which the system complies with all the technical standards set forth in §76.605(a)
and shall be as follows:
(1) For cable television systems with 1000 or more subscribers but with 12,500 or fewer subscribers,
proof-of-performance tests conducted pursuant to this section shall include measurements taken
at six (6) widely separated points. However, within each cable system, one additional test point
shall be added for every additional 12,500 subscribers or fraction thereof (e.g., 7 test points if
12,501 to 25,000 subscribers; 8 test points if 25,001 to 37,500 subscribers, etc.). In addition, for
technically integrated portions of cable systems that are not mechanically continuous (i.e.,
employing microwave connections), at least one test point will be required for each portion of the
cable system served by a technically integrated microwave hub. The proof-of-performance test
points chosen shall be balanced to represent all geographic areas served by the cable system. At
least one third of the test points shall be representative of subscriber terminals most distant from
the system input and from each microwave receiver (if microwave transmissions are employed),
in terms of cable length. The measurements may be taken at convenient monitoring points in the
cable network: Provided, that data shall be included to relate the measured performance of the
system as would be viewed from a nearby subscriber terminal. An identification of the
instruments, including the makes, model numbers, and the most recent date of calibration, a
description of the procedures utilized, and a statement of the qualifications of the person
performing the tests shall also be included.
(2) Proof-of-performance tests to determine the extent to which a cable television system complies
with the standards set forth in §76.605(a) (3), (4), and (5) shall be made on each of the NTSC or
similar video channels of that system. Unless otherwise as noted, proof-of-performance tests for
all other standards in §76.605(a) shall be made on a minimum of four (4) channels plus one
additional channel for every 100 MHz, or fraction thereof, of cable distribution system upper
frequency limit (e.g., 5 channels for cable television systems with a cable distribution system
upper frequency limit of 101 to 216 MHz; 6 channels for cable television systems with a cable
distribution system upper frequency limit of 217–300 MHz; 7 channels for cable television
systems with a cable distribution upper frequency limit to 300 to 400 MHz, etc.). The channels
selected for testing must be representative of all the channels within the cable television system.
(3) The operator of each cable television system shall conduct semi-annual proof-of performance
tests of that system, to determine the extent to which the system complies with the technical
standards set forth in §76.605(a)(4) as follows. The visual signal level on each channel shall be
measured and recorded, along with the date and time of the measurement, once every six hours
(at intervals of not less than five hours or no more than seven hours after the previous
measurement), to include the warmest and the coldest times, during a 24-hour period in January
or February and in July or August.
Exhibit A Chapter 405
(4) The operator of each cable television system shall conduct triennial proof-of performance tests of
its system to determine the extent to which the system complies with the technical standards set
forth in §76.605(a)(11).
(c) Successful completion of the performance tests required by paragraph (b) of this section
does not relieve the system of the obligation to comply with all pertinent technical standards
at all subscriber terminals. Additional tests, repeat tests, or tests involving specified
subscriber terminals may be required by the Commission or the local franchiser to secure
compliance with the technical standards.
(d) The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply to any cable
television system having fewer than 1,000 subscribers: Provided, however, that any cable
television system using any frequency spectrum other than that allocated to over-the-air
television and FM broadcasting (as described in §§73.603 and 73.210 of this chapter) is
required to conduct all tests, measurements and monitoring of signal leakage that are
required by this subpart. A cable television system operator complying with the monitoring,
logging and the leakage repair requirements of §76.614, shall be considered to have met
the requirements of this paragraph. However, the leakage log shall be retained for five years
rather than the two years prescribed in §76.1706.
Note 1 to §76.601: Prior to requiring any additional testing pursuant to §76.601(c), the local franchising authority shall
notify the cable operator who will be allowed thirty days to come into compliance with any perceived signal quality
problems which need to be corrected. The Commission may request cable operators to test their systems at any time.
Note 2 to §76.601: Section 76.1717 contains recordkeeping requirements for each system operator in order to show
compliance with the technical rules of this subpart.
Note 3 to §76.601: Section 76.1704 contains recordkeeping requirements for proof of performance tests.

§ 76.605 Technical standards.
(a) The following requirements apply to the performance of a cable television system as
measured at any subscriber terminal with a matched impedance at the termination point or
at the output of the modulating or processing equipment (generally the headend) of the
cable television system or otherwise as noted. The requirements are applicable to each
NTSC or similar video downstream cable television channel in the system:
(1) The cable television channels delivered to the subscriber's terminal shall be capable of being
received and displayed by TV broadcast receivers used for off-the-air reception of TV broadcast
signals, as authorized under part 73 of this chapter; and (ii) Cable television systems shall
transmit signals to subscriber premises equipment on frequencies in accordance with the channel
allocation plan set forth in CEA–542–B: “Standard: Cable Television Channel Identification Plan,”
(Incorporated by reference, see §76.602).
(2) The aural center frequency of the aural carrier must be 4.5 MHz ± 5 kHz above the frequency of
the visual carrier at the output of the modulating or processing equipment of a cable television
system, and at the subscriber terminal.
(3) The visual signal level, across a terminating impedance which correctly matches the internal
impedance of the cable system as viewed from the subscriber terminal, shall not be less than 1
millivolt across an internal impedance of 75 ohms (0 dBmV). Additionally, as measured at the end
of a 30 meter (100 foot) cable drop that is connected to the subscriber tap, it shall not be less
than 1.41 millivolts across an internal impedance of 75 ohms (+3 dBmV). (At other impedance
values, the minimum visual signal level, as viewed from the subscriber terminal, shall be the
square root of 0.0133 (Z) millivolts and, as measured at the end of a 30 meter (100 foot) cable
drop that is connected to the subscriber tap, shall be 2 times the square root of 0.00662(Z)
millivolts, where Z is the appropriate impedance value.)
Exhibit A Chapter 405
(4) The visual signal level on each channel, as measured at the end of a 30 meter cable drop that is
connected to the subscriber tap, shall not vary more than 8 decibels within any six-month interval,
which must include four tests performed in six-hour increments during a 24-hour period in July or
August and during a 24- hour period in January or February, and shall be maintained within:
(i) 3 decibels (dB) of the visual signal level of any visual carrier within a 6 MHz nominal
frequency separation;
(ii) 10 dB of the visual signal level on any other channel on a cable television system of up to
300 MHz of cable distribution system upper frequency limit, with a 1 dB increase for each
additional 100 MHz of cable distribution system upper frequency limit (e.g., 11 dB for a
system at 301–400 MHz; 12 dB for a system at 401–500 MHz, etc.); and
(iii) A maximum level such that signal degradation due to overload in the subscriber's receiver or
terminal does not occur.
(5) The rms voltage of the aural signal shall be maintained between 10 and 17 decibels below the
associated visual signal level. This requirement must be met both at the subscriber terminal and at
the output of the modulating and processing equipment (generally the headend). For subscriber
terminals that use equipment which modulate and re-modulate the signal (e.g., baseband
converters), the rms voltage of the aural signal shall be maintained between 6.5 and 17 decibels
below the associated visual signal level at the subscriber terminal.
(6) The amplitude characteristic shall be within a range of ±2 decibels from 0.75 MHz to 5.0 MHz
above the lower boundary frequency of the cable television channel, referenced to the average of
the highest and lowest amplitudes within these frequency boundaries. The amplitude characteristic
shall be measured at the subscriber terminal.
(7) The ratio of RF visual signal level to system noise shall not be less than 43 decibels. For class I
cable television channels, the requirements of this section are applicable only to:
(i) Each signal which is delivered by a cable television system to subscribers within the
predicted Grade B contour for that signal;
(ii) Each signal which is first picked up within its predicted Grade B contour;
(iii) Each signal that is first received by the cable television system by direct video feed from a TV
broadcast station, a low power TV station, or a TV translator station.
(8) The ratio of visual signal level to the rms amplitude of any coherent disturbances such as
intermodulation products, second and third order distortions or discrete-frequency interfering
signals not operating on proper offset assignments shall be as follows:
(i) The ratio of visual signal level to coherent disturbances shall not be less than 51 decibels for
noncoherent channel cable television systems, when measured with modulated carriers and
time averaged; and
(ii) The ratio of visual signal level to coherent disturbances which are frequency coincident with
the visual carrier shall not be less than 47 decibels for coherent channel cable systems, when
measured with modulated carriers and time averaged.
(9) The terminal isolation provided to each subscriber terminal:
(i) Shall not be less than 18 decibels. In lieu of periodic testing, the cable operator may use
specifications provided by the manufacturer for the terminal isolation equipment to meet this
standard; and
Exhibit A Chapter 405
(ii) Shall be sufficient to prevent reflections caused by open-circuited or short-circuited
subscriber terminals from producing visible picture impairments at any other subscriber
terminal.
(10) The peak-to-peak variation in visual signal level caused by undesired low frequency disturbances
(hum or repetitive transients) generated within the system, or by inadequate low frequency
response, shall not exceed 3 percent of the visual signal level. Measurements made on a single
channel using a single un-modulated carrier may be used to demonstrate compliance with this
parameter at each test location.
(11) As of June 30, 1995, the following requirements apply to the performance of the cable television
system as measured at the output of the modulating or processing equipment (generally the
headend) of the system:
(i) The chrominance-luminance delay inequality (or chroma delay), which is the change in delay
time of the chrominance component of the signal relative to the luminance component, shall
be within 170 nanoseconds.
(ii) The differential gain for the color sub-carrier of the television signal, which is measured as the
difference in amplitude between the largest and smallest segments of the chrominance signal
(divided by the largest and expressed in percent), shall not exceed ±20%.
(iii) The differential phase for the color sub-carrier of the television signal which is measured as
the largest phase difference in degrees between each segment of the chrominance signal
and reference segment (the segment at the blanking level of O IRE), shall not exceed ±10
degrees.
(12) As an exception to the general provision requiring measurements to be made at subscriber
terminals, and without regard to the type of signals carried by the cable television system, signal
leakage from a cable television system shall be measured in accordance with the procedures
outlined in §76.609(h) and shall be limited as follows:
Frequencies
Signal leakage
Limit Distance in
(micro-volt/meters)
Distant in
meters (m)
Less than and including 54 MHz, and over 216 MHz 15 30
Over 54 MHz up to and including 216MHz 20 3
(b) Cable television systems distributing signals by using methods such as nonconventional
coaxial cable techniques, non-coaxial copper cable techniques, specialized coaxial cable
and fiber optical cable hybridization techniques or specialized compression techniques or
specialized receiving devices, and which, because of their basic design, cannot comply with
one or more of the technical standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, may be
permitted to operate: Provided, That an adequate showing is made pursuant to §76.7 which
establishes that the public interest is benefited. In such instances, the Commission may
prescribe special technical requirements to ensure that subscribers to such systems are
provided with an equivalent level of good quality service.
Note 1: Local franchising authorities of systems serving fewer than 1000 subscribers may adopt standards less stringent
than those in §76.605(a). Any such agreement shall be reduced to writing and be associated with the system's proof-ofperformance
records.
Note 2: For systems serving rural areas as defined in §76.5, the system may negotiate with its local franchising authority
for standards less stringent than those in §§76.605(a)(3), 76.605(a)(7), 6.605(a)(8), 76.605(a)(10) and 76.605(a)(11). Any
such agreement shall be reduced to writing and be associated with the system's proof-of-performance records.
Exhibit A Chapter 405
Note 3: The requirements of this section shall not apply to devices subject to the TV interface device rules under part 15
of this chapter.
Note 4: Should subscriber complaints arise from a system failing to meet §76.605(a)(6) prior to December 30, 1999, the
cable operator will be required to provide a converter that will allow the system to meet the standard immediately at the
complaining subscriber's terminal. Further, should the problem be found to be system-wide, the Commission may order all
converters on the system be changed to meet the standard.
Note 5: Should subscriber complaints arise from a system failing to meet §76.605(a)(10), the cable operator will be
required to remedy the complaint and perform test measurements on §76.605(a)(10) containing the full number of
channels as indicated in §76.601(b)(2) at the complaining subscriber's terminal. Further, should the problem be found to
be system-wide, the
Commission may order that the full number of channels as indicated in §76.601(b)(2) be tested at all required locations for
future proof-of-performance tests.
Note 6: No State or franchising authority may prohibit, condition, or restrict a cable system's use of any type of subscriber
equipment or any transmission technology.

(b) As of July 1, 1993, the operator of each cable television system shall deliver intact closed
captioning data contained on line 21 of the vertical blanking interval, as it arrives at the
headend or from another origination source, to subscriber terminals and (when so delivered
to the cable system) in a format that can be recovered and displayed by decoders meeting
§15.119 of this chapter.

§ 76.609 Measurements.
(a) Measurements made to demonstrate conformity with the performance requirements set forth
in §§76.601 and 76.605 shall be made under conditions which reflect system performance
during normal operations, including the effect of any microwave relay operated in the Cable
Television Relay (CARS) Service intervening between pickup antenna and the cable
distribution network. Amplifiers shall be operated at normal gains, either by the insertion of
appropriate signals or by manual adjustment. Special signals inserted in a cable television
channel for measurement purposes should be operated at levels approximating those used
for normal operation. Pilot tones, auxiliary or substitute signals, and non-television signals
normally carried on the cable television system should be operated at normal levels to the
extent possible. Some exemplary, but not mandatory, measurement procedures are set
forth in this section.
(b) When it may be necessary to remove the television signal normally carried on a cable
television channel in order to facilitate a performance measurement, it will be permissible to
disconnect the antenna which serves the channel under measurement and to substitute
therefore a matching resistance termination. Other antennas and inputs should remain
connected and normal signal levels should be maintained on other channels.
Exhibit A Chapter 405
(c) As may be necessary to ensure satisfactory service to a subscriber, the Commission may
require additional tests to demonstrate system performance or may specify the use of
different test procedures.
(d) The frequency response of a cable television channel may be determined by one of the
following methods, as appropriate:
(1) By using a swept frequency or a manually variable signal generator at the sending end and a
calibrated attenuator and frequency-selective voltmeter at the subscriber terminal; or
(2) By using either a multi-burst generator or vertical interval test signals and either a modulator or
processor at the sending end, and by using either a demodulator and either an oscilloscope
display or a waveform monitor display at the subscriber terminal.
(e) System noise may be measured using a frequency-selective voltmeter (field strength meter)
which has been suitably calibrated to indicate rms noise or average power level and which
has a known bandwidth. With the system operating at normal level and with a properly
matched resistive termination substituted for the antenna, noise power indications at the
subscriber terminal are taken in successive increments of frequency equal to the bandwidth
of the frequency-selective voltmeter, summing the power indications to obtain the total noise
power present over a 4 MHz band centered within the cable television channel. If it is
established that the noise level is constant within this bandwidth, a single measurement may
be taken which is corrected by an appropriate factor representing the ratio of 4 MHz to the
noise bandwidth of the frequency-selective voltmeter. If an amplifier is inserted between the
frequency-selective voltmeter and the subscriber terminal in order to facilitate this
measurement, it should have a bandwidth of at least 4 MHz and appropriate corrections
must be made to account for its gain and noise figure. Alternatively, measurements made in
accordance with the NCTA Recommended Practices for Measurements on Cable Television
Systems, 2nd edition, November 1989, on noise measurement may be employed.
(f) The amplitude of discrete frequency interfering signals within a cable television channel may
be determined with either a spectrum analyzer or with a frequency-selective voltmeter (field
strength meter), which instruments have been calibrated for adequate accuracy. If
calibration accuracy is in doubt, measurements may be referenced to a calibrated signal
generator, or a calibrated variable attenuator, substituted at the point of measurement. If an
amplifier is used between the subscriber terminal and the measuring instrument, appropriate
corrections must be made to account for its gain.
(g) The terminal isolation between any two terminals in the cable television system may be
measured by applying a signal of known amplitude to one terminal and measuring the
amplitude of that signal at the other terminal. The frequency of the signal should be close to
the mid-frequency of the channel being tested. Measurements of terminal isolation are not
required when either:
(1) The manufacturer's specifications for subscriber tap isolation based on a representative sample
of no less than 500 subscribers taps or
(2) Laboratory tests performed by or for the operator of a cable television system on a representative
sample of no less than 50 subscriber taps, indicates that the terminal isolation standard of
§76.605(a)(9) is met. To demonstrate compliance with §76.605(a)(9), the operator of a cable
television system shall attach either such manufacturer's specifications or laboratory
measurements as an exhibit to each proof-of-performance record.
Exhibit A Chapter 405
(h) Measurements to determine the field strength of the signal leakage emanated by the cable
television system shall be made in accordance with standard engineering procedures.
Measurements made on frequencies above 25 MHz shall include the following:
(1) A field strength meter of adequate accuracy using a horizontal dipole antenna shall be employed.
(2) Field strength shall be expressed in terms of the rms value of synchronizing peak for each cable
television channel for which signal leakage can be measured.
(3) The resonant half wave dipole antenna shall be placed 3 meters from and positioned directly
below the system components and at 3 meters above ground. Where such placement results in a
separation of less than 3 meters between the center of the dipole antenna and the system
components, or less than 3 meters between the dipole and ground level, the dipole shall be
repositioned to provide a separation of 3 meters from the system components at a height of 3
meters or more above ground.
(4) The horizontal dipole antenna shall be rotated about a vertical axis and the maximum meter
reading shall be used.
(5) Measurements shall be made where other conductors are 3 or more meters (10 or more feet)
away from the measuring antenna.
(i) For systems using cable traps and filters to control the delivery of specific channels to the
subscriber terminal, measurements made to determine compliance with §76.605(a) (5) and
(6) may be performed at the location immediately prior to the trap or filter for the specific
channel. The effects of these traps or filters, as certified by the system engineer or the
equipment manufacturer, must be attached to each proof-of-performance record.
(j) Measurements made to determine the differential gain, differential phase and the
chrominance-luminance delay inequality (chroma delay) shall be made in accordance with
the NCTA Recommended Practices for Measurements on Cable Television Systems, 2nd
edition, November 1989, on these parameters.

§ 76.611 Cable television basic signal leakage performance criteria.
(a) No cable television system shall commence or provide service in the frequency bands 108-
137 and 225–400 MHz unless such systems is in compliance with one of the following cable
television basic signal leakage performance criteria:
Exhibit A Chapter 405
(1) prior to carriage of signals in the aeronautical radio bands and at least once each calendar year,
with no more than 12 months between successive tests thereafter, based on a sampling of at
least 75% of the cable strand, and including any portion of the cable system which are known to
have or can reasonably be expected to have less leakage integrity than the average of the
system, the cable operator demonstrates compliance with a cumulative signal leakage index by
showing either that
(i) 10log I3000 is equal to or less than -7 or
(ii) 10log I00 is equal to or less than 64, using one of the following formula:

---,
i
ri is the distance (in meters) between the leakage source and the center of the cable
television system;
T is the fraction of the system cable length actually examined for leakage sources and is
equal to the strand kilometers (strand miles) of plant tested divided by the total strand
kilometers (strand miles) in the plant;
Ri is the slant height distance (in meters) from leakage source i to a point 3000 meters above
the center of the cable television system;
Ei is the electric field strength in microvolts per meter (ìV/m) measured pursuant to
§76.609(h) 3 meters from the leak i; and n is the number of leaks found of field strength equal
to or greater than 50 ìV/m pursuant to Section 76.609(h).
The sum is carried over all leaks i detected in the cable examined; or
(2) prior to carriage of signals in the aeronautical radio bands and at least once each calendar year,
with no more than 12 months between successive tests thereafter, the cable operator
demonstrates by measurement in the airspace that at no point does the field strength generated
by the cable system exceed 10 microvolts per meter (ìV/m) RMS at an altitude of 450 meters
above the average terrain of the cable system. The measurement system (including the receiving
antenna) shall be calibrated against a known field of 10 ìV/m RMS produced by a well
characterized antenna consisting of orthogonal resonant dipoles, both parallel to and one quarter
wavelength above the ground plane of a diameter of two meters or more at ground level. The
dipoles shall have centers collocated and be excited 90 degrees apart. The half-power bandwidth
of the detector shall be 25 kHz. If an aeronautical receiver is used for this purpose it shall meet
the standards of the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RCTA) for aeronautical
communications receivers. The aircraft antenna shall be horizontally polarized. Calibration shall
be made in the community unit or, if more than one, in any of the community units of the physical
system within a reasonable time period to performing the measurements. If data is recorded
digitally the 90th percentile level of points recorded over the cable system shall not exceed 10
ìV/m RMS; if analog recordings is used the peak values of the curves, when smoothed according
to good engineering practices, shall not exceed 10 ìV/m RMS.
(b) In paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section the un-modulated test signal used on the
cable plant shall:
(1) Be within the VHF aeronautical band 108–137 MHz or any other frequency in which the results
can be correlated to the VHF aeronautical band and
(2) have an average power level equal to the average power level of the strongest cable television
carrier on the system.
Exhibit A Chapter 405
(c) In paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section, if a modulated test signal is used, the test signal
and detector technique must, when considered together, yield the same result as though an
un-modulated test signal were used in conjunction with a detection technique which would
yield the RMS value of said un-modulated carrier.
(d) If a sampling of at least 75% of the cable strand (and including any portions of the cable
system which are known to have or can reasonably be expected to have less leakage
integrity than the average of the system) as described in paragraph (a)(1) cannot be
obtained by the cable operator or is otherwise not reasonably feasible, the cable operator
shall perform the airspace measurements described in paragraph (a)(2).
(e) Prior to providing service to any subscriber on a new section of cable plant, the operator
shall show compliance with either: (1) The basic signal leakage criteria in accordance with
paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section for the entire plant in operation or (2) a showing
shall be made indicating that no individual leak in the new section of the plant exceeds 20
ìV/m at 3 meters in accordance with §76.609 fo the Rules.
(f) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a cable operator shall be permitted to operate
on any frequency which is offset pursuant to §76.612 in the frequency band 108–137 MHz
for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the cable television basic signal leakage
performance criteria.

§ 76.612 Cable television frequency separation standards.
All cable television systems which operate in the frequency bands 108–137 and 225–400 MHz
shall comply with the following frequency separation standards:
(a) In the aeronautical radio-communication bands 118–137, 225–328.6 and 335.4–400 MHz,
the frequency of all carrier signals or signal components carried at an average power level
equalto or greater than 10- 4 watts in a 25 kHz bandwidth in any 160 microsecond period
must operate at frequencies offset from certain frequencies which may be used by
aeronautical radio services operated by Commission licensees or by the United States
Government or its Agencies. The aeronautical frequencies from which offsets must be
maintained are those frequencies which are within one of the aeronautical bands defined in
this subparagraph, and when expressed in MHz and divided by 0.025 yield an integer. The
offset must meet one of the following two criteria:
(1) All such cable carriers or signal components shall be offset by 12.5 kHz with a frequency
tolerance of ±5 kHz; or
(2) The fundamental frequency from which the visual carrier frequencies are derived by multiplication
by an integer number which shall be 6.0003 MHz with a tolerance of ±1 Hz (Harmonically Related
Carrier (HRC) comb generators only).
(b) In the aeronautical radio-navigation bands 108–118 and 328.6–335.4 MHz, the frequency of
all carrier signals or signal components carrier at an average power level equal to or greater
than 10- 4 watts in a 25 kHz bandwidth in any 160 microsecond period shall be offset by 25
kHz with a tolerance of ±5 kHz. The aeronautical radio-navigation frequencies from which
offsets must be maintained are defined as follows: (1) Within the aeronautical band 108–118
MHz when expressed in MHz and divided by 0.025 yield an even integer.
Exhibit A Chapter 405
(1) Within the band 328.6–335.4 MHz, the radio-navigation glide path channels are listed in Section
87.501 of the Rules.
Note: The HRC system, as described above, will meet this requirement in the 328.6–335.4 MHz navigation glide path
band. Those Incrementally Related Carriers (IRC) systems, with comb generator reference frequencies set at certain odd
multiples equal to or greater than 3 times the 0.0125 MHz aeronautical communications band offset, e.g. (6n + 1.250 ±
0.0375) MHz, may also meet the 25 kHz offset requirement in the navigation glide path band.

§ 76.613 Interference from a multi-channel video programming distributor (MVPD).
(a) Harmful interference is any emission, radiation or induction which endangers the functioning
of a radio navigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or
repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service operating in accordance with this
chapter.
(b) An MVPD that causes harmful interference shall promptly take appropriate measures to
eliminate the harmful interference.
(c) If harmful interference to radio communications involving the safety of life and protection of
property cannot be promptly eliminated by the application of suitable techniques, operation
of the offending MVPD or appropriate elements thereof shall immediately be suspended
upon notification by the District Director and/or Resident Agent of the Commission's local
field office, and shall not be resumed until the interference has been eliminated to the
satisfaction of the District Director and/or Resident Agent. When authorized by the District
Director and/or Resident Agent, short test operations may be made during the period of
suspended operation to check the efficacy of remedial measures.
(d) The MVPD may be required by the District Director and/or Resident Agent to prepare and
submit a report regarding the cause(s) of the interference, corrective measures planned or
taken, and the efficacy of the remedial measures.

Cable television operators transmitting carriers in the frequency bands 108–137 and 225–400
MHz shall provide for a program of regular monitoring for signal leakage by substantially
covering the plant every three months. The incorporation of this monitoring program into the
daily activities of existing service personnel in the discharge of their normal duties will generally
cover all portions of the system and will therefore meet this requirement. Monitoring equipment
and procedures utilized by a cable operator shall be adequate to detect a leakage source which
produces a field strength in these bands of 20 uV/m or greater at a distance of 3 meters. During
regular monitoring, any leakage source which produces a field strength of 20 uV/m or greater at
a distance of 3 meters in the aeronautical radio frequency bands shall be noted and such
leakage sources shall be repaired within a reasonable period of time.

§ 76.616 Operation near certain aeronautical and marine emergency radio frequencies.
(a) The transmission of carriers or other signal components capable of delivering peak power
levels equal to or greater than 10- 5 watts at any point in a cable television system is
Exhibit A Chapter 405
prohibited within 100 kHz of the frequency 121.5 MHz, and is prohibited within 50 kHz of the
two frequencies 156.8 MHz and 243.0 MHz.
(b) At any point on a cable system from 405.925 MHz to 406.176 MHz analog transmissions are
prohibited from delivering peak power levels equal to or greater than 10- 5 watts. The
transmission of digital signals in this range is limited to power levels measured using a
rootmean-square detector of less than 10- 5 watts in any 30 kHz bandwidth over any 2.5
millisecond interval.

§ 76.617 Responsibility for interference.
Interference resulting from the use of cable system terminal equipment (including subscriber
terminal, input selector switch and any other accessories) shall be the responsibility of the cable
system terminal equipment operator in accordance with the provisions of part 15 of this chapter:
provided, however, that the operator of a cable system to which the cable system terminal
equipment is connected shall be responsible for detecting and eliminating any signal leakage
where that leakage would cause interference outside the subscriber's premises and/or would
cause the cable system to exceed the Part 76 signal leakage requirements. In cases where
excessive signal leakage occurs, the cable operator shall be required only to discontinue
service to the subscriber until the problem is corrected.

CHAPTER 407. RIGHTS-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT
(Reference Ordinance No. 945, 1116, 1139, 1351)
407.01. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
1. To provide for the health, safety and well-being of its citizens, and to ensure the structural
integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the public rights-of-way, the City strives to
keep its public rights-of-way in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary
encumbrances. Although the general population bears the financial burden for the upkeep of
the public rights-of-way, a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its
public rights-of-way is frequent excavation by persons whose equipment or facilities are
located therein.
Public right-of-way obstruction is a source of frustration for merchants, business owners and
the general population which must avoid these obstructions or change travel or shopping
plans because of them and has a detrimental effect on commerce. Persons whose equipment
or facilities is located within the public right-of-way are the primary cause of these frequent
obstructions.
The City holds the public rights-of-way within its geographical boundaries as an asset in trust
for its citizens. The City and other public entities have invested millions of dollars in public
funds to build and maintain the public rights-of-way. It also recognizes that some persons, by
placing their equipment or facilities in the public right-of-way and charging the citizens of the
City for goods and services delivered thereby, are using this property held for the public
good. Although such services are often necessary or convenient for the citizens, such persons
receive revenue and/or profit through their use of public property.
As a result of all these intrusions in the public right-of-way, it is appropriate for the City to
establish a system of documenting what is placed in the public rights-of-way within its
municipal boundaries to inform its citizens and the other public entities of the equipment or
facilities that have been placed in the right-of-way that is held in trust for them.
2. In response to the foregoing facts, the City hereby enacts this Chapter of the City Code
relating to right-of-way permits and administration. This Chapter imposes reasonable
regulations on the placement and maintenance of facilities and equipment currently within
the City’s public rights-of-way or to be placed therein at some future time. It is intended to
complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies. Under this Chapter, persons
disturbing and obstructing the public rights-of-way will bear the financial responsibility for
their work. Finally, this Chapter provides for recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs
from persons using the public rights-of-way.
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.01.4
This Chapter shall be interpreted consistently with Minnesota Statutes, Sections 237.16,
237.162, 237.163, 237.79, 237.81 and 238.086 and the other laws governing applicable
rights of the City and users of the right-of-way. This Chapter shall also be interpreted
consistently with Minnesota Rules, Chapter 7819 where possible. To the extent any
provision of this Chapter cannot be interpreted consistently with the Minnesota Rules, that
interpretation most consistent with the Act and other applicable statutory and case law is
intended.
3. In addition to the foregoing recovery of costs and regulation of use, the City Council
determines that there is an existing and legitimate state and local public policy, which
authorizes the City to require payments as reimbursement or return to the public for the use
value of the public rights-of-way from those who obtain revenue or profits from such use.
This reimbursement is provided for and defined in this ordinance as the “user fee.” This fee
does not apply to the repair, replacement or reconstruction of an existing facility.
Telecommunication facilities are exempt from a user fee by state statute.
A. Public Interest and Welfare.
The City Council finds that it is in the public interest to provide for the payment of a
user fee by all persons who use and occupy the right-of-way for operating their
businesses. This provides equity by requiring all users of the public right-of-way to pay
compensation apportioned equally among them all for the value and benefit of using
such public right-of-way. To ensure such fair treatment, this Chapter exempts franchise
holders which pay franchise fees to the City on the date of adoption of this Chapter from
the payment of a user fee.
B. Not a Rate.
The City Council finds and determines that the user fee authorized by this Chapter is not
and is not intended to be a rate as that term is defined in Minnesota Statutes, Section
216B.02, Subd. 5. Such user fee is not a fee for a service that is provided to the
customer of a person using the public right-of-way, but is rather a fee paid for the right
of that person to operate in the public right-of-way, and to maintain the equipment in the
public right-of-way in the City of Fridley.
4. Pursuant to the authority granted to the City under state and federal statutory, administrative
and common law, the City hereby elects to manage rights of way within its jurisdiction.

3. Grant of Right; Payment of User Fee.
Any person required to register under Section 407.04, which occupies, uses, or places its
equipment in the public right-of-way but who is not a telecommunications right of way user
or a right of way user as defined by this Chapter and Minnesota Statutes Chapter 237, is
hereby granted a right to do so if and only so long as it (1) timely pays the user fee as

This section does not apply to a person who uses and occupies the right-of-way for operating
their business when there is a pre-existing franchise agreement between that person and the
City and the payment of a franchise fees, nor does it apply to the repair, replacement or
reconstruction of an existing facility.
The grant of such right is expressly conditioned on, and is subject to, continuing compliance
with all provisions of law, including this Chapter.
407.06. REPORTING OBLIGATIONS

4. Supplemental Provisions for Small Wireless Facility Permits
A. Small Wireless Facility Agreement.
A Small Wireless Facility shall only be collocated on a small wireless support structure
owned or controlled by the City, or any other City asset in the right-of-way, after the

a small wireless facility permit does not supersede, alter or affect any then-existing
agreement between the City and Applicant.
B. Deadline for Action
The City shall approve or deny a small wireless facility permit application within 90
days after filing of such application. The small wireless facility permit, and any
associated building permit application, shall be deemed approved if the City fails to

1. Timing.
The work to be done under the Excavation Permit, and the Patching or Restoration of the
Right-of-Way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit,
increased by as many days as work could not be done because of extraordinary
circumstances beyond the control of the Permittee or when work was prohibited as
unseasonal or unreasonable under Section 407.14.
2. Patch and Restoration.
Permittee shall Patch its own work. The City may choose either to have the Permittee
restore the Right-of-Way or to restore the pavement itself.
A. City Restoration.
If the City restores the pavement, Permittee shall pay the costs thereof within thirty (30)
days of billing. If, during the twenty-four (24) months following such Restoration, the
pavement settles due to Permittee’s improper backfilling, the Permittee shall pay to the
City, within thirty (30) days of billing, all costs associated with having to correct the
defective work.
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.11.4.
B. Permittee Restoration.

application for an Excavation Permit the posting of a Construction Performance Bond in
an amount determined by the City to be sufficient to cover the cost of Restoration in
accordance with the provisions of Minnesota Rules, Part 7819.3000. If, within twentyfour
(24) months after completion of the Restoration of the Right-of-Way, the City
determines that the Right-of-Way has been properly restored, the surety on the
Construction Performance Bond shall be released.
3. Standards.
The Permittee shall perform Excavation Patching and/or Restoration according to the
standards and with the materials specified by the City and shall comply with Minnesota
Rules, Part 7819.1100. The City shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent
of the Restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a caseby-
case basis.
Methods of restoration may include, but are not limited to, patching, replacement of the
right-of-way base, and milling and overlay of the entire area of the right-of-way affected by
the work.
The permittee shall correct defects in patching, or restoration performed by permittee or its
agents. Permittee upon notification from the City, shall correct all restoration work to the
extent necessary, using the method required by the City. Said work shall be completed
within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the City, not including days
during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or
days when work is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under Section 407.14.
If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required
by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all restorations required by the City,
the City as an option, may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the City,
within thirty (30) days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way.
4. Guarantees.
By choosing to restore the Right-of-Way itself, the Permittee guarantees its work and shall
maintain it for twenty-four (24) months following its completion. During this 24-month
period it shall, upon notification from the City, correct all restoration work to the extent
necessary, using the method required by the City. Said work shall be completed within five
(5) calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the City, not including days during which
work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when
work is prohibited as unseasonal or unreasonable under Section 407.14.
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.12.3
5. Obligation.
Construction triggers an obligation of the right-of-way user that the right-of-way restoration
be completed according to the conditions set forth in this Chapter. The right-of-way user
also assumes responsibility for “as built” drawings and for repairing facilities or structures,
including right-of-way that was damaged during facility installation. The obligation is
limited to one year for plantings and turf establishment.
6. Failure to Restore.
If the Permittee fails to restore the Right-of-Way in the manner and to the condition required
by the City, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all Restoration required by the City,
the City at its option may do such work. In that event the Permittee shall pay to the City,
within thirty (30) days of billing, the cost of Restoring the Right-of-Way. If Permittee fails
to pay as required, the City may exercise its rights under the Construction Performance
Bond.
7. Degradation Cost in Lieu of Restoration.
In lieu of Right-of-Way Restoration, a Right-of-Way user may elect to pay a Degradation
Fee with the approval of the City. However, the Right-of-Way User shall remain
responsible for Patching and the Degradation Fee shall not include the cost to accomplish
these responsibilities.
407.12. JOINT APPLICATIONS
1. Joint Application.
Registrants may jointly apply for permits to Excavate or Obstruct the Right-of-Way at the
same place and time.
2. With City Projects.

whether or not it is a joint application by two or more Registrants or a single application, are
not required to pay the Obstruction and Degradation portions of the permit fee.
A right-of-way permit application must be completed. In these circumstances, the
excavation fee will be waived.
Mapping data must be provided per Section 407.21.
3. Shared Fees.
Registrants who jointly apply for Right-of-Way Permits, which the City does not perform,
may share in the payment of the Right-of-Way Permit Fee. Registrants must agree among
themselves as to the portion each will pay and indicate the same on their applications.
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.14.3.
407.13. SUPPLEMENTARY APPLICATIONS
1. Limitation on Area.
A Right-of-Way Permit is valid only for the area of the Right-of-Way specified in the
permit. No Permittee may obstruct or do any work outside the area specified in the permit,
except as provided herein. Any Permittee which determines that an area greater than that
specified in the permit must be Obstructed or Excavated must before working in that greater
area (i) make application for a permit extension and pay any additional fees required
thereby, and (ii) be granted a new permit or permit extension.
2. Limitation on Dates.
A Right-of-Way Permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No Permittee may
begin its work before the permit start date or, except as provided herein, continue working
after the end date. If a Permittee does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must
apply for a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or an
extension of the old permit before working after the end date of the previous permit. This
Supplementary Application must be approved before the initial permit end date.
407.14. OTHER OBLIGATIONS
1. Compliance with Other Laws.
Obtaining a Right-of-Way Permit does not relieve Permittee of its duty to obtain all other
necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by the City or other
applicable rule, law or regulation. A Permittee shall comply with all requirements of local,
state and federal laws, including Minnesota Statutes, Section 216D.01-.09 (“One Call
Excavation Notice System”). A Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all
applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done
in the Right-of-Way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who does the work.
2. Prohibited Work.
Except in an Emergency, and with the approval of the City, no Right-of-Way Obstruction or
Excavation may be done when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable
for such work.
3. Interference with Right-of-Way.
A Permittee shall not so Obstruct a Right-of-Way that the natural free and clear passage of
water through the gutters or other waterways shall be interfered with. Private vehicles of
those doing work in the Right-of-Way may not be parked within or next to a permit area,
unless parked in conformance with City parking regulations. The loading or unloading of
trucks must be done solely within the defined permit area unless specifically authorized by
the permit.
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.15.1.G
4. Trenchless Excavation.
As a condition of all applicable permits, permittees employing trenchless excavation
methods, including but not limited to Horizontal Directional Drilling, shall follow all
requirements set forth in Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 216D and Minnesota Rules, Chapter
7560 and shall require potholing or open cutting over existing underground utilities before
excavating, as determined by the Director.
407.15. DENIAL OF PERMIT
1. Reasons for Denial.
Except in an emergency, no right-of-way permit will be granted.
A. To any person required to be registered who has not done so;
B. To any person required to file an annual report but has failed to do so;
C. For any next-year project not listed in the construction and major maintenance plan
required under this Chapter;
D. For any project which requires the excavation of any portion of a right-of-way which was
constructed or reconstructed within the preceding five (5) years;
E. To any person who has failed within the past two (2) years to comply, or is presently not
in full compliance, with the requirements of this Chapter;
a.
F. To any person who has outstanding debt owed to the City; and
G. To any person as to whom there are existing grounds for the revocation of a permit.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, the City may issue a permit in any case
where the permit is necessary (1) to prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer
of the permit Applicant, or (2) to allow such customer to materially improve its utility
service, or (3) to allow a new economic development project, or (4) as otherwise
required by law; and where the permit Applicant did not have knowledge of the
hardship, the plans for improvement of service, or the development project when said
Applicant was required to submit its list of Next-year Projects.
The City may deny a permit to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way,
would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other
event, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way, its use, and its users. The City may
consider one or more of the following factors:
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.16
(1) the extent to which right-of-way space where the permit is sought is available;
(2) the competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-way;
(3) the availability of other locations in the right-of-way or in other rights-of-way for the
equipment or facilities of the permit Applicant;
(4) the applicability of ordinance or other regulations of the right-of-way that affect
location of equipment or facilities in the right-of-way;
(5) the degree of compliance of the Applicant with the terms and conditions of its
franchise, this Chapter, and other applicable ordinances and regulations;
(6) the degree of disruption to surrounding neighborhoods and businesses that will result
from the use of that part of the right-of-way;
(7) the condition and age of the right-of-way, and whether and when it is scheduled for
total or partial reconstruction; and
(8) the balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage to the right-of-way,
against the benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional
parts of the right-of-way.
2. Procedural Requirements.
The denial or revocation of a permit must be made in writing and must document the basis
for the denial. The City must notify the Applicant or right-of-way user in writing within
three business days of the decision to deny or revoke a permit. If an application is denied,
the right-of-way user may address the reasons for denial identified by the City and resubmit
its application. If the application is resubmitted within 30 days of receipt of the notice of
denial, no additional application fee shall be imposed. The City must approve or deny the
resubmitted application within 30 days after submission.
407.16. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
The excavation, backfilling, patching, repair, and restoration, and all other work performed in
the Right-of-Way shall be performed and completed in conformance with Minnesota Rules,
Parts 7819.1100 and 7819.5000, Engineering Standards adopted by the PUC, City, county, and
State, and any other applicable local requirements, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the
Minnesota Statutes, Sections 237.162 and 237.163.
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.17.3.B
407.17. INSPECTION
1. Notice of Completion.
When the work under any permit hereunder is completed, the permittee shall furnish a
Completion Certificate in accordance with Minnesota Rule, Part 7819.1300.
Unless waived by the City, a person designated by the right-of-way user as a responsible
employee shall sign a completion certificate showing the completion date for the work
performed, identifying the installer and designer of record, and certifying that work was
completed according to the requirements of the City.
If necessary due to approved changes for the work as projected when the permit was applied
for, the permittee shall submit “as built” drawings or maps within six months of completing
the work, showing any deviations from the plan that are greater than plus or minus two feet.
The City shall respond within 30 days of receipt of the completion certificate. Failure to
approve or disapprove the Permittee’s performance within 30 days is deemed to be approval
by the City.
2. Site Inspection.
Permittee shall make the work-site available to the City and to all others as authorized by
law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution of and upon completion of
the work.
3. Authority of Director
A. At the time of inspection the City may order the immediate cessation of any work which
poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public.
B. The Director may issue an order to the Permittee for any work which does not conform
to the terms of the permit or other applicable standards, conditions, or codes. The order
shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit.
Within ten (10) days after issuance of the order, the Permittee shall present proof to the
City that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within
the required time, the City may revoke the permit pursuant to Section 407.20.
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.20.1.A
407.18. WORK DONE WITHOUT A PERMIT
1. Emergency Situations.
Each Registrant shall immediately notify the City of any event regarding its Facilities which
it considers to be an Emergency. The Registrant may proceed to take whatever actions are
necessary to respond to the Emergency. Excavators’ notification to Gopher State One Call
regarding an emergency situation does not fulfill this requirement. Within two business days
after the occurrence of the Emergency the Registrant shall apply for the necessary permits,
pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring
itself into compliance with this Chapter for the actions it took in response to the Emergency.
If the City becomes aware of an emergency regarding a Registrant’s Equipment or Facilities,
the City will attempt to contact the Local Representative of each Registrant affected, or
potentially affected by the Emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it
deems necessary to respond to the Emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the
Registrant whose Facilities occasioned the Emergency.
2. Non-Emergency Situations.
Except in an Emergency, any Person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit,
Obstructs or Excavates a Right-of-Way must subsequently obtain a permit, and as a penalty
pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
Legislative Code, deposit with the City the fees necessary to correct any damage to the Rightof-
Way and comply with all of the requirements of this Chapter.
407.19. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTIFICATION
If the activity in the Right-of-Way begins later or ends sooner than the date given on the Rightof-
Way Permit, Permittee shall notify the City of the accurate information as soon as this
information is known.
407.20. REVOCATION OF PERMITS
1. Substantial Breach.
The City reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any Right-of-Way Permit, without a
fee refund, in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute,
ordinance, rule or regulation, or any material condition of the permit including a threat to the
safety of workers or the right-of-way user or the utility users. A substantial breach by
Permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
The violation of any material provision of the Right-of-Way Permit;
A. An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the Right-of-Way Permit, or
the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the City or its citizens;
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.20.5
B. Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a Right-of-Way Permit;
C. The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; unless a permit extension is
obtained or unless the failure to complete work is due to reasons beyond the Permittee’s
control; or
D. Failure to relocate existing facilities as specified in Sec. 407.23; or
E. Failure of the utility to pay any required costs, fees, or charges billed by the City or
F. The failure to correct, in a timely manner, work that does not conform to a condition
indicated on an Order issued pursuant to this Chapter.
2. Written Notice of Breach.
If the City determines that the Permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or
condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit the City
shall make a written demand upon the Permittee to remedy such violation. The demand
shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. A substantial
breach, as stated above, will allow the City to place additional or revised conditions on the
permit to mitigate and remedy the breach.
3. Response to Notice of Breach.
Within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving notification of the breach, Permittee shall
provide the City with a plan, acceptable to the City that will cure the breach. Permittee’s
failure to so contact the City, or the Permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
Permittee’s failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate
revocation of the permit. Further, Permittee’s failure to so contact the City, or the
Permittee’s failure to submit an acceptable plan, or Permittee’s failure to reasonably
implement the approved plan, shall automatically place the Permittee on Probation for one
(1) full year.
4. Cause for Probation.
From time to time, the City may establish a list of conditions of the permit, which if
breached will automatically place the Permittee on Probation for one full year, such as, but
not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on Right-of-Way grossly
outside of the permit authorization.
5. Automatic Revocation.
If a Permittee, while on Probation, commits a breach as outlined above, Permittee’s permit
will automatically be revoked and Permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full
year, except for Emergency repairs.
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.21.1.E
6. Reimbursement of City Costs.
If a permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the City for the City’s reasonable
costs, including Restoration Costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with such revocation.
407.21. MAPPING DATA
1. Information Required.
Each Registrant shall provide Mapping information required by the City in accordance
with Minnesota Rules, Parts 7819.4000 and 7819.4100. Failure to provide Mapping
and detailed drawings pursuant to this subsection shall be grounds for revoking the
permit holder’s registration. Mapping data shall include the following information:
A. location and approximate depth of Applicant’s mains, cables, conduits, switches, and
related equipment and facilities, with the location based on:
(1) offsets from property lines, distances from the centerline of the public right—of-way,
and curb lines as determined by the City; or
(2) coordinates derived from the coordinate system being used by the City; or
(3) any other system agreed upon by the right-of-way user and City;

Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.21.3
The right-of-way user is not required to provide or convey mapping information or data in a
format or manner that is different from that which it currently utilizes and maintains. The
right-of-way user shall, however, include the cost to covert the data furnished by the rightof-
way user to a format currently in use by the City as part of the permit application fee.
These data conversion costs, unlike other costs that make up permit fees, may be included in
the permit fee after the permit application process is completed and shall be immediately
due to the City upon the ascertainment of the cost and notice of the fee to the Applicant.
Any permit for which such fee has not been paid within 30 days of notice from the City may
upon written notice be revoked. The City shall not issue any other permits to the registrant
related to any City right-of-way until such fee is paid.
Mapping data shall be provided with the specificity requested by the City for inclusion in the
mapping system used by the City.
For mapping data provided to the City of Fridley in GIS format compatible with the City’s
standards, the mapping portion of the excavation fee is waived.

A. Within six (6) months after the acquisition, installation, or construction of additional
equipment or any relocation, abandonment, or disuse of existing equipment, each
registrant shall submit the Mapping Data required herein.
B. All existing right-of-way users shall submit detailed plans as may be reasonable and
practical for all facilities and equipment installed, used or abandoned within the public
right-of-way.
C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mapping Data shall be submitted by all Registrants for
all equipment which is to be installed or constructed after the date of passage of this
Chapter at the time any permits are sought under these ordinances.
D. A new Registrant, or a Registrant which has not submitted a plan as required above,
shall submit complete and accurate Mapping Data for all its equipment at the time any
permits are sought under these ordinances.
3. Telecommunication Equipment.
Information on existing facilities and equipment of telecommunications right-of-way users
need only be supplied in the form maintained by the telecommunications right-of-way user.
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.22.2
4. Service Laterals.
All permits issued for the installation or repair of service laterals, other than minor repairs as
defined in Minnesota Rules, Part 7560.0150, subp. 2, shall require the permittee’s use of
appropriate means of establishing the horizontal locations of installed service laterals and
the service lateral vertical locations in those cases where the Director reasonably requires it.
Permittees or their subcontractors shall submit to the Director evidence satisfactory to the
Director of the installed service lateral locations. Compliance with this subdivision 2 and
with applicable Gopher State One Call law and Minnesota Rules governing service laterals
installed after Dec. 31, 2005, shall be a condition of any City approval necessary for:
A. payments to contractors working on a public improvement project, including those under
Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 429, and
B. City approval under development agreements or other subdivision or site plan approval
under Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 462. The Director shall reasonably determine the
appropriate method of providing such information to the City. Failure to provide prompt
and accurate information on the service laterals installed may result in the revocation of
the permit issued for the work or future permits to the offending permittee or its
subcontractors
407.22. LOCATION OF FACILITIES
1. Placement, location, and relocation of facilities must comply with the Act, with other
applicable law, and with Minnesota Rules, Parts 7819.3100, 7819.5000, and 7819.5100, to
the extent the rules do not limit authority otherwise available to cities.
2. Corridors.
The City may assign specific corridors within the Right-of-Way, or any particular segment
thereof as may be necessary, for each type of Facility that is or, pursuant to current
technology, the City expects will someday be located within the Right-of-Way. All
excavation, obstruction, or other permits issued by the City involving the installation or
replacement of Facilities shall designate the proper corridor for the Facilities at issue.
Any Registrant who has Facilities in the Right-of-Way in a position at variance with the
corridors established by the City shall, no later than at the time of the next reconstruction or
excavation of the area where the Facilities are located, move the Facilities to the assigned
position within the Excavation of the Right-of-Way, unless this requirement is waived by
the City for good cause shown, upon consideration of such factors as the remaining
economic life of the Facilities, public safety, customer Service needs and hardship to the
Registrant.
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.24
3. Nuisance.
Any facilities found in a right-of-way that have not been registered shall be deemed to be a
nuisance. The City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including,
but not limited to, abating the nuisance or taking possession of the Equipment or Facilities
and restoring the right-of-way to a usable condition.
4. Limitation of Space.
To protect public health, safety, and welfare, or when necessary to protect the Right-of-Way
and its current use, the City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or
additional Facilities within the Right-of-Way. In making such decisions, the City shall
strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the Right-of-
Way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public’s
needs for the particular Utility Service, the condition of the Right-of-Way, the time of year
with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the Right-of-Way,
and future City plans for public improvements and development projects which have been
determined to be in the public interest.
407.23. RELOCATION OF FACILITIES
A Registrant must promptly and at its own expense, with due regard for seasonal working
conditions, permanently remove and relocate its Facilities in the Right-of-Way whenever the
City for good cause requests such removal and relocation, and shall restore the Right-of-Way
consistent with Minnesota Rules, Parts 7819.0050 – 7819.9950. The City may make such
request to prevent interference by the Company’s Equipment or Facilities with (i) a present or
future City use of the Right-of-Way, (ii) a public improvement undertaken by the City, (iii) an
economic development project in which the City has an interest or investment, (iv) when the
public health, safety and welfare require it, or (v) when necessary to prevent interference with
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the Right-of-Way.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Person shall not be required to remove or relocate its Facilities
from any Right-of-Way which has been vacated in favor of a non-governmental entity unless
and until the reasonable costs thereof are first paid to the Person thereof.
407.24. PRE-EXCAVATION FACILITY AND FACILITIES LOCATION

horizontal and vertical placement of all said Facilities. Any Registrant whose Facilities are less
than twenty (20) inches below a concrete or asphalt surface shall notify and work closely with
the excavation contractor to establish the exact location of its Facilities and the best procedure
for excavation.

407.25. DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES
When the City does work in the Right-of-Way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or
move a person’s Facilities to protect it, the City shall notify the Local Representative as early as
is reasonably possible. The costs associated therewith will be billed to that person and must be
paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Each person shall be responsible for the
cost of repairing any Facilities in the Right-of-Way which it or its Facilities damages. Each
person shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the Facilities of another
persons caused during the City’s response to an Emergency occasioned by that persons

407.26. RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION
1. Reservation of Right.
If the City vacates a Right-of-Way which contains the Facilities of a Registrant, and if the
vacation does not require the relocation of Registrant’s or Permittee’s Facilities, the
registrant’s rights in the vacated right-of-way are governed by Minnesota Rules, Part
7819.3200 and the City shall reserve, to and for itself and all Registrants having Facilities in
the vacated Right-of-Way, the right to install, maintain and operate any Facilities in the
vacated Right-of-Way and to enter upon such Right-of-Way at any time for the purpose of
reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining or repairing the same.

or enforcement of compliance with the permit; or
B. when otherwise provided in an applicable franchise agreement.
4. Remedy is Additional; Subrogation
A defense or indemnification of the City by a permittee is deemed not to be a waiver of any
defense or immunity otherwise available to the City.
A permittee, in defending any action on behalf of the City is entitled to assert every defense
or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf.
407.28. ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES
1. Discontinued Operations.
A Registrant who has determined to discontinue all or a portion of its operations in the City
must provide information satisfactory to the City that the Registrant’s obligations for its
Facilities in the Right-of-Way under this Chapter have been lawfully assumed by another
Registrant and locate and provide to the City a map which clearly identifies the facility and
also maintains it as a real property record.

two (2) years, remains unused or one year after the passage of this Chapter, any Facilities
found in a Right-of-Way that have not been Registered with the City shall be deemed to be
abandoned. Abandoned Facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The City may exercise any
remedies or rights it has as law or in equity, including, but not limited to, (i) abating the
nuisance, (ii) taking possession of the Facilities and restoring the Right-of-Way to a useable
condition, or (iii) requiring removal of the Facilities by the Registrant, or the Registrant’s
successor in interest.
Fridley City Code Chapter 407 Section 407.32
3. Removal.
Any Registrant who has unused, unusable and abandoned Facilities in any Right-of-Way
shall remove it from that Right-of-Way if required in conjunction with other right-of-way
repair, excavation or construction, unless this requirement is waived by the City or other
remedy agreed to.
407.29. APPEAL

had a permit revoked; or (; (4) believes that the fees imposed are not in conformity with
Minnesota Statutes, Section 237.163, subd. 6; or (5) disputes a determination of the Director
regarding Section 1.24, subd.2 of this ordinance may have the denial, revocation, fee imposition,
or decision reviewed, upon written request, by the City Council. The City Council shall act on a
timely written request at its next regularly scheduled meeting. A decision by the City Council
affirming the denial, revocation, or fee imposition will be in writing and supported by written
findings establishing the reasonableness of the decision.
407.30. RESERVATION OF REGULATORY AND POLICE POWERS
A Permittee’s or Registrant’s rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the City to
adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
public.
407.31. SEVERABILITY
If any portion of this Chapter is for any reason held invalid by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and
such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. Nothing in this
Chapter precludes the City from requiring a franchise agreement with the Applicant, as allowed
by law, in addition to requirements set forth herein.
407.32. FEES
Any fees imposed under this Chapter shall be reviewed and adopted at least annually at the same
time and in the same manner as other fees established by the City.
At any time, in its discretion, the City expressly reserves the right to review the fees imposed in
this Chapter and, upon notice and public hearing, modify them if it is satisfied that such action
is necessary to reflect the cost of regulating and supervising the activities governed by this
Chapter.

give Company reasonable notice of plans to vacate for a City improvement project, or to grade,
regrade, or change the line of any Public Way or to construct or reconstruct any City Utility
System. If a relocation is ordered within five years of a prior relocation of the same Electric
facilities, which was made at Company expense, the City shall reimburse Company for Non-
Betterment Costs on a time and material basis, provided that if a subsequent relocation is
required because of the extension of a City Utility System to a previously unserved area,
Company may be required to make the subsequent relocation at its expense. Nothing in this
Ordinance requires Company to relocate, remove, replace or reconstruct at its own expense its
Electric Facilities where such relocation, removal, replacement or reconstruction is solely for the
convenience of the city and is not reasonably necessary for the construction or reconstruction of
a Public Way or City Utility System or other City improvement.
2. Relocation of Electric Facilities in Public Ground. Except as may be provided in Chapter
408.4.3, City may require Company at Company’s expense to relocate or remove its Electric
Facilities from Public ground upon a finding by City that the Electric Facilities have become or
will become a substantial impairment to the existing or proposed public use of the Public
Ground.
3. Projects with Federal Funding. Relocated, removal, or rearrangement of any Company
Electric facilities made necessary because of the extension into or through City of a federallyaided
highway project shall be governed by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes Section 161.46
as supplemented or amended. It is understood that the right herein granted to Company is a
valuable right. City shall not order Company to remove or relocate its Electric Facilities when a
Public Way is vacated, improved or realigned because of a renewal or a redevelopment plan
which is financially subsidized in whole or in part by the Federal Government or any agency
thereof, unless the reasonable Non-Betterment Costs of such relocation and the loss and expense
resulting therefrom are first paid to Company, but the City need not pay those portions of such
for which reimbursement to it is not available.
4. No Waiver. The provisions of Section 4 apply only to Electric Facilities constructed in
reliance on a franchise and Company does not waive its rights under an easement or prescriptive
right, or State or County permit.
Fridley City Code Chapter 408 Section 408.08
408.05. TREE TRIMMING.
Company may trim all trees and shrubs in the Public Ways and Public Grounds of City
interfering with the proper construction, operation, repair and maintenance of any Electric
Facilities installed hereunder, provided that Company shall save the City harmless from any
liability arising therefrom, and subject to permit or other reasonable regulation by the City.
408.06. INDEMNIFICATION.
1. Indemnity of City. Company shall indemnify, keep and hold the City free and harmless
from any and all liability on account of injury to persons or damage to property occasioned by
the construction, maintenance, repair, inspection, the issuance of permits, or the operation of the
Electric facilities located in the Public ways and Public Grounds. The City shall not be
indemnified for losses or claims occasioned through its own negligence except for losses or
claims arising out of or alleging the City’s negligence as to the issuance of permits for, or
inspection of, Company’s plans or work. The city shall not be indemnified if the injury or
damage results from the performance in a proper manner of acts reasonably deemed hazardous
by Company, and such performance is nevertheless ordered or directed by City after notice of
Company’s determination.
2. Defense of City. In the event a suit is brought against the City under circumstances
where this Agreement to indemnify applies, Company at it sole cost and expense shall defend the
City in such suit if written notice thereof is promptly given to Company within a period wherein
Company is not prejudiced by lack of such notice. If Company is required to indemnify and
defend, it will thereafter have control of such litigation, but Company may not settle such
litigation without the consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available
to the City; and Company, in defending any action on behalf of the City shall be entitled to assert
in any action every defense or immunity that the City could assert in its own behalf.
408.07. VACATION OF PUBLIC WAYS.
The city shall give Company at least two weeks prior written notice of a proposed vacation of a
Public Way. Except where required for a City improvement project, the vacation of any Public
Way, after the installation of Electric Facilities, shall not operate to deprive Company of its
rights to operate an maintain such Electric Facilities, until the reasonable cost of relocating the
same and the loss and expense resulting from such relocation are first paid to Company. In no
case, however, shall City be liable to Company for failure to specifically preserve a right-of-way
under Minnesota Statutes, Section 160.29.
408.08. CHANGE IN FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
Any change in the form of government of the City shall not affect the validity of this Ordinance.

all of the rights and obligations of the City provided in this Section.
Fridley City Code Chapter 408 Section 408.09.2.
408.09. FRANCHISE FEE
1. Fee Schedule. During the term of the franchise hereby granted, and in lieu of any permit
or other fees being imposed on Company, the City may impose on Company a franchise fee not
to exceed an amount determined by collecting the amounts indicated in a Fee Schedule set forth
in a separate Section, as a percentage of Gross Revenues from the Public Street & Highway
Lighting Class, as a percentage of Gross Revenues or a monthly meter charge from the
Residential Class, or as a monthly meter charge from any other Customer Classification, from
each customer in the designated Company Customer Classification for electric service at each
and every customer location within the City based on a Fee Schedule form similar to the
following:
Customer Classification Amount Per Month
Residential
Small C & I and Municipal With No Demand Charge
Small C & I and Municipal With Demand Charge
Large C & I - Secondary Voltage
Large C & I - Primary Voltage & Above
Public Street & Highway Lighting
The franchise fee amount collected from each and every customer location in a Customer
Classification shall be determined so that the total franchise fee amount collected annually from
all customers in such Customer Classification does not exceed what s estimated by Company to
be four percent of the total annual Gross revenues from such Customer Classification. The
franchise fee imposed on all customers within a non-residential Customer Classification shall not
exceed an amount which is estimated by Company to be five percent of the average annual bill
collected from customers in the Small Customer Group in such Customer Classification. The
Small Customer Group for each non-residential Customer Classification with more than 50
customers shall constitute 25 percent of the actual customers within the City in such Customer
Classification which are estimated by Company to be the customers from which Company
collects its lowest annual revenues with the Customer Classification. The Small Customer
Group for each non-residential Customer Classification with 50 or fewer customers shall
constitute ten percent of the actual customers within the City in such Customer Classification
which are estimated by Company to be the customers from which Company collects its lowest
annual revenues within such Customer Classification. Company shall, within 60 days of the
City’s request, provide City with revenue estimates setting forth the revenues from the Small
Customer Group for planning a Fee Schedule.
2. Separate Ordinance. The franchise fee shall be imposed by a separate ordinance duly
adopted by the City council, which ordinance shall not be adopted until at least 60 days after
written notice enclosing such proposed ordinance has been served upon Company by certified
mail. The fee shall not become effective until at least 60 days after written notice enclosing such
adopted ordinance has been served upon Company by certified mail. Chapter 408.02.5 shall
constitute the sole remedy for solving disputes between Company and the City in regard to the
interpretation of, or enforcement of, the separate ordinance. No action by the City to implement
Fridley City Code Chapter 408 Section 408.09.4.
a separate ordinance will commence until this Ordinance is effective. A separate ordinance
which imposes a lesser franchise fee on the Residential Class than the franchise fee imposed on
any other Customer Classification, measured as a percentage of estimated total annual Gross
Revenues from all customers in each class, shall not be effective against Company, The
payment of a franchise fee as provided by this Section does not relieve Company from paying
fees to City unrelated to the installation, ownership or operation of Electric Facilities, such as
building permit fees.
3. Terms Defined. For the purpose of Chapter 408.09, the following definitions apply:
3.1. “Customer Classification” refers to the classes listed on the Fee Schedule and as
defined or determined in Company’s electric tariffs on file with the Commission.
3.2. “Fee Schedule” refers to the schedule in Section 408.09.1 setting forth an amount
per month for various customer classes.
3.3. “Gross Revenues” for each Customer Classification means all sums received from
Company billings for the sale or delivery of electricity to its retail customers within the
corporate limits of the City within a Customer Classification, excluding any surcharge,
sales tax, miscellaneous tariff charges or any similar addition to Company’s charges to
customers for the purpose of reimbursing Company for the franchise fee, sales tax, or
similar charges.
4. Collection of the Fee. The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly and shall be based on
the amount collected by Company during complete billing months during the period for which
payment is to be made by imposing a surcharge equal to the designated franchise fee for the
applicable Customer Classification in al customer billings for electric service in each class. The
payment shall be due the last business day of the month following the period for which the
payment is made. The franchise fee may be changed by ordinance from time to time; however,
each change shall meet the same notice requirements and not occur more often than annually and
no change shall require a collection from any customer for electric service in excess of the
amounts specifically permitted by this Chapter. The time and manner of collecting the franchise
fee is subject to the approval of the Commission. No franchise fee shall be payable by Company
if Company is legally unable to first collect an amount equal to the franchise fee from its
customers in each applicable class of customers by imposing a surcharge in Company’s
applicable rate for electric service. Company may pay the City the fee based upon the surcharge
billed subject to subsequent reductions to account for uncollectibles, refunds and correction of
erroneous billings. Company agrees to make its records available for inspection by the City at
reasonable times provided that the City and its designated representative agree in writing not to
disclose any information which would indicate the amount paid by any identifiable customer or
customers or any other information regarding identified customers.
Fridley City Code Chapter 408 Section 408.11.
5. Conditions on the Fee. The separate ordinance imposing the fee shall not be effective
against Company unless the separate ordinance lawfully imposes and the City quarterly or more
often collects a fee or tax of the same or greater equivalent amount on the receipts from sales of
energy within the City from every other energy supplier, provided that, as to such a supplier, the
City has the authority to require a franchise fee or to impose a tax. The “same or greater
equivalent amount” shall be measured, if practicable, by comparing amounts collected as a
franchise fee from each similar customer, or by comparing, as to similar customers, the
percentage of the annual bill represented by the amount collected for the franchise fee purposes.
The franchise fee or tax shall be applicable to energy sales for any energy use related to heating,
cooling or lighting, as well as to the supply of energy needed to run machinery and appliances on
premises located within or adjacent to the City, but shall not apply to energy sales for the
purpose of providing fuel for vehicles.
6. Exclusive Electric Service. Company is currently the exclusive provider of retail electric
service to its customers within the City in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, Section 216B.37
et seq. If Company is no longer the sole supplier of electric energy for any class of customers
from which it is collecting a franchise fee based on a percentage of Gross Revenues, Company’s
obligation to collect and pay a franchise fee on such retail electric service shall terminate upon
20 days Notice to City. Company will agree at City’s request to amend this franchise agreement
to collect a monthly meter charge from such a class of customers which will result in the
collection of approximately the same total franchise fee amount for the class as was being
collected by applying the percentage fee.
408.10. PROVISIONS OF THE CODE.
1. Severability. Every section, provision, or part of this Code is declared separate from
every other section, provision, or part; and if any section, provision, or part shall be held invalid,
it shall not affect any other section, provision or part. Where a provision of any other City code
conflicts with the provisions of this code, the provision of this code shall prevail.
2. Limitation on Applicability. This Code constitutes a franchise agreement between the
City and Company as the only parties and no provision of this franchise shall in any way inure to
the benefit of any third person as a third party beneficiary of the agreement or of any one or more
of the terms hereof, or otherwise give rise to any cause of action in any person not a party hereto.
408.11. AMENDMENT PROCEDURE.
Either party to this franchise agreement may at any time propose that the agreement be amended
to address a subject of concern and the other party will consider whether it agrees that the
amendment is mutually appropriate. If an amendment is agreed upon. this Code may be
amended at any time by the city passing a subsequent ordinance declaring the provision of the
amendment, which amendatory ordinance shall become effective upon the filing of Company’s
written consent thereto with the City Clerk within 90 days after the effective date of the
amendatory ordinance.

CHAPTER 801. CURFEW
(Ref. 1048)
801.01. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
1. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in juvenile victimization and crime. At
the same time, the crimes committed by and against juveniles have become more violent. A
significant percentage of juvenile crime occurs during curfew hours.
2. Because of their lack of maturity and experience, juveniles are particularly susceptible to
becoming victims of older perpetrators. The younger the person is, the more likely he or she is to
be a victim of crime.
3. While parents have the primary responsibility to provide for the safety and welfare of
juveniles, Fridley also has a substantial interest in the safety and welfare of juveniles. Moreover,
the City of Fridley has an interest in preventing juvenile crime, promoting parental supervision,
and providing for the well being of the general public.
4. An updated and enforceable curfew ordinance will reduce juvenile victimization and crime
and will advance public safety, health, and general welfare.

under 18 who are married or have been legally emancipated.

the powers and responsibilities of a parent as defined by Minn. Stat. 525.619.
4. "Responsible adult" means a person over the age of eighteen (18) specifically authorized by
law or by a parent or guardian to have custody and control of a juvenile.
5. "Public Place" means any place to which the public or a substantial group of the public has
access and includes, but is not limited to, streets, highways, and the common areas of schools,
hospitals, apartment houses, office buildings, transport facilities, and shops.
6. "Emergency" means a circumstance or combination of circumstances requiring immediate
action to prevent property damage, serious bodily injury, or loss of life.
7. "Serious bodily injury" means bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death, serious
permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss of impairment of the function of any body part or
organ.

8. "Establishment" means any privately owned place of business to which the public is invited,
including but not limited to any place of amusement, entertainment, or refreshment.

F-8: ORDINANCE NO. 625, ADOPTED 10/25/76
AN ORDINANCE AMENDING THE CITY CHARTER OF THE CITY OF FRIDLEY.
Section 5.02 EXPENDITURES BY PETITIONERS. No member of any initiative, referendum, or recall
committee, no circulator of a signature paper, and no signer of any such paper, or any other person, shall
accept or offer any reward, pecuniary or otherwise, or service rendered in connection with the circulation
thereof, but this shall not prevent the committee from paying for legal advice and from incurring an expense
not to exceed $200.00 for stationary, copying, printing, and notaries' fees. A sworn statement substantiating
such expenses shall be turned over to the City Clerk within 5 days following the filing of a petition. Any
violation of the provisions of this Section is a misdemeanor. Any violation of this Section shall be reported
by the City Clerk to the proper authorities for prosecution under State Statutes applying thereto.
Section 5.03 FURTHER REGULATIONS. A lawful petition under this Charter may be certified, signed
and circulated upon an ordinance to be initiated, an ordinance to be made the subject of a referendum and a
proceeding for recall upon the grounds authorized by law and required by the Constitution of the State of
Minnesota, and reasons stated in the Certificate, are to be stated and noted in the petition itself. A petition
for any other purpose may be made in accordance with procedures established by this Charter and under
provisions of law as may be elsewhere provided.
Fridley City Code - Appendix F Page 6
A petition under this Charter shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk as one instrument, which
instrument shall contain any instrument required, a copy of any ordinance proposed, covered or affected,
any other document (appropriate to the petition) and all the signature papers and affidavits attached in
support of the same. A petition may be signed by any elector. A petition can be circulated and verified only
by an elector who has signed the same. All the signatures on any petition need not be on one signature
paper. The circulator of every paper shall verify by affidavit attached that he (she) was the circulator of the
same, that each signature was signed in his (her) presence, and is of the person that same purports to be and
that each signer affirmed that he (she) was an elector at the residence stated thereon. Any paper lacking
such affidavit or verified by an affidavit false and untrue is insufficient and void of effect.
The City Clerk shall be responsible for determining the validity of signatures. If it is obvious the signature
on the petition is the signature of the person on the Voter Registration Card with which the signature is
compared, the signature shall be counted as a valid signature, notwithstanding the fact that the person may
have signed the petition in a different manner when they signed the Voter Registration Card. Before
discarding a signature, a reasonable effort shall be made to contact the person(s) in question to determine, if,
in fact, they did sign the petition.
The insufficiency or irregularity of a petition shall not prejudice the filing of any new petition for the same
purpose, nor shall it prevent the Council from referring any ordinance proposed to the electorate at the next
Regular or Special election, or otherwise acting favorably upon the same.
The Council may provide by ordinance such further regulations for the initiative, referendum, and recall, not
inconsistent with this Charter as it deems necessary.
The City Clerk, upon receipt of documented information that any signature on any petition paper has been
falsely attested to, shall promptly forward such information to the proper authority for prosecution under
State Statutes applying thereto.
Section 5.05 FORM OF PETITION AND OF SIGNATURE PAPERS. The petition for the adoption of any
ordinance shall consist of the ordinance, together with all the signature papers and affidavits thereto

City Clerk shall be subject to the direction of the City Manager and shall have such duties in connection
with the keeping of the public records, the custody, and disbursement of the public funds, and the general

expenditure of more than that which is set by the State Statutes, unless the Council shall by an emergency
ordinance otherwise provide, the City Manager shall advertise for bids by at least 10 days published notice
in the official newspaper. When a bid is required, it shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder as
determined by the Council. The Council may, however, reject any and all bids. Nothing contained in this
Section shall prevent the Council from contracting for the doing of work with patented processes, or from
the purchasing of patented appliances.

to items and amounts.
Fridley City Code - Appendix F Page 10

year. In addition to estimates of expenditures, the City Manager shall prepare a detailed statement of
revenues collected for the two preceding completed fiscal years with amounts estimated to be collected for
the current fiscal year, and an estimate of revenues for the ensuing fiscal year. The estimates shall be
submitted to the Council at its first regular monthly meeting in August and shall be published in summary in
the official publication prior to the August meeting.
Section 7.05 PASSAGE OF THE BUDGET. The budget shall be the principal item of business at the first
regular monthly meeting of the Council in August, and the Council shall hold subsequent meetings from
time to time until all the estimates have been considered. The meetings shall be so conducted as to give
interested citizens a reasonable amount of time in which to be heard, and an opportunity to ask questions.
The budget estimates shall be read in full and the City Manager shall explain the various items thereof as
fully as may be deemed necessary by the Council. The annual budget finally agreed upon shall set forth in
such detail as may be determined by the City Council, the complete financial plan of the City for the
ensuing fiscal year, and shall be signed by the majority of the Council upon being adopted. It shall indicate
the sums to be raised and from what sources, and the sums to be spent and for what purposes, according to
the plan indicated in Section 7.04. The total sum appropriated shall not exceed the total estimated revenue.
The Council shall adopt the budget during the month of October by ordinance which shall set forth the total
of the budget and the totals of the major divisions of the budget, according to the plan indicated in Section

November, a statement of all the taxes levied, and such taxes shall be collected and the payment thereof be
enforced with and in like manner as state and county taxes. No tax shall be invalid by reason of any
informality in the manner of levying the same, nor because the amount levied shall exceed the amount
required to be raised for the special purpose for which the same is levied, but in that case the surplus shall go
into a suspense fund, and shall be used to reduce the levy for the ensuing year.
Section 7.14 ACCOUNTS AND REPORTS. The City Manager shall be the Chief Accounting Officer of
the City and of every branch thereof, and the Council may prescribe and enforce proper accounting
methods, forms, blanks, and other devices consistent with the law, this Charter, and the ordinances in accord

the City Treasurer, the status of all funds, the amount spent or chargeable against each of the annual budget
allowances and the balances left in each, and such other information relative to the finances of the City as
the Council may require. The Council may at any time and shall annually provide for an audit of the City
finances by a certified public accountant or by the department of the state authorized to make examinations
of the affairs of municipalities. On or before the first day of April in each year the City Manager shall
prepare a complete financial statement in form approved by the Council of the City's financial operations for
the preceding calendar year, and quarter, which statement may be published in such manner as the Council
may direct and a summary thereof shall be published in the official newspaper on or before the third week in
April, July, October, and January as appropriate.
Section 10.05 RATES AND CHARGES. Every public utility or franchisee making use of the street or
public places within the City shall give courteous, efficient and adequate service at reasonable rates. A
reasonable rate shall be construed to be one which will, with efficient management, normally yield a fair
return on all property used and useful in furnishing service to the City and its inhabitants. This shall not be
Fridley City Code - Appendix F Page 11
construed as a guarantee of a return and in no case shall there be any return upon franchise value. Within
Fridley City Code - Appendix F Page 12
these limits the determination of maximum rates, fares, or charges to be charged by any public utility or
franchisee for service rendered to the City or any person, persons, firm or corporation within the City shall
be made, if possible, by direct negotiations between the public utility or franchisee and the Council. In case
of failure to reach an agreement by this method within a reasonable time the Council may, in its discretion,
agree to submit to arbitration on such terms as it may deem feasible or upon such terms as the franchise
provides for, the fixing of rates, fares, or charges by the public utility or franchisee; provided, however, that
the rates, fares, or charges so fixed by arbitration shall not be binding on the City for more than five years.
Section 10.06 PROVISIONS OF FRANCHISES. Every franchise shall contain, among other things,
provisions relating to the following:

conduits under the streets or public places, and the placing in the streets or other public places of any
permanent or semi-permanent fixtures or equipment by the public utility or franchisee.
(4) The prompt repair by the public utility or franchisee of all damages to the public streets, alleys and
public property occasioned by the acts or omissions of the public utility or franchisee.
(5) The rights of the City to have access to all books, records, and papers of the public utility or franchisee
which in any way deal with, affect or record its operations within and pertaining to the City and
pertaining to property and equipment used and useful in furnishing service to the City and its
inhabitants.
(6) The power and right of the City to submit to arbitration the fixing of any rates, fares or charges to be
made by the public utility or franchisee.
(7) The right of the public utility or franchisee to receive upon condemnation proceedings brought by the
City to acquire the public utility or franchisee compensation for its franchise or the value thereof, if any.
Section 10.09 PUBLIC HEARINGS. Before any franchise ordinance is adopted or any rates, fares or
charges to be charged by the public utility or franchisee are fixed, there shall be a public hearing by the
Council, in regard thereto. Notice of such public hearing shall be given by published notice at least once in
the official newspaper not less than twenty (20) days prior to the date of such public hearing. Additional
notice of such public hearing may be given in such manner as the Council shall determine.

book kept for that purpose and preserved. Every ordinance shall be published at least once in the official

The right is reserved to the City Council, upon the recommendation of an engineer, acting through the
construction department to bid on any work to be let by contract. All contracts shall be let to the lowest
responsible bidder, but the term "lowest responsible bidder" shall be interpreted as giving the City Council
the right to accept any bid which is determined to be most advantageous to the City. The City Council shall
reserve the right to reject any or all bids. Detailed proceedings governing the advertisement for bids and the
execution of the contract shall be prescribed by ordinance. The City shall require contractors to furnish

Ord. 625)
5.06. FILING OF PETITIONS AND ACTION THEREON.
Within five (5) days after the filing of the petition, the City Clerk shall ascertain by examination the number
of signatures appended thereto and whether this number is at least ten percent (10%) of the total number of
registered voters, as of January 1st of that year. If the City Clerk finds the petition insufficient or irregular,
the City Clerk shall at once notify one (1) or more of the committee of sponsors of that fact, certifying the
Fridley City Code - Appendix F Page 29
reasons for the insufficiency or irregularity. The committee shall then be given thirty (30) days in which to
file additional signature papers and to correct the petition in all other particulars. If at the end of that period
the petition is found to be still insufficient or irregular, the petition shall be filed in the City Clerk's office.
The City Clerk shall notify each member of the committee of that fact. (Ref. Ord. 625)
5.07. ACTION OF THE COUNCIL OF PETITIONS.
When the petition is found to be sufficient, the City Clerk shall so certify to the Council at its next meeting,
stating the number of petitioners and the percentage of the total number of registered voters which they
constitute, and the Council shall at once read the ordinance and refer it to an appropriate committee, which
may be a committee of the whole. The committee or Council shall thereupon provide for public hearings
upon the ordinance, after the holding of which the ordinance shall be finally acted upon by the Council not
later than sixty-five (65) days after the date upon which it was submitted to the Council by the City Clerk. If
the Council fails to pass the proposed ordinance, or passes it in a form different from that set forth in the
petition and unsatisfactory to the petitioner, the proposed ordinance shall be submitted by the Council to the
electorate at the next regular municipal election; but if the number of signers of the petition is equal to at
least fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of registered voters, the Council shall call a special election
upon the measure. Such special election shall be held not less than thirty (30) nor more than forty-five (45)
days from the date of final action on the ordinance by the Council or after the expiration of sixty-five (65)
days from the date of submission to the Council when there has been no final action; but if a regular election
is to occur within three (3) months, the Council may submit the ordinance at that election. If the Council
passes the proposed ordinance with amendments and at least four-fifths (4/5) of the committee of petitioners
do not express their dissatisfaction with such amended form by a statement filed with the City Clerk within
ten (10) days of the passage thereof by the Council, the ordinance need not be submitted to the electorate.
5.08. INITIATIVE BALLOTS.
The ballots used when voting upon such proposed ordinance shall state the substance of the ordinance and
shall give the electorate the opportunity to vote either "Yes" or "No" on the question of adoption. If a
majority of those voting on any such ordinance vote in favor of it, it shall thereupon become an ordinance of
the City. Any number of proposed ordinances may be voted upon at the same election but the voter shall be
allowed to vote for or against each separately. In the case of inconsistency between two (2) or more
initiative ordinances approved by the voters, the ordinances shall not go into effect until the City Council
has had sixty (60) days to resolve the inconsistencies. (Ref. Ord. 625)
5.09. INITIATION OF CHARTER AMENDMENTS.
Nothing in this Charter shall be construed as in any way affecting the right of the eligible voters under the
Constitution and Statutes of Minnesota to propose amendments to this Charter.
5.10. THE REFERENDUM.
If prior to the date when an ordinance takes effect a petition signed by at least fifteen percent (15%) of the
registered voters as of January 1st of that year request that any such ordinance be repealed or be submitted
to a vote of the electors, the ordinance shall thereby be prevented from going into operation. The Council
shall thereupon reconsider the ordinance at its next regular meeting, and either repeal it or by aye and no
vote re-affirm its adherence to the ordinance as passed. In the latter case the Council shall immediately
order a special election to be held thereon, or submit the ordinance at the next regular municipal election,
pending which the ordinance shall remain suspended. If a majority of those voting is opposed to the
ordinance, it shall not become effective; but if a majority of those voting favors the ordinance, it shall go
into effect immediately or on the date therein specified.

5.15. FILING OF PETITION.
Within thirty (30) days after the filing of the original certificate, the committee shall file the completed
petition in the office of the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall examine the petition within the next five (5)
days, and if the City Clerk finds it irregular in any way, or finds that the number of signers is less than
twenty-five (25%) percent of the total number of registered voters of the Ward or City represented by the
office holder, the City Clerk shall so notify one (1) or more members of the committee. The committee
shall then be given ten (10) days in which to file additional signature papers and to correct the petition in all
other respects, but they may not change the statement of the grounds upon which the recall is sought. If at
the end of that time the City Clerk finds the petition still insufficient or irregular, all the members of the
committee shall be notified to that effect and the petition shall be filed in the City Clerk's office. No further
action shall be taken thereon.
5.17. PROCEDURE AT RECALL ELECTION.
The Clerk shall include with the published notice of the election the statement of the grounds for the recall
and also, in not more than five hundred (500) words, the answer of the officer concerned in justification of
the course in office. Candidates to succeed the officer to be recalled shall be nominated in the usual way,
and the election shall be conducted as far as possible, in accordance with the usual procedure in municipal
elections.
5.18. FORM OF RECALL BALLOT.
Unless the officer whose removal is sought resigns within ten (10) days after the receipt by the Council of
the completed recall petition, the form of the ballot at such election shall be: "Shall . . . . . . . be recalled?",
the name of the officer whose recall is sought being inserted in the blank, and those voting shall be
permitted to vote separately "Yes" or "No" upon this question. The ballot shall also contain names of the
candidates to be voted upon to fill the vacancy, in case the recall is successful, under the caption:
"Candidates to fill the place of . . . . . . . . . ., if recalled"; but the officer whose recall is sought shall not be a
candidate upon such ballot. If a majority of those voting on the question of recall vote in favor of recall, the
official shall be thereby removed from office, and the candidate who receives the highest number of votes
shall be elected thereto for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the officer sought to be recalled resigns
within ten (10) days after the receipt by the Council of the completed recall petition, the form of ballot at the

The City Manager shall be the Chief Administrative Officer of the City, and shall be chosen by the Council
solely on the basis of training, experience and administrative qualifications. The choice shall not be limited
to inhabitants of the City or State but shall be limited to a citizen of the United States. The City Manager

meeting provided at least three (3) members of the Council vote for the removal. (Ref. Ord. 790)
6.02. POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE CITY MANAGER.
(e) To attend all meetings of the Council, with the right to take part in the discussions but having no
Fridley City Code - Appendix F Page 32
vote; but the Council may at its discretion exclude the City Manager from meetings at which
Fridley City Code - Appendix F Page 33
the City Manager's removal is considered;
(f) To recommend to the Council for adoption such measures as may be deemed necessary for the
welfare of the people and the efficient administration of the City's affairs;
(h) To perform such other duties as may be prescribed by this Charter or required by ordinances or
resolutions adopted by the Council. (Ref. Ord. 790)
6.04. SUBORDINATE OFFICERS.
There shall be a City Clerk, City Treasurer, City Attorney and such other officers subordinate to the City
Manager as the Council may provide for by ordinance(s). The City Clerk shall be subject to the direction of
the City Manager and shall have such duties in connection with keeping of the public records, the custody
and disbursement of the public funds, and the general administration of the City's affairs as shall be ordained
by the Council. The City Clerk may be designated to act as Secretary of the Council. The Council may by
ordinance abolish offices which have been created by ordinance and it may combine the duties of various
offices as it may see fit. (Ref. Ord. 625, 790)
7.06. ENFORCEMENT OF THE BUDGET.
It shall be the duty of the City Manager to enforce strictly the provisions of the budget. The City Manager
shall not approve any order upon the City Treasurer for any expenditure unless an appropriation has been
made in the budget, nor for any expenditure covered by the budget unless there is sufficient unencumbered
balance left after deducting the total past expenditures and the sum of all outstanding orders and
encumbrances. No officer or employee of the City shall place any orders or make any purchases except for
the purposes and to the amounts authorized in the budget. Any obligation incurred by any person in the
employ of the City for any purpose not authorized in the budget or for any amount in excess of the amount
therein authorized shall be a personal obligation upon the person incurring the expenditure.
7.14. ACCOUNTS AND REPORTS.
The City Manager shall be the Chief Accounting Officer of the City and of every branch thereof, and the
Council may prescribe and enforce proper accounting methods, forms, blanks, and other devices consistent
with the law, this Charter and the ordinances in accord with it. The City Manager shall submit to the
Council a statement each month showing the amount of money in the custody of the City Treasurer, the
status of all funds, the amount spent or chargeable against each of the annual budget allowances and the
balances left in each and such other information relative to the finances of the City as the Council may
require. The Council may at any time and shall annually provide for an audit of the City finances by
certified public accountant or by the department of the State authorized to make examination of the affairs
of municipalities. On or before the first day of April in each year the City Manager shall prepare a complete
financial statement in form approved by the Council of the City's financial operations for the preceding
calendar year, and quarter, which statement may be published in such manner as the Council may direct and
a summary thereof shall be published in the official newspaper on or before the third week in April, July,
October and January as appropriate. (Ref. Ord. 625)
7.15. BONDED DEBT AND DEBT LIMIT.
2. The Council by a vote of at least four (4) of its members may authorize the issuance of the bonds to
provide funds for any public purpose not prohibited by law, or may in its discretion, by a majority vote of all
of its members submit to the electorate propositions for the issuance of such bonds. When such a
proposition is submitted to the electorate, no bonds or other term obligations of the City may be issued
except pursuant to a favorable vote of a majority of those voting on the proposition of their issuance. By the
proceedings for the issuance of any bonds, by the terms of the bonds and by agreements with the purchasers
of bonds, they may be made special in character and limited in their payment to earnings or to part earnings
Fridley City Code - Appendix F Page 34
and part tax funds. To the extent that they are thus payable out of earnings or other than tax funds, such
bonds shall not be paid out of taxes. The total bonded debt of the City at the time of the issuance of any
bonds shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the last assessed valuation of the taxable property therein, or the
limit authorized by State law for cities of the same class, whichever is the greater, but in computing the total
bonded debt, certificates of indebtedness, bonds, warrants or other obligations issued before or after
adoption of this Charter shall not be included or counted if (1) held in a sinking fund maintained by the City;
or (2) issued for the acquisition, equipment, purchase, construction, maintenance, extension, enlargement or
improvement of street railways, telegraph or telephone lines, water, lighting, heat and power plants, or
either, or any other public convenience from which a revenue is or may be derived, owned and operated by
the City, or the acquisition of property needed in connection therewith, or for the construction of public
drainage ditches, storm and sanitary sewers, or for the acquisition of lands for streets, parks, or other public
improvements or for the improvement thereof, to the extent that they are payable from the proceeds of
assessments levied upon property especially benefited by such improvements; or (3) issued for the creation
of maintenance of a permanent improvement revolving fund; or (4) for the purpose of anticipating the
collection of general taxes for the year in which issued.
7.16. FORM AND REPAYMENT OF BONDS.
No bonds shall be issued to run for longer than the reasonable life expectancy of the property or
improvement for which the bonds are authorized, as ascertained and set forth in the resolution authorizing
such bonds, and in no case shall bonds be issued to run for more than thirty (30) years. The purposes for
which bonds are authorized shall be set forth in the resolution authorizing them and the proceeds from such
bonds shall not be diverted to any other purpose. It shall be the duty of the City Manager to include in the
budget estimates each year a sum or sums amply sufficient to pay the principal of, and the interest on, any
bonds which are to fall due in the coming fiscal year, and another sum sufficient to pay the interest for the
same year on the bonds which will be still outstanding. It shall be the duty of the Council, enforceable by
mandamus upon the suit of any bondholder or taxpayer, to include such sum or sums as may be necessary
for this purpose in the annual budget which it passes.
11.06. PUBLIC UTILITY, HOW SOLD.
No public utility owned by the City, whether acquired prior to the adoption of this Charter or thereafter,
shall be sold or otherwise disposed of by the City, unless the full terms of the proposition of said sale or
other disposition thereof, together with the price to be paid therefore, shall be embodied in an ordinance
passed by an affirmative vote of at least four (4) members of the Council, and submitted to the electorate at
a general or special election and approved by at least sixty (60) percent of those voting thereon.
11.07. MUNICIPAL UTILITY ORGANIZATIONS.
1. The Council by majority vote may provide for the establishment of a separate department to administer
the utility function, including the regulation of privately owned and operated utilities and the operation of
municipally owned utilities. Such department shall keep separate financial and accounting records for each
municipally owned and operated utility and prior to the first day of each fiscal year shall prepare a
comprehensive report of each utility in accordance with the City Manager's specifications.
12.03. OATH OF OFFICE.
Every officer of the City shall, before entering upon the duties of the office, take and subscribe an oath of
office in substantially the following form: "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) to support the Constitution of
the United States and of the State of Minnesota and to discharge faithfully the duties devolving upon me as
(Mayor, or Councilmember, or City Manager, etc.) of this City to the best of my judgement and ability."
12.04. CITY OFFICERS NOT TO ACCEPT FAVORS OR CONTRACTS.
Fridley City Code - Appendix F Page 35
No member of the City Council or employee of the City shall solicit or receive any pay, commission,
money, thing of value, or derive any profit, directly or indirectly, from or by reason of, any improvement,
Fridley City Code - Appendix F Page 36
alteration or repair required by authority of the City, or any contract to which the City shall be a party,
except lawful compensation, including authorized expenditures, or salary as such member of the City
Council or as such employee. No member of the City Council or employee of the City, except as otherwise
provided in this Charter, or by law, shall solicit, accept or receive, directly or indirectly, from any public
utility corporation or the owner of any public utility or franchise, any pass, frank, free ticket, free service, or
any other favor, upon terms more favorable than those granted the public generally. A violation of any of
the provisions of this Section shall disqualify the offender, if found guilty, from continuing in office or in
the employment of the City, and the offender shall be removed therefrom. Any contract with the City in
which any member of the City Council or employee of the City is, or becomes, directly or indirectly
interested personally shall be voidable at the option of the Council; and any money which shall have been
paid on such contract by the City may be recovered from any or all of the persons interested therein by joint
or several action.
12.05. OFFICIAL BONDS.
The offices of City Manager, the City Clerk and City Treasurer and such other officers or employees of the
City, as may be provided for by ordinance, shall each, before entering upon the duties of their respective
offices or employment, give a corporate surety bond to the City in such form and in such amount as may be
fixed by the Council as security for the faithful performance of their respective official duties and the
safekeeping of the public funds. Such bonds shall be approved by the City Council and approved as to form
by the City Attorney. They shall be filed with the Secretary of the Council. In the event the Secretary of the
Council holds more than one (1) office by appointment, the Secretary's bond or bonds shall be filed with the
Mayor. The provisions of the laws of the State relating to official bonds, not inconsistent with this Charter,
shall be complied with. The premiums on the corporate surety bonds hereinbefore provided for shall be
paid by the City.

The budget shall be a principal item of business at the last regular monthly meeting of the Council in
August, and the Council shall hold subsequent meetings from time to time until all the estimates have been
considered. The meetings shall be so conducted as to give interested citizens a reasonable amount of time in

auditor annually, not later than the date required by Minnesota Law, a statement of all the taxes levied, and
such taxes shall be collected and the payment thereof be enforced with and in like manner as state and
county taxes. No tax shall be invalid by reason of any informality in the manner of levying the same, nor
because the amount levied shall exceed the amount required to be raised for the special purpose for which
the same is levied, but in that case the surplus shall go into a suspense fund, and shall be used to reduce the
levy for the ensuing year. (Ref. 625)

within five (5) days following the filing of a sufficient petition. Any violation of the provisions of this

AN ORDINANCE AMENDING FRIDLEY CITY CHARTER, CHAPTER 7. TAXATION AND
FINANCES, SECTION 7.02.3.A. & B. PERTAINING TO UTILITY FEES
SECTION 1.
The Fridley City Council hereby finds the following:
That in 2000, a successful initiative petition proposing an amendment to the Fridley City Charter requiring voter
approval for tax increases beyond specified inflationary adjustments, or to create, expand or increase various fees
was received and placed on the November 7, 2000, municipal election ballot. The question was approved by the
voters by 57% of all people voting in the election. In an attempt to remedy confusing language contained in the
amendment and potentially dangerous and costly problems for the City, an ad hoc work group met and formulated
an ordinance designed to correct the language contained within the amendment. The ordinance was reviewed by the
City Charter Commission and recommended to the City Council for adoption. The ordinance was approved April 9,
2001.
That in 2004, due to the City’s increased costs in providing the sanitary sewer, storm water and water sales to its
customers, it was found that an unintended consequence to the City had been created by the amendment by not
allowing the City to recover its full costs for providing sanitary sewer, storm water and water sales. The Charter
Commission recommended adoption of an ordinance removing utility fees from Section 7.03.A. of the City Charter
as a defined fee that could not be increased above 5% or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower. The City Council
adopted the ordinance; however, a successful Referendum Petition requesting withdrawal of the ordinance was
received and placed on the November municipal election ballot. The question approving the ordinance failed and
the ordinance did not become effective.
During the 2006 budget preparation and planning it was determined that sanitary sewer, storm water and water costs
continue to increase due to a number of outside factors beyond the control of the city. Some of these factors include
federal mandates imposing increasingly higher standards for water and sewer, higher sewage disposal charges
imposed by the Metropolitan Council Environmental Services agency, and ongoing repairs and maintenance of the
system’s infrastructure. The City Council sent a Survey to all current city commissioners to query their thoughts
about utility rates. There was overwhelming agreement that the charter should be amended to allow the city to
recover its costs for sanitary sewer, storm water and water sales.
That a proposed charter amendment will help eliminate potential for long term subsidy of sanitary sewer, storm
water and water deficits; provide cost recovery for federal or state mandates; and maintain all other spending
restrictions which requires city council to obtain direct voter approval for programs that increase costs above 5% or
the rate of inflation, whichever is lower.
SECTION 2.
That Chapter 5, Section 5.09 of the Fridley City Charter states that, “The ways to initiate amendments to this Charter
are set forth in Minnesota Statutes. Minnesota Statutes Chapter 410.12, subd. 5, allows for the city council to
propose an amendment to the voters by ordinance. This ordinance shall be submitted to the charter commission for
review. After the charter commission completes its review and notifies the city council of its recommendation, the
city council may submit it to the people.
Fridley City Code Appendix F Page 74
SECTION 3.
That the Fridley City Council hereby ordains that the Fridley City Charter be amended and that a Special Election be
held in the City of Fridley on November 8, 2005, to allow the people to vote on the following question:
Shall the Fridley Charter be amended so as to permit water, sewer and storm water charges above the rate of
inflation without the passage of a referendum for each such increase?
? Yes
? No
SECTION 4.
That the City Clerk shall cause notice of said election to be given to the Anoka County Auditor within
53 days of said election and that notice of said election be published in the official newspaper of the
City for at least three weeks prior to said election; and
That the City Council ordains that the election shall be held at the usual polling locations for the state
general election, as set forth in Exhibit “A,” and that said election shall be held and conducted in
accordance with the Minnesota State Statutes applicable to municipal elections and the provisions of
the Home Rule Charter; and
That the City Council shall meet within seven days from said election as required by law for the purpose of
canvassing said election and declaring the results thereof.

G-4: ORDINANCE NO. 1087, ADOPTED 12/16/1996
ESTABLISHING BY INTERIM ORDINANCE A MORATORIUM WITHIN THE CITY ON THE
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW COMMUNICATION AND ANTENNA ARRAY TOWERS AND ON THE
USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF PROPERTY FOR SUCH NEW TOWERS THEREBY AMENDING
THE CITY CODE BY ADDING A NEW SECTION FOR THAT PURPOSE
(a) PREAMBLE
The City Council of Fridley, Minnesota, finds that recent advances in wireless communications technology have
resulted in a new generation of cellular communication services. These new services, called "Personal
Communications Services" ("PCS"), will likely require numerous antenna locations throughout the community.
These antennae may be located on buildings, water towers, and other similar structures, but will also frequently be
located on towers constructed or enlarged for that purpose.
The City Council of Fridley further finds that PCS providers have recently been licensed by the Federal
Communications Commission ("FCC") for the Minneapolis/St. Paul Major Trading Area ("MTA") and additional
providers are expected to be licensed in the near future. In addition, demand is increasing for traditional cellular
services from existing or new providers. Collectively, these entities are expected to begin or continue efforts at
antenna siting and construction within the City, including requests to construct new or enlarged communications
towers. Because of the recent advent of the technology requiring construction of multiple communications
towers, current Fridley ordinances may not adequately address issues relating to these types of towers, such as the
appropriate locations for these towers and the conditions under which they may be allowed within the City to
provide sufficient protection to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City. Issues which need to be
comprehensively addressed in reviewing the impact of this new, technology-driven, communications phenomenon
include, but are not limited to, structural and construction requirements and standards, co-location to avoid
unnecessary duplication of construction within the City, as well as setbacks and height limitations.
The City Council of Fridley, Minnesota, further finds that there is a need to study these and other issues to
determine what regulatory controls may need to be adopted to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The
City has issued a Request for Proposal to experienced consultants for the purpose of assisting the City's
professional planning and engineering staff in conducting a comprehensive study of the possible impact of these
towers on the City, and to provide, with City Staff, recommendations to the City of Fridley regarding PCS and
cellular service and other antenna or wireless tower issues. Time is also required for the City's staff to draft any
necessary proposals for amendments to City zoning regulations for the City Council's review and consideration.
The Council finds, therefore, that a moratorium is required in order to protect the planning process and to prevent
the construction of enlargement towers and the use and development of lands within the City for such towers
pending the completion of necessary studies and the consideration and implementation of new regulations on that
subject. At the present time it is expected that the necessary study and implementation can be completed within a
180-day period.
(b) MORATORIUM ESTABLISHED; SCOPE; DEFINITION OR "TOWER"
(1)In accordance with the findings set forth in the Preamble to this ordinance and pursuant to the authority of
Minnesota Statutes 462.355 (subd. 4). there is hereby established a moratorium on the construction,
erection, placement, reconstruction, enlargement or expansion of towers within the City and on the
development and use of property for such purposes.
(2)During the period of the moratorium neither pending nor to-be submitted applications for final site and
building plan approval, building permits, Conditional Use Permits ("CUP") and other permits or related
variance requests and approvals related to such tower work shall not be considered by the City, neither the
G-5
4
Planning Commission nor the City Council shall consider or grant approval of any application required for
such work, and no permits or variances for such work shall be issued.
(3)For the purposes of the moratorium, the term "tower" shall mean "any pole, spire, structure or combination
thereof, including supporting lines, cables, wires, braces and masts, intended primarily for the purpose of
mounting an antenna, meteorological device, or similar apparatus above grade."
(c) APPLICABILITY
The moratorium shall be applicable to public and private property throughout the City.
(d) EXCEPTIONS
The moratorium shall not apply to (1) the lawful use of existing towers or the lawful erection of antennae on such
existing towers, (2) the repair and/or maintenance of any existing tower provide that such work does not enlarge
or expand that tower, (3) work on a tower necessary to preserve health, safety, life or property in the face of an
emergency, and (4) tower work that has received all necessary permits and approvals from the City prior to the
effective date of this ordinance.
(e) PENALTIES
Any person, corporation or other entity that constructs, erects, places, reconstructs, enlarges, or expands a tower
in violation of this Section, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to any additional legal or
equitable remedies available to the City.
This Section shall take effect upon its adoption and publication, shall be effective for 180 days from its effective
date, and shall expire at that time unless further extended.
G-5: ORDINANCE NO. 1088, ADOPTED 01/27/1997
ESTABLISHING BY INTERIM ORDINANCE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF MINNESOTA
STATUTES SECTION 462.355, A MORATORIUM WITHIN THE CITY OF FRIDLEY ON
CONSTRUCTION OR EXPANSION OF MULTI-BAY WAREHOUSE OR SIMILAR TRUCKINGBASED
PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES
That the City Council of the City of Fridley, Minnesota, finds that truck traffic in areas surrounding large facilities
in the City used for warehousing or similar purposes can and has created a substantial potential for and actual
hazard to the health and safety of the citizens of the City.
Moreover, the age of the City has created a situation in which areas zoned for industrial uses in which warehouse
or trucking-based distribution operations are currently located within the City are near or adjacent to residential
neighborhoods.
That the City Council believes that the best use of property in areas zoned for industrial use is in manufacturing,
and that trucking and distribution facilities not directly related to manufacturing on the site may, in fact, detract
from and deter the City's efforts to attract and grow a strong manufacturing base within the City.
That recent trends in construction of commercial property would appear to create structures that, while not
formally designated as warehouses or even initially proposed to be used for a warehouse and distribution facility,
nevertheless contain the large numbers of multiple docking bays (in excess of ten docks) and other indicia of
intensive truck-related use that can generate the traffic increases that result in a threat to the health and safety of
citizens in the City in the future.
G-7
5
That the City Council has found that a study is necessary in order to determine whether such uses should continue
to be permitted in industrial zones in the City, particularly in instances in which there is close proximity to
residential areas and, if so, under what conditions or limitations that would adequately protect the citizens of the
City.
1.That the Planning and Economic development staff of the City of Fridley shall immediately conduct a full
review and study of the industrially zoned properties within the City to determine the compatibility of
warehouse or similar, trucking-based product distribution facilities with other allowable uses in the industrially
zoned areas of the city.
2.That a moratorium is declared on all construction, expansion or extension of any use in the industrially zoned
land within the City for the purpose of constructing or operating a warehouse or similar product-distribution
facility requiring multiple dock trucking facilities containing ten or more loading docks for truck use, or any
structure capable of being put to any such use without modification.
3.That the duration of the moratorium herein declared shall be 120 days from the date of final enactment of this
ordinance.

That the City Council of the City of Fridley, Minnesota, finds that truck traffic in areas surrounding large facilities
in the City used for warehousing or similar purposes can and has created a substantial potential for and actual

That the City Council has determined that additional time shall be required to complete the study and associated
ordinance amendments.
That the duration of the previously established 120 day moratorium herein declared be extended 60 days,
