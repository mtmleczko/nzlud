PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Lisbon, Maine. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of selectmen and at town meetings. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Code Attorney, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Twila D. Lycette, Town Clerk, Roger Therriault, Town Attorney, and the other members of the town staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the council-manager charter of the town, as adopted by the charter commission on Sept. 15, 2005. Amendments to the charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

ARTICLE I. - GRANT OF POWERS TO THE TOWN 

Sec. 1.01. - Incorporation. 
    The inhabitants of the Town of Lisbon, within the limits as now established or as hereafter established in the manner provided by law, shall be a municipal corporation by the name of the Town of Lisbon. 
Sec. 1.02. - Powers and Duties. 
    The Town shall have, exercise and enjoy all the rights, immunities, powers, privileges and franchises, and shall be subject to all the duties, liabilities and obligations provided for herein, or otherwise pertaining to or incumbent upon said Town as a municipal corporation, or the inhabitants or municipal authorities thereof. It may enact bylaws, regulations and ordinances not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the State of Maine, and impose penalties for the breach thereof, to be recovered for such uses as said bylaws, regulations and ordinances shall provide. The Town may acquire property within or without its corporate limits for any town purpose, in fee simple or any lesser interest or estate, by purchase, gift, devise, lease or condemnation, and may sell, lease, mortgage, hold, manage and control such property as its interest may require. 
Sec. 1.03. - Construction. 
    In this Charter, mention of a particular power shall not be construed to be exclusive or to restrict the scope of the powers that the Town would have if the particular power were not mentioned. The Charter shall be liberally construed to the end that the Town may have all the powers necessary or convenient for the conduct of its municipal affairs, including all powers the Town may assume pursuant to state laws and to the provisions of the State Constitution. 
Sec. 1.04. - Intergovernmental Relations. 
    The Town may exercise any of its powers or perform any of its functions and may participate in the financing thereof, jointly or in cooperation, by contract or otherwise, with any one or more municipalities, states or civil divisions or agencies thereof, or of the United States or any agency thereof. 
Sec. 1.05. - Separation of Powers. 
    The Town of Lisbon, pursuant to authority granted by the Home Rule Amendment to the Maine Constitution and statutory authority under the Maine Revised Statutes, exercises both legislative and administrative powers in carrying out its governmental functions. Legislative powers are vested solely and exclusively with the Town Council. This Legislative function pertains to the enactment of Ordinances, Regulations, Resolutions and Orders, and with the establishment of Policy, the purpose of which is to determine a course of conduct for Town government, and to formulate Rules of Conduct consistent therewith. Administrative powers are vested in the Town Manager and Town Staff. These executive functions vested in the Town Manager and Town Staff exist for the purpose of carrying out administratively the Legislative Policies adopted, approved and set down by the Town Council. This Charter recognizes a firm line of division between these two governmental functions and herein expresses the principal that members of the Town Council shall not be involved in the exercise of the administrative powers of the Town, except to determine that the Legislative Enactments and Policies adopted by Council are being carried out by Town Administration.

Within 20 days after the circulated petition has been filed, the Clerk shall complete a certificate as to its sufficiency, specifying, if it is insufficient, why it is defective. The Clerk shall promptly send a copy of the certificate to the recall committee by mail. A petition certified as insufficient for lack of the required number of valid signatures may be amended once if the recall committee files a notice of intention to amend it with the Clerk within two days after receiving the copy of the Clerk's certificate and files a supplementary petition upon additional papers within ten days after receiving the copy of such certificate. Such supplementary petition shall comply with the requirements of subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of section 8.31. Within five days after it is filed, the Clerk shall complete a certificate as to the sufficiency of the petition as amended and promptly send a copy of such certificate to the recall committee by mail as in the case of an original petition. If a petition or amended petition is certified as sufficient, or if a petition or amended petition is certified as insufficient, and the recall committee does not elect to amend or request Council review under subsection (2) of this section within the time required, the Clerk shall promptly present the certificate to the Council and the certificate shall then be a final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition. 
(2)  Council Review. If a petition or amended petition has been certified as being insufficient, the recall committee may, within two days after receiving the copy of such certificate, file a request that it be reviewed by the Council. The Council shall review the certificate at its next meeting following the filing of such request and approve or disapprove it. The Council's determination shall then be a final determination as to the sufficiency of the petition. 
(3)  Public Hearing . Subsequent to Council's determination of sufficiency, the Council shall convene a public hearing in order to allow the members of the public to attend and have an opportunity to discuss the recall petition and the basis and criteria for the recall. If the matter has been referred to an independent examiner, then, if possible, the independent examiner will chair the public hearing. If no independent examiner has been appointed or is available, then the chair of the Town Council shall appoint another individual to chair the public hearing. 
(4)  Court Review; New Petition. A final determination as to the sufficiency of a petition shall be subject to court review. A final determination of insufficiency, even if sustained upon court review, shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose. 
(d)  Actions on Petitions. The Council shall, within 30 days following a final determination that the recall petition is sufficient, hold a municipal election for the purpose of submitting the question of recall to a vote of the qualified voters of the Town or, in the case of recall of a Council member elected from a district, the qualified voters of that district. Pending the outcome of the election, the elected official who is the subject of the recall petition shall continue to exercise all of the privileges of his or her office. An official shall be recalled when a majority of those voting thereon shall have voted in the affirmative so long as the total number of votes cast for and against recall is at least equal to 30% of the total number of qualified voters who cast votes for Governor in the most recent gubernatorial election. Where the voters have recalled an official, the Council shall fill the vacancy thus created in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of this Charter. 
(e)  Candidacy of Incumbent. An official who is recalled by the voters shall be allowed to seek re-election at the special election called for the purpose of filling the vacancy created by the recall by filing a notice with the Town Clerk that he or she wishes to have his or her name appear on the ballot. The request shall be filed no later than the fifteenth day preceding the election. The official shall not be required to circulate a nomination petition. Other qualified voters who seek to fill the vacancy created by the recall shall have until the fifteenth day preceding the election to file with the Town Clerk a petition as required by the Charter for a regular municipal election. 
(f)  Recall Ballot. The ballot for recall shall contain the following question: "Shall (name of person being subjected to recall) be recalled from the office of (name of office)?" Immediately below such question shall appear in the following order the words "yes" and "no" and to the left of each, a square in which the voter may indicate his or her vote.

ARTICLE VII. - ADULT USE ESTABLISHMENTS 

Sec. 10-401. - Authority. 
    This article is enacted pursuant to the Home Rule Authority of municipalities under the laws of the State of Maine, Title 30-A M.R.S.A. § 3001 and under the authority of the Constitution of the State of Maine, Article VIII, Part 2, Section 1, as well as the general powers of municipalities to enact police power ordinances. 
(T.M. of 5-15-2006, art. 42) 
Sec. 10-402. - Findings. 
    There is convincing documented evidence, based on research and studies by municipalities throughout the nation, that adult use establishments, because of their very nature, have negative secondary affects on the areas surrounding these types of business uses, that these types of uses are consistently and strongly associated with perceived decreases in the value of both residential and commercial properties, and that they facilitate illicit and undesirable and, in some cases, criminal activities that are detrimental to the town and to its inhabitants. Such adult business establishments can often be incompatible with surrounding uses particularly where a number of these types of uses are concentrated within a limited geographical area or are located in close proximity to residential, daycare, school, house of worship, public parks or recreational areas, or other similar types of uses. A police power ordinance of this nature is a proper, reasonable and necessary means of controlling the negative secondary affects of such adult use establishments. 
(T.M. of 5-15-2006, art. 42) 
Sec. 10-403. - Purpose. 
    The requirements and regulations of this article are directed to controlling negative secondary affect of adult business establishments and are not intended to address, limit or otherwise curtail protected speech or expression. Therefore, it is the purpose of this article to provide performance standards and regulations relating to the time, place and manner of operation of adult use establishments, and to require their annual licensing. It is the further purpose of this article to prohibit and prevent their location in proximity to other types of uses that are incompatible, including, but not limited to, those uses listed in section 10-402 above. These regulations, performance standards and licensing requirements are necessary and appropriate to minimize the negative secondary affects identified in section 10-402 above, to protect incompatible uses from exposure to adult use establishment operations, and to prevent concentration of these types of uses in one area or geographical location. It is not the intent of this article to prohibit adult use establishments from locating in the community or to provide a reasonable opportunity for such uses to exist, but to regulate the impact of the business enterprise in accordance with the provisions of this article.

Secs. 10-519-10-530. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IX. - MARIJUANA DISPENSARY FACILITIES 

Sec. 10-531. - Authority. 
    This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the enabling provisions of article VIII, part 2, section 1 of the Maine Constitution, the provisions of 30-A M.R.S.A. § 301 (Home Rule), 30-A M.R.S.A. § 3001 (Ordinance Power), and 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4356 (Moratoria) § 1B (Necessity) and § 2 (Definite Term). 
(C.M. of 9-21-2010, V. 2010-155) 
Sec. 10-532. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this ordinance is to prohibit the processing and issuance of any land use permit or other permit required by the Town of Lisbon which would allow the construction, erection, location, enlargement or operation of a marijuana dispensary, and to provide the Town of Lisbon with an opportunity to establish regulations for administering the siting and to develop performance standards, for marijuana dispensaries within the town's boundaries and mitigate their impact on the neighborhood and the town in general. 
(C.M. of 9-21-2010, V. 2010-155; C.M. of 9-21-2010, V. 2010-155; C.M. of 6-2-2015, V. 2015-141 ) 
Sec. 10-533. - Statement of necessity and statutory compliance. 
    At the current time, the town's zoning ordinance and related ordinances do not provide an adequate basis for regulating marijuana dispensaries and the town's comprehensive plan does not address the issue of such uses in terms of its impact on the town and the necessity of providing appropriate siting and performance standards that would allow the use while protecting the public interests. This is especially true in view of the policy of the state to site these types of facilities on a regional basis. Town staff is being tasked with the development of ordinances that will deal with the citing of marijuana dispensaries and to develop performance standards that will protect the town from any negative impact from these types of facilities. 
    Based on these circumstances, the town makes a finding that the level of necessity required to support this moratorium ordinance does, in fact, exist and that the moratorium complies with the requirements of 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4356(1)(B), and that the absence of any regulations dealing with the establishment, construction or placement of marijuana dispensary facilities has the potential to create harm and negatively impact areas within the Town of Lisbon. 
(C.M. of 9-21-2010, V. 2010-155; C.M. of 9-21-2010, V. 2010-155; C.M. of 6-2-2015, V. 2015-141 )

(C.M. of 9-21-2010, V. 2010-155) 
Sec. 10-535. - Conflict with other ordinances. 
    The provisions of this ordinance supersede any conflicting provisions of the Town of Lisbon land use ordinance and site plan review ordinance. 
(C.M. of 9-21-2010, V. 2010-155) 
Sec. 10-536. - Moratorium on marijuana dispensary facilities construction and expansion. 
    During the time that this ordinance is in effect, and during any extension thereof, no official, employee, board, or committee of the Town of Lisbon shall receive, accept, or act upon any application for construction, erection, location, relocation, enlargement, or establishment, of a marijuana dispensary use within the Town of Lisbon, or grant any permit, approval, or permission for such a facility.

    This ordinance shall take effect as of June 2, 2015, and shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days, after which it shall be repealed, unless extended in accordance with section 10-538 below.

Editor's note- C.M. of 4-4-2017, V. 2017-73 , provides for an extension of the moratorium. See § 10-541. 
Sec. 10-538. - Extension. 
    Under circumstances where the issues giving rise to the need for this moratorium continue to exist and have not been fully resolved, and where the town has made reasonable progress toward addressing these issues, the moratorium may be extended by the municipal officers for additional 180 day periods after appropriate notice and hearing and in accordance with the provisions of 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4356(3). 
(C.M. of 9-21-2010, V. 2010-155) 
Editor's note- C.M. of 4-4-2017, V. 2017-73 , provides for an extension of the moratorium. See § 10-541. 
Sec. 10-539. - Separability. 
    If any section, subsection, or provision of this ordinance is declared to be invalid for any reason by any competent court, such a decision shall not affect the validity of any other section, subsection, or provision of this ordinance. 
(C.M. of 9-21-2010, V. 2010-155) 
Sec. 10-540. - Violation. 
    Any violation of the terms of this moratorium ordinance shall be subject to the enforcement penalties under 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4452.

Sec. 10-541. - Moratorium on retail marijuana establishments, retail marijuana stores, and retail marijuana social clubs. 
    Whereas, the "Marijuana Legalization Act," has become law in Maine, codified in the Maine Revised Statutes in Title 7, chapter 417; and 
    Whereas, the Marijuana Legalization Act (hereinafter, "Act") authorizes municipalities to regulate the number of retail marijuana stores and the location and operation of retail marijuana social clubs and retail marijuana establishments, including retail marijuana stores, retail marijuana cultivation facilities, retail marijuana products manufacturing facilities and retail marijuana testing facilities, as those terms are defined in the Act, as well as providing the option to prohibit the operation of retail marijuana social clubs and retail marijuana establishments, including stores, cultivation facilities, manufacturing facilities and testing facilities, within their jurisdiction; and 
    Whereas, the proposed Act will not limit the privileges or rights afforded by the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Act (22 M.R.S.A. §§ 2421 - 2430-B) to qualifying patients, primary caregivers, or registered dispensaries, including cultivation facilities associated with any of those classifications; and 
    Whereas, the Town's current ordinances do not include any regulations related to retail marijuana stores, retail marijuana establishments or retail marijuana social clubs under the proposed new Act; and 
    Whereas, the unregulated location and operation of retail marijuana establishments, retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs within the Town of Lisbon raises legitimate and substantial questions about the impact of such establishments, stores and social clubs on the Town, including questions about the compatibility of retail marijuana establishments, retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs with existing uses and development in residential, commercial and industrial zoning districts; the potential adverse health and safety effects of retail marijuana establishments, retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs on the community if not properly regulated; the possibility of illicit sale and use of marijuana and marijuana products to minors and misuse of marijuana and marijuana products by those who would abuse the uses authorized under the Act; potential criminal activity associated with the cultivation, manufacturing, sale and use of marijuana and marijuana products for non-medicinal purposes and the potential increased burden on the Town's police and fire departments; and the adequacy of the Town's streets and infrastructure to accommodate the additional traffic and/or population that may result from the presence of retail marijuana establishments, retail marijuana stores or retail marijuana social clubs; and 
    Whereas, the possible effect of the location and operation of retail marijuana establishments and/or retail marijuana stores and/or retail marijuana social clubs within the Town has potentially serious implications for the health, safety and welfare of the Town and its residents; and 
    Whereas, the Town needs time to review the Act and to review its own ordinances to determine the implications of future proposed retail marijuana establishments and/or retail marijuana stores and/or retail marijuana social clubs to develop reasonable ordinances governing the location and operations of such establishments and stores and social clubs to address the concerns cited above; and 
    Whereas, the Town's current ordinances are insufficient to prevent serious public harm that could be caused by the unregulated development of retail marijuana establishments and retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs and other uses authorized by the Act, thereby necessitating a moratorium; and 
    Whereas, the town council, the administration and the planning board, with the professional advice and assistance of the police department, shall study the Town's current ordinances to determine the land use and other regulatory implications of retail marijuana establishments and retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs and consider what locations, if any, and conditions of approval, if any, might be appropriate for such uses; and 
    Whereas, a moratorium is necessary to prevent an overburdening of public facilities that is reasonably foreseeable as the result of retail marijuana establishments and retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs and other uses authorized by the Act, being located in the Town; and 
    Whereas, it is anticipated that such a study, review, and development of recommended ordinance changes will take at least one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date the Town enacts this Moratorium Ordinance on retail marijuana establishments and retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs; 
    Now, therefore, be it ordained by the town council of the Town of Lisbon, that the following Moratorium Ordinance on retail marijuana establishments and retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs be, and hereby is, enacted, and, in furtherance thereof, the town council does hereby declare a moratorium on the location, operation or licensing of any retail marijuana social clubs and any retail marijuana establishments, including retail marijuana stores, retail marijuana cultivation facilities, retail marijuana products manufacturing facilities and retail marijuana testing facilities, within the Town. 
    This Moratorium Ordinance shall take effect, once enacted by the town council, but shall be applicable as of April 25, 2017 as expressly provided below. The moratorium shall remain in effect for one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of applicability of this Ordinance, unless extended, repealed, or modified by the town council, for the express purpose of drafting an amendment or amendments to the Town's current ordinances to protect the public from health and safety risks including, but not limited to, compatibility of retail marijuana establishments, retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs with existing and permitted uses in residential, commercial and industrial zoning districts; the correlation of retail marijuana establishments, retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs with medical marijuana cultivation facilities and dispensaries, all as defined in the Act; the potential adverse health and safety effects of retail marijuana establishments and retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs on the community if not properly regulated; the possibility of illicit sale and use of marijuana and marijuana products to minors and misuse of marijuana and marijuana products by those who would abuse the uses authorized under the new law; criminal activity associated with the cultivation, manufacturing, sale and use of marijuana and marijuana products for non-medicinal purposes and the potential increased burden on the public safety agencies serving the Town in responding to the same; and the adequacy of the Town's infrastructure to accommodate the additional traffic and/or population that may result from the presence of retail marijuana establishments or retail marijuana stores or retail marijuana social clubs in the Town. 
    Be it further ordained, that this Ordinance shall apply to retail marijuana stores and retail marijuana social clubs and retail marijuana establishments, including retail marijuana stores, retail marijuana cultivation facilities, retail marijuana products manufacturing facilities and retail marijuana testing facilities, as those terms are defined by the Act, codified at 7 M.R.S.A. §§ 2442 (36), (38), (39), (40) (41), that may be proposed to be located within the Town on or after April 25, 2017 the applicability date of this Ordinance; and 
    Be it further ordained, that notwithstanding the provisions of 1 M.R.S.A. § 302 or any other law to the contrary, this Ordinance, when enacted, shall govern any proposed retail marijuana establishments or retail marijuana stores or retail marijuana social clubs for which an application for a building permit, Certificate of Occupancy, site plan or any other required approval has not been submitted to and granted final approval by the Code Enforcement Officer, Planning Board or other Municipal official or board prior to the applicability date of this Ordinance; and 
    Be it further ordained, that no person or organization shall develop or operate a retail marijuana establishment or retail marijuana store or retail marijuana social club within the Town on or after the effective date of this Ordinance without complying with whatever ordinance amendment or amendments the town council may enact as a result of this Moratorium Ordinance; and 
    Be it further ordained, that during the time this Moratorium Ordinance is in effect, no officer, official, employee, office, administrative board or agency of the Town shall accept, process, approve, deny, or in any other way act upon any application for a license, building permit or any other type of land use approval or permit and/or any other permits or licenses related to a retail marijuana establishment or retail marijuana stores or retail marijuana social club; and 
    Be it further ordained, that those provisions of the Town's ordinances that are inconsistent or conflicting with the provisions of this Ordinance, are hereby repealed to the extent that they are applicable for the duration of the moratorium hereby ordained, and as it may be extended as permitted by law, but not otherwise; and 
    Be it further ordained, that if retail marijuana establishments or retail marijuana stores or retail marijuana social clubs are established in violation of this Ordinance, each day of any continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation of this Ordinance, and the Town shall be entitled to all rights available to it in law and equity, including, but not limited to, fines and penalties, injunctive relief, and its reasonable attorney's fees and costs in prosecuting any such violations; and 
    Be it further ordained, that should any section or provision of this Ordinance be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such a declaration shall not invalidate any other section or provision. 
(C.M. of 4-4-2017, V. 2017-73 ) 
Sec. 10-542. - Emergency moratorium on medical marijuana storefronts. 
    Whereas, the Town enacted a Moratorium on Retail Marijuana Establishments and Retail Marijuana Stores and Retail Marijuana Social Clubs on April 4, 2017, and extended by votes of the Town Council on September 19, 2017 and November 17, 2017; 
    Whereas, medical marijuana storefronts are a newly proposed type of use which is not specifically regulated under the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Act, and which causes the same questions and concerns set forth in the Moratorium on Retail Marijuana Establishments and Retail Marijuana Stores and Retail Marijuana Social Clubs (such questions and concerns being included herein by reference); 
    Whereas, the Town needs time to review pending regulations adopted by the State and to review its own Code of Ordinances to determine the implications of future proposed medical marijuana storefronts to develop reasonable ordinances governing the location and operations of such establishments; 
    Whereas, the Town Council, with the advice and assistance of the administration and police department, shall study the Town's current Code of Ordinances to determine the land use and other regulatory implications of medical marijuana storefronts and consider what locations, if any, and approval and performance standards, if any, might be appropriate for such uses; and 
    Whereas, it is anticipated that such a study, review, and development of recommended Ordinance, changes will take at least one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date the Town enacts this Moratorium Ordinance on Medical Marijuana Storefronts; 
    Now, therefore, be it ordained by the Town Council of the Town of Lisbon, that the following Moratorium Ordinance on Medical Marijuana Storefronts (the "Moratorium Ordinance") be, and hereby is, enacted, and, in furtherance thereof, the Town Council does hereby declare a moratorium on the location, operation or licensing of any medical marijuana storefronts within the Town. For the purposes of this Moratorium Ordinance, a medical marijuana storefront is defined as an establishment which resembles a retail storefront in terms of signage, hours of operation and accessibility to patrons, and which is operated by one or more registered Primary Caregivers as defined by 22 M.R.S.A. § 2422(8-A) for the sale of marijuana and marijuana products to Qualifying Patients as defined by 22 M.R.S.A. § 2422(9). 
    This Moratorium Ordinance shall take effect once enacted by the Town Council, in accordance with the provisions of the Town Charter and, notwithstanding 1 M.R.S.A. § 302, shall be applicable to Medical Marijuana Storefronts for which applications are not pending or approved as of January 12, 2018. The moratorium shall run concurrently with the Moratorium on Retail Marijuana Establishments and Retail Marijuana Stores and Retail Marijuana Social Clubs and shall expire on the date said Moratorium expires, unless extended, repealed, or modified by the Town Council, for the express purpose of drafting an amendment or amendments to the Town's current Code of Ordinances to protect the public from health and safety risks including, but not limited to, compatibility of medical marijuana storefronts with existing and permitted uses in residential, commercial and industrial zoning districts, the potential adverse health and safety effects of medical marijuana storefronts on the community if not properly regulated, and the adequacy of the Town's infrastructure to accommodate the presence of medical marijuana storefronts in the Town. 
    Be it further ordained, that this Moratorium Ordinance shall apply to medical marijuana storefronts that may be proposed to be located within the Town after the enactment of this Ordinance; and 
    Be it further ordained, that no person or organization shall develop or operate a medical marijuana storefront within the Town on or after the enactment date of this Moratorium Ordinance without complying with whatever ordinance amendment or amendments the Town Council may enact as a result of this Moratorium Ordinance; and 
    Be it further ordained, that during the time this Moratorium Ordinance is in effect, no officer, official, employee, office, administrative board or agency of the Town shall accept, process, approve, deny, or in any other way act upon any application for a license, building permit or any other type of land use approval or permit and/or any other permits or licenses related to a medical marijuana storefront unless the application under review was filed with the Town prior to the enactment date of this Ordinance; and 
    Be it further ordained, that those provisions of the Town's current Code of Ordinances that are inconsistent or conflicting with the provisions of this Ordinance, are hereby repealed to the extent that they are applicable for the duration of the moratorium hereby ordained, and as it may be extended as permitted by law, but not otherwise; and 
    Be it further ordained, that if medical marijuana storefronts are established in violation of this Moratorium Ordinance, each day of any continuing violation shall constitute a separate violation of this Moratorium Ordinance, and the Town shall be entitled to all rights available to it in law and equity, including, but not limited to, fines and penalties, injunctive relief, and its reasonable attorney's fees and costs in prosecuting any such violations; and 
    Be it further ordained, that should any section or provision of this Moratorium Ordinance be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such a declaration shall not invalidate any other section or provision. 
Emergency Declaration 
    The Town Council declares the existence of an emergency because the Code of Ordinances is insufficient to prevent serious public harm that could be caused by the unregulated development of medical marijuana storefronts, thereby necessitating a moratorium to provide an opportunity for the Town to review the potential impacts and harm that may be caused by such storefronts, and to amend its Code of Ordinances to mitigate the potential impact and harm on the Town and its residents. In accordance with Section 2.08 of the Town Charter, this Moratorium shall be enacted as an emergency ordinance. It shall be effective immediately upon enactment and shall remain in effect through the ninety-first (91st) day following the date on which it was adopted, unless adopted as a regular ordinance within that time period or unless it is terminated or extended in accordance with this Ordinance.

Sec. 14-36. - Adoption. 
    The General Assistance Ordinance, prepared by the Maine Municipal Association, is hereby adopted and incorporated herein by reference, except for such portions as are deleted, modified, or amended in this article. Please refer to the ordinance on the town's website: http://www.lisbonme.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={12E2A1D4-2E43-4FF1-A31F-ED0ADC91032C}

See Appendix C of this ordinance for the current year's housing maximums. It is the applicant's responsibility to find suitable housing, although the administrator may help the applicant find housing when appropriate. The administrator will inform the applicant of the allowed housing maximums to assist the applicant in his or her search for housing. The allowed maximum for any applicant will be the categorical housing maximum representing the minimum dwelling unit space necessary to adequately shelter the applicant household.

(C.M. of 7-17-2012, V. 2012-92) 
APPENDICES 
Appendix A 
    Appendix A is a listing of the overall maximum levels of assistance pertaining to all municipalities in Maine. These new overall maximum levels of assistance have been calculated on the basis of the 2009-2010 HUD Fair Market Rent (FMR) values that will become effective on October 1, 2009. These maximum levels of assistance are established by Maine General Assistance law (22 MRSA (4305(3-B)) and cannot be altered by action of the municipal officers. 
    Amend Appendix A of the General Assistance Ordinance to incorporate the following maximum levels of assistance to be effective on and after October 16, 2018 for Androscoggin County, as follows: 
GA Overall Maximums 1 person household 669 2 person household 736 3 person household 932 4 person household 1193 5 person household 1461  
(C.M. of 11-4-2009, V. 2009-158; C.M. of 7-17-2012, V. 2012-92; C.M. of 12-20-2016, V. 2016-269 ; C.M. of 11-14-2017, V. 2017-282 ; C.M. of 10-16-2018, V. 2018-229 ) 
Appendix B 
    Appendix B is a listing of the maximum levels of assistance for food. These maximum levels are the same as the USDA 2009-2010 Thrifty Food Plan, which are presumed to be reasonable by regulation of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Note that the Appendix B maximums in this packet remain unchanged from the mid-year increase that was made in March 2009, due to the federal economic stimulus package. If the municipal officers wish to amend these maximum levels of food assistance, a local survey must be developed and provided to DHHS to justify the proposed alterations. 
    Amend Appendix B of the General Assistance Ordinance to incorporate the following maximum levels of assistance to be effective on and after October 16, 2018 for Androscoggin County, as follows: 
1 person household $192.00 2 person household $352.00 3 person household $504.00 4 person household $640.00 5 person household $760.00

Appendix C 
    Appendix C is a listing of the maximum levels of assistance for housing (both heated and unheated). These maximum levels were developed by MMA using 2009-2010 HUD Fair Market Rent values that include utility costs. Because the FMR numbers include utility and heating costs, the applicable average utility and heating allowances, as developed by the Maine State Housing Authority (MSHA), are subtracted from the FMR to obtain a pure "housing" cost. 
    Amend Appendix C of the General Assistance Ordinance to incorporate the following maximum levels of assistance to be effective on and after October 16, 2018 for Androscoggin County, as follows: 
Bedrooms Unheated Heated 1 $540.00 $664.00 2 $711.00 $847.00 3 $907.00 $1,094.00 4 $1,122.00 $1,349.00

GA Housing Maximums
(Heated & Unheated Rents) 
NOTE: NOT ALL MUNICIPALITIES SHOULD ADOPT THESE SUGGESTED HOUSING MAXIMUMS! Municipalities should ONLY consider adopting the following numbers, if these figures are consistent with local rent values. If not, a market survey should be conducted and the figures should be altered accordingly. The results of any such survey must be presented to DHHS prior to adoption. Or , no housing maximums should be adopted and eligibility should be analyzed in terms of the Overall Maximum-Appendix A. ( See Instruction Memo for further guidance .) 
Appendix D

    In accordance with the following conditions, the administrator may allow as a budgetable expense the amount of an applicant's summer-loaded special payment arrangement (SPA) or budget payment arrangement (BPA), as calculated by the electric utility and entered into by the applicant, even when the arranged payment amount exceeds the above maximums or actual usage. 
1)  The SPA or BPA, when annualized, does not exceed the above monthly maximums, when annualized, for non-electrically heated dwelling units. 
2)  The SPA or BPA, when annualized, does not exceed the above monthly maximums and the fuel assistance maximums, when annualized, for electrically heated dwelling units. 
3)  The administrator determines, in consultation with the utility, that the payment arrangement does not include in any part the installment payment of past debt unless the municipality guaranteed to the utility the allowance of such an arrangement as a condition of averting a disconnection. 
    Pursuant to the use-of-income requirements in section 6.6 of this ordinance, whenever the administrator budgets for SPA's or BPA's under this section, the recipient will be required to pay the SPA or BPA him or herself to the extent of the income capacity of the household.

    When the dwelling unit is heated electrically, the maximum amount allowed for heating purposes will be calculated by multiplying the number of gallons of fuel allowed for that month by the current price per gallon. 
    When fuels such as wood, coal and/or natural gas are used for heating purposes, they will be budgeted at actual rates, if they are reasonable. However, no eligible applicant shall be considered to need more than: 
7 tons of coal per year 
8 cords of wood per year 
126,000 cubic feet of natural gas per year, or 
1,000 gallons of propane.

Appendix I 
26 MRSA § 1043 (23) 
    Misconduct. "Misconduct" means a culpable breach of the employee's duties or obligations to the employer or a pattern of irresponsible behavior, which in either case manifests a disregard for a material interest of the employer. This definition relates only to an employee's entitlement to benefits and does not preclude an employer from discharging an employee for actions that are not included in this definition of misconduct. A finding that an employee has not engaged in misconduct for purposes of this chapter may not be used as evidence that the employer lacked justification for discharge. [1999, c. 464, §2 (rpr).] 
A.  The following acts or omissions are presumed to manifest a disregard for a material interest of the employer. If a culpable breach or a pattern of irresponsible behavior is shown, these actions or omissions constitute "misconduct" as defined in this subsection. This does not preclude other acts or omissions from being considered to manifest a disregard for a material interest of the employer. The acts or omissions included in the presumption are the following: 
(1)  Refusal, knowing failure or recurring neglect to perform reasonable and proper duties assigned by the employer; 
(2)  Unreasonable violation of rules that are reasonably imposed and communicated and equitably enforced; 
(3)  Unreasonable violation of rules that should be inferred to exist from common knowledge or from the nature of the employment; 
(4)  Failure to exercise due care for punctuality or attendance after warnings; 
(5)  Providing false information on material issues relating to the employee's eligibility to do the work or false information or dishonesty that may substantially jeopardize a material interest of the employer; 
(6)  Intoxication while on duty or when reporting to work or unauthorized use of alcohol while on duty; 
(7)  Using illegal drugs or being under the influence of such drugs while on duty or when reporting to work; 
(8)  Unauthorized sleeping while on duty; 
(9)  Insubordination or refusal without good cause to follow reasonable and proper instructions from the employer; 
(10)  Abusive or assaultive behavior while on duty, except as necessary for self-defense; 
(11)  Destruction or theft of things valuable to the employer or another employee; 
(12)  Substantially endangering the safety of the employee, coworkers, customers or members of the public while on duty; 
(13)  Conviction of a crime in connection with the employment or a crime that reflects adversely on the employee's qualifications to perform the work; or 
(14)  Absence for more than 2 work days due to incarceration for conviction of a crime. 
[1999, c. 464, §2 (new).] 
B.  "Misconduct" may not be found solely on: 
(1)  An isolated error in judgment or a failure to perform satisfactorily when the employee has made a good faith effort to perform the duties assigned; 
(2)  Absenteeism caused by illness of the employee or an immediate family member if the employee made reasonable efforts to give notice of the absence and to comply with the employer's notification rules and policies; or 
(3)  Actions taken by the employee that were necessary to protect the employee or an immediate family member from domestic violence if the employee made all reasonable efforts to preserve the employment.

ARTICLE III. - CURFEW FOR MINORS 

Sec. 26-61. - Purpose and necessity. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to deal with problems that have arisen by virtue of unrestricted use of streets and public areas by minors in the town. These problems have manifested themselves in a general rise in criminal activities by minors and an increase in the percentage of serious night crimes, mischief, vandalism and drug usage by minors. This article is intended to reduce the opportunity of minors to participate in this type of behavior and to reduce minors' exposure in general to this type of activity. In enacting this article, the town has in mind the peculiar vulnerability of children and susceptibility to be influenced by the type of activity which this article seeks to prohibit. The town is also aware that minors constitute a separate classification for purposes of imposition of this article, as evidenced by numerous laws, ordinances and regulations which restrict minors' abilities and inhibit their personal liberties based on their inability to make critical decisions in an informed, mature manner and their susceptibility, due to their lack of maturity and experience, to participation in unlawful and gang-related activities and to their potential victimization by older perpetrators. The town also believes that this legislation enhances and promotes the parental role in child rearing. It has been demonstrated that increased parental control over minors decreases the likelihood of that minor's participation in criminal activities, mischief, vandalism and drug-related activities. The penalties provided in this article also will have the effect of inducing parents to exercise their parental control. 
(b)  The town also is mindful of its obligation to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons, and of its obligation to provide generally for the health, safety and welfare of the public by reducing minor crime, mischief, violence, vandalism and drug-related and gang-related activities within the town. For these reasons, the town believes that this article will promote the achievement of these goals and will be in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare.

    Minor means any person who is less than 18 years of age. 
    Public place means any location to which the general public has access and the right to resort for any lawful purpose.

(b)  These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this chapter and are separate from all other fees chargeable by the Town. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-157. - Source of revenues. 
    The source of the revenues needed for retiring debt services, capital expenditures, operation and maintenance of the public sewer system shall be a sewer service charge assigned to Owners of property located within the limits of the Town whose residency, property or place of business is connected within the boundaries of the public sewer system. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-158. - Establishment of rates. 
    Sewer service charge rates, including "Ready-to-Serve" charges shall be determined by the Town Council after notice and hearing. This charge will be computed and billed on a quarterly basis throughout each calendar year and will be based on the volume of water consumed, as determined by records of the Water Department. In the event, the water supply is not metered, the customer shall be billed at a flat rate determined by multiplying together the number of bedrooms in the dwelling unit, 1,100 cubic feet per quarter per bedroom, and the prevailing user charge per cubic foot. The number of units will be determined by assessment records or an assessor's review. Alternatively, a customer at his own expense can purchase a meter and outside reader from the Water Department in order to obtain a metered rate. Each customer shall be required to install the meter and outside reader utilizing a licensed plumber at their own expense. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-159. - Billing abatements. 
    All billing shall also be subject to just and equitable discounts and abatements in exceptional cases (Refer to Article XII), or in the case of private water supply, a fair estimate shall be used or reading from an installed water meter shall be made. (Refer to Section 34-184). The Town may also assess capacity consumption fees and impact fees, as applicable, for new or modified sewer connections. (Refer to Sections 34-164.) 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-160. - Summer usage policy. 
    To allow for the correction for the excessive summer usage due to irrigation and filling pools, billing for the two summer quarters will be based on the average of the two winter quarters or consumption reported by the Lisbon Water Department, whichever is less. (Refer to Appendix D.) 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-161. - Changes in rates. 
    The Town Council reserves the right to change the rates of sewer service charges originally or previously assigned to any property owner. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-162. - Collection of unpaid rates. 
    The owner of the property connected to the municipal sewer will be charged for the use of sewer service. Each sewer charge levied pursuant to this division which remains unpaid shall be collected as provided in 30-A M.R.S.A. § 3406(3). (See Article XI.) 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-163. - Interest charges. 
    An interest charge at the same rate as established by the Town for uncollected taxes will be made on all sewer bills not paid within thirty (30) days after the due date. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-164. - Special industrial or commercial rates. 
    A special sewer service charge shall be established for any industrial firm, commercial user, who, by virtue of the volume, strength or unusual characteristic of their waste alone, would overload or upset the capacity of efficiency of the sewerage works or any part thereof if such waste entered the public sewer, if the cost to treat that wastewater is higher than that of typical domestic sanitary sewage, or whose waste disposal situation is such that it would be in the public interest to waive the basic requirements. The Town, after appropriate study, shall establish a Special Sewer Service Charge to the industrial firm, commercial user, or organization by separate agreement with said firm. The appropriate portions of the preceding sections, as well as the equitable rights of the public, shall be the basis for such an arrangement. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-165. - "Ready-to-serve" fee. 
    The Town may assess a "Ready-to-Serve" fee to be paid by any property owner (with an improved lot or vacant lot) that has an active Building Permit and Sewer Application Permit or if the lot was previously billed, unless the stub has been capped as approved by the Superintendent. This only applies when the public sewer service is available within two-hundred feet (200') of the structure to be served, but for any reason, has yet to connect to the sewer, provided that a building sewer stub has been installed and is ready for connection. If no building sewer stub is in-place, no Ready-to-Serve fee will be assessed. This fee is intended to offset the cost of making sewer service available to the property in the future even though there is not a current physical connection. This fee will be billed quarterly at the same time as connected sewer users receive their sewer bills. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-166. - Sanitary sewer connection fee. 
    Before the issuance of a connection permit for any activity requiring a connection permit under this chapter, the applicant shall pay to the Town a sanitary sewer connection fee in accordance with a fee schedule established by order of the Town Council as shown in Appendix B. The purpose of this fee is to allow the Town to recover a portion of the costs of the wastewater infrastructure capacity which will be consumed by a new sewer user or by the modified use of an existing sewer user. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-167. - Impact fee for existing infrastructure. 
    In instances where any proposed development or use of any parcel of land in the Town results in the need to construct, replace, upgrade, reconstruct, enlarge, expand, or repair any essential infrastructure of the sanitary sewer system in order to accommodate the wastewater attributable to the proposed development or use, the Town may require the payment of an impact fee to cover the costs of the required improvements. The amount of the impact fee shall be determined by the Town Council based on the portion of the improvements that will be utilized by the development or use. All impact fees shall be deposited into a special interest-bearing reserve fund, and any impact fee may only be expended for the purpose for which it was collected. If the Town does not use any impact fee within ten years from the date of payment, Town shall refund that impact fee, with interest, to the person who paid the fee, or that person's successor or assignee. In addition, Town shall refund any portion of the impact fee that exceeds the development's share of the Town's actual costs for the improvements associated with that impact fee. If the development or use for which an impact fee was paid is not commenced within two years from the date of payment of the fee, the Town shall refund the impact fee, with interest, to the person who paid the fee, or that person's successor or assignee, unless the Town and the person enter into a written agreement extending the time for the commencement of the development or use. Provided, however, that if Town has incurred costs or entered into obligations in reliance on the proposed development and the payment of the impact fee, Town may retain so much of the impact fee as may be reasonably necessary and appropriate to cover those costs or obligations. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-168. - Construction of excess capacity. 
    The Town may elect, at its sole discretion, to construct excess capacity in a service area in conjunction with a project requiring the assessment of an impact fee. For example, a new sewer line upgrade or a pump station upgrade may be constructed with capacity beyond that needed for the current project since the sizing of such projects is not exact. Should a developer pay the full cost of a project through impact fees, the Town shall collect proportionate impact fees from future connections that benefit from the added capacity and shall refund the newly collected fees to the previous developer or their assignees. Should the Town elect to pay a portion of the initial capital costs for which impact fees are assessed, it may recover proportionate future impact fees from future connected sewer users that benefit from the added incremental capacity that was provided.

ARTICLE XI. - LIENS FOR NON-PAYMENT 

Sec. 34-176. - Lien on premises. 
    Each sewer charge levied pursuant to the ordinance is hereby made a lien on the premises and if the same is not paid within 30 days after it shall be due and payable, it shall be certified to the Treasurer of the Town who shall place the same on the real property tax bill for that year with interest and penalties allowed by law, and be collected as other Town taxes are collected.

    There shall be a lien placed on real estate served or benefited by a municipal sewer to secure the payment of sewer service charges duly established hereunder which shall take precedence over all other claims on such real estate excepting only claims for taxes. The Town shall have the same authority and power to collect such sewer service charges as are granted in 38 M.R.S.A. § 3406 as amended. In addition to the lien established hereby, the Town may bring a civil action against the party so charged for the amount of said sewer service charges in any court competent to try the same, and in such action, may recover the amount of such charges with legal interest on the same from the date of said charge plus costs.

ARTICLE XII. - ABATEMENTS 

Sec. 34-181. - Abatement recommendation and due care. 
    All requests for sewer abatements shall be forwarded to the Superintendent for his recommendation and then shall be forwarded to the Town Manager for decision. Abatements of sewer use charges may be granted by the Town Manager based on recommendation by the Superintendent upon application of a ratepayer where the ratepayer can demonstrate that a "loss" of water that did not enter the sewer occurred due to no fault of the ratepayer, his or her agents, or employees. Ratepayers are responsible for exercising "due care" in the maintenance of their water and sewer systems to prevent water losses for purposes of abatement. "Due care" shall be defined as the normal and reasonable steps which would be taken by a prudent individual in operating and maintaining their water and sewer systems. Abatements may also be granted if an applicant can demonstrate that an error in billing occurred or that significant volumes of water did not enter the sewer. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-182. - One-time sewer usage abatement. 
    A one-time sewer abatement will be assessed at the request of the property owner for consumption calculated to be above four times the average water use for the previous year. This abatement can only be used once per each property owner. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-183. - Abatement review. 
    The Town Manager shall be responsible for reviewing the basis for the requested abatement in light of the "due care" standard established in Section 34-181 above. The Superintendent or his designee shall make a record of the results of the investigation which shall include an estimate of the amount of water lost. The estimate of water loss shall be based on the previous four quarters of water consumption, if available, and consideration of seasonal water use patterns. If not available, the abatement shall be based on the current flat rate billing procedure until such time there are a minimum of two (2) quarters available. This estimate of water loss shall be used to calculate the amount of the abatement should one be granted. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-184. - Billing records. 
    When an abatement is granted, the Town Treasurer shall be responsible for taking the necessary steps to correct the appropriate billing records to reflect the abatement or to process a credit where the sewer use charge in question has been paid. Any abatement provided, will only apply to the specific account being abated. For abatements involved in real estate transactions, the abatement will only be granted after the final meter readings. If no prior history is available on which to base an abatement, an excessive first bill will receive an abatement based on what the non-metered rate would be for a similar building. After the property has been billed for consumption for the first year, the abatement shall be reassessed and appropriate charges made. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-185. - Requirement for secondary meter. 
    Abatements shall not be granted for water used for watering lawns, gardens, filling swimming pools, or other outside water uses outside their summer average quarters, unless ratepayers, at their own cost, install a secondary water meter that will measure only water used for these water use purposes. The installation of the meter shall be inspected by the Superintendent or his designee and must have an outside reader. The ratepayer will read the meter quarterly in order to allow abatements, if applicable, to quarterly sewer bills. The Superintendent reserves the right to periodically inspect such meters to ensure continued compliance with the requirements of this subsection. Where a secondary meter is installed, the ratepayer may be granted an abatement. The Town Manager shall have the ability to prorate and abate the first bill of a non-metered flat rate account based on the date of the sewer entrance permit. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-186. - Abatement period. 
    An abatement request shall only be considered for a maximum six month (two quarter period). If such conclusive proof cannot be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, the abatement may be denied for all or part of the maximum period. The Town Manager can approve an abatement request outside this timeframe but no longer than a one-year period for due cause. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-187. - Payment receipts. 
    In order for an abatement to be considered for any previous billing quarters, the applicant must demonstrate, with receipts marked "Paid," that full payment has been made for those sewer billing quarters. No abatement request will be reviewed for any billing quarter in which outstanding sewer bills, interest or penalties remain unpaid. Abatement requests for the current billing quarter will be considered even though the current bill is unpaid; however, the applicant shall remain responsible for all interest and penalties that may accrue during the current period while the abatement request is under review. Abatement will not be applied to any billing in the rears. 
(C.M. of 3-20-2018, V. 2018-56 ) 
Sec. 34-188. - Water used in manufacturing. 
    Any ratepayer who uses water in its end manufactured product which is shipped from the ratepayer's facility or in the process of manufacturing a product or providing a service and where such water does not enter into the sewer system, either in whole or in part, may apply for consideration of an adjustment to their sewer use fee determination to offset that portion of the water which does not reach the Town's sewer system. The applicant shall bear the burden of providing the necessary proof and documentation which must accompany the request for adjustment and must clearly demonstrate the quantity of water used which does not enter into the sewer system. All such requests for adjustment shall be made to the Superintendent who shall be responsible for reviewing the basis for the adjustment as well as the adequacy of the information provided. The Superintendent shall provide to the Town Manager his or her recommendation as to whether the adjustment should or should not be granted. The Town Manager shall make the final determination as to whether the sewer rate adjustment request shall or shall not be granted. The applicant should make this request at the time that they first connect their manufacturing process to the Town's sewer. During the period in which an adjustment is in effect, the Superintendent reserves the right to periodically inspect the ratepayer's premises and records to ensure that the ratepayer is in compliance with the terms and basis by which the adjustment was considered and granted. Should it be determined that the information provided by the ratepayer is invalid, that changes have occurred in the ratepayer's processes which have the effect of increasing the amount of water reaching the sewer system, or that more water is reaching the sewer system than reported by the ratepayer, the Town Manager may revoke the adjustment and the ratepayer shall be subject to a revised user charge equal to the full value of the adjustment for the period in which a current or prior adjustment was in effect.

A thick ring of mortar extending to the outer edge of the masonry shall be placed all around and on top of the bottom flange. Mortar shall be smoothly finished and have a slight slope to shed water away from the frame. 
16)  All sewers shall satisfy requirements of a leakage test before they are accepted by the Superintendent. The leakage test shall be as follows: 
a)  For each size of pipeline, an initial leakage test shall be made on the first section of the pipeline complete between two adjacent manholes. Thereafter, the leakage tests shall be made on sections of approved lengths of completed pipeline which in no case shall exceed 1,000 feet. 
b)  Each section shall be tested upon its completion. 
c)  Air checking of sewer lines shall be as follows: 
i)  After backfilling sewer line from manhole to manhole, the Contractor shall conduct an air leakage test in the presence of the Superintendent or Engineer, using low-pressure air. 
ii)  The equipment used shall meet the following minimum requirements: 
(a)  Pneumatic plugs shall have a sealing length equal to or greater than the diameter of the pipe to be inspected. 
(b)  Pneumatic plugs shall resist internal test pressures without requiring external bracing or blocking. 
(c)  All air used shall pass through a single control panel. 
(d)  Three individual hoses shall be used for the following connections: 
(i)  From control panel to pneumatic plugs for inflation. 
(ii)  From control panel to sealed line for introducing the low-pressure air. 
(iii)  From sealed line to control panel for continually monitoring air pressure rise in the sealed line. 
(iii)  Procedures shall be as follows: 
(a)  All pneumatic plugs shall be seal tested before being used in the actual test installation. One length of pipe shall be laid on the ground and sealed at both ends with the pneumatic plugs to be checked. Air shall be introduced into the plugs to 25 psig. The sealed pipe shall be pressurized to 5 psig. The plugs must hold against this pressure without having to be braced. 
(b)  After a manhole-to-manhole reach of pipe has been backfilled and cleaned, and the pneumatic plugs are checked by the above procedure, the plugs shall be placed in the line at each manhole and inflated to 25 psig. Low-pressure air shall be introduced into this sealed line until the internal air pressure reaches four (4) psig greater than the average backpressure of any groundwater that may be over the pipe. At least two minutes shall be allowed for the air pressure to stabilize. 
(c)  After the stabilization period (3.5 psig minimum pressure in the pipe), the air hose from the control panel to the air supply shall be disconnected. The portion of line being tested shall be termed "Acceptable" if the time required in minutes for the pressure to decrease from 3.5 to 2.5 psig (greater than the average backpressure of any groundwater that may be over the pipe) shall not be less than: 

Where: T = Shortest time, in seconds, allowed for the air pressure to drop 1.0 psig, K = 0.000419 DL, but not less than 1.0, Q = 0.0015 cubic feet/minute/square feet of internal surface, D = Nominal pipe diameter in inches, and L = Length of pipe being tested in feet.  
Table 1 indicates the time required for various lengths and pipe sizes. 

(d)  In areas where groundwater is known to exist, the contractor shall install a half-inch diameter capped pipe nipple, approximately ten inches long, through the manhole wall on top of one of the sewer lines entering the manhole. This shall be done at the time the sewer line is installed. Immediately prior to the performance of the leakage test, the groundwater shall be determined by removing the pipe cap, blowing air through the pipe nipple into the ground so as to clear it, and then connecting a clear plastic tube to the nipple. The plastic tube shall be held vertically, and a measurement of the height in feet of water over the invert of the pipe shall be taken after the water has stopped rising in this plastic tube. The height in feet shall be divided by 2.3 to establish the pounds of pressure that will be added to all readings. (For example, if the height of water is 111/2 feet, the added pressure will be five psig. This increases the 3.5 psig to 8.5 psig, and the 3.0 psig to 8.0 psig. The allowable drop of one-half pound and the timing remain the same.) 
(e)  If the installation fails to meet this requirement, the Contractor shall determine the source of the leakage and repair or replace all defective materials at his own expense. 
17)  Manholes shall be tested by plugging the pipes and filling the manholes with water for an exfiltration test or by an air vacuum test. 
a)  Water exfiltration test: 
(a)  The manhole shall be filled to allow for concrete absorption and left overnight. 
(b)  The following morning, the manhole shall be filled to a level no less than one foot above the beginning of the manhole taper, and shall be tested for 8 hours. 
(c)  The water level shall be carefully marked, and at end of following eight (8) hour period, sufficient water shall be added to bring water level back to mark. Water added shall be supplied from a metered source and quantity so added water shall be converted to gallons per day lost through manhole leakage. 
(d)  The loss of water shall be less than one gallon per day per foot of depth of manhole. 
(e)  If the measured exfiltration exceeds the allowable rate, the necessary repairs shall be made by the Contractor at his expense to reduce the leakage. 
(f)  In areas with a high groundwater table, the Superintendent or Engineer may require a visual infiltration test rather than an exfiltration test. In this case, all leaks or weepings visible from the inside of the manhole shall be repaired, and the manhole made watertight. 
b)  Air vacuum test: 
(a)  Manholes shall be tested by a vacuum test immediately after assembly of the manholes and connecting pipes and before any backfill is placed around the manholes, and again after backfilling. 
(b)  All lift holes shall be plugged with nonshrink grout and all pipes entering the manhole shall be plugged, taking care to securely brace the plugs and pipe. 
(c)  The test shall be made using an inflatable compression band, vacuum pump and appurtenances specifically designed for vacuum testing manholes. Test procedures shall be in accordance with the equipment manufacturer's recommendations. 
(d)  After the testing equipment is in place, a vacuum of 10" of Hg shall be drawn on the manhole. The manhole will be considered to have passed the test if the vacuum does not drop more than 1" of Hg in one minute. 
(e)  If the manhole fails the initial test, the Contractor shall locate the source of leakage and make proper repairs as directed by the Superintendent, and re-tested until a satisfactory test result is obtained.

APPENDIX D - CALCULATING THE "ONE TIME" SEWER CREDIT 
1.  ADD LAST 4 QUARTERS CONSUMPTION AND DIVIDE BY 4. This is the average usage 
2.  MULTIPLY AVERAGE USAGE x 400 PERCENT. Billed consumption in question must be greater than the 400 percent of average 
3.  IF BILLED CONSUMPTION IN QUESTION IS LESS THAN 400 PERCENT OF AVERAGE, ACCOUNT DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR CREDIT 
4.  IF BILLED CONSUMPTION IS GREATER THAN 400 PERCENT OF AVERAGE, SUBTRACT AVERAGE FROM BILLED CONSUMPTION TO GIVE YOU THE OVERAGE BILLED. 
MULTIPLY AVERAGE USAGE x $51.50 FOR THE AMOUNT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BILLED PLUS THE OVERAGE BILLED x $1.00. ADD THIS AMOUNT TO WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BILLED. THIS IS THE AMOUNT TO SUBTRACT FROM THE ACTUAL BILL, AND THE BALANCE IS THE AMOUNT TO BE CREDITED.

    The purpose of this article is to promote the general welfare and safety of the citizens of the town by regulating the installation of culverts and storm drainage on town right-of-way, town-controlled drainage easements, or town-maintained rights-of-way belonging to the state, so that a public hazard or nuisance shall not be created by blocking, impeding or diverting surface water onto town-maintained roadways or surface water removal. 
(Code 1983, § 11-301) 
Sec. 42-62. - Scope. 
    Any person within the town constructing or connecting any means of access to or from private or public property to an existing town right-of-way, town easement or town-maintained state right-of-way shall comply with this article. 
(Code 1983, § 11-302) 
Sec. 42-63. - Width of connection allowed. 
    No connection to an existing public right-of-way maintained by the town shall exceed 40 feet in width, measured along the centerline of the town-maintained road within the right-of-way. This distance refers to the paved, or used portion, of the work constructed for access to the town-maintained right-of-way. This requirement shall be inapplicable to town or state roads that are or are required by ordinance to be of a larger dimension. 
(Code 1983, § 11-303) 
Sec. 42-64. - Use of culverts or storm drainage required. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person or business to construct a means of access to any public right-of-way in the town from abutting private, or public, property by the construction of a street, road, lane, driveway, parking lot, walkway or other substantial form of entrance without providing adequate ditches or drainage structures. These ditches or structures shall be so located and constructed as not to cause the blockage, impediment or substantial diversion of established drainage patterns along the side of the existing town roads, or to prohibit or impede the flowage of surface water off of the existing road surfaces. 
(Code 1983, § 11-304) 
Sec. 42-65. - Size and form of structures required. 
(a)  Permit required. A letter or permit from the director of public works shall be required before any culverts, drains or structures are installed. The letter or permit shall specify the size, material of construction, location, length and form of drainage treatment required. 
(b)  Culverts; construction. 
(1)  Length. Culverts shall not exceed 70 feet in length. 
(2)  Materials. Culverts shall be made of galvanized corrugated steel construction, designed for the highway loadings imposed upon them. 
(3)  Coupling bands. Coupling bands shall be constructed of galvanized steel with full circular corrugations. The ends of all culvert pipe shall be fabricated with full circle corrugations, not spiral, to be compatible with the coupling bands. 
(4)  Bed. Culverts shall be laid in a bed at least one foot deep of rough granular material containing no stones larger than three inches in any dimension. This material shall provide a distance of one foot each side of the pipe and brought up to the springline of the pipe. This bedding material shall be thoroughly tamped the entire length of the pipe. 
(5)  Buried. Culverts shall be buried with at least 11/2 feet of granular material over the crown of the pipe. This material shall contain no stones larger than six inches in any dimension. 
(6)  Size. The size of the culvert shall be determined by the director of public works based on the drainage characteristics of the area to be serviced by the proposed culvert. In no case shall the culvert pipe be less than the nominal 15-inch size. 
(7)  Slope. Minimum slope of culverts shall be no less than 0.1 foot/20 foot length of pipe (one-half of one percent) sloped in the direction of the existing drainage. 
(c)  Storm drainage systems. 
(1)  When required. Storm drainage systems shall be required where the length of pipe in one continuous piece shall exceed 70 feet, where the open end of a culvert and the depression of the accompanying ditch might present a hazard to pedestrian and vehicular traffic, or when there is not a sufficient town right-of-way or easement to adequately construct a ditch type of drainage system. The extent and nature of such hazards shall be determined by the director of public works. 
(2)  Material. Pipe for storm drain systems shall be either asbestos cement pipe, reinforced concrete pipe, cast iron pipe or galvanized corrugated steel pipe. The type and class of pipe shall meet the requirements of the American State Highway Officials (ASHO) for loads imposed. The size, type and class of pipe used shall be approved by the director of public works before any construction is started. Manholes and catchbasins shall be constructed in accordance with the sheets attached to this article labeled plate no. 1 and plate no. 2. Manholes and catchbasins may be made of reinforced concrete, brick of approved design, or eight-inch-thick solid concrete block and mortar construction. 
(3)  Catchbasins; when required. A catchbasin, with a sump as shown on plate no. 2, shall be required at the upstream end of all storm drain systems. The remaining necessary catchbasins and manholes will be located where directed by the director of public works. In no case shall the distance between any catchbasin and manhole or between any two consecutive manholes exceed 350 feet. 
(4)  Manholes as catchbasins. Manholes shall not be used as catchbasins unless specifically required by the director of public works. 
(5)  Manhole construction. All manholes shall be constructed with inverts or channels the full height of the largest pipe leaving or entering the manhole. Inverts shall be constructed of red hardburned brick, wire cut and kiln fired. Cement used in manholes and catchbasins shall be type II Portland cement without the addition of lime. Half sections of pipe backed by concrete and topped by brick may be used to form the invert for straight-through manholes. Inverts shall present a smooth surface throughout and in manholes forming angle points in the line, shall be constructed at as large a radius as possible. Bricks used in inverts shall be laid with the narrow longitudinal edge exposed to the flowthrough. Bricks used to construct the cap, below the frame, shall all be laid as headers. All brick work exposed to the soil on the exterior of catchbasins and manholes shall be parged to a smooth surface with mortar. 
(6)  Catchbasins; single lead to open outfall. Catchbasins with only a single lead to an open outfall shall have at least a nominal 15-inch pipe, or larger if required by the director of public works. 
(7)  Catchbasins attached to trunk line and manholes. Catchbasins attached to a storm drain system comprised of a trunk line and manholes shall have no lead smaller than an eight-inch nominal pipe. A larger size lead may be required by the director of public works in certain instances where the runoff characteristics of the area may require the installation of large-capacity grates. 
(8)  Pipe size. Pipe sizes for the storm drain system shall be adequately sized to handle the runoff water of the total drainage area capable of being serviced by extension from the part being immediately constructed. In no case shall the trunk line be sized smaller than a nominal 12-inch pipe. 
(9)  Engineered design required. An engineered design by a registered professional engineer, including plan, profile of pipe and ground, location of manholes and catchbasins and outfall location and treatment, shall be required for all storm drain systems containing more than six catchbasins, or having an overall project length in excess of 450 feet. These plans shall be approved by the director of public works and the town council before construction is started. Plans shall also denote the size, type, class and slope of all pipe to be used in the work. 
(10)  Trunk line size. For storm drain systems smaller than those described in subsection (c)(9) of this section, the following chart shall be used as a guide for sizing trunk lines: 
Number of 
Catchbasins 
Serviced Pipe Size

Flow coefficients and design computations will be considered at the time plans are submitted to determine the appropriate slopes for pipes 20 inches and larger. 
(12)  Cover. No pipe shall have less than 31/2 feet of cover measured from the crown of the pipe to the finished grade of the ground except in the area of the outfall. This dimension may be excepted if the pipe is encased in concrete or in some other way substantially strengthened and supported. All exceptions will have to be approved by the director of public works. Culverts are exempt from this provision. 
(13)  Castings. All castings used in the work shall meet the requirements shown on plates no. 1 and no. 2 and shall be approved by the director of public works. 
(14)  Trenching and installation. Trenching and pipe installation shall conform to the practices depicted on plate no. 3 of this article. 
(15)  Connections. All connections of the catchbasin leads to other pipes of the storm drain system shall be made by means of saddles or tees fabricated into the pipe before installation. In extenuating circumstances, the director of public works may allow alternate methods of connection if done under his direct supervision and if the connection is constructed such that the full capacity of both pipes is maintained. These alternate methods of connection must be constructed such that there is no leakage or reduction of strength of the pipes at the point tapped. Catchbasin leads shall be connected directly into manholes whenever possible. 
(d)  Open ditches. 
(1)  When allowed; construction. Open ditches may be constructed to handle surface drainage where there will be no health or safety hazard created by their use, ponding of water within the ditch, flooding caused on adjacent lands or excessive erosion. Ditches, with the exceptions below, will not be constructed with a length of over 300 feet along the edge of a town road, or with an overall length of more than 500 feet. Ditches will not be allowed of longer length unless special design considerations are presented and specific approval is granted by both the director of public works and the town council. Ditches along state aid roads and rural town roads in undeveloped areas may exceed the maximum length of 500 feet at the discretion of the director of public works. 
(2)  Slope. The minimum slope of drainage ditches shall be 0.005 foot per foot. The maximum slope for ditches with grassed channels shall be 0.08 foot per foot. Ditches with slopes greater than eight percent shall have rip rapped, or paved, channels. Side slopes shall not have a gradient steeper than one foot of rise per three feet of horizontal run (3:1). Flatter side slopes may be required by the director of public works because of high flows at high velocities, soil stability, availability of adjacent materials to cause blockages and neighboring uses. 
(3)  Erosion prevention. All ditch slopes and channels shall be treated to prevent erosion by one of the following methods: 
a.  Three-inch loam, fertilizer, seed and hay mulch. 
b.  Three-inch loam, fertilizer, seed and asphalt emulsion binder. 
c.  Two-inch loam and sodding. 
d.  Stone, rip rap one foot thick. 
e.  Two and one-half-inch bituminous pavement with six-inch granular base. 
f.  Four-inch reinforced concrete slab sections with weep holes and six-inch granular-free draining base. 
(4)  Channel invert. Drainage ditches along the sides of roads constructed after passage of this article shall have their channel invert equal to or lower than the granular base material in the road. In all cases the ditch channel invert shall be at least below the edge of the road pavement.

(a)  The director of public works shall issue a permit for the construction of an entrance onto a public way if all of the following criteria are met. 
(1)  Traffic safety. The entrance shall be located such that adequate sight distance is maintained for entering and turning traffic, that adequate separation distance is maintained between the proposed entrance and existing entrances on either side, and that the entrance geometry is consistent with good engineering practice. 
(2)  Drainage. The entrance shall be constructed such that the existing flow of stormwater from and along the public way is not impeded and such that the entrance does not contribute additional stormwater flow to the traveled portion of the public way. Culverts required beneath the entrance shall be sized to accommodate the expected flow from a 25-year storm, but in no case smaller than 15 inches in diameter, and shall be installed in accordance with good construction practices. Reused culverts may be permitted by the director of public works at his sole discretion. 
(3)  Geometry. The entrance shall be designed such that the grade within 50 feet of the public way shall not exceed ten percent nor be less than 0.5 percent. If the entrance is onto a paved surface and the entrance grade exceeds five percent, it shall be paved within the limits of the right-of-way. The entrance shall not intersect the traveled way at a horizontal angle less than 75 degrees. 
(4)  Construction. If the entrance is a part of a road or way intended to be accepted by the town, it shall comply in all respects with article III of this chapter and with sections 66-147-66-200 of chapter 66. All that portion of any entrance which lies within the limits of the right-of-way shall be constructed with a minimum base course of 18 inches of base gravel meeting DOT specification 703.06. 
(b)  Sidewalks which must be traversed shall be restored to a condition equal to or better than the condition immediately adjacent to the entrance. If granite curbing is removed, removed stone shall remain property of the town. Tip-downs of a material identical to the adjacent curbing shall be installed on both sides of the entrance. Asphalt or concrete paving shall be saw cut, and new material shall be butted against a bonded vertical surface. Brick pavers shall be removed and reset in a continuous pattern and on a base to match the adjacent sidewalk.

1.2.  Purpose . The purpose of the access management standards is to manage access onto regulated roads in a manner that protects the safety of access and road users, protects the road system from the negative impacts of drainage, preserves mobility and economic productivity related to roadway transportation, and avoids the long-term cost of constructing new roadway capacity. 
1.3.  Administration . The access management standards will be administered by the planning board and the public works director with assistance from the town engineer, as needed. The code enforcement officer is responsible for determining if a proposed development requires approval from the planning board and/or the public works director. 
1.4.  Definitions : 
    Access . A public or private point of entry or exit from land adjacent to a public road used by motor vehicles as defined in 29-A M.R.S.A., Chapter 1, § 101. 
    Access point. The intersection of an existing or proposed access with the public right-of-way. 
    Alteration. A significant physical change to an access existing on or after the effective date of this section, including significant changes to location, width, cross-section, grade, or drainage characteristics of the access. Paving a gravel access will not be considered an "alteration" unless accompanied by other such changes. 
    Applicant . The person applying for the permit. Normally, this will be the owner of the property but can be another party provided that person (or organization) can demonstrate that he/she has right, title or interest in the property. 
    Change in use. A change in activity occurring on the property accessed by the driveway that will result in the conversion of a building or parcel of land from a single-family or two-family dwelling to a three or more-family use, from a residential use to nonresidential use, or from one type of nonresidential use to any other type of nonresidential use. By way of example, the change from retail to office or retail to a restaurant, from farming to a nonresidential use, or from residential to industrial use. 
    Corner clearance. The minimum distance, measured parallel to a highway, between the nearest curb, pavement or shoulder line of an intersecting public way and the nearest edge of a driveway excluding its radii.

    Separator strip. A separator strip is a strip of land that separates the roadway from the throat or parking area of a driveway. 
    Sight distance. The sight distance required to allow a vehicle entering the roadway to reach 85% of the posted speed without being overtaken by a vehicle traveling at the posted speed and approaching the entering vehicle from behind. Sight distance is measured from the perspective of a hypothetical person seated in a vehicle from three vantage points: (1) sitting in the access viewing vehicles traveling on the roadway (both left and right), (2) traveling on the roadway viewing a vehicle sitting in an access, and (3) traveling on the roadway viewing a vehicle turning into the access (both ahead and behind). In case of discrepancy between these measurements, the lesser measurement will be used to determine whether the sight distance standard is met. Sight distance is measured to and from the point on the centerline of the proposed access that is located 10 feet from the edge of the travel way. The height of the hypothetical person's view is considered to be 31/2 feet above the pavement and the height of the object being viewed is considered to be 41/4 feet above the pavement. 
    Terminal end. A terminal end is the end section of a run of curb that is sloped to aid the design vehicle in turning into the driveway or to meet Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 1213 et seq., requirements.

(MPH) Driveway 
Separation 
(Feet) 25 70 35 85 40 175 45 265 50 350 55 525  
2.3.  Driveway width. If 30% or less of the traffic projected to use the proposed entrance will be larger vehicles, the width of a two-way driveway within the road right-of-way must be between 22 and 30 feet inclusive. If more than 30% of the traffic projected to use the proposed driveway will be larger vehicles, the width of a two-way driveway within the road right-of-way must be between 30 and 42 feet inclusive. Driveways must be designed in accordance with the MaineDOT Standard Details. The driveway width will be the minimum necessary to accommodate the design vehicle. 
2.4.  Corner clearance. The minimum corner clearance for driveways onto the roadway must be 150 feet, except that the town may require increased corner clearance if the town reasonably determines that the proposed driveway will significantly impact public safety or cause a reduction in posted speed. 
2.5.  Shared driveways. Whenever possible, property owners should seek opportunities for shared driveways. 
2.6.  Number of driveways. Lots will be limited to one two-way driveway or two one-way driveways. 
2.7.  One-way driveway requirements. If a one-way system is proposed and the predominant traffic volume is truck traffic, the driveway will be configured on the minimum angle that permits the truck to enter or leave the roadway safely and smoothly. Otherwise, all driveways must be configured perpendicular to the roadway for at least the length of the design vehicle. 
A physical separation of curbing, ditching, grass or other landscaping must be used for one-way driveways and must be designed and constructed to prevent adjacent one-way driveways from becoming one entrance in practice. Both portions of a one-way driveway on a single lot must be separated from another one-way driveway by at least 12 feet. Both portions of a one-way driveway abutting a sidewalk must have a minimum separation of at least 18 feet and allow for 7-foot terminal ends and at least a 4-foot header in between. 
A one-way entrance abutting a curbed, non-sidewalk section must have a minimum separation of at least 12 feet and allow for two 4-foot terminal ends separated by at least a 4-foot header. 
2.8.  Intersection angle/radius of edge. To the maximum extent practical, the entrance must be constructed perpendicular to the highway at the access point. Except where curbing exists or is proposed, the minimum radius on the edges of a driveway must be sufficient to allow the design vehicle to enter the driveway without encroaching into the path of existing vehicles in accordance with the MaineDOT Standard Details included in Appendix B. Driveways designed for right turns only must be designed to the greatest extent possible to prohibit illegal traffic movements. 
2.9.  Throat length. The throat must be of sufficient length to prevent incoming vehicles from queuing back into the roadway. Access from the throat to parking or other areas is prohibited. 
2.10.  Driveway separator strips. Driveway separator strips must be installed between the parking area and the roadway and along the throat. The separator strip must extend away from the roadway to the greater of (1) 5 feet from the right-of-way limits, or (2) in areas where the right-of-way limits are defined by wrought portion, 7 feet from the edge of a clearly evident shoulder. The property owner must maintain any vegetation within the separator strip such that it does not interfere with the sight distance at the driveway. In areas where sidewalks exist, curbing or wheel stops must be provided to prevent parking vehicles from interfering with pedestrian flow. 
2.11.  Paving of driveway. The driveway, including all radii, must be paved from the edge of pavement of the roadway to the road right-of-way or to the length of the design vehicle, whichever is greater. 
2.12.  On-street parking. Parking must meet the requirements of Town of Lisbon Code Chapter 70, Article VI, Division 3, Off-Street Parking and Loading. 
2.13.  Turnaround area/parking. Driveways will be designed such that all maneuvering and parking of any vehicles will take place outside of the road right-of-way and such that vehicles may exit the premises without backing onto the roadway or roadway shoulder. All driveways must have a turnaround area with a width of at least 8 feet and a length of at least 15 feet or the length of the design vehicle, whichever is greater. 
2.14.  Loading dock requirements. Loading docks or other delivery areas must not be located within the road right-of-way and must be situated so that delivery vehicles do not encroach on the road right-of-way. All delivery vehicles must maneuver entirely on-site. 
2.15.  Double frontage lots. Driveways for lots with double frontage on regulated roads and another public way will be restricted to the other public way, unless the planning board determines that queuing of traffic using a driveway off the other public way would interfere with traffic on the regulated road due to insufficient lot frontage along the other public way. 
2.16.  Traffic signal restriction . No proposed driveway will be permitted on a regulated road if the proposed driveway serves a development that warrants installation of a traffic signal. 
2.17.  Mobility enhancement measures. The planning board may require applicants to provide for improvement of the existing safety or mobility levels through enhancement measures if the planning board determines, based upon accepted traffic engineering principles, that the proposed driveway will significantly impact public safety or cause a reduction in posted speed. 
Mobility enhancement measures include: 
A.  Elimination, combination or modification of existing driveways; 
B.  Development of frontage, backage or other service roads within the corridor to provide alternate access to existing driveways. 
2.18.  Mitigation . If a proposed driveway has been granted a waiver and the planning board reasonably determines, based upon accepted traffic engineering principles, that the proposed driveway will significantly impact public safety or cause a reduction in posted speed, the planning board may require mitigation of traffic impacts from a proposed driveway. In making such determinations, the planning board may consider existing developments planned or reasonably expected on the parcel of land owned or controlled by the applicant. 
If mitigation is required, applicants will be required to employ and, in some instances maintain, one or more of the mitigation techniques listed below. 
A.  Payment of a fee pursuant to Town of Lisbon Code Chapter 62, Article IV, § 62-185, Site Plan Review Impacts on Public Facilities and Services, equal to an amount necessary for the town to purchase an easement on an adjacent lot for purposes of developing a shared entrance. 
B.  Payment of a fee pursuant to Town of Lisbon Code Chapter 62, Article IV, § 62-185, Site Plan Review Impacts on Public Facilities and Services, equal to an amount necessary for the town to purchase easements across one or more lots for purposes of developing a frontage road for driveways serving subdivisions or commercial or industrial uses or parks. 
C.  Acceleration and/or deceleration lanes. 
D.  Medians, jug handles or turnarounds. 
When mitigation measures are required, the town may require the applicant, prior to construction, to submit a performance and payment bond or certified check payable to the Town of Lisbon, in an amount and form that complies with Town of Lisbon Code Chapter 62, Article IV, § 62-185, Site Plan Review Impacts on Public Facilities and Services. In addition, the town may require that notice of conditions applicable to the driveway be recorded in the Androscoggin County Registry of Deeds. 
2.19.  Drainage standards. 
A.  Culvert size. The diameter of culverts within the road right-of-way will be determined by either the public works director or the MaineDOT, as appropriate. 
B.  Construction and maintenance standards. Driveways, on-site ditches, swales, pipes and other structures that direct runoff toward ditches or drainage systems on regulated roads must be constructed, crowned, stabilized and maintained with stable materials and appropriate erosion control measures such as permanent vegetation or stone. 
C.  Mitigation. If the proposed development poses a significant drainage risk, then the applicant must mitigate the impacts of increases in peak flow from storms into the roadway drainage system through measures specified by the public works director or MaineDOT. Mitigation measures may include on-site controls, off-site improvements, or payment of a fee pursuant to Town of Lisbon Code Chapter 62, Article IV, § 62-185, Site Plan Review Impacts on Public Facilities and Services. A "significant drainage risk" exists (a) when the applicant proposes a fixed connection to a closed drainage structure owned by the town or MaineDOT, or (b) when the public works director determines, using acceptable engineering and hydrologic principles, that: (i) the proposed driveway has a grade of 10% or greater for a length of 150 feet or more draining toward the roadway, (ii) the proposed development has more than 10,000 square feet of impervious surface draining toward the roadway, or (iii) the proposed development will substantially contribute to the failure of a downstream public facility. The applicant owner is responsible for all on-site and off-site mitigation expenses. 
D.  Retail fueling station requirements . Applicants with driveways for use by retail fueling stations must demonstrate that in the event of a spill, deposit of contaminants in the right-of-way will be contained. 
3.  Waivers . Driveway standards may be relaxed or waived by the planning board only as provided in this section. 
3.1.  Standards that may not be waived . The sight distance standards, corner clearance standards, paving of driveway requirement, on-street parking standards, loading dock requirements, and turnaround area/parking standards. 
3.2.  Standards that may be waived . All other standards may be waived in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
3.3.  Criteria for granting waivers . Waiver requests will be granted if the applicant demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the town, that: (i) the waiver will not significantly detract from public safety, (ii) the proposed driveway meets the standards to the maximum extent practicable, and (iii) there is no feasible alternative. 
A.  In determining that the waiver will not significantly detract from public safety, the town must consider such factors as crash rates, traffic volumes, road geometrics, types and frequency of traffic moving to and from existing uses within 1,000 feet of the proposed driveway. 
B.  In determining practicability and feasibility, the town will consider the availability and cost of alternative driveway locations and designs in relation to the proposed use. 
C.  In cases involving alterations or changes of use of existing accesses, the town may grant waiver requests if it determines the alteration will likely result in a net gain to public safety or will result in a reduction in the driveway's non-conformity with this section. 
D.  In cases involving double frontage lots, the town will consider the length of frontage on the regulated road, the intensity of traffic generated by the proposed use, the geography along the frontage of the other public way, and the distance to the other public way. 
3.4.  Spacing standards waiver . The spacing standards in Table 3 of this section may be waived only to the extent that lots of record existing as of September 6, 2011, that do not have access to another public way and do not have sufficient lot frontage to meet these spacing standards, may be allowed access if the applicant meets the following criteria, in addition to the above-referenced waiver criteria: 
A.  The applicant meets the criteria of granting waivers set forth in this section. 
B.  The proposed access is located in an area designated for growth in the town's comprehensive plan. 
C.  The proposed access will not have an unreasonable adverse impact on the regulated road such that the speed limit must be reduced to accommodate new traffic expected to be generated.

Secs. 46-135-46-140. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VI. - STREET LIGHTING 

Sec. 46-141. - Background. 
    Street lighting design is primarily concerned with the selection and location of street lighting equipment so as to provide adequate visibility and increased safety for pedestrians and vehicles while making the most efficient use of energy with minimal expenditure. By providing an adequate level of illumination and uniformity of distribution along roadways, satisfactory visibility and lighting patterns can be achieved that will aid vehicle and pedestrian travel and minimize potential conflict between the two. 
    Lighting also promotes the visual appeal of a community and creates an environment that pedestrians feel safe accessing during the night. Too much light cast by overhead streetlights creates glare for vehicles and pedestrians alike and obscures the aesthetics of a nighttime downtown environment, creating a streetscape that can appear dreary and empty. Sufficient street lighting provides a necessary amount of light and contributes to an environment that pedestrians feel comfortable accessing at night. Ornamental and streetscape lighting has demonstrated an improved visual appeal for the Town of Lisbon, along Main and Village Streets. Properly installed ornamental lighting creates an environment that is aesthetically pleasing and inviting to nighttime use by pedestrians. 
    The Town of Lisbon's street lighting standards as promulgated in this policy account for factors such as traffic volume, nighttime pedestrian activity, crime prevention, light pollution, and energy conservation. It is understood that while vehicle headlights are the preferred method of illumination for vehicles, street lighting is particularly useful in areas of potential vehicle and pedestrian conflict, such as intersections and other pedestrian crossing locations. Additionally, along routes with high vehicle travel volume, the pattern of poles and street lighting can provide guidance to motorists. 
    It is also understood that ornamental and streetscape lighting is the preferred method of lighting for pedestrian travel and safety. Overhead street lighting creates downward-cast shadows, while properly designed streetscape lighting illuminates the faces of pedestrians and creates an inviting ambiance for pedestrians. Based on studies of the relationship between street lighting and crime it can be concluded that streetlights will not reduce the likelihood that crimes will take place; however, properly located lighting reduces the perceived fear associated with crime, increasing the likelihood that pedestrians will access the center and falls at night, thus contributing to an effect of more "eyes on the street." 
    Lighting levels for roadway street lighting is generally based on Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IES) recommendations contained in IES publication RP-8-00 Roadway Lighting. IES guidelines are based on geometric, operational, and environmental factors and suggest average roadway luminance and uniformity ratios to reduce traffic accidents. Although the IES standards are desirable to attain for roadways with high traffic volumes, the IES standard do not easily translate to rural and residential roadway lighting applications where traffic flow and speed are not the primary concern. The standards recommended by the IES would be best applied to Lisbon on roadways where traffic flow, speed, and the potential pedestrian conflicts are of primary concern such as sections of Main Street (in Lisbon Falls,) and Village Street (in Lisbon Center).

    Utility pole means a pole owned and maintained by a utility company used to support power lines, telephone lines, cable lines, etc. 
(C.M. of 8-3-2010, V. 2010-125) 
Sec. 46-145. - Applicability. 
    This policy applies to all streetlights located within public right-of-ways. Street lighting improvements shall be made: 
(1)  During routine maintenance and capital improvements by the town or its contractors. 
(2)  When new public streets are constructed, improved, or closed. 
(3)  When new development is proposed that impacts the downtown streetscape. 
(4)  When the town council makes recommendations and has a majority vote. 
(C.M. of 8-3-2010, V. 2010-125) 
Sec. 46-146 - General. 
(a)  The installation and maintenance of street lights within the limits of the town shall conform to the standards set forth in this policy. 
(b)  The town engineer is responsible to oversee the maintenance and operation of town streetlights (a contractor) shall be responsible for the installation, replacement, removal, and maintenance of all town street lights in conformance with the standards set forth in this policy. 
(C.M. of 8-3-2010, V. 2010-125) 
Sec. 46-147. - Street light placement standards. 
    Street light placement within public right-of-ways shall conform to the following standards as feasible given utility pole spacing and light pole spacing: 
(1)  Village zone. For any roadway within the Village Area Zone indicated on the street light service map in appendix B*: 
a.  One streetlight shall be located at all roadway intersections and mid-block locations at a spacing interval of approximately 220 feet as feasible given existing utility pole and light pole spacing. 
b.  Street segments less than 350 feet in length shall only be lit at roadway intersections and dead ends. 
c.  Ornamental and streetscape lighting may be used to light roadways where sidewalks are present and highlight public building facades and public areas as determined. Ornamental lighting currently serves to light the public right-of-way for portions of Main Street, Village Street, Webster Street, and a short distance of Route 196 (Lisbon Street). If ornamental lighting is the standard then all other lighting will be removed from poles unless it is determined by the town engineer, public safety (police, fire) and public works department determine the need exists.

    The board of appeals may grant a variance from the requirements of this article consistent with state law and the following criteria: 
(1)  Variances shall not be granted within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(2)  Variances shall be granted only upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; and 
b.  A determination that should a flood comparable to the base flood occur, the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, public expense, or create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and 
c.  A showing that the issuance of the variance will not conflict with other state, federal or local laws or ordinances; and 
d.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in "undue hardship," which in this sub-section means: 
1.  That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is granted; and 
2.  That the need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood; and 
3.  That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality; and 
4.  That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner. 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and the board of appeals may impose such conditions to a variance as it deems necessary. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements, or other development for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:

a.  The development meets the criteria of this subsections (1) through (4) above; and, 
b.  The proposed repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(6)  Any applicant who meets the criteria of subsection (1) through (5) shall be notified by the board of appeals in writing over the signature of the chairman of the board of appeals that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in greatly increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 per $100.00 of insurance coverage; 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property; and, 
c.  The applicant agrees in writing that the applicant is fully aware of all the risks inherent in the use of land subject to flooding, assumes those risks and agrees to indemnify and defend the municipality against any claims filed against it that are related to the applicant's decision to use land located in a floodplain and that the applicant individually releases the municipality from any claims the applicant may have against the municipality that are related to the use of land located in a floodplain. 
(7)  Appeal procedure for administrative and variance appeals. 
a.  An administrative or variance appeal may be taken to the board of appeals by an aggrieved party within 30 days after receipt of a written decision of the code enforcement officer or planning board.

(2)  When not designated on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, it is considered to be the channel of a river or other water course and the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the floodplain, as measured from the normal high water mark to the upland limit of the floodplain. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Special flood hazard area - see "area of special flood hazard". 
    Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, substantial improvement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, or modification of any construction element, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building. A gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground is also a structure. 
    Substantial damage means, damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and a variance is obtained from the community's board of appeals. 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or development to comply with a community's floodplain management regulations.

(a)  It is the policy of the Town of Lisbon to encourage the use of open space subdivisions in order to preserve a sense of space, provide for agriculture and forestry as well as recreational land, preserve other resources identified in the Town of Lisbon comprehensive plan, and harmonize new development with the traditional open, wooded, agricultural and village landscapes. 
    This standard is intended to implement that policy by providing incentives that afford flexibility to a subdivider in road and lot layout and design, placement of residential structures and road frontage requirements and by allowing the planning board to waive or reduce certain otherwise applicable standards and provisions of this chapter and Chapter 70, Zoning, if the subdivider commits to the permanent preservation of important open space resources. It shall not be construed as granting variances from dimensional standards when the planning board grants waivers provided for in this section as allowed for in 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4353.4-C. These incentives are designed to encourage greater flexibility and more innovative approaches to housing and environmental design that will promote the most appropriate use of land and will preserve, as permanent open space, agricultural or forestry land, important natural features, wildlife habitat, water resources, ecological systems, and historic and scenic areas for the benefit of present and future residents. 
(b)  A open space subdivision achieves the purposes of this performance standard by reducing the lot size, frontage and setback requirements as contained in Chapter 70, modifying the road design standards and clustering housing and uses in those areas where they have the least impact on identified environmental, agricultural and other open space resources. These resources are then permanently preserved by the use of covenants and restrictions or conservation easements that run with the land. The open space principle can be applied to subdivisions of any size. 
(c)  Planning board review. 
(1)  The planning board shall review the application in accordance with 30-A M.R.S.A. § 4404 and the chapter as modified by the provisions of this section. 
(2)  The submissions for an open space subdivision shall include all plans and materials required for a conventional subdivision under this chapter. 
(3)  In planning board review and approval of an open space subdivision, the following requirements shall apply and shall supersede any inconsistent or more restrictive provisions of this chapter or Chapter 70, Zoning. 
a.  All open space subdivisions shall meet the use standards of the zoning district in which they are located. 
b.  The overall density of the subdivision shall not exceed the density requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. In the event that an open space subdivision is located in more than one zoning district, the overall density of the subdivision shall not exceed the combination of the density requirements of the districts in which the open space subdivision is located. In calculating overall density the land area contained in road rights-of-way that are proposed for public acceptance shall be deducted prior to determining density. 
The planning board may grant a density bonus of one lot or dwelling unit for each ten lots or dwelling units when it makes a written finding that the open space subdivision design provides pedestrian friendly layouts through the use of sidewalks, wider paved roads or trail systems within the project or provides linkages for pedestrian movements between adjoining properties which contributes to town wide open space planning. The planning board must find that the project can provide for adequate subsurface wastewater disposal and adequate supply and quality of water for both domestic and firefighting purposes, if public sources are no available, to grant the density bonus. 
c.  A lot for a dwelling unit created as part of an open space subdivision shall not be further divided, except that a lot for a dwelling unit created as part of an open space subdivision where such lot shall have within its bounds designated open space may not be further divided if the original approved plan shall have reserved future development of such lot, but any such further division shall only be made in accordance with this standard. 
(d)  Layout and siting standards. In planning the location and siting of residential structures in an open space subdivision, priority should be given to the preservation of the open space for its natural resource value with human habitation activity located and sited on the lower valued natural resource portion of a parcel taking into account the contours of the land and the reasonableness of slopes. 
    The building lots and/or residential structures shall be laid out and be sited according to the following principles. The planning board in its discretion shall resolve conflicts between these principles as applied to a particular site: 
(1)  In the least suitable agricultural soils and in a manner which maximizes the useable area remaining for the designated open space use, where agricultural, forestry, or recreational, existing or future uses, are particularly sought to be preserved; 
(2)  Within woodlands, or along the far edges of open agricultural fields adjacent to any woodland to reduce encroachment upon agricultural soils, to provide shade in the summer, and shelter as well as solar gain in the winter, and to enable new residential development to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features; 
(3)  In such manner that the boundaries between residential lots and/or structures and active agricultural or forestry land are well buffered by vegetation, topography, roads or other barriers to minimize potential conflict between residential and agricultural or forestry uses; 
(4)  In locations where buildings may be oriented with respect to identified scenic vistas, natural landscape features, topography and natural drainage areas, in accordance with an overall plan for site development, scenic vistas may be addressed by creating at least one scenic window per development with at least one turnout suitable for public use; 
(5)  In locations that provide compatibility in terms of physical size, visual impact, intensity of use, proximity to other structures, and density of development with other permitted uses within the zoning district; 
(6)  In locations such that diversity and originality in lot layout and individual building, street, parking layout is encouraged; and 
(7)  So that individual lots, buildings, street and parking areas shall be designed and situated to minimize alterations of the natural site, to avoid the adverse effects of shadows, noise and traffic on the residents of the site, to conserve energy and natural resources, and to relate to surrounding properties, so as to improve the view from and of buildings. 
(e)  Space standards. 
(1)  Shore frontage, shore setback and shoreland density requirements shall not be reduced below the minimum required in the zoning district. 
(2)  Distances between residential structures shall be a minimum of the height of the tallest adjacent structure. 
(3)  When individual lots will be laid out, the required minimum lot size or minimum land area per dwelling unit for the building envelope may be reduced. Unless public sewage collection and treatment is provided, no lot shall be less than 20,000 square feet. 
(4)  Minimum road frontage requirements may be waived or modified by the planning board provided that: 
a.  Any applicable provisions regarding roads in subsection (g) of this section are satisfied; and 
b.  Adequate access and turnaround to and from all parcels and/or structures by fire trucks, ambulances, police cars and other emergency vehicles can be ensured by private roads and/or common driveways. 
(5)  A reduction of required setback distances may be allowed at the discretion of the planning board, based upon the public benefits to be achieved from the design provided that the front and rear setbacks shall be no less than 25 feet or that required for the applicable zoning district, whichever shall be less. For the perimeter of cluster development, overall development setback shall not be reduced below the minimum front, side and rear setbacks required in the zoning district unless the planning board determines a more effective design of the project can better accomplish the purposes of this performance standard. 
(6)  No individual lot or dwelling unit shall have direct vehicular access onto a public road existing at the time of development. 
(f)  Utilities . At the discretion of the planning board, in order to achieve the most appropriate design and layout of lots, residential structures and open space, utilities including individual wells and septic systems may be located on designated portions of the open space, if necessary, provided they shall not unreasonably interfere with the open space purposes or uses to be achieved under this section. 
(1)  All structures requiring plumbing in the development shall be connected the public sewer system, to individual septic systems or a private central collection and treatment system in accordance with the minimum standards set forth in the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules. Proposed systems shall in no way endanger ground water supplies which are currently being utilized as a water source for any existing development or which are to be utilized as a common or individual water supply for the proposed development. 
(2)  If a private central collection system is proposed, the applicant must show either that at least one designated site for each lot, in the open space or on the lot, has adequate soils and land area suitable for subsurface waste disposal for each lot in accordance with the minimum standards set forth in the State of Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules, or that a second site on the parcel has the size, location and soil characteristics, to accommodate a system similar to the one originally proposed. 
(3)  If a private central collection system is proposed, the system shall be maintained by an homeowners' association or under an agreement of the lot or unit owners in the same fashion required for maintenance of the open space by a homeowners' association or the lot or unit owners in common and written evidence of said maintenance agreement shall be submitted to the planning board. The planning board may require the developer and homeowners association to retain a qualified third party to inspect and approve the system from time to time and furnish a copy of his report to the code enforcement officer. 
(g)  Roads . The planning board shall require private roads and common driveways to comply with the design standards set forth in this chapter except as provided in subsection (g)(4) of this section. 
(1)  The subdivider shall submit to the planning board as part of the application for approval a professional engineers drawing showing the location and drainage characteristics, dimensions and grade of roads and common driveways as well as specifications setting forth their proposed composition. 
(2)  The subdivision plan shall show the road clearly labeled "private road." 
(3)  Whenever possible and as far as practicable, the roads and common driveways shall: 
a.  Follow natural contours in an effort to limit phosphorous export; 
b.  Be limited in width, curvilinear in design, and keeping within the rural character of the town; 
c.  Turn away from the front access to public roads, and shall use sufficiently dimensioned culverts to accommodate pre-development and post-development drainage and flows, where necessary. 
(4)  Travelways and shoulders of roads and common driveways within open space subdivisions shall meet the following minimums: 
a.  Common driveways serving three or fewer dwelling units: 12 foot travel way. 
b.  Roads serving four units: 16-foot travel way and three-foot shoulders. 
c.  Roads serving five to ten units: service 16-foot paved travel way and three-foot shoulders. 
d.  Roads serving 11 to 50 units: 20 foot paved travel way and three-foot shoulders. 
(h)  Open space requirements. In planning board review and approval of an open space subdivision, the following requirements shall apply and shall supersede any inconsistent or more restrictive provisions of this chapter or Chapter 70, Zoning. 
    Open space set aside in an open space subdivision shall be permanently preserved as required by this section except where open space is dedicated by a landowner under contract with the town for a term of years as set forth below. Land set aside as permanent open space may, but need not be, a separate tax parcel. Such land may be included as a portion of one or more large parcels on which dwellings are permitted provided that a conservation easement or a declaration of covenants and restrictions is placed on such land pursuant to subsection (h)(3) of this section and provided that the planning board approves such configuration of the open space. 
(1)  Open space . In all districts at least 50 percent of the gross acreage shall remain as open space outside of individual lots or building envelopes, assigned to individual dwelling units and/or road rights-of-ways that are proposed for public acceptance. 
(2)  Open space uses. On all parcels, open space uses shall be appropriate to the site. Open space should include natural features located on the parcel(s) such as, but not limited to, agricultural land, forested acreage, wildlife habitat and historic features and sites. Open space shall be preserved and maintained subject to the following, as applicable: 
a.  On parcels that contain significant portions of land suited to agriculture, open space shall be preserved for agriculture or other compatible open space uses such as forestry, recreation (active or passive) and resource conservation. 
b.  When the principal purpose of preserving portions of the open space is the protection of natural resources such as wetlands, aquifers, steep slopes, wildlife and plant habitats, and stream corridors, open space uses in those portions may be limited to those which are no more intensive than passive recreation. 
c.  Open space areas shall be contiguous, where possible, to allow linking of open space areas throughout the town. 
d.  The use of any open space may be limited by the planning board at the time of final plan approval where the planning board deems it necessary to protect adjacent properties or uses, or to protect sensitive natural features or resources. A proposed change in use of open space land, other than that specified at the time of plan approval, shall be reviewed by the planning board as an amendment to the approved plan. 
e.  Further division of open space or its use for other than agriculture, forestry, recreation or conservation, except for easements for underground utilities, shall be prohibited and shall be so stated by deed restrictions. Structures and buildings accessory to recreation or conservation uses may be erected on open space, subject to planning board approval. 
(3)  Notations on plan . Open space areas must be clearly labeled on the final plan. The final plan shall include information or provide reference to a legal document which defines open space uses, ownership, management, method of preservation, and the rights, if any, of the owners in the subdivision to such land or portions thereof.

a.  A perpetual conservation easement, or declaration of covenants and restrictions, restricting development of the open space land must be incorporated in the open space plan. 
b.  The conservation easement may be granted to or the declarations may be for the benefit of a private party, third party or other entity, the town, with the approval of the council or to a qualified not-for-profit conservation organization acceptable to the planning board. 
c.  Such conservation easement or declaration of covenants and restrictions shall be reviewed and approved by the planning board and be required as a condition of plan approval hereunder. 
d.  The planning board may require that such conservation easement, or declaration of covenants and restrictions, be enforceable by the Town of Lisbon if the town is not the holder of the conservation easement or beneficiary of the declarations. 
e.  The conservation easement or declarations shall prohibit residential, industrial, or commercial use of such open space land (except in connection with agriculture, forestry and recreation) and shall not be amendable to permit such use. 
f.  The conservation easement or declaration shall be recorded in the Androscoggin County Registry of Deeds prior to or simultaneously with the filing of the Open Space Subdivision final plan in the Androscoggin County Registry of Deeds. 
(i)  Maintenance standards . Ongoing maintenance standards, where appropriate, shall be established, enforceable by the town against the owner(s) of common land, including open space land, roads and other facilities as a condition of subdivision approval. Such maintenance standards may include such conditions, obligations, or costs to maintain their use, facilities and/or scenic character. 
(j)  Notations on plan. Common lands, roads or facilities, including open space lands, must be clearly labeled or referenced on the final plan. The final plan shall include information or provide reference to a legal document which defines use, ownership, management, method of preservation, and the rights, if any, of the owners in the subdivision to such land or portions thereof, and shall contain a reference or notation indicating any conservation easements, deed restrictions, or other documents regarding those provisions required to be recorded to implement such reservations, restrictions or provisions.

(Code 1983, § 15-103) 
Sec. 70-5. - Nonconforming uses, lots and structures. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  Transfer of ownership. Ownership of land and structures which remain lawful but become nonconforming by the adoption or amendment of this chapter may be transferred, and the new owner may continue the nonconforming uses or continue to use the nonconforming structure or lot subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Maintenance, expansion. A nonconforming building or structure may be repaired, maintained or improved; but the area in nonconforming use may not be extended or expanded except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  Restoration of unsafe property. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to safe condition any part of any building or structure declared unsafe by the code enforcement officer. 
(4)  Pending application for building permits. Nothing in this chapter shall require any change in the plans, construction, size or designated use for any building, structure, or part of a building or structure for which application for a building permit has been made or a building permit has been issued or upon which construction commenced prior to the adoption or amendment of this chapter, provided construction shall start within 60 days after the issuance of such permit. 
(b)  Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Continuation of nonconforming uses. 
a.  Continuation. The use of land, building or structure, lawful at the time of adoption or subsequent amendment of this chapter, may continue although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter. Sand and gravel pits in existence in the groundwater protection overlay zone prior to May 20, 1988, shall continue as nonconforming uses subject to performance standards contained in section 70-610. 
b.  Expansion. A nonconforming use may not be expanded with the exception of sand and gravel pits in existence in the groundwater protection overlay zone prior to May 20, 1988. 
(2)  Discontinuance of nonconforming uses. A nonconforming use which is discontinued for a period of one year may not be resumed. The uses of the land, building or structure shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this chapter. A nonconforming use which has been discontinued may be resumed by the same owner or another owner within the allowed time period. This provision shall not apply to the resumption of a use of a residential structure provided that the structure has been used or maintained for residential purposes during the preceding five-year period. 
(3)  Rule of precedence. Whenever a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use of a structure, or structure and land in combination, such structure or combination of land and structure shall thereafter conform to the provision of this chapter. 
(4)  Change of use. An existing nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that (a) the proposed use has no greater adverse impact on the subject and adjacent properties and resources than the former use; as determined by the planning board and (b) applicable performance standards contained in Article VI of this chapter and Chapter 62, Site Plans. The determination of no greater adverse impact shall be made according to criteria listed below. 
a.  That the proposed use is of the same character or less noxious than the current nonconforming use; 
b.  That the proposed use will not create a traffic hazard nor increase an existing traffic hazard; 
c.  That the amount of parking required to meet the minimum requirements for the proposed use exists on the site or will be otherwise provided in accordance with this chapter; 
d.  That the amount of noise, odors, vibrations, smoke, dust and air discharges of the proposed use shall be equal to or less than the present use; 
e.  That the hours of operation of the proposed use will be compatible with the existing, surrounding land uses; 
f.  That the proposed use will not increase the adverse impact on surrounding properties; and 
g.  Additionally, in the shoreland zone, the planning board shall require written documentation from the applicant, regarding the probable effects on public health and safety, erosion and sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, vegetative cover, visual and actual points of public access to waters, natural beauty, floodplain management, archaeological and historic resources, and functionally water-depended uses. 
(c)  Nonconforming lots of record. 
(1)  Subdivision lots. Lots in subdivisions approved during the period June 29, 1971, through March 10, 1975 (under the previous ordinance), shall remain valid if sanitation and shoreland conditions can be met. 
(2)  Rear lots. A rear lot may be used for a single-family dwelling provided that it conforms with the requirements of section 70-641. A rear lot is defined as a lot without road frontage or a lot that has as part of its fee interest a limited amount of road frontage, less than the frontage requirement that provides access to the lot. 
(3)  Single lot. A single lot of record which, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter does not meet the area, frontage or width requirements of the district in which it is located may be built upon provided that such lot shall be in separate ownership and not contiguous with any other lot in the same ownership, and that all other provisions of this chapter shall be met. Variance of yard or other requirements not involving area or width shall be obtained only by action of the board of appeals. 
(4)  Contiguous lots. If two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in single or joint ownership of record at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, and if any of these lots do not individually meet the dimensional requirements of this chapter or subsequent amendments, and if one or more of the lots are vacant or contain only an accessory structure, the lots shall be combined to the extent necessary to meet all dimensional requirements; and no portion of the parcel shall be built upon which does not meet dimensional requirements of this chapter; nor shall any division of the parcel be made which creates any dimension or area below the requirements of this chapter. 
(d)  Nonconforming structures. 
(1)  Expansions. A nonconforming structure may be added to or expanded after obtaining a permit from the same permitting authority as that for a new structure, if such addition or expansion does not increase the nonconformity of the structure and is in accordance with subsections a and b below. 
a.  After January 1, 1989, if any portion of a structure is less than the required setback, that portion of the structure shall not be expanded in floor area or volume, by 30 percent or more, during the lifetime of the structure. If a replacement structure conforms with the requirements of subsection (d)(2) of this section, and is less than the required setback the replacement structure may not be expanded if the original structure existing on January 1, 1989 had been expanded by 30 percent in floor area and volume since that date. 
b.  Whenever a new, enlarged, or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming structure, the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee, basing its decision on the criteria specified in subsection (d)(2) of this section. If the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure, except for expansion in conformity with subsection (d)(1)(a) of this section, and the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three additional feet, as measured from the uphill side of the structure (from original ground level to the bottom of the first floor sill), it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure. 
(2)  Reconstruction or replacement. Any nonconforming structure which is located less than a required setback and which is removed, or damaged or destroyed, regardless of the cause, by more than 50 percent of the market value of the structure before such damage, destruction or removal, may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within 18 months of the date of said damage, destruction, or removal, and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee in accordance with the purposes of this chapter. In no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity. If the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure, except as allowed pursuant to subsection (d)(1), as determined by the nonconforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location. If the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area, no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure. 
Any nonconforming structure which is located less than a required setback and which is removed by 50 percent or less of the market value, or damaged or destroyed by 50 percent or less of the market value of the structure, excluding normal maintenance and repair, may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the code enforcement officer within one year of such damage, destruction, or removal. 
In determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider, in addition to the criteria in subsection (d)(2) of this section, the physical condition and type of foundation present, if any.

The owner/occupant will need to demonstrate, in order to be eligible for an informal adjustment agreement, that he has made a good-faith effort to comply with the letter of this chapter. An informal adjustment agreement shall only be appropriate in those instances where the structure causing the violation is not, and does not create, an unsightly condition and the structure is of a nature which is generally compatible with those in the neighborhood. The term "compatible" means that the offending structure is not substantially different in size, style or effect from those in the surrounding area. 
(b)  Where the violation is of a bulk and/or space provision of this chapter, the town manager and the code enforcement officer shall have the authority to enter into an informal adjustment agreement on behalf of the town. In such instances, the town council shall be informed of the agreement by receipt of a copy. 
(c)  The request for an informal adjustment agreement shall be made by the violator. The informal adjustment agreement shall contain a description of the nature of the violation; shall admit the violation; and, in order to resolve the violation, may contain any of the following: 
(1)  A fine; 
(2)  An agreement to make adjustments, repairs, renovations or relocation of the structure or any other remedial action or, if appropriate, no such action at all; 
(3)  A statement that the town, in consideration for the informal adjustment agreement, will waive any further prosecution of the violation; and 
(4)  A statement that the town will not require any fine or any remedial action. 
(d)  A copy of the informal adjustment agreement shall be filed by the owner/occupant at the county registry of deeds within 30 days of its issuance. All costs for such recording shall be borne by the violator. 
(e)  For purposes of administration of this section, the structure which forms the basis for the violation will continue to be considered a nonconforming structure, and shall be subject to the provisions for nonconformity as appear in this chapter. 
(f)  Upon receipt of application for approval of an informal adjustment agreement, the code enforcement officer shall cause notice of the application to be sent, regular mail, postage prepaid, to all abutters to the property for which the informal adjustment agreement is requested. The notice shall indicate the nature of the violation and the relief requested. Any abutter shall have a period of ten days from the date of mailing of the notice to indicate any objection or make any comments regarding the application. 
(g)  Any action or failure to act by the town manager under the provisions of this section shall be deemed an administrative act and shall be appealable under the appropriate provisions under this chapter, to be handled as an administrative appeal before the zoning board of appeals.

    The zoning board of appeals shall determine, in specific cases, where a relaxation of the terms of this chapter would not be contrary to the public interest and where, owing to the conditions peculiar to the property and not the results of actions by the applicant, a literal enforcement of the requirements of this chapter would result in an undue hardship.

The term "undue hardship" shall mean:

(2)  The granting of the variance will not cause the area of the dwelling to exceed the maximum permissible lot coverage according to the space and bulk regulations.

    The board of appeals may grant a variance to an owner of a residential dwelling for the purpose of making that dwelling accessible to a person with a disability who resides in or regularly uses the dwelling.

Sec. 70-501. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the diversified development district is to allow the diversification of the relationships of various uses, buildings, structures and open spaces in planned building groups in a compact manner to avoid the disadvantages of strip development by limiting access points to this district and to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public while allowing for a planned approach for a compatible mixture of public, commercial, service and residential development. The amenities and compatibilities of the diversified development district shall be ensured through development plans which present appropriate orientation, density and use compatibilities within the district.

Sec. 70-503. - Space and bulk standards. 
    Space and bulk standards in the diversified development district shall meet or exceed minimum requirements as identified in section 70-536 and the following. 
(1)  Additional standards. 
a.  Where the lot abuts or is within 100 feet of the right-of-way of Route 196, a 50-foot buffer strip shall be maintained, although 25 feet may be used for parking. 
b.  Any required side or rear yard area located within 100 feet of a residential district or an existing lot containing a dwelling shall maintain a 50-foot buffer strip. The planning board may reduce the width of side and rear buffer strips for commercial and institutional lots when it has been demonstrated that the design of the reduced buffer strip will provide adequate screening and will minimize the impact upon adjoining properties. In no case shall the buffer strips be reduced by more than 50 percent. The planning board shall consider the location of the lot, existing or proposed activities on adjacent lots, and the impacts of the reduced setbacks. In the decision to reduce any yard setbacks, the planning board shall consider if the abutting property owners have consented to such setback reductions. The board shall make a written finding of fact that the reduction in setback will not affect the public health, safety and welfare or nullify the intent and purpose of this section. 
c.  A buffer strip of 20 feet shall be maintained adjacent to the railroad right-of-way. 
d.  Frontage and lot width shall not be reduced. 
e.  All uses shall be served by public water and sewer.

Sec. 70-504. - Development plan. 
    The following provisions shall apply in the diversified development district, which district shall also be subject to the other provisions of this chapter; however, where conflicts in regulations occur, the regulations set forth in this division shall apply: 
(1)  Development plan. In addition to plans required by section 70-191 et seq., or by chapter 66, the applicant shall submit a narrative containing a circulation pattern, indicating both public and private streets and how they relate to existing public and private streets and to planned or potential streets in those areas of the district yet to be developed. 
(2)  Factors to be considered by the planning board. The planning board's review of a development plan shall include but is not limited to the following considerations in addition to provisions contained in section 70-191 et seq.: 
a.  Specific standards. 
1.  Parking requirements shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 70-661 et seq. 
(3)  Access to diversified development district. Access to the diversified development district shall be limited to three points from Route 196 which shall be a minimum of 500 feet apart. The proposed development shall indicate how it proposes to utilize such access points. Entrances to uses in existence on January 1, 1996, may be continued for those uses but may not be utilized for other uses. Entrances on Gartley Street shall be allowed without regard to the restrictions listed in this paragraph. 
(4)  Internal vehicular circulation. The layout of the site will provide for the safe movement of passenger, service and emergency vehicles through the site. 
a.  Nonresidential projects will provide a clear route for delivery vehicles with appropriate geometric design to allow turning and backing for such delivery vehicles. 
b.  Clear routes of access will be provided and maintained for emergency vehicles to all portions of the site and will be posted with appropriate language. 
c.  The layout and design of parking will provide for safe and convenient circulation of vehicles throughout the lot and will discourage vehicles from backing out onto a street. 
(5)  Pedestrian circulation. All development plans shall include a route for pedestrian traffic. The development plan will provide for a system of pedestrian circulation within the development and to adjacent developments and/or development areas. This system will connect with existing sidewalks if they exist in the vicinity of the project. The pedestrian network may be located either in the street right-of-way or outside the right-of-way in open space or recreation areas. The system will be designed to link residential units with recreational and commercial facilities, other common facilities, school bus stops, and existing sidewalks in the neighborhood. 
(6)  Open space. 
a.  Common open spaces as shown on any approved development plan shall contain a notation that common open space areas shall not be further developed for any other use without planning board approval. 
b.  When reviewing the location and type of open space designated in the development plan, the planning board shall consider the following criteria: 
1.  Individual lots, buildings, streets and parking areas shall be designed and situated: 
i.  To minimize alterations of the natural site; 
ii.  To avoid the adverse effects of shadows, noise and traffic on the residents of the site; 
iii.  To relate to surrounding properties, to improve the view from and of buildings. 
2.  Open space shall include irreplaceable natural features located on the tract (such as but not limited to stream beds, significant standards of trees, individual trees of significant size and rock outcroppings). 
3.  Open space intended for recreation or public use shall be determined by the size, shape, topographic and location requirements of the site. 
4.  The planning board may allow up to 100 percent of the required open space to be comprised of land not suitable for development. 
(7)  Utilities. 
a.  Utilities shall be installed underground except as otherwise approved by the planning board. 
b.  Underground utilities shall be installed only within the limits of the access to the property (i.e., no utility easements shall be permitted); and, to the extent practicable, provisions shall be made for stubs to developable land passed by the utilities to avoid disruption of the pavement. 
c.  The size, type and location of streetlights, electric and gas lines, telephone and other utilities shall be shown on the development plan and approved by the planning board. 
(8)  Advertising features. The size, location, texture and lighting of all exterior signs and outdoor advertising structures or features shall not detract from the layout of the property and the design of proposed buildings and structures and the surrounding properties, and shall not constitute hazards to vehicles and pedestrians. The development plan shall include the proposed sign design and be approved by the planning board. Total sign area is limited to 60 square feet per sign. 
(9)  Special features. Exposed storage areas, exposed machinery installations, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings and structures, and similar accessory areas and structures shall be subject to such setbacks, screen plantings or other screening methods as shall reasonably be required to prevent their being incongruous with the existing or contemplated environment and the surrounding properties. 
(10)  Exterior lighting. All exterior lighting shall be designed to encourage energy efficiency, to ensure safe movement of people and vehicles, and to minimize adverse impact on neighboring properties and public ways. Adverse impact is to be judged in terms of hazards to people and vehicular traffic and potential damage to the value of adjacent properties. Lighting shall be arranged to minimize glare and reflection on adjacent properties and the traveling public. 
(11)  Emergency vehicle access. Provisions shall be made for providing and maintaining convenient and safe emergency vehicle access to all buildings and structures at all times. 
(12)  Landscaping. Landscaping, including those areas contained in the open space ratio, shall be designed and installed to define, soften or screen the appearance of off-street parking areas from the public right-of-way and abutting properties, to enhance the physical design of the buildings and site, and to minimize the encroachment of the proposed use on neighboring land uses. 
(13)  Conversion of existing buildings. Where existing structures located in the diversified development district are converted from residential to another use, access to that use shall be allowed via Route 196 if the distance is consistent with subsection (3) of this section. All other structures shall be accessed through the diversified development district. 
(14)  Relation of proposed buildings to environment. Proposed structures shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings in the vicinity that have a visual relationship to the proposed structures, so as to have minimally adverse affect on the environmental and aesthetic qualifies of the developed and neighboring areas. Colors of structures should correspond to the adjacent properties and landscape.

DIVISION 15. - ZONING AMENDMENTS 

Sec. 70-537. - Map 1. 
    The former Knight-Celotex site was recently rezoned from industrial to commercial; a minor change is proposed for the property across from it on Route 196, to provide for commercial frontage along both sides of Route 196 (Lisbon Street) at the gateway (Lisbon town line). 

( C.M. of 6-21-2016, V. 2016-146 ) 
Sec. 70-538. - Map 2. 
    With consideration for the vision for the Lisbon Falls waterfront area (Route 196 Corridor Plan), including the Worumbo site, this area is proposed to be rezoned from commercial to village. Village zoning would allow for more mixed uses (including residential, which is not allowed in commercial), and has more flexible dimensional standards such as setbacks and lot coverage, which may help with the redevelopment of the waterfront area. The commercial zone also allows some potentially incompatible land uses in the village, such as warehousing, truck terminals, electrical/plumbing/contractor yards, or manufacturing. None of the existing land uses would become nonconforming by rezoning to village. 

( C.M. of 6-21-2016, V. 2016-146 ) 
Sec. 70-539. - Map 3. 
    The rear lot of the school property, where the middle school and fields are located, was at some point zoned general residential instead of village, like the high school property. However, technically schools and school uses are not allowed in the general residential zone. Give the zoning of the high school lot and abutting commercial zone, this lot would be more compatible (and no longer nonconforming) if rezoned to village. 

( C.M. of 6-21-2016, V. 2016-146 ) 
Sec. 70-540. - Map 4. 
    In Lisbon Village there is a proposed expansion of the village zone along Route 196 to include Village Street (currently the zone doesn't allow business uses), and the areas around Spring Street and one side of Park Street. The vision for Village Street in both the Downtown Plan and Route 196 Plan calls for allowing traditional village mixed uses. Expanding the village zone to include the Spring Street and Park Street areas would still allow for the existing residential uses, areas which might remain predominantly residential for some time, but would provide for future opportunities for small business growth in Lisbon Village. 

( C.M. of 6-21-2016, V. 2016-146 ) 
Sec. 70-541. - Comprehensive plan-Future land use plan. 
    The proposed zoning changes in Lisbon Falls and Lisbon Village are all consistent with the text and policies set forth in the Lisbon Comprehensive Plan. However, the changes proposed in Lisbon Falls are not consistent with the future land use plan, a map that is part of the land use section of the comprehensive plan. This map must be updated in order to keep the comprehensive plan and zoning map consistent. This change to the future land use map is consistent with the town's comprehensive plan text, Route 196 Corridor Plan, and downtown plan.

Sec. 70-561. - Purpose. 
    The mapped sand and gravel aquifers should be capable of providing substantial quantities of water for existing and potential uses, both public and private. By nature, they are sensitive to pollution. The purpose of the aquifer protection overlay district is to protect the town's sand and gravel aquifers and public drinking water supplies from adverse development or land use practices that have the potential to reduce the quality and quantity of groundwater that is now and in the future will be available for use by the municipalities, individuals and industries. In order to protect existing public water supply sources and provide for potential future sources, the Lisbon Water Department has mapped areas that contribute groundwater to the town's supply wells and identified aquifer areas that may serve as future supplies for private or public uses. 
(C.M. of 8-16-2011, V. 2011-153; C.M. of 10-21-2014, V. 2014-220) 
Sec. 70-562. - Establishment and delineation. 
(1)  For the purposes of this division, there is hereby established the aquifer protection overlay district consisting of sand and gravel aquifers and which is divided into three zones requiring varying degrees of protection. The aquifer protection overlay district and each of the zones are delineated on the official zoning map entitled "Zoning Map of Lisbon, Maine." This map shall be deemed an integral part of this division and shall be filed at the town office. Wellheads, aquifers and aquifer recharge areas are defined in part by Emery & Garrett, 1993: The Cost of No Wellhead Protection in Maine and by standard geologic and hydrologic investigations which may include drilling observation wells, performing pumping tests, water sampling and geologic mapping. New areas identified by any of these methods may be added to this chapter by amendment. Due to the limitations of hydrogeological techniques, exact boundaries of aquifers have some uncertainty. Provisions are made for applicants to provide information on the location of the district boundary as pertains to a particular parcel of land or development. 
(a)  Aquifer protection overlay zones . There are three zones to the aquifer protection overlay district as follows: 
1)  Zone 1: Immediate Wellhead Recharge Zones: Zone 1 extends from each public water supply wellhead to the 200-day groundwater time-of-travel boundary. 
2)  Zone 2: Primary Recharge Zones: Zone 2 extends from the outer boundary of Zone 1 to the 2,500-day time-of-travel boundary. Zone 2 also includes an area within the aquifer located in the northwesterly portion of town and adjacent to the Androscoggin River. A test well was done there and a portion of the aquifer was identified through professional hydrogeologic evaluation as a potential new municipal well location. Zone 2 standards shall be applied to that area within the aquifer centered at the test wellhead and having a radius of 1,500 feet. 
a.  Any test well created in any other area of the town that is identified by the board of water commissioners as "viable for development as a source of municipal water" and certified by a qualified hydrogeologist or equivalent, may also be considered part of Zone 2 where it is located and within a circle having a radius of 1,500 feet from the test well head. However, a test well may only be considered part of Zone 2 if it is identified as "viable for development as a source of municipal water" and action to include the new wellhead area within Zone 2 is pursuant to section 70-7 of this chapter. 
3)  Zone 3: Sand and Gravel Aquifer Zones: Zone 3 includes the remainder of the sand and gravel aquifers and aquifer recharge areas. Zone 3 areas may provide secondary, long-term recharge to public water supply wellheads or serve as potential sources of significant quantities of groundwater for future private and public uses. Mapping of these areas coincides with sand and gravel aquifer maps produced by the Maine Geological Survey and United States Geological Survey. 
(2)  Pursuant to section 70-7, the delineation of the aquifer protection overlay district and zones may be revised by the town council as the extent of the wellheads, aquifers and recharge areas are more accurately defined. 
(3)  Where the bounds as delineated are in doubt or in dispute, the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant disputing the boundary of the land in question to show where the bounds should properly be located. The applicant disputing the boundary shall engage a professional geologist or a professional hydrologist to determine more accurately the location and extent of an aquifer or recharge area. The consultant to be engaged shall be approved by the planning board. The cost of the investigation shall be completely borne by the applicant disputing the boundary. 
(4)  Where there is conflict between the provisions of this division and the provisions of 38 M.R.S.A § 1393 and 38 M.R.S.A § 1394, the more restrictive shall control.

  Plans for any changes to existing remediation activities shall be reported to the board of water commissioners and the town engineer. Changes to remediation activity may be exempt from planning board review. Planning board review will not be required if the town engineer, with the concurrence of the board of water commissioners determines that the changes will have no negative material impact beyond the property boundary nor upon the water quality or quantity available to the town water supply. Proposed changes shall be submitted for review and approval. 
  The following procedures shall be applied to determine if planning board review is required: 
  Owner/remediator must simultaneously submit a report of planned activity changes and the expected effect prepared by qualified professional to both the town engineer and to the board of water commissioners. A copy shall also be sent to the planning board. The report must make the case for "no material impact beyond the property boundary or upon the water quality or quantity available to the town water supply." 
  Within 30 days of receipt of the report, the town engineer and the board of water commissioners (two entities with one decision-vice 4 votes) must determine the potential material impact on the site and whether peer review is required. If peer review is determined to be appropriate, the town engineer shall immediately seek the services of a qualified professional to provide the review. Such review shall be at the total expense of the remediator/owner. Upon receipt of the peer review report, the town engineer shall immediately forward a copy to the water commissioners and the planning board. Within 30 days of receipt of the peer review report, the town engineer shall again consult with the board of water commissioners and together, those two entities will decide, whether planning board review and conditional use approval is required. The town engineer will then promptly notify the owner/remediator and the planning board of the decision. 
  If no peer review is required, the town engineer and the board of water commissioners (two entities with one decision-vice 4 votes) shall determine whether the planning board review and conditional use approval is required. The town engineer will then promptly notify the owner/remediator and planning board of the decision. 
  It shall be noted herein that if the town engineer and the board of water commissioners cannot mutually agree upon a course of action within the specified time limits of 30 days subsequent to receipt of required reports, (either before or after a peer review) then planning board review will be required. 
  Decisions of the town engineer and the board of water commissioners shall be formalized in a written document and signed by both entities. 
  The requirements under this provision shall not prohibit emergency responses to pollution occurrences and shall not apply to treatment of private drinking water supplies. 
15  Does not include single track sidings where materials handled are in solid form at normal air temperatures. 
16  Conditional use permit shall apply only to the following. In zone 2, storage of up to 220 gallons of petroleum based products, in containers having a capacity of 55 gallons or less when such products are for a permitted use and are for maintenance of equipment or vehicles. Such products shall be stored indoors on impermeable surfaces and in covered containers located to allow visual inspection for leaks. If product is for use on site, the storage area shall have containment equal to 110% the volume of the total quantity stored. In zone 3, storage shall be in compliance with Department of Environmental Protection (Chapters 691 and 695) and State Fire Marshal's Office (FM Chapter 34) Rules In Zones 2 and 3, products in 5 (five) gallon or smaller containers may be stored, handled or presented for retail sale. Storage, handling and presentation for wholesale sales and/or distribution of products in 5-gallon or smaller containers when the total quantity exceeds 220 gallons requires containment as described above. 
17  Except that stumps generated on site may be land-filled in accordance with Maine Department of Environmental Protection Rules. 
18  Demanufacturing must comply with applicable conditional use standards and shall be done in an enclosed building.

Sec. 70-609. - Conversion of existing buildings to multiple-unit housing. 
(a)  General requirements. Conversion of existing buildings which do not meet dimensional or parking requirements to multiple-unit housing in the village and general residential districts may be allowed by conditional use permit from the planning board. A conditional use permit may be granted to allow reasonable economic return for the property so long as the intensity or density of the use is reasonable for the neighborhood. A determination of reasonable economic return may include consideration of heating costs, property taxes, size and obsolescence. In granting a conditional use permit, the planning board may require conditions such as date of construction, minimum dwelling unit size, outside structural modification limits, and maintenance of lawn, shrub, or green areas. 
(b)  Conditional use limitations. 
(1)  In the general residential zone, decrease of dimensional requirements by not more than 55 percent; decrease of parking requirements by not more than 50 percent. 
(2)  In the village zone, decrease of area and/or parking requirements may be reduced by not more than two-thirds. 
(c)  Guidelines. In setting required conditions, the planning board shall use the following guidelines: 
(1)  Construction date. The building must have been constructed prior to 1935. 
(2)  Minimum dwelling size. The minimum dwelling size shall be: 
a.  At least 450 square feet for a single-person dwelling unit. 
b.  At least 600 square feet for a two-person dwelling unit. 
c.  At least 150 additional square feet per additional person. 
(3)  Exterior. Exteriors of structures shall be maintained or reconstructed in a manner so that the architectural and aesthetic character of the property and of the neighborhood is maintained. 
(4)  Open space. Open, unpaved (lawn, garden, shrub or tree) area of a minimum equal to half the combined floor space of the dwelling units but no less than 25 percent of the property shall be maintained.

(T.M. of 5-16-1992, art. 86, § 15-616) 
Sec. 70-611. - Archaeological sites. 
    Any proposed land use activity within the shoreland zone involving structural development or soil disturbance on or adjacent to sites listed on or eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as determined by the permitting authority, shall be submitted by the applicant to the state historic preservation commission for review and comment at least 20 days prior to action being taken by the permitting authority. The permitting authority shall consider comments received from the commission prior to rendering a decision on the application. 
Note. Municipal officials should contact the historic preservation commission for the listing and location of historic places in their community. 
(T.M. of 5-16-1992, art. 86, § 15-617) 
Sec. 70-612. - Roads and driveways. 
    The following standards shall apply to the construction of roads and/or driveways and drainage systems, culverts and other related features within the shoreland zone: 
(1)  Roads and driveways shall be set back at least 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland unless no reasonable alternative exists as determined by the planning board. If no other reasonable alternative exists, the planning board may reduce the road and/or driveway setback requirement to no less than 50 feet, horizontal distance, upon clear showing by the applicant that appropriate techniques will be used to prevent sedimentation of the water body, tributary stream or wetland. Such techniques may include, but are not limited to, the installation of settling basins, and/or the effective use of additional ditch relief culverts and turnouts placed so as to avoid sedimentation of the water body, tributary stream, or wetland. On slopes of greater than 20 percent the road and/or driveway setback shall be increased by ten feet, horizontal distance, for each five percent increase in slope above 20 percent. This subsection shall not apply to approaches to water crossings or to roads or driveways that provide access to permitted structures and/or facilities located nearer to the shoreline due to an operational necessity, excluding temporary docks for recreational uses. Roads and driveways providing access to permitted structures within the setback area shall comply fully with the requirements of this subsection except for that portion of the road or driveway necessary for direct access to the structure. 
(2)  Existing public roads may be expanded within the legal road right-of-way regardless of its setback from a water body, tributary stream or wetland. 
(3)  New roads and driveways are prohibited in a resource protection district except that the planning board may grant a permit to construct a road or driveway to provide access to permitted uses within the district. A road or driveway may also be approved by the planning board in a resource protection district upon a finding that no reasonable alternative route or location is available outside the district. When a road or driveway is permitted in a resource protection district the road and/or driveway shall be set back as far as practicable from the normal high water line of a water body, tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland. 
(4)  Road and driveway banks shall be no steeper than a slope of two horizontal to one vertical, and shall be graded and stabilized in accordance with the provisions for erosion and sedimentation control contained in State of Maine Guidelines for Municipal Shoreland Zoning Ordinances, section 15, subsection Q. 
(5)  Road and driveway grades shall be no greater than ten percent except for segments of less than 200 feet. 
(6)  In order to prevent road and driveway surface drainage from directly entering water bodies, tributary streams and wetlands roads and driveways shall be designed, constructed and maintained to empty onto an unscarified buffer strip at least 50 feet plus two times the average slope in width between the outflow point of the ditch or culvert and the normal high water line of a water body, tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland. Surface drainage which is directed to an unscarified buffer strip shall be diffused or spread out to promote infiltration of the runoff and to minimize channelized flow of the drainage through the buffer strip. 
(7)  Ditch relief (cross drainage) culverts, drainage dips and water turnouts shall be installed in a manner effective in directing drainage onto unscarified buffer strips before the flow gains sufficient volume or head to erode the road, driveway or ditch. To accomplish this, the following shall apply: 
a.  Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and associated water turnouts shall be spaced along the road, or driveway at intervals no greater than indicated in the following table: 
Grade (Percent) Spacing (Feet) 0-2 250 3-5 200-135 6-10 100-80 11-15 80-60 16-20 60-45 21+ 40  
b.  Drainage dips may be used in place of ditch relief culverts only where the grade is ten percent or less. 
c.  On sections having slopes greater than ten percent, ditch relief culverts shall be placed at approximately a 30-degree angle downslope from a line perpendicular to the centerline of the road or driveway. 
d.  Ditch relief culverts shall be sufficiently sized and properly installed in order to allow for effective functioning, and their inlet and outlet ends shall be stabilized with appropriate materials. 
(8)  Ditches, culverts, bridges, dips, water turnouts and other stormwater runoff control installations associated with roads and driveways shall be maintained on a regular basis to ensure effective functioning.

Sec. 70-613. - Essential services generally. 
    In the shoreland zone, the installation of essential services shall comply with the following: 
(1)  Where feasible, the installation of essential services shall be limited to existing public ways and existing service corridors. 
(2)  The installation of essential services, other than road-side distribution lines, is not permitted in a resource protection district, except to provide services to a permitted use within that district, or except where the applicant demonstrates that no reasonable alternative exists. Where permitted, such structures and facilities shall be located so as to minimize any adverse impacts on surrounding uses and resources, including visual impacts. 
(3)  Damaged or destroyed public utility transmission and distribution lines, towers and related equipment may be replaced or reconstructed without a permit.

Any sign lighting that creates a safety hazard or glare to pedestrians or motorists must be replaced to address the safety hazard, or removed entirely. 
(b)  External sign illumination. Lighting should be fully shielded and should not produce a glare that is distracting to motorists, pedestrians, or cyclists. Fixtures should be carefully aimed so that light is directed only onto the sign. Top-mounted shielded lighting or indirect lighting is preferred over ground-mounted lighting as it has reduced impacts on light pollution and glare. 
(c)  Internally illuminated signs. Internally illuminated signs shall not create glare that would distract motorists, nor should the degree of illumination disturb any surrounding residential areas or contribute to light pollution. 
1)  Neon signs. Neon tube lettering or graphics shall be used only for window signs, and shall not exceed 25% of the window area in which they are located. 
(d)  Changeable electronic or digital signs. See section 70-719, Standards by Sign Type.

DIVISION 6. - TIMBER HARVESTING AND CLEARING OF VEGETATION 

Sec. 70-731. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- C.M. of 9-3-2013, V. 2013-138, repealed § 70-731, which pertained to timber harvesting and derived from Code 1983, § 15-611(1); T.M. of 5-16-1992, art. 86, § 15-611; T.M. of 7-21-2009, § 2009-109. All timber harvesting activity within a shoreland zone is administered by the Maine Forest Service (MFS) effective Jan. 1, 2013. 
Sec. 70-732. - Clearing or removal of vegetation for activities other than timber harvesting. 
    For clearing of vegetation for development within 250 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high water line of a river; within 250 feet of the upland edge of a freshwater wetland; or within 75 feet of the normal high water line of a stream, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Within a shoreland area zoned for resource protection, cutting or removal of vegetation shall be limited to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that district. 
(2)  Except in areas as described in subsection (1) of this section, and except to allow for the development of permitted uses, within a strip of land extending 75 feet, horizontal distance, from any other water body, tributary stream or the upland edge of a freshwater wetland, a buffer strip of vegetation shall be preserved as follows: 
a.  There shall be no cleared opening greater than 250 square feet in the forest canopy (or other existing woody vegetation if a forest canopy is not present) as measured from the outer limits of the tree or shrub crown. However, a footpath not to exceed six feet in width as measured between tree trunks and/or shrub stems is permitted provided a cleared line of sight to the water through the buffer strip is not created. 
b.  Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is permitted provided that a well-distributed stand of trees and other natural vegetation is maintained. For the purposes of this section, a well-distributed stand of trees shall be defined as maintaining a minimum rating score of 16 per 25-foot by 50-foot (1,250 square feet) rectangular area as determined by the following rating system: 
Diameter of Tree at 41/2 Feet Above Ground Level (Inches) Points 2-< 4 in. 1 4-< 8 in. 2 8-< 12 in. 4 12 in. or greater 8  
The following shall govern in applying this point system: 
1.  The 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular plots must be established where the landowner or lessee proposes clearing within the required buffer; 
2.  Each successive plot must be adjacent to, but not overlap a previous plot; 
3.  Any plot not containing the required points must have no vegetation removed except as otherwise allowed by this section; 
4.  Any plot containing the required points may have vegetation removed down to the minimum points required or as otherwise allowed by the ordinance from which this section was derived; 
5.  Where conditions permit, no more than 50% of the points on any 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular area may consist of trees greater than 12 inches in diameter. 
For the purposes of this section, "other natural vegetation" is defined as retaining existing vegetation under three feet in height and other ground cover and retaining at least five saplings less than two inches in diameter at four and one-half feet above ground level for each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangle area. If five saplings do not exist, no woody stems less than two inches in diameter can be removed until five saplings have been recruited into the plot. 
c.  Pruning of tree branches, on the bottom one-third of the tree is permitted. 
d.  In order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation, when the removal of storm-damaged, diseased, unsafe or dead trees results in the creation of cleared openings, these openings shall be replanted with native tree species unless existing new tree growth is present. 
e.  In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing vegetation under three feet in height and other ground cover, including leaf litter and the forest duff layer, shall not be cut, covered, or removed, except to provide for a footpath or other permitted uses as described in subsections (2) and (2)(a) of this section. 
(3)  a.  At distances greater than 75 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high water line of any water body, tributary stream or the upland edge of a freshwater wetland, there shall be permitted on any lot, in any ten-year period, selective cutting of not more than 40 percent of the volume of trees four inches or more in diameter, measured four and one-half feet above ground level. Tree removal in conjunction with the development of permitted uses shall be included in the 40 percent calculation. For the purposes of these standards, volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area. 
b.  In no event shall cleared openings for any purpose, including but not limited to principal and accessory structures, driveways, lawns and sewage disposal areas, exceed in the aggregate 25 percent of the lot area within the shoreland zone or 10,000 square feet, whichever is greater, including land previously cleared. This provision shall not apply to the commercial and industrial districts. 
(4)  Cleared openings legally in existence on the effective date of this division (adopted at town meeting of May 16, 1992), may be maintained but shall not be enlarged except as permitted by this division. 
(5)  Fields and other cleared openings which have reverted to primarily shrubs, trees or other woody vegetation shall be regulated under the provisions of this division.

(1)  The person holding title to an existing sand and gravel pit shall provide the code enforcement officer a spill, prevention and control plan (SPCC) and documentation signed by a licensed geologist, engineer or soil scientist establishing the seasonal high water table in that portion of the pit within the aquifer protection overlay district, zones 2 or 3. 
(2)  Extraction of sand, gravel or other material from the pit shall not be allowed below five feet above the seasonal high water table except that the limit may be waived to within 24? of the seasonal high water table upon approval of both the board of water commissioners and the planning board and provided that the pit owner complies with all applicable DEP rules and permitting processes to do so. No ditching, trenching, plumbing or other methods shall be used to artificially lower the seasonal high water table to permit the extraction of more material than could occur under normal conditions. 
(3)  If sand, gravel or other material has been or will be extracted below the five feet of separation, then the owner shall submit to the planning board for review and approval all documentation submitted to and received from the DEP regarding such reduction in separation including any orders or other reports, plans or correspondence. The town maintains the right to enforce all Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Rules and Performance Standards relating to gravel pits and other mining operations as well as provisions in any variance application(s) to the DEP and all provisions and conditions of the board order as if imposed by the town. The town also reserves the right to inspect such operations without cause provided the owner is given 24-hour notice. 
(4)  If sand, gravel or other material in an existing pit in the aquifer protection overlay district has been extracted below the limit set in this subsection, a plan showing how groundwater will be protected during continuing operations and closing of the pit shall be submitted for review and approval by the planning board based on the standards and criteria contained in the ordinance from which this section was derived and applicable Maine Statutes and Maine DEP Rules. 
(5)  If sand, gravel, or other material in an existing pit has been extracted, or is proposed to be extracted below the 5 feet of separation the owner shall provide a report indicating how those areas in the aquifer protection overlay district that are mined below the five feet of separation will be closed. 
(a)  The plan shall provide for a phased closure of these areas as well as banks that are adjacent to these areas. 
(b)  The plan can be in the form of map plans or a narrative accompanied by an aerial photograph on which the phased areas are denoted. 
(c)  The plan shall specify how groundwater is to be protected from future overlying uses as well as how slopes will be graded and protected from erosion. 
(d)  Closure must be completed within one year after extraction operations have ended or when more than one acre of land has been mined below the five-foot separation and will no longer be used. 
(6)  When pits are closed, all pits located in the aquifer protection overlay district shall be closed in such a manner as to prevent erosion, mitigate ground or surface waters and prevent safety hazards. Closures shall be accomplished in accordance with applicable Maine Statutes and Maine DEP Rules. A formal reclamation plan in accordance with DEP standards and using any applicable best management practices shall be created. The town shall maintain the right to enforce performance standards contained in the rules or as conditions of any permits or variances granted by the Maine DEP for the pit operation. 
(7)  Refueling and maintenance of equipment shall be conducted in accordance with the following standards: 
(a)  Refueling and maintenance of equipment permanently in place in the pit or that are used solely in the pit, such as crushers, large tracked excavators, cranes and the like shall be accomplished in a manner which will prevent the spillage of fuel, oils or fluid from contact with the ground. 
(b)  Refueling of other equipment such as loaders, dump trucks and other vehicles shall take place in a refueling area which shall consist of a layer of impervious material sloped so that spillage shall be contained by a six-inch dike which shall surround the area on at least three sides. Maintenance of such equipment shall take place in the refueling area or in a maintenance building, provided the floor of the building is constructed of impervious material or is made impervious by the use of methods approved by the department of environmental protection. 
(8)  The pit shall not be used to dump, store or process any substance other than sand, gravel or crushed stone. 
(9)  If petroleum storage is used or proposed an above ground fully contained storage and refueling area must be provided. Additional standards set forth in section 70-570 shall also apply.

DIVISION 10. - MUNICIPAL SHORELAND ZONING 

Sec. 70-810. - Background. 
    The Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act, 38 M.R.S.A. sections 435-449, requires all municipalities to adopt, administer, and enforce ordinances that regulate land use activities within 250 feet of great ponds, rivers, and freshwater wetlands, and within 75 feet of streams. The Act also requires the Board of Environmental Protection to establish minimum guidelines for such ordinances. The Act requires that municipalities adopt shoreland zoning ordinances consistent with, or no less stringent than, the state minimum guidelines, and that in addition to the ordinances, the municipality establish an official shoreland zoning map. The standards of the shoreland zoning ordinance regulate the land use, buildings, structures, and site work within the designated shoreland area, in conformance with state requirements. 
(C.M. of 7-2-2013, V. 2013-98) 
Sec. 70-811. - Purpose. 
    Shoreland zoning regulations are incorporated into the land use Zoning Ordinance Chapter 70 Articles I through VI. The official shoreland zoning map, which illustrates the location and extent of shoreland overlay zones and shoreland districts, is required in order to comply with the Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act, and is needed for the town's permitting process.

Sec. 70-813. - Shoreland zoning map description. 
    The shoreland zoning map is developed based on the states requirements and definitions on the regulation of (a) all land areas within 250 feet horizontal distance of the normal high-water line of any great pond, river or contiguous wetlands larger than 2 acres, or (b) all land areas within 75 feet horizontal distance of the normal high-water line of a stream. 
(C.M. of 7-2-2013, V. 2013-98) 
Sec. 70-814. - Shoreland overlay zone districts. 
    The shoreland overlay zone is divided into the following districts which are shown on the Official Shoreland Zoning Map(s), and which are made part of the town's shoreland zoning ordinance: 
(A)  Resource Protection. 
(B)  Limited Residential. 
(C)  Limited Commercial. 
(D)  General Development I. 
(E)  Stream Protection. 
    District boundary lines are property lines, the centerline of streets, roads and rights of way, and the boundaries of the shoreland area as defined herein. Where uncertainty exists as to the exact location of district boundary lines, the Board of Appeals shall be the final authority as to location. 
(C.M. of 7-2-2013, V. 2013-98)

(2)  Land below the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland and land beneath roads serving more than two (2) lots shall not be included toward calculating minimum lot area. 
(3)  Lots located on opposite sides of a public or private road shall be considered each a separate tract or parcel of land unless such road was established by the owner of land on both sides thereof after September 22, 1971. 
(4)  The minimum width of any portion of any lot within one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland shall be equal to or greater than the shore frontage requirement for a lot with the proposed use. 
(5)  If more than one residential dwelling unit, principal governmental, institutional, commercial or industrial structure or use, or combination thereof, is constructed or established on a single parcel, all dimensional requirements shall be met for each additional dwelling unit, principal structure, or use. 
B.  Principal and Accessory Structures. 
(1)  All new principal and accessory structures shall be set back at least one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of great ponds classified GPA and rivers that flow to great ponds classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of other water bodies, tributary streams, or the upland edge of a wetland, except that in the General Development I District the setback from the normal high-water line shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet, horizontal distance, and in the Commercial Fisheries/Maritime Activities District there shall be no minimum setback. In the Resource Protection District the setback requirement shall be 250 feet, horizontal distance, except for structures, roads, parking spaces or other regulated objects specifically allowed in that district in which case the setback requirements specified above shall apply. 
In addition: 
(a)  The water body, tributary stream, or wetland setback provision shall neither apply to structures which require direct access to the water body or wetland as an operational necessity, such as piers, docks and retaining walls, nor to other functionally water-dependent uses. 
(b)  All principal structures along Significant River Segments as listed in 38 M.R.S.A. section 437 (see Appendix B), shall be set back a minimum of one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line and shall be screened from the river by existing vegetation. This provision does not apply to structures related to hydropower facilities. 
(c)  For principal structures, water and wetland setback measurements shall be taken from the top of a coastal bluff that has been identified on Coastal Bluff maps as being "highly unstable" or "unstable" by the Maine Geological Survey pursuant to its "Classification of Coastal Bluffs" and published on the most recent Coastal Bluff map. If the applicant and the permitting official(s) are in disagreement as to the specific location of a "highly unstable" or "unstable" bluff, or where the top of the bluff is located, the applicant may at his or her expense, employ a Maine Registered Professional Engineer, a Maine Certified Soil Scientist, a Maine State Geologist, or other qualified individual to make a determination. If agreement is still not reached, the applicant may appeal the matter to the board of appeals. 
(d)  On a non-conforming lot of record on which only a residential structure exists, and it is not possible to place an accessory structure meeting the required water body, tributary stream or wetland setbacks, the code enforcement officer may issue a permit to place a single accessory structure, with no utilities, for the storage of yard tools and similar equipment. Such accessory structure shall not exceed eighty (80) square feet in area nor eight (8) feet in height, and shall be located as far from the shoreline or tributary stream as practical and shall meet all other applicable standards, including lot coverage and vegetation clearing limitations. In no case shall the structure be located closer to the shoreline or tributary stream than the principal structure. 
(2)  Principal or accessory structures and expansions of existing structures which are permitted in the Resource Protection, Limited Residential, Limited Commercial, and Stream Protection Districts, shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet in height. This provision shall not apply to structures such as transmission towers, windmills, antennas, and similar structures having no floor area. 
(3)  The lowest floor elevation or openings of all buildings and structures, including basements, shall be elevated at least one foot above the elevation of the 100-year flood, the flood of record, or in the absence of these, the flood as defined by soil types identified as recent flood-plain soils. In those municipalities that participate in the National Flood Insurance Program and have adopted the April 2005 version, or later version, of the Floodplain Management Ordinance, accessory structures may be placed in accordance with the standards of that ordinance and need not meet the elevation requirements of this paragraph. 
(4)  The total footprint area of all structures, parking lots and other non-vegetated surfaces, within the shoreland zone shall not exceed twenty (20) percent of the lot or a portion thereof, located within the shoreland zone, including land area previously developed, except in the General Development District adjacent to tidal waters and rivers that do not flow to great ponds classified GPA, and in the Commercial Fisheries/Maritime Activities District, where lot coverage shall not exceed seventy (70) percent. 
(5)  Retaining walls that are not necessary for erosion control shall meet the structure setback requirement, except for low retaining walls and associated fill provided all of the following conditions are met: 
(a)  The site has been previously altered and an effective vegetated buffer does not exist; 
(b)  The wall(s) is(are) at least 25 feet, horizontal distance, from the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland; 
(c)  The site where the retaining wall will be constructed is legally existing lawn or is a site eroding from lack of naturally occurring vegetation, and which cannot be stabilized with vegetative plantings; 
(d)  The total height of the wall(s), in the aggregate, are no more than 24 inches; 
(e)  Retaining walls are located outside of the 100-year floodplain on rivers, streams, coastal wetlands, and tributary streams, as designated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps or Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, or the flood of record, or in the absence of these, by soil types identified as recent flood plain soils. 
(f)  The area behind the wall is revegetated with grass, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof, and no further structural development will occur within the setback area, including patios and decks; and 
(g)  A vegetated buffer area is established within 25 feet, horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of a water body, tributary stream, or upland edge of a wetland when a natural buffer area does not exist. The buffer area must meet the following characteristics: 
(i)  The buffer must include shrubs and other woody and herbaceous vegetation. Where natural ground cover is lacking the area must be supplemented with leaf or bark mulch; 
(ii)  Vegetation plantings must be in quantities sufficient to retard erosion and provide for effective infiltration of stormwater runoff; 
(iii)  Only native species may be used to establish the buffer area; 
(iv)  A minimum buffer width of 15 feet, horizontal distance, is required, measured perpendicularly to the normal high-water line or upland edge of a wetland; 
(v)  A footpath not to exceed the standards in Section 15(P)(2)(a), may traverse the buffer; 
(6)  Notwithstanding the requirements stated above, stairways or similar structures may be allowed with a permit from the Code Enforcement Officer, to provide shoreline access in areas of steep slopes or unstable soils provided: that the structure is limited to a maximum of four (4) feet in width; that the structure does not extend below or over the normal high-water line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland, (unless permitted by the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to the Natural Resources Protection Act, 38 M.R.S.A. section 480-C); and that the applicant demonstrates that no reasonable access alternative exists on the property.

    Landscape buffer means an area with grass, trees or other landscape plantings that is predominantly vegetated and serves to create a pleasant transition between built site elements or between a development site and an adjacent use, property, or right-of-way. 
    Landscape screen or screening means an area with trees, landscape plantings, and/or fencing that serves as a year-round visual block for a particular site feature or between a development site and an adjacent use, property, or right-of-way. 
    Pedestrian access or pedestrian infrastructure means the physical construction elements of how a pedestrian accesses a building or site, generally including sidewalks, walkways, ramps, or stairs; pedestrian access and infrastructure also refers to the level of safety and interconnectedness of pedestrian ways within a development site or to adjacent sites, uses or rights-of-way. 
    Pedestrian scale means a development pattern where walking is safe and efficient, and where building and site layouts are more compact, interconnected, and because of the size and proportions, are generally well-suited for pedestrians. 
    Pedestrian-oriented development, related to pedestrian scale, means a project, site or development area of pedestrian scale and designed to conveniently accommodate pedestrians as opposed to auto-oriented development which emphasizes vehicle access and circulation. 
    Pre-construction value means the assessed value of a property, its buildings and site features, prior to any improvements or alterations requiring a town permit. For purposes of this ordinance, the determination of value shall include any permitted improvements or alterations within a five-year period. 
    Scale means building or landscape elements and form as they proportionally relate to each other and to humans. 
    Site improvements means construction or alterations impacting a site's impervious surfaces, structures, landscaping, or other managed or disturbed areas, generally resulting in the site being improved or enhanced. 
    Typical New England character means typical architectural styles, forms and features that originated from eighteenth and nineteenth century New England. This includes (but not absolutely limited to) typical architectural styles such as: Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Queen Anne, Shingle, and Colonial Revival. 
    Visual character, similar to character, means the visual aspects and physical features that comprise the appearance of a place and/or property, including both building and site features.

Sec. 70-830. - Purpose and intent. 
(1)  Purpose . The Route 196 Design Standards, along with the accompanying design guidelines have been developed to support the vision of the Route 196 Corridor Master Plan, adopted by the Lisbon Council in October 2013. The purpose of Design Standards and Guidelines is to provide a tool for the Town of Lisbon to improve the visual character of the Route 196 corridor. These standards and guidelines are meant to ensure that new development and redevelopment is designed and constructed with desired character in terms of architecture, scale, site layout and aesthetic/visual effect. They are meant to ensure that property owners, developers, contractors and other professionals understand the community values, i.e. those values expressed by the Comprehensive Plan and Route 196 Master Plan, which their designs must satisfy to be acceptable to the town. 
    Because the design standards and guidelines cannot anticipate the unique conditions or opportunities present on individual properties, there may be occasions where a specific standard or guideline may not apply. In such cases, it is incumbent upon both the applicant, and those charged with reviewing and approving the proposed project, to arrive at solutions that are still in keeping with the spirit and intent of the larger principals of the standards and guidelines. 
(2)  Goals . The Town of Lisbon has several existing ordinances which address design issues such as land use and zoning, dimensional standards, impacts on neighboring properties and uses, environmental or engineering design requirements, etc. The Route 196 Design Standards and accompanying design guidelines are meant to supplement those ordinance regulations, with more emphasis on the visual and aesthetic character of the Route 196 Corridor. Therefore, the goals include: 
(a)  Establishing a distinctive and visually appealing experience along the Route 196 Corridor and Village Main Streets. 
(b)  Encouraging quality development and redevelopment that respects the uniqueness of individual properties, while improving and reinforcing Lisbon's "sense of place" and local character. 
(c)  Upgrading the visual character and pedestrian scale of the Route 196 Corridor's non-residential properties through design elements including architecture, site planning, landscaping, and signage. 
(d)  Integrating design with land use, and transportation (vehicle, pedestrian, bicycle) to encourage the development of a safe, attractive, functional, and economically viable Route 196 Corridor. 
(C.M. of 5-6-2014, V. 2014-61) 
Sec. 70-831. - Jurisdiction and applicability. 
(1)  The Route 196 Design Standards and Guidelines apply only to non-residential development abutting or within 500 feet of the Route 196 Corridor designated sections of Main Street and Village Street. 
(a)  Design standards . Applications for new, non-residential development permitting or review, through the planning board or code enforcement office, are required to be consistent with the Route 196 Design Standards. In cases of redevelopment of an existing building or property, see the applicability table below (2). These standards are required by ordinance. 
(b)  Design guidelines. Applicants for any non-residential development permitting or review, through the planning board or code enforcement office, are strongly encouraged to be consistent with the Route 196 Design Guidelines. These are voluntary parameters to be used as a guide to development in addition to the requirements in the design standards. 
    Compliance with the Route 196 Design Guidelines will be required (versus encouraged) in circumstances when town funding, such as a grant or loan, is being provided for private improvements to the building, site or development. 
(2)  The table below indicates the applicability of the design standards to non-residential review and permitting applications along the Route 196 corridor. 
Permit Type Applicability Site plan review (PB or CEO) Full design standards apply Non-residential subdivision (PB) Full design standards apply Signage permit Any signage permit will require full compliance with the sign ordinance. The sign design guidelines will also be met to the greatest extent possible. Conditional use (PB or CEO) and all other permits (CEO) For building improvements or alterations, all new buildings and structures must comply with the architectural design standards. Any construction/alterations to an existing building totaling at least 25% of the building's pre-construction value must comply with the architectural design standards, though only for the facade facing Route 196, Main Street, or Village Street. The pre-construction value shall not include any improvements within 5 years of the application. For site improvements or alterations, all new site improvements or construction must comply with both site layout and landscaping design standards. For any site on which proposed site improvements are affecting an area of 25% or more of the total existing developed lot area (pre-construction), the entire site must comply with both site layout and landscaping design standards. The percentage of existing developed lot area (pre-construction) shall not include any site improvements within 5 years of the application. 
For permitting and review under the administration of the code enforcement officer, the code enforcement officer may refer applications to the planning board for purposes of design standards review as needed.  
(3)  Design submissions. Applicants for permitting and review under these Design Standards must provide sufficient visual illustrations, images, plans and/or exhibits to demonstrate the compliance with the standards and/or provide evidence as needed for waivers. Applicants may request a preliminary review or discussion with the code enforcement officer or planning board if further guidance is needed in determining what illustrations or exhibits are needed. 
(4)  Consistency shall be determined by the planning board or code enforcement officer, whoever is the applicable reviewing and permitting agent. As these design standards and guidelines cannot anticipate unique conditions or opportunities present on individual properties, there may be instances when a specific standard or guideline does not apply. Waivers may be granted when the applicant can clearly demonstrate: 
(a)  That a particular standard cannot apply or causes undue hardship as substantiated by the reviewing/permitting authority, or 
(b)  The proposed design, despite the non-compliant condition, is consistent with the purpose and intent of these design standards, or 
(c)  The proposed design, despite the non-compliant condition, is consistent with the vision and recommendations of the Route 196 Corridor Master Plan. 
A waiver request must be submitted to the code enforcement officer or planning board, whichever authority must ultimately review the application, accompanied by written documentation and reason for the waiver request. 
(5)  Other standards and regulations. 
(a)  It is the intent of the design standards to supplement, not supersede, town land use regulations and standards, and to further encourage design that improves and enhances the Route 196 corridor. 
(b)  The Route 196 Design Standards shall not supersede any applicable state and federal standards or regulations. 
(c)  These standards and guidelines do not encompass all requirements of permitting and review. Additional town standards and regulations are applicable, such as under Lisbon's Zoning Ordinance, site plan review, conditional use, subdivision, shoreland zoning, or other local, state and federal permitting and regulations pertaining to non-residential development. 
(C.M. of 5-6-2014, V. 2014-61) 
Sec. 70-832. - Character districts. 
(1)  Because the Route 196 Corridor Plan identified that different sections of the corridor have differing character, there are, in some cases, standards and guidelines that apply only to specific character districts along the corridor. The area of design guidelines applicability and the designated character districts are illustrated on the Route 196 Design Standards Overlay Map, (e) below. 
(a)  Village character district. 
1)  Purpose . The purpose of standards and guidelines for the village character districts along the Route 196 Corridor is to maintain the areas of existing village character and scale, and encourage village character and scale for development and redevelopment in other appropriate areas of the corridor. 
2)  District locations. Character districts shall include all abutting properties on Route 196 within the sections of road below, including any development within 500 feet of the right-of-way. 
a.  Lisbon Falls-between Topsham town line and Sugg Drive/Route 9. 
b.  Lisbon Center and Lisbon Village-between River Road and Littlefield Road. 
(b)  Village/Main Street character district. 
1)  Purpose . The purpose of standards and guidelines for the Village/Main Street character districts adjacent to the Route 196 Corridor is to maintain the areas of existing village character and scale that are distinct to the village "Main Streets." These areas have definable significance for Lisbon's character. This development form, unique architecture, and pedestrian scale, is part of Lisbon's unique character and must be protected. 
2)  District locations. Character districts shall include all abutting properties on Route 196 within the sections of road below, including any development within 500 feet of the right-of-way. 
a.  Main Street-between Lisbon Street and School Street. 
b.  Village Street-between Lisbon Street and Franklin/Gartley Streets. 
(c)  Highway commercial character district. 
1)  Purpose . The purpose of standards and guidelines for the highway commercial character districts along the Route 196 Corridor is to allow for appropriate scale and character, which is more auto-oriented access and development, in the corridor's major commercial districts, while seeking to improve the visual character of the corridor overall. 
2)  District locations. Character districts shall include all abutting properties on Route 196 within the sections of road below, including any development within 500 feet of the right-of-way. 
a.  Midtown Commercial Area-between Sugg Drive/Route 9 and Highland Avenue. 
b.  Western Commercial Gateway-between Littlefield Road and Lewiston town line. 
(d)  Rural transition character district. 
1)  Purpose . The purpose of standards and guidelines for the rural transition character districts along the Route 196 Corridor is to maintain the existing undeveloped character of portions of the corridor. 
2)  District locations. Character districts shall include all abutting properties on Route 196 within the sections of road below, including any development within 500 feet of the right-of-way. 
a.  Midtown Transition Area-between Highland Avenue and River Road.

(C.M. of 5-6-2014, V. 2014-61) 
Sec. 70-833. - Design standards. 
(1)  Site layout and general design. 
(a)  General standards by district. In addition to the General Standards, (b) through (f) below, these character district standards shall apply. 
1)  Village character district. 
a.  Lot layout. In village areas, buildings shall have small setbacks from the roadway, with frontage areas between the building and roadway that are well landscaped and have appropriate pedestrian access. Village areas will typically have speed limits 35 mph or lower, with an emphasis on pedestrian-scale site layout and less auto-oriented development. 
i.  Buildings shall be located close to the sidewalk or public right-of-way, consistent with surrounding buildings. 
ii.  Off-street parking shall be located to the side or rear of the building, not in front. 
b.  Scale and density. Buildings shall be constructed to a 11/2 to 2 story height (maximum building height of 35 feet), unless a lower building height is determined to be more compatible with the surrounding buildings. In cases of a building or buildings (connected) with a larger footprint (>5,000 square feet), the building massing must be broken up architecturally to be consistent with the village scale and surrounding buildings. The village districts are intended to support higher building density, with greater percentage of lot coverage and more units/square footage and mixed uses. 
c.  Architecture and character. Historic buildings and building character are to be maintained to the greatest extent possible; new construction should be generally described as "Typical New England Character" ( See (2) Architecture Standards ). 
2)  Village/Main Street character district. 
a.  Lot layout. In the Village/Main Street districts, buildings shall be located right next to or very close to the sidewalk or right-of-way, with emphasis on streetscape and pedestrian access in front of the building. Off-street parking is not allowed in front of buildings in this character district, only to the side or rear. The Village/Main Streets will typically have speed limits of 25 mph, with an emphasis on pedestrian-scale site layout and less auto-oriented development. 
b.  Scale and density. Buildings shall be constructed to a 11/2 to 2 story height (maximum building height of 35 feet), unless a lower building height is determined to be more compatible with the surrounding buildings. In cases of a building or buildings (connected) with a larger footprint (>5,000 square feet), the building massing must be broken up architecturally to be consistent with the village scale and surrounding buildings. The village districts are intended to support higher building density, with greater percentage of lot coverage and more units/square footage and mixed uses. 
c.  Architecture and character. In this district, historic buildings, building character, and building form are to be maintained to the greatest extent possible. Traditional "Main Street" or downtown buildings include first floor retail or business space with pedestrian-oriented facades. New construction should be village character and scale, and architectural style generally described as "Typical New England Character" ( See (2) Architecture Standards ), and be compatible in scale and architectural style with the existing and/or historic buildings. 
3)  Highway commercial character district. 
a.  Lot layout. In the highway commercial districts, buildings shall have larger setbacks from the roadway, with frontage areas between the building and roadway that are well landscaped and have appropriate pedestrian access. Highway commercial areas will typically have higher speed limits (above 35 mph, up to 45-50 mph) and/or wider roadway width, and while they tend to be more auto-oriented, the intent is to foster stronger pedestrian-oriented and pedestrian-scaled streetscape and development. 
i.  Buildings shall not be located immediately adjacent to the sidewalk or public right-of-way, allowing for frontage space to consist of landscaping and pedestrian infrastructure. 
ii.  Off-street parking is encouraged to be located to the side or rear of buildings, but where parking is between the building and the roadway, there shall be adequate landscaping or grass buffers per the parking and screening standards in this section. 
b.  Scale and density. Larger building footprints on larger lots are appropriate for highway commercial areas. Though front building setbacks are larger, it is still appropriate, though not strictly required, for buildings to be located towards the front of the buildable envelope, and for parking to be located to the side and rear of the building where possible. 
c.  Architecture and character. Development in the highway commercial character districts is expected to be more commercial than village in character, where the nature of the uses and building scale differs from village areas. However, for both building rehabilitation and new buildings, the architectural character will still be generally described as "Typical New England Character" ( See (2) Architecture Standards ). 
4)  Rural transition character district. 
a.  Lot layout. Buildings shall be well set back from the roadway, with the frontage emphasizing buffering and less visibility of the development from the road. The Rural Transition area will typically have higher speeds (above 45 mph) and less density of development, where there is less need for pedestrian-oriented development. Generally, building and site layout design standards are not applicable if development is buffered, but visual character standards are applicable to the layout and constructed features in the frontage. 
i.  Buildings shall be well separated from the roadway with a generous front setback and landscape buffering. 
ii.  Off-street parking is not allowed within the front setback, and must also be visually separated from the roadway with landscape buffering. 
b.  Access and pedestrian circulation. 
i.  Pedestrian connections are required but waivable (as defined earlier in this ordinance) in this character area. 
c.  All other site layout and design requirements under (b) through (f) below shall not apply to buildings or improvements in the rural transition character district, so long as there is adequate buffering and screening in the front setback. ( See section 70-833(3) Landscaping and Screening. ) For any structures, signs or site improvements that are within the front setback area or that are not screened from the roadway, the design standards under (c) highway commercial character district (above) shall apply. 
(b)  Building and structure location. 
1)  Front building setbacks are specified by zone (dimensional standards) and character district. ( See Ch. 70, Article IV, Division 14 Dimensional Requirements .) 
2)  Buildings shall be located as close to the front setback line as possible to provide scale and interest to the auto and pedestrian environment. Buildings should "face the road" whenever possible, in that the street-facing facade should be used as the main public/business entrance, and at a minimum shall have appropriate door and window spacing. 
(c)  Access and pedestrian circulation. 
1)  Buildings must have clearly marked and well-designed entrances, with safe pedestrian access from parking areas and existing sidewalks. 
2)  Where there are sidewalks in the public R.O.W. adjacent to the property, there shall be safe and clear pedestrian path connecting the building entrance(s) to the sidewalk(s), with strong encouragement to provide pedestrian connections to any abutting public access trails. 
3)  There shall be safe and well-designed internal pedestrian circulation, such as paths between parking and the building(s), or connecting to adjacent properties when appropriate. Pedestrian paths shall be separated from vehicle areas (such as parking and driveways) with curbing, green space, or other barrier deemed appropriate by the reviewing authority. 
4)  Drive-throughs, loading docks, and other service areas or structures shall be designed to minimize pedestrian conflicts and support a safe pedestrian environment. 
(d)  Parking and paved areas. 
1)  Parking and paved areas shall be located to the rear and side of buildings. Waivers may be considered by the reviewing authority if there are exigent circumstances. Consideration shall be given to proximity of residential homes, including needed screening or alternative location of parking areas. 
a.  When parking is in front of buildings and/or along the road, there shall be adequate landscaping or grass buffers between the parking area and buildings or roadways. ( See also (3) Landscaping Standards .) 
b.  Parking on the side of buildings shall not extend closer to the road than the front of the building, and shall have adequate landscaping or grass buffers along the roadway. 
2)  Areas of pavement such as for vehicle circulation or parking shall not extend up to or directly alongside buildings, except at doorways, garages, or loading areas (as allowed). There shall be an appropriately sized grass or landscaped buffer between any paved areas on the site and buildings or adjacent roads and sidewalks, except where not applicable in the Village or Main Street character areas where zero or near-zero front building setbacks are desired. These green buffers shall serve to visually soften built areas. ( See also (3) Landscaping Standards .) 
3)  Parking areas with more than 15 spaces shall be broken up with trees, landscaped islands, low decorative walls, or other appropriate features. ( See also (3) Landscaping Standards .) 
4)  Provisions shall be made for snow storage in the design of parking areas, and to the greatest extent possible shall not be in conflict with pedestrian circulation, landscaping, vehicle site distances, or drainage. 
(e)  Buffers and Screening. See (3) Landscaping Standards, below. 
(f)  Lighting, utilities, structures. 
1)  Utilities shall be located underground to the greatest extent possible. All above ground utility boxes or structures associated with underground utilities shall be screened with landscaping or decorative fencing, and shall be of a non-reflective, neutral or natural/earth tone color if not completely screened from view. 
2)  Site lighting fixtures not attached to buildings shall be of quality design with appropriate style and craftsmanship, and pedestrian-scaled. Light poles and fixtures should not be taller than the buildings on the site. 
3)  Site lighting fixtures shall only use recessed, shielded, or cut-off luminaire fixtures to reduce light glare and light pollution. 
4)  Site lighting fixtures for auto-related uses (car sales, repair, or gas stations) or for service related areas such as loading zones may be of a greater height if necessary, but shall emphasize the goal of minimizing light pollution while meeting safety and security needs. Canopy lighting must be fully recessed. 
5)  Dumpsters and propane or other fuel tanks shall be screened with fencing or landscaping, or may be located within an accessory structure. The design of the screening or enclosing structure must be consistent with the architecture and design for the site. 
(2)  Architecture . 
(a)  Typical New England character. For purposes of these design standards, typical New England character in terms of architectural style shall be broadly defined to include typical styles, forms and features that originated from eighteenth and nineteenth century New England. This includes (but not absolutely limited to) typical architectural styles such as: Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Queen Anne, Shingle, and Colonial Revival. 
a.  The requirement of employing typical New England character does not require following one particular architectural style, but requires that appropriate architectural form and features are used. 
b.  Styles that may be considered "contemporary" architecture may be allowable if the architectural style is shown to be compatible with the character of the surrounding neighborhood, the vision described in the Route 196 Corridor Master Plan, or with Lisbon's local character generally. 
c.  These design standards are not intended to require any compatibility or compliance with specific historic preservation standards, but wherever appropriate, historically accurate restoration of existing buildings or the construction of new buildings that are designed based on local historic architecture is strongly encouraged. 
(b)  General form and architecture. 
1)  Proposed structures shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings in the vicinity that have a visual relationship to the proposed structures so as to have a minimally adverse effect on the aesthetic qualities of the developed and neighboring areas. 
2)  Buildings shall have good scale, and be in harmony and compatible with neighboring development and with the character area. 
3)  A building's architecture shall reflect traditional New England building forms such as pitched roofs, dormers and windows (rather than undifferentiated plate glass). Free-standing accessory structures shall be treated as architectural elements and meet the same design standards as the principal structures on the site. 
4)  Existing and historic buildings and structures shall be retained whenever possible. Architectural features that are historic and/or are aesthetically positive shall be restored or appropriately replaced. In the case of building reuse and retrofitting, structures shall retain or be restored to their original character to the greatest extent possible if appropriate. This standard shall apply at a minimum to any historic structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or identified in the Lisbon Comprehensive Plan, but shall apply to any existing buildings that may have historic value or architectural character that contributes to Route 196 character. 
Though not a requirement, in cases where clarification is sought and findings needed on the specific historic architectural value or significance of a building or structure, the planning board or code enforcement officer may refer the case to the Lisbon Historical Society or Maine Historic Preservation Commission for input and comment. 
5)  Building components, such as windows, doors and eaves, shall have good proportions and relationships to one another. 
6)  Facade length. Long or continuous facades do not provide visual interest. Facades shall be articulated every 50 feet using varied setbacks, rooflines, materials and heights. 
7)  Drive-throughs, loading docks, and other attached building additions or structures that cannot be screened shall be harmonious in design with the building's architecture, in terms of scale, color, materials, and architectural style. 
8)  Primary or major public/customer entrances shall be emphasized through the use of canopies, recessed entries, decorative plantings or seating areas, lighting, or other architectural or sculptural features. 
9)  Franchise styles. Architectural forms primarily derived from building styles from other regions of the country are prohibited. New England regional prototypes from national franchises are permitted, provided that they meet the design standards. Buildings that are stylized to the point where the structure is a form of advertising are not acceptable. 
(c)  Building materials and fixtures. 
1)  Exterior building materials shall be of comparable aesthetic quality on all sides. Building siding materials shall include clapboard, brick, and other traditional local/regional building materials. Other building architectural components such as doors, windows, and details/fenestration should be aesthetically compatible with local/regional buildings, particularly neighboring development. 
a.  Highly reflective or processed materials (e.g., sheet metal or plastic panels, brushed aluminum, bronzed glass), stucco or synthetic stucco (exterior insulation and finish systems/EIFS), adobe, concrete block, T-111, untreated plywood, particle board, tilt-up concrete panels, and multicolored brick (incorporating occasional white bricks in a random pattern) may not be used as the primary facade material. 
2)  Building facade colors shall be non-reflective, subtle, neutral, or earth tone. The use of high intensity colors, metallic colors, fluorescent colors or black on facades is prohibited. Building trim and architectural accent elements may feature colors or black, but shall be muted, not metallic, not fluorescent, and not specific to particular uses or tenants. Standard corporate and trademark colors shall be permitted only on signage unless they comply with the criteria. Neon lighting or fixtures shall be limited to interior signage. 
3)  Exterior lighting on the building shall be part of the architectural concept. Fixtures, standards, and all exposed accessories shall be harmonious with building design. 
4)  Mechanical equipment, antennas, satellite dishes, air handling units, vents, downspouts, meters, or other utility hardware on roof or buildings shall be screened from public view with materials harmonious with the building, or they shall be located so visibility from any public way is minimized. When these elements need to be part of the facade, they should be incorporated into the architecture through detailing or matching colors. 
(d)  Signage and graphics on buildings. 
1)  Architecture as advertising. Proposed buildings, improvements and additions shall not be stylized to the point that the building or improvements are more an advertisement than an architectural form. 
2)  Exterior signage. Signage attached to the building shall be part of the architectural concept, and shall be harmonious with building design. Additional standards for signage apply under the design guidelines and in the Town of Lisbon sign ordinance. 
(e)  Architectural standards by district . In addition to the general standards, (a) through (d) above, these Character district standards shall apply. 
1)  Village/Main Street . 
a.  Historic character and architectural context will be considered of utmost importance in the Village/Main Street character districts, due to the significance of architecture, form, and building location on the character of the villages/downtown. 
b.  In the Village/Main Street character districts, existing, historic buildings and structures that are attached (zero lot line development) may be subject to "creative" adaptations of these design standards, in order to preserve the original architecture, form and relationship to other buildings. 
c.  Buildings in the Village/Main Street character districts must have a street-level facade that is pedestrian-oriented such as traditional New England storefronts. 
2)  Highway commercial. 
a.  Historic character and architectural context will typically not be significant factors in the highway commercial districts, however, buildings are expected to be compliant with the vision and character expressed in the Route 196 Corridor Master Plan. 
3)  Rural transition. 
a.  Architectural design standards shall not apply to buildings screened from the road and adequately set back in this character district. For existing buildings that are developed along the roadway and not screened, general and highway commercial architectural standards shall apply. 
(3)  Landscaping and screening . 
(a)  All landscaping and vegetation shall be planted and maintained so as not to create unsafe conditions for vehicles or pedestrians. 
(b)  Whenever possible, existing trees and vegetation shall be preserved on the property, except where removal is needed for safety reasons, including vehicle site distances. 
(c)  All buildings or paved/hardscape areas shall have proportionally appropriate landscaping and green buffers to soften built elements and visually enhance the property. For example, large buildings shall have large-scale plantings, large expanses of paving and impervious surface shall have larger areas of plantings within and surrounding the paved areas. 
(d)  Buffers and screening. 
1)  Vegetated or landscape buffers shall be used to create a pleasant transition between site elements or between the site use and adjacent uses. Buffers are not intended to visually block or hide features. 
2)  Screening shall be used when a site use, such as parking, loading areas or utility structures, is to be visually blocked and hidden from view, either from the public right-of-way, adjacent properties, or from anywhere within the site. Screening shall consist of solid wood or vinyl fencing (minimum 6' height) and/or evergreen plantings (for year-round screening) of more than a single row of plants and spacing that adequately blocks view. Landscape plantings that prove ineffective as a screen must be supplemented with fencing. 
(e)  Landscaping for parking and paved areas . 
1)  There shall be an appropriately sized grass or landscaped buffer between any paved areas and buildings or adjacent roads and sidewalks, except where not applicable in the Village or Main Street character areas. These green buffers shall serve to visually soften built areas. 
2)  Parking areas with more than 15 spaces shall be broken up with trees, landscaped islands, low decorative walls, or other appropriate features. 
3)  When parking is in front of buildings and/or along the road, there shall be adequate landscaping or grass buffers between the parking area and buildings or roadways. 
4)  Parking to the sides of buildings shall have adequate landscaping or grass buffers along the roadway frontage. 
(f)  Landscaping for auto sales and service uses . Auto sales businesses and other uses where cars are displayed in the frontage and/or where there is extensive parking area along the roadway, are expected to have adequate landscape plantings and buffering along the road. Such landscaping shall include street tree plantings (abutting the road right-of-way) at least every 40 feet. 
(g)  Landscaping and screening standards by district. In addition to the general standards, (a) through (g) above, these character district standards shall apply. 
1)  Village/Main Street. In the Village/Main Street character districts, landscaping in the front of the building is not required where there is a zero front setback and the building fronts directly onto the sidewalk or a pedestrian plaza. 
2)  Highway commercial . In the highway commercial character district, for street frontage areas of more than 100 feet where there are not existing street trees and vegetation, street tree plantings are required at least every 40 feet (abutting the road right-of-way). 
3)  Rural transition. Landscaping Standards for parking and paved areas, and associated with buffering or screening buildings or site features, are not applicable in the rural transition character district except when the paved areas, buildings, or structures are in close visual proximity to the roadway and screening is needed. If applicable, the development will be subject to the general and highway commercial landscaping standards shall apply. 
(h)  Maintenance . 
1)  Dead trees and vegetation shall be removed and/or replaced in a timely manner, with the same or equivalent species or form. 
2)  All landscaping and screening approved and permitted in accordance with these design standards shall be maintained as designed and specified in the decision and findings of the code enforcement officer or planning board.

Secs. 74-142-74-150. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 5. - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT 

Sec. 74-151. - Revolving loan fund (RLF). 
(a)  Statement of purpose. The Town of Lisbon Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) is established to provide a source of financing, which may not otherwise be available, for expanding or start-up businesses. Used to fill a "financing gap" in a business development project, the RLF offers an option to complete a financing package. A "gap" occurs when the business is unable to fully finance their projects with equity, conventional financing or other private and public sources. While the RLF is not a substitute for conventional financing, it can fill the gaps in existing local financial markets and attract additional capital, which would otherwise not be available for economic development. 
    The RLF adds another tool to the "tool box" of the town's economic development efforts. The RLF is not the primary source of financing for a project, however, the combination of public and private financing lessens the risk for the primary lender. 
(b)  Goals and objectives. It is the intent of the RLF to consider both existing and start-up businesses as equal under the criteria, with preference given to those expansions and start-ups that result in retained and new jobs and/or new sources of economic activity within the town. Lisbon seeks to work with healthy companies that have excellent potential for growth, will provide increased employment in the town and will help diversify the economic base. 
    Further the RLF seeks to: 
(1)  Retain and attract businesses that provide permanent jobs. 
(2)  Maximize investment within the town. 
(3)  Redevelop/utilize vacant and/or blighted property (land and/or buildings). 
(4)  Provide financial assistance to eligible businesses. 
(5)  Rehabilitation and/or creation of Lisbon housing stock. 
(6)  Further the comprehensive plan and economic development strategy. 
(c)  Program description. The RLF program is designed to offer financial support for the purchase of fixed capital assets or working capital. Depending on the loan program, eligible businesses may finance up to 30 percent of a project's cost up to a $100,000.00 (amount of available funding is determined by account balance). Special consideration for greater participation up to 50 percent will be given to projects that create high end, high wage positions and/or a substantial number of new job opportunities. Under certain circumstances and depending on the loan program, the maximum amount that could be available is 75 percent or $250,000.00 whichever is less. 
    Initial participation by conventional lending institutions is preferred, and Lisbon will take a subordinated security position to the bank, thus assisting less established firms in forming a banking relationship. Since Lisbon participation in a project must not displace local commercial lenders, a commercial lender letter declining participation must accompany any request for direct Lisbon financing unless both entities are participating in the project. 
(d)  Eligibility and criteria. Applicants must be a for-profit entity. Loans shall not be made to public, quasi-public or non-profit entities (with the exception of nonprofit housing organizations). The applicant must be the owner or have vested authority to apply for funding. 
    Eligible industries include*:

(6)  Tourism.

    Existing businesses within Lisbon or individuals looking to start a new business in Lisbon are eligible to apply for financing. The applicant must demonstrate a need for funds. All loan proceeds must be used in operations located within Lisbon. 
    Expansions and new businesses must be able to document that the planned project will result in job creation and/or retention or new sources of economic activity within Lisbon.

In the process of gathering information about a qualifying business, the town may receive information about the business which is confidential and, if released, could cause harm to the business or give unfair advantage to its competitors. State law authorizes towns and other public entities to maintain the confidentiality of business records which come into their possession. 
    To protect the businesses applying for funds and to encourage them to make full and frank disclosures of business information relevant to their application, the town may take the following steps to ensure the confidentiality of the information it receives: 
(1)  The adoption of an ordinance which makes such information confidential and punishes disclosure; 
(2)  A restriction on the number of people with access to the files with the program administrator primarily responsible for their safe-keeping, and 
(3)  A requirement that personnel involved in the program sign statements of confidentiality regarding all personal and private submittals by qualified businesses. 
    All applicants must comply with all federal, state and local laws, codes and ordinances including but not limited to: civil rights, environment, flood protection insurance, ADA, etc. 
(f)  Loan parameters. 
(1)  Loan size. The maximum loan for land, building, machinery and equipment (fixed assets) or working capital that one applicant may borrow is $100,000.00 or 30 percent of the total project cost whichever is less. Special consideration for greater participation up to 50 percent will be given to projects that create high end, high wage positions and/or a substantial number of new job opportunities. Under certain circumstances and depending on the loan program, the maximum amount that could be available is 75 percent or $250,000.00 whichever is less. 
(2)  Private sector investment. Loans will preferably be made in conjunction with private sector lending sources, owner equity, private equity or other private sources.

Machinery and equipment loans will have a maximum term of eight years or no longer than the useful life of the assets being financed.

(10)  Unsuccessful applicants may request a review of the decision to deny the loan based on errors of fact or procedure. Such a review may not be based on judgments concerning the feasibility of a proposed project or the credit-worthiness of a particular applicant. An applicant may submit a new loan application at any time.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 74-200. - Attendance policy for boards and committees of the town. 
    There is hereby adopted by the town council, a standardized attendance policy for members of the boards and committees of the town. Regular attendance at meetings is required. Two unexcused absences in a row or three or more in a year shall be considered cause for the board/committee to report the absences to the town council who shall notify the member to attend a town council meeting to show cause why the member should not be removed by the board. 
(Sel. Ord. of 10-2-01, § 5.065) 
Sec. 74-201. - Working rules for town council. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of these rules is to establish procedures for the conduct of town business before the council, pursuant to the authority of council under Section 2.06(b) of the Charter. 
(b)  Effective date/adoption/amendment. 
(1)  Effective date. These rules shall be effective for the council year that runs from the organizational meeting on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in December to the next organizational meeting in the ensuing year. Should the council fail to adopt working rules at its organizational meeting, then the rules for the previous year shall remain in full force and effect. 
(2)  Adoption. The adoption of these working rules, or any amendment thereof, shall require four affirmative votes. 
(3)  Amendment. These working rules may be amended at any regular or special meeting of the town council. Any amendment proposed for these working rules shall be submitted in writing and shall be included in the agenda package for the meeting at which the amendment is to be considered. 
(c)  Agenda. 
(1)  Development. The development of agendas for meetings of the Lisbon Town Council shall be in accordance with Section 2.04(a)(2) of the Charter. 
(2)  Deadline. For regular and special meetings of the council held at the designated time and place, all agenda items shall be provided to the manager's office by close of business on the Wednesday prior to the regular Tuesday meeting. 
The agenda shall be provided online by the close of business on the Friday prior to the regular Tuesday meeting. Changes to the agenda will not normally be made after this time and documentation for all agenda items will be included with the agenda. Any missing documents will be addressed via memorandum from the Town Manager (i.e., fuel bids). 
For special meetings not scheduled at the regular Tuesday meeting time, agenda items shall be provided by the town manager's office at least 48 hours before the scheduled time and date of the meeting. 
When an emergency meeting is called, or changes to the regular meeting agenda are needed, agenda items shall be provided as much in advance as possible prior to the meeting, but may be presented at the meeting itself if circumstances so require. 
In the event a councilor, resident and/or taxpayer of the Town of Lisbon, authorized representatives of such resident or taxpayer, or in the case of an organization, the authorized representative of that organization, wishes a matter to be considered at a council meeting, it shall be submitted to the town manager as far in advance of the meeting as possible, and prior to the Thursday deadline. The individual requesting the matter be considered shall explain the reason or necessity for consideration in order for the request to be considered by the council for inclusion on the agenda. 
(3)  Consent agenda. Those items which in the opinion of the chair are considered routine matters not requiring debate, may be included on the agenda as a consent item. If so designated, it shall be listed on the agenda under "consent agent." Any councilor wishing to have any item so listed, removed from the consent agenda, shall have the unlimited right to do so at any time prior to the vote by council on the consent agenda. If such an item is removed from the consent agenda, it shall be considered as the next item of business after the consent agenda. In the case of items included as consent items, the motion to approve the item shall be considered to have been adopted by the town council as part of its vote to approve the consent agenda. 
(4)  Fiscal items. If a proposal has a direct fiscal impact of $10,000.00 or more and requires a council vote outside the annual budget process, the council may consider that proposal only after the finance department has provided the council with a written evaluation of the direct impact of the proposal on town revenues and expenditures during the current and following fiscal year. As used in this rule, "proposal" means a supplemental appropriation, a proposed contract, or a proposed grant. This rule does not preclude the council from considering a proposal's longer term impact on town revenues and expenditures. 
(5)  Order of business. All regular meetings of the town council shall transact their business in the following order: 
a.  Call to order and pledge to flag; 
b.  Roll call; 
c.  Reading of meeting rules; 
d.  Good news, recognition; 
e.  Public hearings; 
f.  Audience participation and response; 
g.  Consent agenda; 
h.  Council orders, resolutions, and ordinances; 
i.  Other business; 
j.  Appointments; 
k.  Councilor communication; 
l.  Any business and council response; 
m.  Executive session; 
n.  Adjournment. 
The town council shall have the right to change the agenda order and to take up any agenda item out of order. 
(6)  Non-agenda items. In the event the town manager, town staff, or a councilor, wishes a matter to be considered at the current council meeting, that was not able to be submitted prior to the deadline and has not been included on the agenda, then that matter in proper form shall be submitted to the town council as far in advance of the meeting as possible, but it may be presented at the meeting. The councilman, the manager or staff requesting that the matter be considered, shall explain the reason for the necessity of immediate consideration at the current meeting. The council may vote to waive the rules to consider that item, and upon a majority vote of those councilors present, the item(s) shall be considered for action by council. 
(d)  Meetings. 
(1)  Generally. Unless otherwise designated by the chair or by four members of council, and for good cause shown, meeting of the town council shall occur at the central meeting room in the town office building. 
(2)  Attendance . Failure to attend 3 consecutive meetings of the Council without being excused by a vote of the Council will result in forfeiture of office. Acceptable excuses include, without limitation, illness, vacation, and family emergencies. A limit of seven (7) excused absences over a one year session shall trigger Council review. 
(3)  Meeting length. All council meetings, workshops, or executive sessions shall be conducted, except in extraordinary circumstances, within 21/2 hours of the time the meeting is called to order. At regularly scheduled meetings, this will call for adjournment on or before 9:30 p.m. The council may, by waiving these rules, agree to extend the time for meetings if it is deemed appropriate. 
(4)  Adjourned sessions. Any session of the town council may be continued or adjourned from day to day, or for more than one day, but no adjournment shall be for a longer period than until the next regular meeting. 
(5)  Organizational meeting. The council shall conduct an organizational meeting at 7:00 p.m. at its regular place of meeting, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of December of each year. The meeting shall address the installation and oath of office of newly elected councilors, the election of a chair and vice chair, appropriate annual appointments as may be necessary, consideration and adoption of council working rules for the ensuing year, and such other organizational matters as may be deemed necessary and appropriate. 
(6)  Regular meetings. The town council shall hold its regular meetings at 7:00 p.m. on the first and third Tuesdays of each month. If that Tuesday falls on a holiday, then the meeting shall be held on the next day. For good cause, the meeting date may be changed by the chair or by the vote of four councilors to another date and or time. If it is determined by the chair that there is no business to come before the town council, then he/she shall advise the town council accordingly and no meeting need be held. 
(7)  Special meetings. Special meetings shall be held upon the call of the chair or four or more members of the council in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.06 of the Charter. The same notice requirements for a regular meeting shall pertain to the calling of a special meeting. 
(8)  Emergency meetings. Where circumstances justify and constitute a hazard to the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants, that requires action by the town council, then an emergency meeting may be held. Notice shall be given in the best practical manner including telephonically. The press shall be given the same notice within the same time frame as the town councilors. 
(e)  Conduct of meetings. 
(1)  Rules of procedure. Meetings shall be conducted in accordance with Robert's Rules of Order except as otherwise provided herein or required by the Charter. 
(2)  Decorum. The chair shall preserve decorum and decide all questions of order and procedure subject to appeal to the town council. Anyone desiring to speak shall address the chair, and upon recognition by the chair, shall confine themselves to the question under debate and shall avoid all personal attacks and indecorous language. No person shall enter into any discussion either directly or indirectly or through a member of the town council without the permission of the chair. Any person making personal, impertinent, and slanderous remarks or who becomes boisterous while addressing the town council or while attending the town council meeting may be removed from the premises and such person shall be barred from further audience before the town council for the duration of the meeting. The chair may direct a police officer to remove such offenders from the premises and aggravated cases shall be prosecuted on appropriate complaint signed by the chair. 
Once recognized by the chair, persons desiring to address the town council shall state their name for the record, and shall limit their remarks to the matter under discussion. All remarks and questions addressed to the town council shall be addressed to the town council as a whole and not to any individual member thereof. All remarks and questions addressed to the administration of the town shall be addressed to the town manager and not to any individual town employee. No comment shall be allowed which has the effect of embarrassing or attacking the character of any individual, staff member, or councilor, and this rule shall be liberally construed and strictly enforced. No one, other than the individual having the floor, shall enter into any discussion either directly or indirectly without permission of the chair. 
Councilors, staff, and the public shall preserve order and decorum and shall neither by conversation or otherwise delay or interrupt the proceedings nor refuse to obey the order of the chair or the rules of the town council.

Individuals shall be removed from the meeting for failure to comply with decisions of the chair or for continued violations of the rules of the town council. If the chair fails to act, any member may move to require the chair to enforce the rules and the affirmative vote of the majority of the town council shall require the chair to act. 
a.  Council. During the town council meetings, a councilor, once recognized, shall not be interrupted while speaking unless called to order by the chair, unless a point of order is raised by another member or unless the speaker chooses to yield to questions from another member. If a councilor is called to order while speaking, the councilor shall cease speaking immediately until the question of order is determined. If ruled to be in order, the town councilor shall be permitted to proceed. If ruled to be not in order, the town councilor shall remain silent or shall alter the remarks so as to comply with rules of the town council. 
b.  Staff. While the chair shall have the authority to preserve decorum in meetings as far as staff members and town employees are concerned, the town manager shall also be responsible for the orderly conduct and decorum of all town employees under the town manager's direction and control. The town manager shall take such disciplinary action as may be necessary to insure that such decorum is preserved at all times by town employees in town council meetings. 
c.  Public. Unauthorized remarks from the audience, stamping of feet, whistles, yells, and similar demonstrations shall not be permitted and may result in removal of the offenders from the premises. 
(3)  Tabling motions. Although tabling motions under Robert's Rules of Order are not designated as motions which are debatable, this council shall allow debate on a tabling motion.

c.  Following this introduction of the issue, there will be time devoted to any questions of the sponsor or the town manager or staff regarding the agenda item which any councilor may have which would help to clarify the question presented by the agenda item. The chair may allow questions from the public during this time, however, no debate or discussion of collateral issues shall be permitted. 
d.  When authorized by the chair, any additional public comment shall be no longer than two minutes per person and must be to request or furnish new or undisclosed information or viewpoints only.

a.  Anyone wishing to address council will wait to be recognized by the chair before beginning any remarks. Audience members will move to the lectern to address council, and shall provide name and address prior to addressing the council. 
b.  The purpose of new business is for the council to receive input on town matters not on the agenda for that meeting.

Comments shall be to furnish new or undisclosed information or viewpoints and limited to a time period of two minutes or less and shall be directed through the chair.

Similarly, a councilor who has a financial interest in any matter for the town council shall disclose the interest and abstain from voting on any matter involving the interest. A copy of the disclosure and the abstention shall be recorded with the town clerk. A councilor has "financial interests" within the meaning of this section if the councilor owns at least a ten percent interest in the business or economic entity or ten percent or more of the stock of the corporation involved in the pending transaction or matter. 
(2)  Relationship. A town councilor is disqualified in any quasi-judicial matter before the town council, if the councilor is related to any of the parties within the sixth degree (second cousin).

(3)  Appearance of conflict. A town councilor shall avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, whether there is a technical conflict or not, by disclosure of the facts underlying the potential conflict, and where appropriate, be abstaining from voting on the matter. If, after disclosure, the councilor believes the interest will affect the councilor's ability to make a fair and impartial decision faithful to the public interest, the councilor shall abstain from voting. 
(4)  Participation. An abstaining councilor may but need not remain in the town council chamber during debate or votes on that issue. 
(5)  Judgment of qualifications. If there is any doubt as to whether a councilor has a conflict of interest in any matter, the chair shall determine the qualification of the challenged member by the vote of council. The decision of the town council shall be final.

ARTICLE V. - COMPUTER SYSTEM AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS POLICY 

Sec. 74-281. - General. 
    The Town of Lisbon (hereinafter the "town") is committed to providing an environment that encourages the use of computer systems and electronic communications as essential tools to support and enhance the municipal mission. As the town provides a computer system to its employees for this purpose, it is the responsibility of each employee to ensure that this technology is used for business purposes and not to the detriment of town business. Therefore, the town expects all employees to conduct their use of the computer system in a professional, responsible, respectful and courteous manner and as provided in this policy.

(Sel. Ord. of 3-21-2006, § 5.186) 
Sec. 74-284. - Use. 
    All parts of the system are town property and/or are provided for business use and for town communications. All communications are town property. 
(Sel. Ord. of 3-21-2006, § 5.186) 
Sec. 74-285. - Disclaimer. 
    Much of the information available from the town system is available from sources outside the Town of Lisbon and refers to information generated outside the Town of Lisbon. The town makes no assurances of any kind, whether expressed or implied, with regard to any of this external material. The town will not be responsible for any damages suffered by an employee caused by the use of the information obtained from sources outside the Town of Lisbon, and the use of any such information is at the employee's own risk. The town further accepts no responsibility for the quality of information obtained from extra-town sources. 
    The town assumes no responsibility for any unauthorized charges or fees, including, but not limited to, long distance charges, per minute surcharges, and/or equipment or line charges. 
(Sel. Ord. of 3-21-2006, § 5.186) 
Sec. 74-286. - Privacy. 
    Because all systems and communications are the property of the town, employees should not expect that communications are private. Specifically, employee communications are not considered private despite any such designation by the sender or the recipient. Some communications on the system may be classified as public record and may be subject to disclosure under applicable state laws. 
(Sel. Ord. of 3-21-2006, § 5.186) 
Sec. 74-287. - Monitoring. 
    The town, because all systems and communications are the property of the town, by and through the town manager and his/her designee, has the specific right to monitor all communications of employees, including, but not limited to, Internet usage, all voicemail messages, all e-mail messages, all electronic files, all software, all data, and all other relevant information. The town may monitor and review the content of any of the above at any time and for any purpose whatsoever and may disseminate such communications for any purpose without the permission of the employee. 
(Sel. Ord. of 3-21-2006, § 5.186) 
Sec. 74-288. - Internet. 
(a)  The town system, including its connections to the Internet and communications relating thereto, is to be used primarily for town business purposes and any personal use shall be restricted to occasional use that will not in any manner interfere with the town's business purposes. Any unauthorized use of the Internet is strictly prohibited. Use of the Internet shall be regarded as a communication. 
(b)  Any downloading or installation of unauthorized material is prohibited. 
(c)  Unauthorized use includes, but is not limited to: connecting, posting, or downloading pornographic material; engaging in computer "hacking" and other related activities; attempting to disable or compromise the security information contained on the town system. 
(d)  Internet messages should be treated as non-confidential. Anything sent through the Internet passes through a number of different computers systems, all with the differing levels of security. The confidentiality of messages may be compromised at any point along the way, unless the messages are encrypted. 
(e)  Internet access provides the town with significant access and the opportunity to disseminate information to individuals outside the town. Since access to Internet messages are capable of being forwarded without the express permission of the original author, users must exercise caution in the transmission and dissemination of messages outside of the town and all such messages must comply with this policy, other applicable town policies and ordinances, and all state and federal laws. 
(f)  Because postings placed on the Internet may display the town address, make certain before posting information on the Internet that the information reflects the standards and policies of the town. Under no circumstances shall information of a confidential, sensitive or otherwise proprietary nature be placed on the Internet. 
(g)  Subscriptions to news groups and mailing lists are permitted when the subscription is for a business related purpose. All other subscriptions are prohibited. 
(h)  Information posted or viewed on the Internet may constitute published material. Therefore, reproduction of information posted or otherwise available over the Internet may be done only by express permission from the author or copyright holder and according to all applicable copyright laws. 
(i)  Unless the prior approval of the town manager and/or his designee has been obtained, employees may not establish Internet or other external network connections that could allow unauthorized persons to gain access to the town's systems and information. These connections include, but are not limited to, the establishment of hosts with public mode dial-ins, World Wide Web home pages and File Transfer Protocol ("FTP"). 
(j)  Use of a modem is permitted only to provide certain hardware or software vendors access to specific servers or personal computers on the town network to provide technical support. Such modem connections must be approved by the town manager and/or his designee. All other modem connections are prohibited.

(m)  Although primarily for town business, occasional personal use of the e-mail is permitted but shall not be to an extent that will interfere with the town's business. 
(Sel. Ord. of 3-21-2006, § 5.186) 
Sec. 74-289. - Electronic mail (e-mail). 
(a)  Electronic mail, Internet mail, internal electronic mail and telecommunication access shall be regarded as communications. 
(b)  Since no computer system is completely secure, and there is no expectation or right of privacy regarding use of the system or communications, e-mail should not transmit sensitive material such as personnel decisions or any other similar information where unauthorized access may be an issue. Such information should be more appropriately communicated by written memorandum or personal contact. 
(c)  The town maintains "public" e-mail addresses that may be used by the public to transmit, request or transfer information to the town. These e-mail addresses shall be monitored. Due to the nature of e-mail, a response is not guaranteed. 
(d)  Individuals may be assigned confidential passwords. Users should be aware that such an assignment does not imply that the system is for personal confidential communication. The use of the e-mail system remains for the conduct of town business. Passwords should be periodically changed to ensure the security of the e-mail system. Users should not share their passwords with anyone else, other than his or her department head or the town manager. The town manager may allow certain individuals to have "private" e-mail accounts for the transfer of correspondence or information from outside entities directly to that person. These accounts also are not to be considered a system for personal confidential communication and shall be governed by this policy. 
(e)  Generally, e-mail messages are intended to be temporary communications that are non-vital and may be discarded routinely. However, depending on the content of the e-mail message, it may be considered a more formal record and should be retained pursuant to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. 
(f)  Employees should be aware that when they have deleted messages from their workstation mailbox, it might not have been deleted from the central e-mail system. The message may be residing in the recipient's mailbox or forwarded to other recipients. Furthermore, the message may be stored on the computer's back-up system for an indefinite period of time.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 86-1. - Fund balance policy. 
(a)  The Town of Lisbon recognizes the importance of maintaining an appropriate level of undesignated fund balance. The town's unassigned GF fund balance serves a number of stabilizing purposes. It is a surplus of amounts which have accrued from unexpected operating budget surplus and unanticipated excess revenues. The surplus also provides the town with an amount for use in unforeseen, unbudgeted emergency situations, and provides a cash flow cushion to offset the need for borrowing in anticipation of tax receipts. 
(b)  In order to maintain financial stability, the town has established this policy to maintain an unassigned GF fund balance no less than 12% and no more than 16% of the current fiscal year's budget as defined below: 
Gross town operating budget, including town's share of school budget, town's portion of the county's operating budget, and debt service. 
(c)  Once the town achieves its goal of an appropriate level of undesignated fund balance, any excess funds may be utilized for other municipal purposes, including, without limitation, additional capital improvement needs, tax rate stabilization, or reduction purposes. For example, by utilizing excess fund balances for capital improvements, the town will reduce the need to incur long-term debt and will avoid creating an operating funding gap for subsequent fiscal years. 
(d)  This policy has been adopted by the town to recognize the financial importance of a stable and sufficient level of undesignated fund balance. However, the town, reserves the right to appropriate funds from the undesignated fund balance for emergencies and other requirements the town believes to be in the best interest of the town. 
(e)  In the event the town's undesignated fund balance drops below the 12% minimum, a written plan to replenish the fund within a maximum of three fiscal years must be approved by the town council at the time of the emergency GF fund balance appropriation.

(T.M. of 12-4-2007, § 2007-218; C.M. of 11-18-2014, V. 2014-247) 
Sec. 86-42. - Distribution of purchase orders.

The amount of petty cash will not exceed $100.00 for any one department. Department heads are required to retain receipts for all purchases.

Sec. 86-44. - Grants. 
    There are two types of grants 1) grants that require a large match which is greater than what the town carries for a grant match budget. These types of grants will require council approval or possibly town approval depending on the size of the town matching funds required. These types of grants would be considered unbudgeted and would require a special appropriation within the confines of the charter; 2) grants that fall within what the town carries for grant match budget. These grants are considered budgeted as the council has budgeted funds in the current fiscal year to address grants that become available in the current fiscal year. These grants must also be approved by town council prior to submitting for the grant. This is required to make sure that when the grant money expires and there is a requirement to continue funding the activity or equipment, which will be 100 percent by the town, that this continued expenditure is a true benefit to the community and does not become a burden to the taxpayer. 
    The intent is to make sure that council is aware and approves of all grants and the expenditures for that grant so as not to create an unnecessary liability for the town. The town manager is accountable to insure that department heads seek both town manager and town council approval prior to applying for any grant either funded or unfunded. 
(T.M. of 12-4-2007, § 2007-218; C.M. of 11-18-2014, V. 2014-247) 
Sec. 86-45. - Credit card use. 
    The town shall allow departments to purchase goods and services directly from vendors with a credit card when those items are needed, but it is not expedient, practical, or desirable to have either a check or cash available when payment is demanded. Credit cards shall not be used to circumvent the general purchasing procedures required by the policies of the Town of Lisbon. 
    The finance office will select a company to use to obtain the necessary credit cards and establish a line of credit with that company. Consideration will be given to a company who can meet the general purchasing needs of the various town departments and the billing and payment requirements of the town. 
    The finance office will establish appropriate credit limits for each card, recognizing that individual cards may vary with the types of goods and services which are anticipated to be acquired. 
    The use of this card is restricted for the Town of Lisbon to acquire goods and services which are appropriate for the conduct of the town's business. 
    Each department head is responsible for the use of the cards by their department. The department head is responsible to make sure that any charges are authorized town expenditures and that adequate monies are available within the department's approved budget. 
    No personal expenditures are allowed by employees with the credit cards, even if the intent is to re-pay the town at a future point. 
    Credit card bills submitted to the finance office for payment must include supporting documentation, such as receipts and invoices, which clearly show what goods and services were purchased using the credit card. 
    The persons authorized to be issued credit cards for their respective departments shall be as listed below: 
(1)  Town manager; 
(2)  Public works director; 
a.  Public works operations manager; 
(3)  Police chief;

Sec. 86-81. - Internal control. 
    The treasurer shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be documented in writing. The internal controls shall be reviewed annually by the auditor hired by the town. The controls shall be instituted to prevent possible loss of public funds arising from fraud, employee error, misrepresentation by a third party, unanticipated changes in financial markets, or imprudent actions by town employees. 
    Internal control is a management process for keeping the town on course in achieving its organizational objectives. A management control system, including comprehensive internal controls, should provide reasonable assurance that the town's objectives are being met. 
    The town's objectives fall into the following three separate but related categories: 
 Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; 
 Reliability of financial reporting; and 
 Compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
    Control objectives focus the management control system toward those control activities designed to minimize the risks of not achieving objectives. 
    An internal control system should provide reasonable assurance that an organization will accomplish its objectives. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of an internal control activity should not exceed the benefit derived. 
    Internal controls are distinguished as accounting and administrative controls. Accounting controls are necessary to ensure that activities associated with authorizing, processing, recording, and reporting financial transactions are properly controlled and that the information resulting from these activities is reliable and useful. Administrative controls are necessary to ensure that all resources, including personnel, are properly obtained, maintained, and used; that decisions regarding the expenditure of funds are made based on reliable information; and that budgets are properly developed and monitored to ensure consistency between planned and actual expenditures. 
    Accounting and administrative controls and financial procedures are documented as follows: 
I. Classification and Coding Structure 
II. Financial Management and Control 
 Reporting 
 Reconciliations 
III. Cash Management 
 Receipts 
 Disbursements 
IV. Payroll 
V. Data Security 
VI. Procurement 
I. Classification and Coding Structure 
    The Town of Lisbon currently uses TRIO software package to record the accounting transactions of the town. This software consists of inter-dependent and stand alone modules. The modules are: real estate, personal property, tax billing, real estate collections, personal property collections, clerk, budgetary system, cash receipting, payroll, blue book, motor vehicle registration, and system maintenance. 
    The budgetary system which includes the general ledger is organized at a fund level. The town currently has nine active funds: 
 Fund 1 General Fund; 
 Fund 2 Sewer Fund; 
 Fund 4 DARE; 
 Fund 5 School Capital Projects; 
 Fund 6 Recreational Land Use; 
 Fund 7 Trust Funds; 
 Fund 8 General Long Term Debt Account Group; 
 Fund 9 General Fixed Assets Account Group; and 
 Fund 14 Loan Funds. 
    The assets, liabilities and fund balance of the town are assigned a four-digit account number. When recording entries in the general ledger accounts the entry format is GXX-YYYY-ZZ. The first two numbers represent the fund number. The next four are assigned as follows: 1000-1999 are reserved for assets, 2000-2999 is reserved for liabilities and 3000-3999 is reserved for fund balances. The final two numbers are sub-accounts that are used by the town currently only to record inter-fund activity. This numbering scheme allows account titles to be shared by more than one fund. For example, G01-3060-00 and G02-3060-00 are used for fund balance in the general fund and the sewer fund respectively. The system also will construct the entries needed when disbursements are made in the one fund on behalf of another. 
    Revenues are denoted in the format RXX-YYYY. In this case, the prefix denotes the financial statement category to which specific groups of revenues will ultimately roll up. The financial statement categories include: general government, public safety, public works, etc. The software refers to these numbers as department numbers. The next four numbers are between 4000-4999 and describe the town's various sources of revenue. 
    The expense format is EXX-YYY-ZZZZ. The first two are the same department numbers as listed above. The next three are the division number which is what the department level was formerly. The last four numbers are the expense number. These will be in the 5000-5999 range. They are uniform across all departments. (I.e., telephone expenses are 5275 across all divisions.) Additionally, in order to preserve budgetary control, account numbers 5100-5199 are used for personnel expenses. 5200-5299 are for contracted services, 5300-5399 are commodities, 5400-5499 are capital expenditures, 5500-5599 are debt service, and 5600-5699 are grant or special fund expenditures. 
    The complete Chart of Accounts, which is in four pieces: General Ledger, Department/Division, Revenue, and Expense, is appended to this document. 
II. Financial Management and Control 
    The finance office is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the town's accounting data. This is accomplished through a system of financial reporting and data reconciliation. 
 Reporting: 
Generally, the finance director reports to the town council at the second monthly meeting. Prior to the meeting, councilors receive a summary revenue and expense report. The expense report is at the department level. Once a quarter the council receives a report presented at the expense line level. Revenues are presented summarized at the budget level. Department heads receive a monthly report at the expense level and more frequently as requested. We are currently working on getting department heads read only access to the financial software so that they may view their accounts at any time. 
The finance director is responsible for preparing the financial statements for the town to be examined by an independent auditor at the close of the fiscal year. The town reports on a fiscal year of July 1 ending June 30. 
 Reconciliations: 
Cash : Each general fund cash account is reconciled to the general ledger and the bank statement monthly as soon as is practicable by the finance director. The general fund cash accounts include: The town's checking and payroll, the town's savings, CD brokerage account and CDs, the school's payroll and payables accounts. After reconciliations are completed, they are reviewed, initialed, and dated by the town manager. Signatory authority for these accounts rests with the finance director and the town manager. 
Additionally, the town's loan program has four cash accounts: IRP, FAME, Housing, and Commercial. The loan program is administered by the town's economic development director. Due to transaction number restrictions and for additional control, checks to cover the expenses for these funds are written from the general fund and thus are included in the semi-monthly warrant process. Transfers from these funds are made periodically to cover the monies expended by the general fund by the finance director. Signatory control of these accounts rests with the town manager and the finance director. Bank statements for these accounts first go to the economic development director for review, next to the finance director for reconciliation preparation. A copy of the reconciliation and the bank statements are then routed back to the economic development director where they are kept. 
Taxes : All outstanding property tax and lien accounts are reconciled by the deputy tax collector monthly. This entails verifying that all subsidiary ledgers agree in amount with the town's general ledger. Variances are investigated by the tax collector with assistance from the finance director as needed. 
Other Asset and Liability Accounts : All general fund general ledger account balances are reviewed monthly by the finance director and other finance department staff and reconciled to supporting documentation on an as needed basis but no less than annually. 
III. Cash Management 
 Receipts: 
Bank Deposits : All cash and checks received by the town flow through the tax collector's office. For amounts collected by the sewer department, economic development, the school department, the town clerk's office, recreation department, transfer station, and Beaver Park: monies are placed in a plastic sealed one use deposit bag by the department that collects the cash. Computer journal entries for the economic development department's cash receipts are recorded by the finance director. These receipts are deposited directly into the loan fund program to which they relate. All other receipts are deposited in the town's general fund account. The sewer clerk and the town clerk's office use the cash receipting function of the town's software to directly record their receipts. Beaver Park, recreation department, transfer station, public works and the school receipts are recorded by a counter clerk in the tax collectors office. At the end of each day or at the beginning of the next day, the deputy tax collector prints off the daily audit report and closes additional activity to the journal. The journal entry resulting from this activity is posted to the accounting records by the finance department. 
Each clerk in the tax collector's office works out of their own drawer and cashes up their own receipts either at the end of the work day or the beginning of the next work day. Each clerk can print an audit report of their work for the day from the accounting system and are responsible for reconciling their bag and any bag they may have receipted from another department to that report. Each clerk then places their cash and checks into a plastic sealed one use deposit bag. Cash drawers when not in use are kept in the safe. Deposit bags are also kept in the safe until they are transported to the bank. The deputy tax collector then summarizes all the deposit bag activity on a worksheet and compares that to the daily cash audit journal summary. Variances are investigated at this time. Individual clerk cash up sheets are attached to this summary and they are routed to the finance department. The deposit bags are taken to the bank by either a counter clerk or the finance director. The deposit slips from the previous day are picked up from the bank at that time. Bank deposit slips are verified to the daily cash up sheets by the accounts payable clerk. 
Receipts from customers to pay their water bills that are received over the counter and by the sewer clerk are entered into cash receipting and posted into a holding account on the balance sheet. Upon closing, a report is printed by the tax collector's office showing all the receipts for the day. This report is forwarded to the water department and the finance director. The finance director then creates an ACH payment from the town's general fund to the water department's bank account. The ACH payment is then released by the payroll clerk or the town manager. A copy of the bank report showing the transfer is then forwarded to the water department. 
In addition to bank deposits, money is received by the town through electronic funds transfers by some state and federal agencies into the general fund checking account. Maturing CDs may also be wired into the account. These transactions are recorded by journal entry by the finance director. 
Occasionally, a taxpayer may request to pay outstanding real estate taxes through a wire transfer. Wire instructions are faxed to the sending institution and the finance director follows up with a phone call to the taxpayer to confirm that the funds were received. 
Transfers between town bank accounts located in the town's primary bank are made on line or in the event of internet problems in person at the local branch. These transfers require no corresponding release. 
The town's primary bank collateralizes deposits that are in excess of FDIC insurance up to $8,000,000. This is in accordance with town ordinance § 86-71. Excess funds are invested typically in certificates of deposit. Certificates are purchased through a broker. Certificates are placed with various banks around the country based on recommendations of the broker and within FDIC insurance coverage. Whether excess cash stays with the town's primary bank or is invested in certificates offered by other banks is based on the time available to invest and the interest rates offered by the various financial institutions and the interest rate offered by the town's primary bank. 
 Disbursements: 
The bills of the town are paid by paper check and are authorized by town council through the warrant process. Warrant preparation coincides with the town council meetings held on the first and third Tuesday of each month. The town uses a modified purchase order system. Department heads use purchase orders to encumber budget allocations when an order for goods or services is placed. Purchase orders are approved by department heads for amounts up to $500.00. Purchase orders above $500.00 require the additional approval of the town manager. Purchase orders are submitted to the computer clerk who books the purchase order as an encumbrance in the accounting system. When goods and services are received, the invoice is approved by the department head and forwarded to the accounts payable clerk. The invoice is reviewed by the clerk and matched up with its PO and submitted to the computer clerk for the entry in to the computer system. The system prepares the warrant and produces the checks with the signature of the town manager attached. The warrant and the POs and invoices are submitted to the town manager's office for his review on the morning of the town council meeting. Checks are locked in a fireproof cabinet in the payroll clerk's office. The key to this cabinet are controlled by the finance director and the payroll clerk. The warrant is reviewed and approved the evening of, before the meeting, by two designated members of the council and then locked in the manager's office overnight. The next day the signed warrant and the POs and invoices are routed back to the finance department. Friday is the normal day for checks to be released. Prior to that, the finance director counter initials all checks over $1,000.00. This includes reviewing the underlying documentation for proper authorization. The checks along with the remittances are mailed by the payroll clerk. The POs are filed alpha by vendor by the accounts payable clerk. Monthly statements from vendors are reconciled to payments and invoices by the accounts payable clerk. 
Between warrants, checks may be issued on a limited basis. Bills routinely paid this way include: remittances to the State of Maine for state fees collected by the tax collector's office. This is because the due dates for these fees and the period covered by these report can be shorter than the time between warrants. Other expenses paid this way include referee fees for the recreation department. This procedure replaces the previous method of the recreation director maintaining a separate checking account in order to pay these officials in a timely manner. Payment is expected at game time. This type of between warrant expenditure is referred to as a hand check. These checks are prepared by staff and hand signed by the finance director or the town manager. They are included on the next warrant or maybe on a separate warrant that is presented for signature at the next council meeting. Again, the criteria for this method include approval by the town manager and/or the finance director. 
The water department presents checks for signature once per week to the finance director. The town manager also has signatory authority on this account. The checks are accompanied by a copy of the water department's warrant signed by a majority of the water commissioners. Only checks appearing on the warrant that agree in both payee and amount are signed. Two of the checks per week are to reimburse the town for payroll expenditures made by the town. 
One member of the town council is required to approve expenditures for the school. Their warrants, signed by the superintendent and a majority of the school board, are submitted to the payroll clerk along with supporting documentation. Two sets of signed warrants are submitted. These are forwarded together with the town warrant and invoices to the town manager the day of the meeting. The checks for the payable warrants are run using the school's financial software which affixes the town manager's signature directly to the check. The checks are produced at the town office by the payroll clerk who has limited access to the school's financial software, they remain locked in the clerks cabinet until after the meeting. The finance director receives the total amount of the warrant and transfers this amount into the school payables bank account. One set of the signed warrants are kept here at the town and another is returned to the school along with the signed checks, and invoices. Generally, this is done on the Friday after the meeting. 
A limited number of transactions of the town are settled by a wire transfer instead of a check. These include: Bond payments, postage purchase, and the transfer of excess cash to the town's brokerage account. Wire transfers are executed on line by the finance director and subsequently released by the payroll clerk or the town manager. Wire transfers may also be settled at the branch in which case there is no subsequent release. 
IV. Payroll 
    The town's work week is Sunday through Saturday with payday being the following Thursday. The weekly payroll is prepared by the payroll clerk with the alternate preparer being the finance director. Generally speaking, employee's time cards/sheets are submitted to and approved by the department director. Director time sheets are approved by the town manager. Public works, sewer, solid waste, police and fire payrolls are summarized by the respective department heads and the sheet is approved(signed by) the appropriate director. The recreation department, the finance department, the tax collector's office, the library, and the remaining single employee departments submit time sheets for each employee which is summarized as one department by the payroll clerk. Department heads are responsible for submitting the appropriate paperwork for new and temporary hires or the employee may be sent directly to the payroll clerk. This includes Form I-9, W-4s and other voluntary participation benefit plans. These enrollment forms and required proofs and directives are retained in the payroll clerk's office. 
    After any employee file maintenance, the weekly payroll is prepared each Tuesday. After processing, the payroll checks are printed. The town manager's signature is affixed to the checks electronically. This signature is password protected and the password is entered by the payroll clerk. ACH files for direct deposits and a funds transfer to the town's payroll account is completed by the payroll clerk electronically. These transfers are released by the finance director or the town manager. The checks are stored in a locked fireproof cabinet until they are distributed by the clerk on Thursday morning. Reports for the week's payroll are run by the clerk. 
    After the town's payroll has been processed, the water department's payroll is run using the same steps as above with the addition of the payroll reports for the water department which are duplicated and forwarded to the water department that day. This is so the reimbursement to the town can be included on the weekly water department warrant. The payroll checks for the water department are retained in the payroll clerk's office and distributed to the water department on Thursday. 
    After the payroll has been completed, the payroll clerk summarizes the payroll; the sheet is then forwarded to the finance director. The finance director then pays the federal and state payroll taxes electronically. The advices of those transactions are attached to a purchase order, which is reviewed and approved by the town manager. 
    Quarterly payroll reports are prepared and filed by the finance director. 
V. Data Security 
    The computerized financial records of the town are kept protected by the following: 
 Restricting physical access to workstations and servers to only authorized personnel; 
 Securing workstations (screen lock or logout) prior to leaving area to prevent unauthorized access; 
 Keeping various computer passwords confidential and protected; 
 Never installing unauthorized software on workstations; 
 Ensuring that monitors are positioned away from public view; and 
 Ensuring that all workstations use a surge protector or a battery backup. 
    Additionally, the town funds an information technology support specialist. The specialist's job duties include the following which contribute to the security of the financial records: 
 System administration functions to control systems; 
 Provides full user support to the town's software applications; 
 Conducts training in the operation and capabilities of applications and systems; 
 Implements system security measures such as backups, access control, system accounting, anti-virus functions and disaster recovery; 
 Researches, recommends, installs, and tests hardware, software and network configurations; 
 Performs troubleshooting and fault isolation on PCs, servers, and laptops; and 
 Tests and evaluates software and hardware for the town. 
VI. Procurement 
    Purchasing procedures and policy can be found in §§ 86-31 through 86-44 of this Code. The items covered in these sections include procedures and policy for: 
 Purchases under $500.00; 
 Purchases over $500.00 but under $5,000.00; 
 Purchases and contracts in excess of $5,000.00; 
 The department head's role in procurement; and

Sec. 86-91. - Residential tax club policy. 
TOWN OF LISBON 
RESIDENTIAL 
TAX CLUB POLICY 
The Tax Club will be from April 1st to March 31st, with the taxpayer enrolled in the club and the first payment due and payable in April, and a payment due each and every month thereafter. Taxes must be paid in full by March 31st. 
Tax Club status is only for the current year's taxes. If any taxes other than the current year are owed, the taxpayer is not eligible for Tax Club status. 
The Tax Club member will be responsible to let the Tax Collector know which tax accounts will be enrolled in the Tax Club. Tax Club books will be issued for each and every tax account separately that the taxpayer wishes to pay through the club and the stubs from each book must be submitted with the payment to ensure proper allocation of the payment. 
The club payments will be calculated into 12 equal monthly payments based on the previous year's tax, and will be recalculated by the Tax Collector after the new tax bills are sent in August. The Tax Collector will notify the taxpayers of the new tax club payment to ensure that the taxes will be paid in full by March 31st. 
Failure to pay a club payment in any month will constitute a late payment and interest will be charged on the outstanding balance beginning on the date that Town Council sets for interest each year until that tax bill is paid in full. The taxpayer will no longer be eligible for the tax club status of not having to pay interest for the remainder of that tax year. They may still make monthly payments, but interest will be receipted first. 
The Tax Collector will maintain an up-to-date list of Tax Club members and the current payment amounts. 
Advance payments will be accepted at any time with no penalty to the taxpayer. 
I, the undersigned, understand that if I miss any monthly payment, interest will be charged on any outstanding amount due after the date Council sets for interest until that tax is paid in full.

Sec. 86-101. - Policy statement. 
    The members of the town council direct the finance director of the Town of Lisbon to adhere to the town ordinances adopted regarding the financial matters of the town. In order to comply with the specific ordinance related to disbursement of town funds, the following interim procedures are approved as recommended by the finance director until a comprehensive set of updated internal control policies and procedures is developed and adopted by the council along with the appropriate updates to Town of Lisbon's ordinances governing its "financial matters" policies. 
( C.M. of 8-18-2015, V. 2015-245 ) 
Sec. 86-102. - Impmentation timeline required. 
    Effective June 2, 2015, the superintendent of schools, school department business manager, and the town manager and finance director of the Town of Lisbon, have reached unanimous agreement that this policy and procedure shall be implemented on July 1, 2015. The timeline provides the time necessary to put technology and human resources in-place to ensure a successful implementation of this policy to be known as Finance Director's Bulletin 15-02. 
( C.M. of 8-18-2015, V. 2015-245 ) 
Sec. 86-103. - Procedures to be implemented. 
    Commencing July 1, 2015 all requests for cash transfers from the town's general operating account(s) to the school department to meet the cost of personal services and satisfy other obligations incurred by the department shall be accompanied by a warrant signed by the superintendent 1 , and at least one member of the school board appointed by the chair of the board, and by the town councilor designated by the chair of the council 2 . The appointed committee member shall act for the majority of the school board until the aforementioned updated internal control policies and procedures are adopted as ordinances. 
    The approved authorization for payment shall be forwarded to the finance director or town manager as soon as possible following the application of the last signature required for approval of the warrant. The invoices, statements, vouchers, and the register of the checks to be printed shall be included for final review by the finance director. A duplicate copy of the signed payment authorization and register of checks to be printed shall be included for recordkeeping purposes. 
    Upon completion of final review, the checks will be printed at the town office. An electronic signature 3 will be applied to each check during the printing process. In those instances where a supplemental payroll or accounts payable warrant is necessary, a manual signature may be applied by the appropriate signing authority. A manual signature will be applied to all checks created during the bi-weekly payroll process. After the checks have been printed and the appropriate bank transfers completed, the checks and related documentations will be released to school department personnel for further processing and mailing. 
    A 48-hour lead time is required from receipt of the approved payment request for school department accounts payable to final processing to ensure adequate time to inspect, process, and transfer cash necessary to fund the warrant 4 . 
    The superintendent and town manager agree, that with respect to payroll, they will make their best effort to meet the 48-hour lead time, with the understanding that special pays and other unforeseen circumstances may require alternate agreed upon procedures be put in place on a case-by-case basis to ensure Lisbon is in compliance with the requirements of Title 26, Chapter 7, Subchapter 2, Subsection 621-A, paragraphs 1, 2, and 4.

    The adoption of this policy returns the final review and processing of payments made from school department accounts to the town office as required by section 86-81, subsection III, Disbursements. Implementation of these procedures provide tighter control over the access to systems that apply electronic signature to checks and other documents; thereby, reducing the risk of misuse of the digitized signature. Additionally, the procedure provides a check and balance control through a final inspection process before any authorizing signature is applied electronically. 
    Changing the procedure that is currently in-place will also ensure better control over the funds transfer process as the school has overdrawn its accounts several times over the past months. 
    The finance director recommends that this policy and procedure be known as Finance Director's Bulletin 15-02. 
( C.M. of 8-18-2015, V. 2015-245 ) 
NOTES BEARING: 
1  The superintendent is responsible for assuring that budget allocations are observed and that total expenditures do not exceed the amount allocated in the budget for all items. Signature by the superintendent certifies that the requested payments are within the legally adopted budget, a legally adopted budget amendment, or authorized transfer of funds. 
2  Reference is made to Article 6 of the Town Charter Financial Matters Sections 6.01-6.10; Town Ordinances Part I, Section 2, Divisions 2, 3, and 4; Sections 2-410 through 2-413; Town Ordinances, Part II, Article I, Sections 86-5-86-6, 86-81 subsection III, Disbursements. The charter and town ordinances are consistent with the applicable sections and subsections of Titles 20-A and 30-A for municipal schools and home rule. 
3  We recognize that there may be times when a payment may fall outside of the normal processing cycle, requiring a special warrant be prepared in time for the next meeting of the school committee for approval and subsequent approval of the council. If such a circumstance should arise, either the town manager or finance director will be available to sign checks requiring a manual signature for an approved warrant in these extraordinary circumstances. Additionally, we recognize that due to the extraordinary circumstances surrounding payroll processing and compliance with state law, alternative agreed upon procedures may need to be implemented on a case-by-case basis to ensure timely payment of wages to employees. 
4  Implementation of the policy and procedure will require read only access to the school department's computerized financial management and accounting system as well as the security necessary to print the checks and apply the electronic signature.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Random alcohol testing must be conducted just before, during or just after a driver's performance of safety-sensitive duties. Random drug testing does not have to be conducted in immediate time proximity to performing safety-sensitive functions. 

Sec. 89-9. - Testing procedures. 
    The Town of Lisbon is contracting with a (TPA) to do the Town's alcohol and substance abuse testing. When an employee has been randomly selected, he/she will be notified by his/her appropriate supervisor and will proceed directly to the testing area. All randomly selected individuals must comply with the testing. 
    Sampling for substance abuse testing shall only be conducted in a medical facility supervised by a licensed physician or nurse. Employees and job applicants for CDL positions shall not be required to provide a urine sample while being observed, directly or indirectly, by another individual. People shall leave any personal belongings including any unnecessary clothing, coat, jacket or similar outer garment outside the collection area. 
    All specimen samples shall be collected, sealed and stored in compliance with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) guidelines as required by Federal Law, and transported to a licensed and certified laboratory for actual testing. Additionally, the chain of custody requirements for these samples shall also be in accordance with NIDA guidelines and the Federal Law in order to protect the sample from being tampered and to verify the identity of each sample and test result. When the sample is first collected a portion of the sample shall be segregated according to federal regulations. In the event there is a positive test with the first sample, the segregated sample may be requested by the employee for testing within seventy-two (72) hours after the employee is notified by the MRO of the positive test to confirm the accuracy of the results. This request should be made to the MRO. The employee shall pay the cost of testing the segregated sample if the test is positive and the Town shall pay the cost if the test is negative. (Applicants shall pay the cost of testing the segregated sample regardless of the test results). If the employee is aware of a situation that may have led to the positive test, such as taking of prescription or other medicines, he/she should make the fact known to the MRO within the required time after notification of a positive test. 
    The Town shall utilize the services of a Medical Review Officer (MRO) to interpret any confirmed positive test. An MRO is a licensed physician who is responsible for receiving the laboratory results. The MRO has knowledge of substance abuse disorders and has appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate an individual's medical history and any other medical information. The MRO shall have the authority to discuss an employee's test result with the employee prior to notifying the Town. Once the employee has been notified and the MRO is satisfied with the accuracy of the test results, the Town shall be notified. 
    All alcohol testing will be conducted with a Breath Testing Device (EBT), which will be administered by the same medical facility as the substance testing. Two (2) breath tests are required to determine if a person has an unacceptable alcohol concentration. A screening test is conducted first. Any result less than 0.02 alcohol concentration is considered a negative test. 
    If the alcohol concentration is 0.02 or greater, a second confirmation test must be conducted within fifteen (15) minutes. The employee and the individual conducting the breath test shall complete the alcohol testing form to ensure that the results are properly recorded. Any individual who conducts the testing must be trained to operate the EBT and be proficient in the breath testing procedures. 
    Employees who are found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, will be placed on unpaid leave for a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours. Any result greater than 0.04 is considered a positive test and the collector will do a confirmation test. If the confirmation test is greater than 0.04 then the employee is removed from the safety sensitive function and will be required to meet with a SAP 
( C.M. of 6-5-2018, V. 2018-121 ) 
Sec. 89-10. - Prohibited conduct. 
    During the time that the Town's CDL employees are performing their work, they shall not do any of the following: 
1.  Report to work and/or remaining on duty with an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater; 
2.  Possess any alcohol; 
3.  Use any alcohol; 
4.  Use any alcohol within four (4) hours of going on duty; 
5.  Use any alcohol within eight (8) hours after an accident which has required the CDL employee to be tested for alcohol concentration; 
6.  Refuse to submit to a required alcohol and/or controlled substance test; 
7.  Report to or remain on duty when using any controlled substance, except when used under a physician's orders and when the physician has informed the CDL employee in writing that the use will not affect the safe operations of a commercial vehicle. In the case of a written warning by the physician the employee shall report this to his/her supervisor immediately; 
8.  Report to or remain on duty if the employee has tested positive for controlled substances. 
    Failure to comply with these rules is a violation of this policy, and will result in disciplinary action or referral to a certified rehabilitation program. 
( C.M. of 6-5-2018, V. 2018-121 ) 
Sec. 89-11. - Refusal to test. 
    Failure to submit to testing will automatically be considered a verified positive test and he/she will have to follow the procedures outlined in this policy. Specifically, the following circumstances will be considered a refusal to test. 
1.  Failure to report to the designated testing area within thirty (30) minutes of being notified to submit to a required test. 
2.  Failure to accurately provide a sufficient sample to be tested, either breath or urine as the case may be, unless medically determined impossible to do so. 
( C.M. of 6-5-2018, V. 2018-121 ) 
Sec. 89-12. - Disciplinary action. 
    Any employee who violates this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Factors to be considered in determining the appropriate disciplinary response include, but are not limited to the following: Employee's work history, length of employment, current job performance and existence of past disciplinary actions. 
    Specific actions which may be subject to dismissal include, but are not limited, to the following: 
1.  Refusal to submit to a rehabilitation program after testing positive. 
2.  Failure to successfully complete a rehabilitation program after receiving a positive test. 
3.  The employee has twice substituted, adulterated, diluted or otherwise tampered with his/her urine sample. 
4.  While on Town premises, the employee was caught drinking alcohol or using, manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, selling, or possessing any illegal or unlawfully obtained substances or drugs. 
5.  The use of alcohol while on Town premises. This includes a conviction for driving while intoxicated (OUI) during work hours. 
6.  Failure to contact the Town's approved substance abuse clinician (EAP Provider) within five (5) regular working days after being notified of a confirmed (MRO certified) positive test for the use of an unauthorized substance. 
    Any permanent employee who tests positive the first time for either alcohol or substance misuse will be offered an opportunity for rehabilitation. The offer of rehabilitation does not apply to job applicants, temporary or probationary employees. 
    Employees who test positive a second time will be suspended immediately without pay and terminated after being notified of the second confirmed (MRO certified) positive test for the use of an unauthorized substance. 
    NOTE: During the period the Town is awaiting an employee's test result due to a post-accident or reasonable suspicion circumstance, the Town may transfer the employee to another position with no reduction in pay or benefits. The Town also reserves the right to place an employee on paid or unpaid suspension. A determination as to whether an employee is placed in another position or placed on paid or unpaid suspension may be based, but not limited to who is responsible for and/or the severity of the accident, if applicable; the observed condition of the employee, if applicable; the employee's work history; length of employment; current job performance and the existence of past disciplinary actions. 
( C.M. of 6-5-2018, V. 2018-121 ) 
Sec. 89-13. - Employee/applicant rights and responsibilities. 
    It is the responsibility of each employee to seek help before alcohol and drug problems lead to disciplinary action. 
    In the event of a positive test result, employees and job applicants shall have the opportunity to present an alternative explanation for the test result by contacting the Medical Review Officer (MRO). This shall be done no later than five (5) days after notification of the result. No further action will be taken if there is a justified explanation, or there is a reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the result or chain of custody of the sample. 
    Any employee or job applicant with a positive test result may also, upon written request within five (5) working days, have the right to any information relating to the test result and procedures. 
    Any permanent employee who tests positive for a first offense, and cannot provide a satisfactory explanation, will be offered EAP referral to a certified rehabilitation program. 
    Any first offense referral may require an indefinite suspension of regular employment or the transfer of the employee to a non-safety sensitive position with an appropriate reduction in pay. If the position is in a lower pay classification, then the employee will remain in his/her current step, but with a reduction in classification which would result in a reduced pay until the admission and completion of an approved drug/alcohol treatment program and the satisfactory passing of a return-to-work substance abuse test. A determination as to whether an employee is placed in another position or placed on unpaid suspension may be based, but not limited to who is responsible for and/or the severity of the accident, if applicable; the observed condition of the employee, if applicable; the level of the test result; the employee's work history; length of employment; current job performance and the existence of past disciplinary actions. The employee may use accumulated sick or vacation time or personal time during the in-patient rehabilitation. 
    Upon successfully completing the rehabilitation program, as determined by the rehabilitation or treatment provider in consultation with the Town, the employee is entitled to return to his/her previous job with full pay and benefits. The exception would be if conditions unrelated to the employee's previous test make the employee's return impossible. 
    Any subsequent second offense positive test will result in immediate suspension without pay and terminated after being notified of a second confirmed (MRO certified) positive test for the use of an unauthorized substance. 
( C.M. of 6-5-2018, V. 2018-121 ) 
Sec. 89-14. - Confidentiality of information. 
    Unless the employee or applicant consents, all information acquired by the Town in the testing process is confidential and may not be released to any person other than the employee or applicant who is tested, the Program Administrator, respective department heads or designees, as well as the EAP or Rehabilitation Provider. The foregoing shall not prevent the release of information that is required or permitted by state or federal law, or the use of information in any grievance procedure, administrative hearing, or civil action relating to the imposition of the test or the use of the test results. 
( C.M. of 6-5-2018, V. 2018-121 ) 
Sec. 89-15. - Sessions. 
    The Town will provide each employee subject to this policy a copy of the written policy. 
    The Town will also provide printed material, which describes the effects of alcohol and/or controlled substances on the individual's health, work and personal life, as well as information on the signs and symptoms of alcohol or controlled substances. In addition, the Town will provide annual training for affected employees on substance abuse awareness. 
    Any employee who wishes to seek personal and confidential advice on alcohol and/or controlled substances may contact the Town's Employee Assistance Provider. 
( C.M. of 6-5-2018, V. 2018-121 )

Sec. 90-3.1. - Sexual harassment. 
(a)  Generally . It is the policy of the town that all employees should be able to work in an environment free from all forms of harassment. Harassment, as defined by this section, is prohibited. This policy refers not only to supervisor-subordinate actions but also to actions between coworkers. Any complaints of harassment will be investigated promptly. If an employee believes they are being subjected to any of the prohibited forms of harassment or believe they are being discriminated against because other employees are receiving favored treatment in exchange for sexual favors, they must bring this to the attention of the town. The very nature of harassment makes it virtually impossible to detect unless the person being harassed registers their discontent with the appropriate town representative. Consequently, in order for the town to deal with the problem, employees must report such offensive conduct or situations. There will be no intimidation, discrimination or retaliation against any employee who makes a report of harassment. Sexual harassment is an extremely serious matter. It is prohibited in the workplace by any person and in any form. 
(b)  Definition . 
(1)  Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of federal law and section 4572 of the Maine Human Rights Act. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: 
a.  Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; 
b.  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or 
c.  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 
(2)  In other words, sexual harassment is the attempt to control, influence or affect the career, salary or job of an individual in exchange for sexual favors. Sexual harassment can also be conduct that creates a hostile or offensive work environment or unreasonably interferes with a person's ability to perform their job. 
(3)  Specific conduct, that is prohibited, includes, but is not limited to: 
a.  Threats or insinuations, implicit or explicit, that any employee's refusal to submit to sexual advances will adversely affect the employee's retention, evaluation, wages, promotion, duties or any other condition of employment. 
b.  Unwelcome sexual flirtations, advances or propositions. 
c.  Verbal or written abuse of a sexual nature. 
d.  Graphic verbal comments about an individual's body. 
e.  Sexual comments of a provocative or suggestive nature. 
f.  Sexually degrading words used to describe an individual. 
g.  Jokes or innuendos intended for and/or directed to another employee. 
h.  The display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or pictures. 
(c)  Report . Any employee who believes he has been the subject of sexual harassment should report the alleged act immediately. The steps to take are as follows: 
(1)  Be sure that the person who is sexually harassing you know[s] that you do not welcome that person's advances/comments/actions. TELL THEM TO STOP! 
(2)  If the sexual harassment continues or if you are not comfortable telling the person who is harassing you to stop, inform your supervisor, department head or the town manager of the sexual harassment. If your supervisor is the alleged harasser, you should report the concern to your department head or the town manager. If the town manager is the alleged harasser, you should inform the chairman of the town council. 
(d)  Confidentiality . A record of the complaint and the findings will become a part of the complaint investigation record, and the file will be maintained separately from the employee's personnel file. It is understood any person electing to utilize this complaint resolution procedure will be treated courteously, the problem handled swiftly and confidentially. 
(e)  Discipline/discharge for violation. Any employee who is found after appropriate investigation to have engaged in sexual harassment will be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge. 
(f)  No retaliation for filing a complaint. The registering of a complaint will in no way be used or held against the employee, nor will it have an adverse impact on the complaining individual's employment status. 
(g)  No retaliation will occur as a result of filing a report. It is unlawful under the Maine Human Rights Act and federal law for an employer to retaliate against an employee because the employee filed a charge or because the employee aided in an investigation.

If the town manager is the one retaliating, the employee should inform the chairman of the town council.

Sec. 90-3.2. - Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA) Policy for Individuals with Disabilities. 
(a)  Policy statement. It is the policy of the Town of Lisbon that no qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be subjected to discrimination in employment. This protection against discrimination shall apply to individuals with disabilities as defined in Title II of the ADA, i.e., those persons who have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of their major life activities, have a record of such an impairment, or are regarded as having such an impairment. This protection against discrimination also applies to individuals with physical or mental disabilities as defined in the Maine Human Rights Act, including individuals with physical or mental impairments that substantially limit a major life activity, that significantly impair physical or mental health, or that require special education, vocational rehabilitation or related services. The MHRA also protects individuals who have a record of, are regarded as, or are likely to develop a physical or mental impairment or any of the specific disabilities under the MHRA. 
    The Town of Lisbon is committed to providing accommodations for eligible individuals with physical or mental disabilities as defined by federal and state law in the most timely and effective manner possible under applicable laws and regulations. The municipality's intent is to ensure that every request for an accommodation is promptly and properly reviewed. The municipality is committed to following the requirements of the ADA, the MHRA and all appropriate federal and/or state laws, rules and regulations. 
    All requests for accommodations are to be submitted to the town manager's office for consideration and review. In evaluating requests for accommodation, the town may request additional medical documentation, examinations and/or opinions to the extent the information requested is job-related and consistent with business necessity. 
(b)  Accommodation process. 
(1)  The employee or the employee's immediate supervisor shall contact the town manager's office for assistance in applying for accommodation. No department or individual may grant any accommodation, whether formal or informal, without first receiving approval of the town manager. If an employee's supervisor makes the request for accommodation on behalf of the employee, the employee must then work with the town manager's office directly. Only that information absolutely necessary shall be shared with the employee's supervisor. The employee's supervisor should not act as an advocate or surrogate for the employee. The town manager's office shall assist the employee in all ways reasonably possible in completing the accommodation process in a timely and efficient manner. 
(2)  Any information submitted shall be considered confidential and may be shared only with those who have a need to know in accordance with federal and/or state law. The town manager's office shall make the determination of the need to know in consultation with the applicable department. 
(3)  The town manager's office must make the following necessary determinations for each ADA or MHRA accommodation request: 
a.  Whether the individual has a disability. This determination may require appropriate documentation from a medical care professional, if such documentation is job-related and consistent with business necessity. 
b.  Whether an accommodation is needed for the individual to perform the essential function(s) of the employee's position. 
c.  Whether the accommodation(s) is (are) reasonable and would not create an undue hardship for the town. 
d.  The town manager's office shall implement the decision through appropriate municipal procedures if the employee is to be accommodated. 
(5)  The town manager's office shall make a determination within a reasonable time upon receipt of a request for accommodation. A reasonable time is necessarily flexible, taking into consideration such factors as the complexity of the request, cooperation of the employee, any need(s) for additional medical information, and so forth. 
(6)  If an employee is not satisfied with the determination regarding a requested accommodation, the employee may submit a request for reconsideration to the town manager. The town manager shall promptly review and respond to the request for reconsideration and notify the employee of the town manager's decision. 
(7)  An employee who believes that he or she has been subjected to unlawful disability discrimination or retaliation is encouraged to appeal to the department head or town manager under Policy 90-29. The employee also may file a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission and/or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 300 days of the alleged discrimination. An employee may contact the Human Rights Commission by writing to the Maine Human Rights Commission, State House Station 51, Augusta, ME 04333, or by phoning 207-624-6050. An employee also may contact the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by writing to EEOC, John F. Kennedy Federal Building, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 475 Government Center, Boston, MA 02203, or by phoning 800-669-4000.

Sec. 90-4. - Employment. 
(a)  Applications . Applications for employment must be filed on forms prescribed by the town manager. Such forms may require whatever information is deemed necessary, and all applications must be signed by the person applying. 
(b)  Preemployment medical inquiries. The town will not require an applicant to take a pre-employment medical examination or make preemployment inquiry of an applicant as to whether the applicant is an individual with a physical or mental disability or as to the nature or severity of a physical or mental disability. The town may, however, make pre-employment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions. The town also may condition an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's commencement of duties, provided that 1) all similarly situated employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of physical or mental disability, and 2) the results of such an examination are used in accordance with the requirements of the Maine Human Rights Act and the American with Disabilities Act. 
(c)  Background and reference checks. To ensure that individuals who join the Town of Lisbon are well qualified and to ensure that the municipality maintains a safe and productive work environment, it is our policy to conduct pre-employment background checks on all applicants who accept an offer of employment. Background checks may include verification of any information on the applicant's resume or application form. 
    All offers of employment are conditioned on receipt of a background check report that is acceptable to the Town of Lisbon. All background checks are conducted in conformity with the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Maine Human Rights Act, and state and federal privacy and antidiscrimination laws. Reports are kept confidential and are only viewed by individuals involved in the hiring process. 
    If information obtained in a background check would lead the Town of Lisbon to deny employment, a copy of the report may be viewed by the applicant, and the applicant will have the opportunity to dispute the report's accuracy. The applicant may obtain a copy of their background from the State at their own expense. Background checks may include a criminal record check, although a criminal conviction does not automatically bar an applicant from employment.

Jobs included in collective bargaining agreements shall have salary grades and ranges as determined through negotiations, and as expressed in these agreements. 
Pay Plan (Salary Grade and Ranges) 
    The town manager shall prepare a recommended uniform and equitable pay plan for those positions not included in collective bargaining agreements. This pay plan shall be presented to the town council for review and approval. Determination of salary ranges shall be based upon qualifications required, prevailing rates of pay for comparable work in other public employment in the area, the financial policy of the community, and any other relevant factors. After adoption by the council, no position may be assigned a salary higher than provided for. Merit pay shall be available as an added percentage to each step raise upon successful completion of a pay for performance plan. The elements of each employee performance plan shall be approved by the town council. The salary grade of the new employee may reflect prior training and experience.

(c)  In order to be eligible for sick leave compensation, the employee shall complete the necessary form and return it to the department head for approval, After a decision by the department head, the form and department head's recommendation is forwarded to the town manager for a final decision, either approving or denying the request. The town manager may require a certificate from a qualified physician certifying that the condition of the employee justifies the absence from employment after three days absence. 
(d)  Entitlement upon separation. Sick leave accumulation shall be forfeited upon separation from town employment unless the employee has 15 years of continued service. Upon separation employees with 15 or more years of consecutive service shall receive one-quarter of their accumulated unused sick leave to a maximum payment of 30 days. Such payment shall be made at the employee's regular rate of pay at the time of separation. Employees terminated for cause will not be entitled to sick leave pay out at separation. 
(e)  Sick leave bank. An employee shall designate on a form provided by the town by June 30 of each fiscal year of any sick leave that would have accrued to an employee, who has reached the maximum accrual level, may at the election of that employee be credited to the town's sick leave pool. Any retiree who is leaving the employment of the town may donate accumulated sick leave, not otherwise reimbursed, to the sick leave pool. The pool may accumulate up to a maximum of 1,000 hours. Any employee of the town not covered by a bargaining agreement, who because of serious or extended illness or extenuating circumstances, is without sick leave, may draw sick leave from the pool. The employee's use of sick leave from the pool shall be in accordance with the following terms and conditions: 
(1)  A condition which supports the need for the use of sick leave shall be a legitimate long-term disability or illness suffered by the employee.

Time spent on sick leave provided under the sick leave pool under the provisions of this section shall be included for purposes of calculating available timeframes under Slate and Federal Family and Medical Leave Acts. 
    All decisions regarding allocation of sick leave from the sick leave pool shall be approved by the town manager after determining that the above terms and conditions have been met and after reviewing the employee's previous use of sick leave. If it is determined that the conditions of this section are met and there is no evidence of previous abuse of sick leave, then approval will not be unreasonably withheld. All decisions by the manager, however shall be final and shall not be subject to appeal, grievance or any other provision or procedure under these personnel rules or otherwise available.

18 years ..... 5 weeks 
(b)  Vacation leave will be accounted for on an employee anniversary basis. No vacation leave will be granted during probationary period, but the time accumulated during the probationary period will be credited retroactively to the employee's total service time. After probation, a new employee may take one week of vacation charged against the two weeks for one year's service. 
(c)  An employee may carry forward into the next year, based on the employee's anniversary date, the same number of weeks that are accumulated as vacation leave based on the employee's longevity. Any vacation above the carry over limit will be lost, provided that when an employee was unable to use vacation time for reasons beyond the employee's control the town manager may allow the employee to carry over additional vacation time. 
(d)  Accrued vacation leave shall be paid to employees in good standing upon separation of service or to their beneficiary to estate upon their death. 
(e)  The scheduling of vacation shall be done by the department head, in accordance with the operational needs of the department, and as much as possible with employee wishes. 
(f)  In computing service time for vacation leave, official leave of absence or absence from duty for which sick leave is paid shall not constitute a break in the employee's service record. Employees working and supervising special shifts or hours shall be subject to the same standards that apply to the employees, which they supervise, at the discretion of the town manager. 
(g)  Accrual limit. Notwithstanding anything in these rules to the contrary, effective July 1, 2003, additional vacation leave shall not accrue on an employee's anniversary date if, at that date, the employee has unused vacation leave which is twice the amount of additional leave that would have accrued, on that date not including the additional amount due the employee on the anniversary date. The accrual of additional vacation shall be deferred until the employee's unused vacation balance accrual is below the above mentioned limit, said limit to include the deferred vacation time that would have been awarded on the anniversary date.

(c)  Any injured employee may request on forms provided by the town that the town begin full payment of salary immediately, to ensure that there will be no delay in worker's compensation benefits. The employee however must stipulate to reimbursement of such payments to the town upon receipt of worker's compensation payments. 
(d)  Such additional payments shall not be continued beyond four weeks except upon an order passed by the council.

Sec. 90-25. - Dismissals. 
    An employee may be dismissed (or demoted) when in the judgment of the town manager the employee's work or misconduct so warrants. The employee may petition, by written notice, the town manager within 15 days after the suspension or discharge to call a hearing concerning the charges as soon as possible, making due allowance to give all parties involved adequate time to prepare their cases. 
(T.M. of 7-31-2007, § 2007-115; T.M. of 4-7-2009, § 2009-62; C.M. of 8-19-2014, V. 2014-159) 
Sec. 90-26. - Layoffs. 
    Any employee may be laid off whenever it becomes necessary to reduce the number of employees due to a shortage of funds or a lack of work or other related reasons which do not reflect discredit upon the employee. The town manager shall notify the town council and shall state the names of the employees, stating the reasons for the layoffs and whether it is temporary or permanent.

Sec. 90-27. - Reemployment. 
    The employee's right to recall shall expire at the expiration of two years from the layoff date. If, within the two-year timeframe, the manager proposes to fill a vacancy created by layoff either temporary or permanent, or where a position has been abolished and subsequently recreated, the person filling that position shall be sent correspondence by certified mail, advising that employee that he/she may resume the position with the town. The employee must respond to the certified mail notice within seven days as to whether or not he/she desires to be reemployed. If the reemployment is indicated, the employee shall report to work no later than one week after notice to accept reemployment is given. The employee shall be responsible, during the layoff period, of providing the town with notice of any change of address for purposes of the certified mail correspondence. If the employee filling a position chooses not to be reemployed, then notice shall be sent to the next laid off employee qualified for the position in terms of seniority with the town. The manager may refuse to reemploy anyone laid off due to reasons that fall under the provisions of sections 90-23.5, 90-24, and 90-25 or anyone who fails to meet the qualifications which the position currently requires at the time of rehire.

Sec. 90-28. - Abolishment of positions. 
    The town council reserves the right to abolish any position at any time, and the abolishment of a position shall automatically constitute the discharge of the employee from that position without reflecting any discredit upon the employee; however, if that same position is recreated within two years, the person discharged due to the abolishment shall be reemployed if available.

Sec. 90-29.5. - General. 
    All employees are expected and required to treat supervisors, other employees, and the public with promptness, patience, courtesy, and respect. Many town employees have access to confidential information pertaining to persons or property in town. Employees shall not use this privileged information to their private advantage or to the advantage of anyone else. No employee may release any information that is not required to be released under the Right to Know Law. Employees are expected to conduct themselves at all times during their hours of employment in a manner that will bring no discredit to their department or to the town. 
(T.M. of 7-31-2007, § 2007-115; T.M. of 4-7-2009, § 2009-62; C.M. of 8-19-2014, V. 2014-159)

(b)  No employee may directly or indirectly coerce, attempt to coerce, command or advise another employee to pay, send or contribute anything of value to a party, committee, organization, agency or person for political purposes.

(d)  If an employee is elected to any political office that is incompatible with or creates a conflict of interest with their duties of employment, the employee shall terminate their employment with the town prior to assuming the duties of the political office. 
(e)  In addition to the provisions of subsections (a) through (d) of this section, employees shall refrain from engaging in improper political activity during working hours or while on town duty after regular working hours. Improper political activity shall include but not be limited to the following: 
(1)  Wearing campaign buttons.

(b)  Employees of the town shall not accept any gift or gratuity from an individual or business that does business with the town that is more than a nominal value or which exceeds the level of customary courtesies extended in the course of ethical business standards. 
(c)  It is imperative that an employee's motives and conduct in expending town funds remain above reproach and completely impartial. Gifts and/or gratuities which exceed a nominal value raise a suspicion of impropriety. Yet, in the current business climate, it would be impractical, though possibly preferable, to refuse any and all gifts and/or gratuities offered. Accepting hats, pads of paper, pens or pencils, magnets, and similar items with business logos or an isolated reasonably priced meal is acceptable pursuant to this policy, as they should not raise an issue of impropriety or partiality in subsequent dealings the individual or business providing such items that does business with the town, or their competitors, or citizens. The prohibition is against any gifts or gratuity which might place an employee in an embarrassing or awkward position or interfere or influence in any way the impartial performance of an employee's duties.

    Where an employee, who has been covered under the town's health insurance plan, or who is a new employee, has access to other adequate health insurance coverage, and elects not to be covered under the town's health insurance plan or to reduce the level of coverage, then the employee will be paid, on an annual basis, July 1 to June 30, a base sum of $3,000.00 that will be increased annually at a rate based on the annual increase in wages. This payment will be distributed in bi-weekly payments. This benefit shall be available, however, only to those employees who have demonstrated that they have adequate and acceptable coverage from another source and the employee's spouse or person providing the coverage does not work for the Town of Lisbon municipal or school department. This election may be made at any time but the benefit shall be prorated over the portion of the fiscal year remaining if not effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year. The payment of premium savings in lieu of health insurance will not prevent the employee from re-enrolling in the town provided health insurance plan at a later date.

Sec. 90-34. - Retirement; flexible pretax benefits, social security. 
(a)  Maine Public Employees Retirement System (optional) . The town is a participating district in the Maine Public Employees Retirement System. A permanent employee whose regularly scheduled work week is 30 hours or more and is not seasonal or temporary will be offered the opportunity to participate in the system. It is not required that an employee participate-just that the employee be given the choice to participate or not. This is an important decision because the employee's choice to participate or not is permanent for all current and future employment in any position with optional membership with the Town of Lisbon. Employees should be encouraged to contact the PLD Unit at the Retirement System at 1-800-451-9800 for information about the plan before making their election. 
(1)  Should any employee choose to participate, the town will deduct a percentage of the employee's paycheck in the form of a payroll deduction. The town will make a contribution on behalf of the employee at a rate to be determined by the retirement system. Employees electing to join MainePERS must start participation when initially hired and must contribute to the plan during any period of employment with the Town of Lisbon or Lisbon School Department. 
(2)  An employee who is a member of MainePERS may apply for a full refund of their own contributions plus accumulated interest after terminating employment with the Town of Lisbon. Employees who take a refund who are vested in the system are giving up their right to a monthly lifetime retirement allowance upon reaching normal retirement age. Withdrawal must take place via the proper application and there is a waiting period before the funds can be released to the employee by the system. 
(b)  ICMA-Money purchase plan (optional). Permanent full time and permanent part time employees may choose to participate in this tax-deferred retirement plan. Employees are eligible as of the date of hire. Employees may enroll at any time during the course of the year permitted by the plan. Contributions of the employee are matched by a town contribution at a rate not to exceed the state retirement system total rate. For employees, who elected to enroll in both retirement plans, the town will only contribute the town portion of the MSRS and the eligible employee shall pay the ICMA plan. The town will not make ICMA or other contributions where the employee has elected to collect retirement benefits from the MSRS or other. 
(c)  Flexible benefits plan. The town may provide a flexible benefits plan as allowed under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees shall bear the cost of either the medical reimbursement and/or dependent care options. Employees not opting to participate in the flexible benefits plan immediately upon being employed or not sustaining a lifestyle change during the year will not be eligible to participate until the next calendar year. 
(d)  Premium conversion plan. The town shall make available a premium conversion plan which enables employees to have their premiums deducted on a pre-taxed basis for participation in the health, dental, or flexible benefits plan, i.e. reducing the cost impact of the premiums for participation in fringe benefits requiring employee contributions. 
(e)  Income protection plan. The town shall provide the Maine Municipal Employees Health Trust Income Protection Plan or its equivalent to all full time employees. The plan premiums shall be borne entirely by the employees. 
(f)  Social security. All employees of the town shall participate in social security in accordance with federal law. The rate of contribution for both the town and the employee will be as determined by federal regulations. 
(g)  Vision plan. Effective January 1, 2015, the town may provide a vision plan to all full time employees. The plan premiums shall be borne entirely by the employees.

    Employees who retire from the town and who are eligible to receive retirement benefits from the Maine Public Employees Retirement System (MainePERS) must terminate employment with the town as a condition of receiving retirement benefits from MainePERS, as provided in MainePERS rules and regulations. Employees who retire make a voluntary decision to terminate employment with the town, and the town does not guarantee or promise that employees who retire will be rehired by the town into either the same or a different position with the town. Any employee who retires and wants to be rehired to a former position, or to a different position, shall be subject to the selection and employment process as provided by town policy. 
    The town has the sole discretion to determine whether former employees will be rehired by the town in their former position or a position for which they are qualified to perform on a part-time or full-time basis. Any application to be rehired shall be in writing, and all requests must meet the eligibility conditions set forth by MainePERS. Any employee who is rehired by the town shall be subject to a probationary period consistent with town policy. 
    Employees who retire shall be paid accumulated benefits as provided by town policy. 
    Except for retirement benefits outlined above, employees who retire and then are subsequently rehired by the town shall be considered new employees for the purposes of accruing and receiving benefits as provided by town policy. Any employee who retires from the town and receives a payout for unused sick leave at the time or retirement shall not be eligible for a payout of sick leave accrued during any post-retirement period of employment.

The town recognizes that certain employees are required to be "on-call" during off-duty hours or a 24-hour emergency call on a permanent, seasonal or as needed basis. This policy is intended to assure that these employees are able to have the vehicles at their disposal necessary to fulfill the duties of their positions while at the same time ensuring only those uses authorized by the town are permitted. Further, the town recognizes that an employee responding to a call for service outside of regular hours from their place of residence will decrease response time for the call. 
    It is the intention of this policy to establish operating procedures for all vehicles and/or equipment that are owned by the Town of Lisbon in order to ensure that proper safety practices are being followed for the protection of employees and the public. This policy will address specific safety practices and does not supersede, amend, or replace any regulation required by state and federal agencies or any regulation required by other agencies for insurance or other purposes. Individual town department policies shall comply with the general provisions of this directive, but may deviate from the specific requirements depending on the department's mission-specific operations and type of equipment operated. 
    Town vehicles are for official use only and are never to be used for personal reasons. Official use is defined as use that is instrumental to the provision of town services. Personal use is defined as use that is specific to personal errands, trips, or purposes. A valid operator's license appropriate for the class of the vehicle is required. 
(b)  Employee responsibility.

(3)  Employees shall ensure that no non-employee is allowed to ride in town-owned vehicles or equipment except in cases of emergency or with prior authorization of the town manager. The police chief may authorize non-employees to participate in a "ride along" program with a uniformed officer provided a liability waiver is obtained from the participant prior to the "ride along." Non-employees who are passengers in any town-owned vehicles or equipment shall wear seatbelts at all times. 
(4)  Any employee operating a town vehicle must strictly adhere to all town and state traffic laws and/or regulations. 
(5)  Each employee will be responsible to ensure the maintenance of the vehicles or equipment in their use for their shift. Each employee will conduct a walk-around on their vehicles/equipment to ensure that it is in safe operating condition. This will include checking the tires and lights. 
(6)  If mechanical problems are encountered while operating any vehicle/equipment, the department head shall be notified by the employee and will schedule the vehicle/equipment for proper repair and any required follow-up maintenance.

(c)  Vehicle assignments . 
(1)  Marked vehicles/unmarked vehicles. Employees whose positions require that they are available during off-duty hours to respond to stakeouts, surveillance sites, fire or emergency calls, may with the request of the Department Head and prior approval of the town manager, use the town's marked/unmarked vehicles while "on-call" during off-duty hours. Any personal use of the town's marked/unmarked vehicles by an employee at a time when they are off-duty and not "on call" is strictly prohibited. 
(2)  Police, fire, public works, parks, and recreation departments may be allowed vehicle assignments with the prior approval of the town manager. A department head with prior approval from the town manager may temporarily give written authorization to on-call emergency supervisors/officers/foremen/employees from these departments to keep an assigned town-owned vehicle at their residence during the time that they are temporarily on-call to be used exclusively for any town business-related purpose. Vehicles are not to be used for personal use while at home. 
(3)  Under IRS regulations, use of town vehicles for commuting is considered taxable income to an employee and the value of the personal use of the town vehicle will be included in the employee's taxable compensation. Excluded from this rule are marked police, fire, or public safety vehicles that are required to be used for commuting by a police officer, firefighter, or public safety officer who, when not on a regular shift, is on call at all times. Other than commuting, personal use of these vehicles, outside the limit of the police officer's arrest powers or the obligation of a firefighter or public safety officer to respond to an emergency, is prohibited pursuant to IRS regulations. 
(d)  Accidents involving town vehicles. All accidents involving town vehicles require a police report no matter how minor. Except when absolutely necessary, a town vehicle involved in an accident will not be moved prior to authorization by an investigating police officer.

ARTICLE IV. - MAILBOX POLICY 

Sec. 91-61. - Mailboxes. 
    For convenience and practicality, mailbox installations have been allowed within the right-of-way of Maine's public highways; however, it is important to recognize that such installations have two very important conditions: 
(1)  The mailbox must be installed in accordance with applicable standards to ensure that mail can be delivered and that the mailbox does not create an obstacle or safety hazard to those that use or maintain the highway; and 
(2)  The mailbox is installed entirely at the owner's risk. In other words, if the mailbox incurs damage during any sort of highway operations or maintenance, the property owner is not entitled to replacement or compensation. In fact, if the mailbox was not installed in accordance with the applicable standards as stated above, the owner may even be held liable for injuries or damages that may have been incurred as a result. 
    Mailbox design and installation standards are available from several sources, and mailbox owners are expected to consult this information prior to undertaking any mailbox installation or replacement. The following standards have nationwide relevance and were developed in cooperation with one another: 
 The United States Postal Service (USPS) Mailbox Guidelines. The USPS defines the standards for mailbox construction, as well as the placement tolerance that must be met to accommodate postal operations. Specifics may be obtained from your local post office or online at: https://www.usps.com/manage/mailboxes.htm 
 American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Roadside Design Guide. The AASHTO Roadside Design Guide, Chapter 11: Erecting Mailboxes on Streets and Highways deals with the safety and construction of privately owned mailboxes, mailbox supports, and mailbox turnout designs and is less focused on postal operations. This publication may be obtained online through the AASHTO Bookstore at: https://bookstore.transporation.org/Item_details.aspx?id=1807 
    In addition, if the mailbox is to be installed in an area with sidewalks, it is important to recognize that the sidewalks must continue to comply with ADA requirements: 
 American Disabilities Act (ADA). The most current version of the ADA Standards for Accessible Design set forth the minimum requirements to ensure facilities are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAstandards.htm#c4 
    The municipality has developed this policy to promote compliance with these national standards and to help further clarify the expectations and responsibilities of Maine mailbox owners. Such compliance helps us ensure that we continue to provide safe, efficient and accessible highways for all. The following pages further specify the details associated with mailbox height, location, offset, and post type to minimize the potential hazards and conflicts associated with mailbox installations and to reduce the opportunities for damage to mailboxes. 
Mailbox Installation Standards 
General Location: 
    Whenever possible, your mailbox should be located after your driveway opening. This location placement improves visibility, minimizes the amount of snow that comes off the snow plow, and improves the approach for your mail carrier. The diagram below further clarifies this preferred placement: 

Mailbox Support Design: 
    In many cases, it is best to use an extended arm type of post with a free-swinging suspended mailbox. This allows snowplows to sweep near or under boxes without damage to supports and provides easy access to the boxes by carrier and customers. The following picture shows a free-swinging suspended mailbox: 

    In addition, note the strategic placement of the red reflector on the point closest to the road. This will help your local snowfighter see and avoid your mailbox during winter storms. 
Offset: 
    Mailboxes should be set back from the edge of the shoulder-regardless of whether the shoulder is gravel or paved. In other words, the face of the mailbox should be at least one foot (1') back from the edge of the normally plowed surface of the highway or the face of curb. Greater offset distances are encouraged whenever possible to allow the mail carrier to get further out of traffic and to further minimize potential damage to your mailbox. The following picture shows a mailbox with a reasonable offset: 

    Mailboxes in sidewalk areas should leave at least 36? behind the back of the box or the post, whichever is located the furthest from the road. 

Height: 
    According to USPS standards, a mailbox must be installed with the bottom of the mailbox located between 41? and 45? high above the surface of the highway shoulder. We recommend that this height be closer to the 45? measurement to minimize conflict with the height of the plow truck wing when snow is being pushed back during, or between, winter storms. The following picture further clarifies the height considerations: 

Post Size, Type and Embedment: 
    Mailbox posts must be sturdy enough to hold up the mailbox in all types of weather conditions, however, they cannot be so rugged that they present a hazard to vehicles that inadvertently leave the road. If a mailbox support is struck by a vehicle, it must easily break away. Therefore, the following types of posts are deemed acceptable: 
 4? x 4? wooden posts embedded 2 feet into the ground. Larger wooden posts (4? x 6? or 6? x 6?) may be used only if the post is drilled through with an appropriate spade bit to create a shear plane. The following diagram indicates the necessary holes and spacing. 

 1? to 2? round diameter steel or aluminum pipe or standard U-channel post embedded 2 feet into the ground. 
 Unacceptable mailbox supports include: anything that is filled with concrete, masonry and stone structures, heavy steel structures, and most objects that were intended for other uses (e.g., antique plows, I-beams, and various other household tools and objects). 
NOTICE: Mailboxes, attachments or support systems not consistent with this policy are considered "Deadly Fixed Objects" (aka, "DFOs") and are in violation of 23 MRSA § 1401-A on state and state aid roads. On local roads, they can be considered as "obstructions" and a number of statutes relate to these obstructions. As such, when these installations are recognized by the municipality, the owner will be informed of the hazard and immediate removal will be requested. If the property owner does not comply with this request, the municipality may elect to remove the installation and seek reimbursement from the property owner for all costs incurred.

Sec. 92-5. - Inventory/review. 
    Within 90 days after the date upon which tax liens mature, the town manager shall develop an inventory of all town-owned property, together with any recommendations regarding the disposal of that property. 
(C.M. of 6-1-2010, V. 2010-101) 
Sec. 92-6. - Tax acquired property. 
    Property that has been acquired by the Town of Lisbon for nonpayment of taxes pursuant to 36 M.R.S.A. Section 943, and for which the period of redemption has expired, may be returned, by municipal quit-claim deed, to the taxpayer who is the owner of record of the property at the time of the acquisition by the town, or that taxpayer's successor in interest. The municipal quit-claim deed is to be executed by the town manager and the town finance director without the necessity of council action. The deed shall not be delivered to the taxpayer or successor in interest until the payment of all back taxes, interests and costs, including such taxes, together with appropriate interest and costs thereon, which would have become assessed and due during the period the property was town-owned, together with all delinquent sewer user fees and water fees.

    Upon recommendation of the town manager, and approval of the town council, the town manager may obtain an appraisal of the property, by an appraiser licensed under the laws of the State of Maine, and qualified to appraise the type of property in question. 
(C.M. of 6-1-2010, V. 2010-101) 
Sec. 92-8. - Methods of disposal. 
(a)  Solicitation of public bids. Where the town council determines that exposure of the property to a public bid procedure is the most expeditious method for disposing of the property, it shall instruct the town manager to conduct a public bid procedure. This procedure shall involve at least one notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the Lisbon area. The bid advertisement shall contain any conditions or restrictions that the town wishes to place on the property, the ability of the town to negotiate with the lowest bidder should it be deemed in the best interest of the town to do so, and the right of the town to reject any and all bids. 
(b)  Solicitation of limited bids. Where the market for the property appears limited to a few potential purchasers, then the town council may instruct the town manager to solicit bids from those potential purchasers without the need of public advertisement. Any bids received, shall be documented by the town manager and the solicitation shall include the same terms and conditions as outlined in subsection (a) above. 
(c)  Request for proposals. To request proposals from potential purchasers where the town determines that the redevelopment of an existing structure, abatement of environmental conditions, job creation, or similar factors, or where the town has special concerns about the nature of the use to be conducted on the property, or where required by State or Federal Law. The town may solicit request for proposals which will include proposals for the development, redevelopment, or other use of the property. The town council may establish criteria or guidelines to be included in the request for proposals that relate to the qualifications of the developer, selection factors, ranking methodology, and any other factors deemed appropriate to the particular property being offered for sale. The town also may include as part of the conditions of sale, a development agreement to be negotiated between the town and a selected purchaser. Any development agreement shall be subject to final approval by the town council and may contain deed restrictions or other guarantees to assure the performance of the proposed developer. 
(d)  Listing agreement. Where, due to the nature of the property, a listing agreement with a realtor who has expertise in marketing property of the type to be disposed of, may be approved by the town council, when this is deemed by the town council as the most effective way of disposing of the property.
