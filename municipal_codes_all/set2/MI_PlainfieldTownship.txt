PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Charter Township of Plainfield, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1988 Complied Ordinances, as supplemented through February 22, 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the township board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1988 Compiled Ordinances, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. or new chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and Bill Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Robert Homan, Township Manager, Ms. Susan L. Morrow, MMC, Township Clerk, and Mr. Eric E. Brandt, Township Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Township readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Township's affairs.

THE CHARTER TOWNSHIP OF PLAINFIELD ORDAINS: 
    Section 1. Short title. This ordinance shall be known as the "Code of Ordinances adopting ordinance" and may be so cited. 
    Section 2. Adoption of Code of Ordinances. The Code entitled "Code of Ordinances, Charter Township of Plainfield, Kent County, Michigan," published by Municipal Code Corporation, consisting of chapters 1 through 38, each inclusive, is adopted. 
    Section 3. Repealer. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before February 6, 2006, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. The Plainfield Charter Township Zoning Ordinance is one of the ordinances that is not being repealed by this Ordinance, but will remain as a separate ordinance apart from the Code. 
    Section 4. Prior ordinances not revived. The repeal provided for in section 3 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section 5. Penalty. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00 and/or imprisonment not exceeding 90 days in the discretion of the court. However, unless otherwise provided by law, a person convicted of a violation of this Code which substantially corresponds to a violation of state law that is a misdemeanor for which the maximum period of imprisonment is 93 days shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500.00, and costs of prosecution or by imprisonment for a period of not more than 93 days or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the township may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
    Section 6. Code additions or amendments. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the Township Board to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
    Section 7. Later ordinances. Ordinances adopted after February 06, 2006, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code, shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code.

If any provision of this Code or its application to any person or circumstance is held to be over broad, that provision or application will nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
State Law reference- Severability of state statutes, MCL 8.5. 
Sec. 1-9. - Provisions deemed continuation of existing ordinances.

The township board hereby finds that prohibiting nudity (as defined in section 4-32(e)) in liquor-licensed establishments serves the legitimate governmental interest of preventing disturbances, criminal or unlawful activity, and other undesirable activity that would more likely occur within or near such establishments if nudity were permitted on the same premises where alcoholic liquor is served.

(1)  The whole or part of the pubic region; 
(2)  The whole or part of the anus; 
(3)  The whole or part of the buttocks; 
(4)  The whole or part of the genitals; or 
(5)  Any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola. A woman's breast feeding of a baby does not constitute nudity irrespective of whether or not the nipple is covered during or incidental to the feeding. 
(f)  For purposes of this section, the term "licensee" means a person or entity having a license to sell alcoholic liquor and the owners, officers, agents, and employees of such person or entity. 
(g)  A violation of any provision of this section is a misdemeanor. In addition to any remedies available at law, the township may bring an action for an injunction or other process against a person to restrain, prevent, or abate any violation of this section. A violation of this section shall also constitute a basis for the township board to recommend nonrenewal or revocation of a liquor license or permit of such establishment.

(h)  Hearings on Appeals. All hearings on appeals shall take place at a regular or special meeting of the appeal board. The township shall have a minimum of 15 days after a claim of appeal is filed to issue the required notices. The appeal shall be heard at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the appeal board following the 15-day period for which the hearing is scheduled, provided that a quorum is present.

Secs. 8-127-8-129. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VI. - DIGITAL SIGN AND BILLBOARD 

Sec. 8-130. - Digital standard. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. More businesses desire to utilize advancements in technology which permit signs to change copy electronically (e.g., utilizing an LED type of sign). These newer technologies pose additional risks of impacting adjacent areas and adversely dominating the environment in which they operate unless regulated in a reasonable fashion. The intent of this article is to establish operating standards and regulations for signs which utilize these newer technologies, other than billboards which are regulated separately by the township, in order to minimize the secondary effects that often accompany the unregulated display of digital signs, preserve the character and repose of adjacent areas (with a principal focus on residential neighborhoods), protect property values, and reduce traffic hazards caused by undue distractions. 
(b)  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the words "wall sign", "digital sign", and "freestanding sign" and "sign" shall have the same definitions as contained in the township's adopted zoning ordinance, as amended from time to time. 
(c)  Display. 
(1)  A digital sign, other than a digital billboard, may not allow the display or message to change more frequently than once every eight seconds, with a transition period of one second or less. 
(2)  A digital sign must have installed an ambient light monitor, which shall continuously monitor and automatically adjust the brightness level of the display based on ambient light conditions consistent with the terms of this article. 
(3)  The maximum brightness levels for digital signs, other than a digital billboard, shall not exceed 0.2 foot-candles over ambient light levels measured within 150 feet of the source, consistent with the terms of this section. Certification must be provided to the township demonstrating that the sign has been preset to automatically adjust the brightness to these levels or lower. Re-inspection and recalibration may be periodically required by the township in its reasonable discretion, at the permittee's expense, to ensure that the specified brightness levels are maintained at all times. 
(4)  Brightness of digital signs shall be measured as follows: 
a.  At least 30 minutes following sunset, a foot candle meter shall be used to obtain an ambient light reading for the location. This is done while the sign is off or displaying black copy. The reading shall be made with the meter aimed directly at the sign area at the pre-set location. 
b.  The sign shall then be turned on to full white copy to take another reading with the meter at the same location. 
c.  If the difference between the readings is 0.2 foot candles or less, the brightness is properly adjusted. 
(d)  Other requirements. The use, size and location of digital signs, other than digital billboards, must comply with all other relevant regulations and ordinances of the township. 
(Ord. No. 829, § 1, 6-7-2010) 
Sec. 8-131. - Billboards. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The township recognizes that billboards are, by their nature, different in scope and purpose from other types of signage in the township. Among other matters, billboards advertise or communicate goods, services or messages not conducted, sold, or generated on the lot where the billboard is located. Billboards are significantly larger in size than other types of signage allowed in the township and their principal purpose is to dramatically attract the attention of the travelling public. The potential impact of a billboard on adjacent areas is significantly greater than other types of signage. Recently, more businesses desire to utilize advancements in technology which permit signs (including billboards) to change copy electronically (e.g., utilizing an LED or digital type of sign). These newer technologies exacerbate the potential impact of a billboard in terms of adversely dominating the environment in which they operate due to light spillover and light pollution, unless regulated in a reasonable fashion. The intent of this section is to establish size, location and operating standards and regulations for billboards, including addressing those utilizing these newer technologies, in order to minimize the secondary effects that can accompany the unregulated display of these types of signs, preserve the character and repose of adjacent areas (with a principal focus on residential neighborhoods), protect property values in all areas of the township, and reduce traffic and similar hazards caused by undue distractions. 
(b)  General requirements. 
(1)  For purposes of this section, the words "billboard", "digital sign" and "sign" shall have the same meaning as provided in the township's zoning ordinance, as amended from time to time. "Digital billboard" shall mean a billboard which incorporates, in whole or in part, a digital sign. 
(2)  Double-faced and V-type billboard structures in compliance with this subsection, shall be treated as a single billboard with multiple faces. Provided, however, no billboard shall contain more than one sign panel facing the same direction of traffic, including digital billboards, and there shall be no angle in excess of 75 degrees between sign panels. 
(3)  Billboard structures having more than one surface display area which are tandem (side-by-side) or stacked (one above the other) are considered two billboards and are prohibited. 
(4)  The installation or use of a billboard is permitted only to the extent authorized by, and subject to, the provisions of the township zoning ordinance as amended from time to time. 
(5)  No billboard may be installed or erected at any time when there are 20 or more existing billboards located in the township. 
(c)  Spacing. 
(1)  No more than three billboards may be located within any linear mile along a street, notwithstanding the fact that such billboards may be located on different sides of the street. This distance requirement shall include in its calculation any billboards located outside of the boundaries of the township. 
(2)  No billboard may be located within a radius of 1,000 feet of another billboard regardless of geographic jurisdiction or within 200 feet of residentially zoned property. Property zoned residential but identified as US-131 right of way shall not be treated as residential in calculating the minimum distance requirement. 
(3)  If a billboard is illuminated, the minimum distance from residentially zoned property shall be 300 feet. Property zoned residential but identified as US-131 right of way shall not be treated as residential in calculating the minimum distance requirement. 
(4)  No billboard may be located within 30 feet of a property line of the property on which the billboard is located. 
(5)  All distances as provided for in this section shall be measured radially from where the surface display area is visible. 
(6)  No billboard may be located on top of, cantilevered over or otherwise suspended above any building or structure. 
(d)  Billboard surface display area; measurement. 
(1)  The maximum allowable surface display area for a digital billboard is 672 square feet if the sign is within 100 feet of U.S. 131. The maximum allowable surface display area for all other billboards at any location is 300 square feet. 
(2)  The surface display area of a billboard shall be measured to include the entire area within a regular geometric form or combinations thereof comprising all of the display area of the billboard, including all of the elements of the matter displayed. Frames and structural members, excluding necessary supports or uprights, shall be included in computation of surface display area. In the case of a sphere, spheroid, or similarly shaped billboard (e.g. a ball), the total surface display area shall be divided by two for determining the maximum surface display area permitted. 
(e)  Height of billboards. The height of a billboard may not exceed 35 feet above the natural grade of the ground on which the billboard is located. 
(f)  Illumination. A billboard may be illuminated, provided such illumination is consistent with the requirements for a digital billboard as set forth herein, or is concentrated on the surface of the billboard and is located so as to avoid glare or reflection onto any portion of an adjacent street or highway, the path of oncoming vehicles or any adjacent premises. 
(g)  Appearance. Except for time and temperature signs or digital billboards as otherwise regulated herein, all billboards must be stationary and may not contain any visible moving parts, alternating or moving messages or have the appearance of having moving parts or messages. Under no circumstances may any type of billboard contain a message or display that appears to flash, undulate, pulse, move, or portray explosions, fireworks, flashes of light, or blinking lights or otherwise appears to move toward or away from the viewer, expand or contract, bounce, rotate, spin, twist or make other comparable movements. 
(h)  Construction and maintenance. A billboard shall be constructed in such a fashion that it will withstand all wind and vibration forces that can normally be expected to occur in the vicinity and in compliance with all applicable codes. A billboard shall be maintained so as to assure proper alignment of structure, continued structural soundness and continued readability of message. 
(i)  Display. 
(1)  The display or message on a digital billboard, of any type, may change no more frequently than once every eight seconds, with a transition period of one second or less. 
(2)  The display or message must otherwise comply with subsection (g) and the digital billboard must have installed an ambient light monitor which shall continuously monitor and automatically adjust the brightness level of the display based on ambient light conditions consistent with terms of this article. 
(3)  Maximum brightness levels for digital billboards shall not exceed 0.2 foot-candles over ambient light levels measured within 150 feet of the sign. Certification must be provided to the township demonstrating that the sign has been preset to automatically adjust the brightness to these levels or lower. Re-inspection and recalibration shall be annually required by the township, in its reasonable discretion, at the permittee's expense to ensure that the specified brightness levels are maintained at all times. 
(4)  Brightness of digital billboards shall be measured as follows: 
a.  At least 30 minutes following sunset, a foot candle meter shall be used to obtain an ambient light reading for the location. This is done while the sign is off or displaying black copy. The reading shall be made with the meter aimed directly at the sign area at the pre-set location. 
b.  The sign shall then be turned on to full white copy to take another reading with the meter at the same location. 
c.  If the difference between the readings is 0.2 foot candles or less, the brightness is properly adjusted. 
(j)  Other applicable laws. A billboard must comply with all applicable provisions of federal and state law. 
(k)  Permitting. Every billboard requires a township sign permit before installation or modification. Permits shall be reviewed and issued consistent with the terms of this section as well as all other applicable ordinances of the township including, without limitation, the township zoning ordinance as amended from time to time. Every applicant for a billboard permit shall file with the application a certificate of insurance, certifying that the applicant is insured against bodily injury and for property damage arising out of the erection, maintenance, repair, and replacement of the billboard. Each applicant, if the permit is granted, shall be required to maintain said insurance and keep a certificate of insurance currently effective on file with the township so long as the billboard or billboards are in existence. The certificate shall provide that the township shall receive ten days written notice in case of cancellation of the policy. Any billboard in violation of the insurance requirements of this section shall be removed immediately and the cost of such removal shall be charged against the owner of the billboard. 
(l)  Other requirements. Billboards must otherwise comply with all other relevant regulations and ordinances of the township. 
(Ord. No. 829, § 1, 6-7-2010; Ord. No. 841, §§ 1, 2, 6-6-2011; Ord. No. 854, § 1, 3-18-2013) 
Sec. 8-132. - Violations; penalties.

(b)  Each day a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense; and shall make the violator liable for the imposition of a fine and other penalties for each day of violation. 
(c)  The owner, co-owner and occupant(s) of any lot which is in violation of a provision of this article shall each be responsible for a municipal civil infraction and shall be subject to the fines, costs and orders as provided herein.

(f)  The rights and remedies provided are cumulative and are in addition to any other remedies provided by law. 
(g)  Nothing herein shall be interpreted to limit the authority of the township to revoke an approval previously granted due to any violations of this article, which right is expressly reserved.

DIVISION 3. - ADULT BUSINESSES 

Sec. 10-271. - Findings of fact. 
    The township board makes the following legislative findings based upon evidence concerning adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community incorporated by the U.S. Supreme Court in the cases of City of Renton v Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); studies conducted in other municipalities; the findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Business prepared by the Minnesota Attorney General and statistics obtained from various health departments. The board specifically finds that: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are often uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments; there must be in place a mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located. 
(3)  Sexual acts occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provided private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live shows. 
(4)  Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. 
(6)  Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses. 
(7)  The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact. 
(8)  According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(9)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(10)  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity including drug use and sales. 
(11)  These findings raise substantial governmental concerns and indicate that it is necessary for protection of the public health, safety and welfare to promulgate regulations for adult businesses. 
(12)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics, which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(13)  It is necessary and in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to promulgate regulations for sexually oriented businesses.

(b)  Designation of primary service area. Pursuant to the Agreement, the township has designated a primary emergency ground ambulance service area to the provider or providers listed in the agreement. The agreement contemplates periodic review of emergency ground ambulance service providers and the service areas to which they are primarily assigned. During this review process, it is possible for other emergency ground ambulance service providers to be authorized to act and to be assigned a primary service area.

(8)  Install or use a geothermal well for heating and cooling systems. 
(Ord. No. 820, § 1, 10-19-2009) 
Sec. 16-204. - Requirements and restrictions within the wellhead protection zone. 
(a)  The following requirements and restrictions apply to all facilities within the WHPZ regardless of the amount of regulated substances located at the facility. 
(1)  Soil and fill material. The use of soil or any other fill material containing regulated substances above any state and/or federal cleanup criteria for soils is prohibited. 
(2)  General purpose floor drains. General-purpose floor drains must be connected to a public sanitary sewer system or an onsite holding tank (not a septic system) in accordance with state, county, and township requirements. General-purpose floor drains that discharge to groundwater or a stormwater collection system are prohibited. Dry wells are prohibited. 
(3)  Well abandonment. When a well is plugged, formal well abandonment logs must be completed and provided to the township's public services department, except in cases where wells were abandoned in the past and no well abandonment logs are available. 
(4)  Commercial vehicle washing. Commercial vehicle washing shall be conducted on a wash pad. Wash areas for commercial vehicles must be paved with an impervious surface and bermed or curbed to prevent stormwater run-on and wash water runoff. The wash area shall be sloped for wash water collection, which may be discharged to a wash water recycling system, directly to the public sanitary sewer (with approval and appropriate pretreatment), or to a dead-end sump (from which the material may be pumped or hauled to the pubic sanitary sewer (with approval). Because wastewaters from vehicle washing represent significant flows that can hydraulically overload an oil/grit separator, any such treatment device must be sufficiently sized to accept these volumes. The wash pad areas shall be covered, if possible. The cleaning of semi-trailer and tanker truck interiors is prohibited, unless the following standards are met: 
a.  The interior of the semi-trailer is swept, and all debris is collected and properly disposed. If rinsing the inside of the trailer is necessary, cleaning shall be conducted over an impervious surface. Wash water must not be discharged to the storm sewer or the ground. With approval and appropriate pretreatment, rinse water may be disposed to the public sanitary sewer. 
b.  Wash water from the interior of tanker trucks or rail tankers shall be pumped directly into containers for appropriate offsite disposal or, with approval and appropriate pretreatment, must be pumped directly to a public sanitary sewer drain. Rail tankers may not be cleaned, unless the wash water can be completely contained and appropriately disposed. 
(5)  Pressure washing and steam cleaning. Pressure washing and steam cleaning related to industrial activities or uses are only permitted within covered, completely contained areas. Due to the possibility of generating runoff with high concentrations of pollutants, exterior pressure washing or steam cleaning of parts, vehicles, and other materials is not permitted. Pressure washing and steam cleaning may be conducted, if either is conducted on a sealed impervious surface that is completely contained and graded toward a drain that discharges either to the sanitary sewer (with approval and appropriate pretreatment) or a holding tank (not into the storm sewer or directly to site soils or groundwater). Alternatively, steam cleaning or pressure washing facilities may have zero-discharge recycling systems equipped with oil/water separators or other treatment devices. 
(6)  Cooling systems. Cooling systems shall be closed-looped to eliminate cooling water discharges. Discharge of cooling water to site soils/groundwater is prohibited without township approval. 
(7)  Salt piles. All salt and associated sand mix piles must be stored on an impermeable surface and covered with a waterproof material. Stockpiles shall not be located near surface waters, in flood plains, or areas with steep slopes, and shall be designed to prevent surface water runoff. Snow containing road salt shall not be brought to sites in the WHPZ for disposal. Environmentally friendly snow and ice removal products and procedures are encouraged. 
(8)  Aboveground storage tanks (ASTs). ASTs shall be certified, installed, operated, maintained, closed, or removed in accordance with MDEQ regulations and the township fire code. A copy of any required local or state AST registration document shall be provided to the township's public services department. 
All ASTs containing flammable or combustible materials must meet the requirements of the MDEQ Rules for the Storage and Handling of Flammable and Combustible Liquids. 
No ASTs shall be located in direct contact with site soils. The tank shall have sufficient ground clearance for visual inspection of the bottom of the AST for deterioration, unless the size of the AST prevents raising the tank, as required, or if the AST is a concrete-vaulted tank. 
Any AST that, due to its location is susceptible to vehicle damage must be protected against impact with physical barriers. Any impervious dike utilized as secondary containment meets the requirements for a physical barrier. 
For ASTs not subject to the MDEQ Rules for the Storage and Handling of Flammable and Combustible Liquids, the following conditions apply: 
a.  Regulated substances must have secondary containment meeting the standards of section 16-204(b)(8). 
b.  Tank piping shall be located within secondary containment whenever possible and must be located below the product level. 
c.  Piping shall be designed so that liquid will not continue to flow by gravity or siphoning from the storage tank if the piping or fittings break. 
d.  Tanks shall be equipped with a shut-off valve, preferably an automatic shear valve, with the shut-off located inside the tank. 
e.  For flood control, all exterior ASTs shall have a monitoring system and secondary standpipe above the 100-year flood-control level for monitoring and recovery. 
f.  Fill-pipe inlets shall be above the elevation of the top of the storage tank. 
g.  ASTs shall have overfill protection, such as a visual liquid-level-indicator gauge or alarms. 
(9)  Underground storage tanks (USTs). New USTs are prohibited, provided however, that a facility presently using USTs for fuel and lubricants for vehicle operations and fuel for building and/or processing heating shall be permitted to replace existing tanks with those constructed and installed pursuant to the specifications of Part 211 of NREPA and all other applicable laws, rules and regulations, the replacements not to exceed the capacity of existing tanks. Replacement of USTs for other than the above referenced fuels and lubricants is prohibited. 
All existing USTs must conform to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to, EPA, MDEQ, and township fire code requirements. 
(10)  Solid-waste dumpsters. Solid-waste dumpsters must have lids and be stored on a paved surface, unless otherwise approved by the township. 
(11)  Scrap metal dumpsters/drums. Dumpsters and drums containing scrap metal that may contain residual chemicals or oils shall be stored on an impervious surface in an enclosed area or covered with an impervious liner to prevent accumulation of stormwater, whenever possible. Where stormwater may otherwise accumulate in the scrap metal collection units, drain plugs shall be left in place to prevent discharge onto the ground. If necessary, such collection units shall be located on an impervious surface with a separate collection catch basin containing an oil/grit separator that discharges to the public sanitary sewer (with prior approval and pretreatment) or a holding tank. 
(12)  No fertilizers, herbicides or pesticides shall be applied on any embankments of either Versluis Lake or the Coit Avenue Gravel Pit or that portion of any adjacent area that slopes towards and drains into either Versluis Lake or the Coit Avenue Gravel Pit. 
(b)  The following requirements and restrictions apply only to those facilities that possess, use, process, store or generate regulated substances, including fuels (e.g. gasoline, diesel, kerosene, etc.), exceeding 55 gallons aggregate for liquid materials or 440 pounds aggregate for dry weights at any given time. 
(1)  Inventory list. A facility that has regulated substances in quantities exceeding 55 gallons aggregate for liquids and/or 440 pounds aggregate for solids on site shall keep an inventory list that identifies all regulated substances stored at the facility in containers exceeding either ten pounds for liquids or 100 pounds for solids. For each regulated substance, the inventory list shall identify the type of storage container, storage location(s), and typical and maximum storage quantities in each storage location. The facility shall maintain a file of current material safety data sheets (MSDS) that includes the hazardous components and percentage by weight of each regulated substance on the inventory list. This MSDS file shall be readily accessible in the event of an emergency. The MSDS file and the inventory required hereunder shall be made available to the township upon request. 
(2)  Floor surfaces. Floor surfaces in work areas shall be impervious to regulated substances that may be used or generated at the facility and, if necessary, shall be sealed with an impermeable material. The work area floor shall be pitched to an appropriate floor drain or collection area (e.g., holding tank). Alternatively, if floor drains are not used, or if they are located close to entranceways, then entrances shall be designed to prevent stormwater runoff from entering the building and prevent spills from leaving the building. Curbing and internal floor berms shall be used to isolate floor drains from spill-prone areas, where necessary. 
(3)  Location of manufacturing/processing activities. Whenever possible, manufacturing and processing activities involving the possession or control of regulated substances shall be conducted indoors. If indoor manufacturing/processing is not feasible, the potentially pollutant-generating activities shall be segregated from nonpolluting activities and conducted on an impervious surface. The area shall be covered, if possible and as appropriate. The surface shall be graded to minimize run-on of stormwater and runoff of spills. The area must be adequately designed to prevent spilled regulated materials from escaping the area. Drains in these areas can be connected to the public sanitary sewer, with approval by the public services department and appropriate pretreatment, or to a holding tank meeting the specifications of this article. If potentially polluting activities cannot be covered, discharge of low-volume, high-frequency storms to the sanitary sewer may be allowed, with prior approval and pretreatment. 
(4)  Loading/unloading areas. Loading/unloading areas shall be paved with concrete or another material sufficiently impervious to the materials loaded and unloaded in that area. Loading/unloading docks shall be isolated from storm drains and dry wells to prevent potential spills from contaminating stormwater or discharging to the ground. If stormwater runoff in the loading/unloading dock is a possibility, the area shall be designed to reduce stormwater run-on, and if not covered or enclosed, grading and/or berms shall direct drainage to a dead-end sump or another appropriate collection device. A positive control valve shall be installed on the drain. Alternatively, at the discretion of the director of public services, a precipitation valve may be installed in the curb, which may be left open to drain precipitation, except during loading/unloading. If tanker trucks are used to load/unload ASTs or USTs containing regulated substances, full containment of the loading/unloading area shall be required. The storage of spill response equipment required by this article or any federal, state or local law or regulation shall be in an area accessible to loading/unloading areas where regulated substances are transferred. 
(5)  Emergency spill response equipment. Facilities shall have emergency spill response equipment. Spill response equipment shall be located throughout the site so that spills may be contained in storage areas, loading/unloading areas, dispensing areas, and work areas, as appropriate. The specific types of spill response equipment to be stored shall reflect the types of regulated substances stored onsite, other engineering controls present, the potential threat to site soils/groundwater, and the location of the site within the WHPZ. 
(6)  Regulated substance storage units. Regulated substance storage units containing greater than 55 gallons for liquids or 440 pounds for solids are prohibited unless they are completely contained, isolated from floor and storm drains, have sealed surfaces, comply with fire safety regulations, and are not accessible to unauthorized personnel. Whenever possible, such regulated substance storage units shall be consolidated into one location for better control of material and waste inventory. All such regulated substances storage units shall be properly labeled as to contents and periodically inspected for evidence of leaks, improper storage, or potential hazards that may result in a release of regulated substances being stored in or transferred into or out of the storage unit. All doors, valves, or other openings through which a release could occur must be locked or otherwise secured when not in use. 
(7)  Storage locations. Regulated substances shall be stored inside, whenever feasible. If it is not feasible, outside storage areas shall be covered, preferably with a roof. A curb or berm shall be required along the perimeter of outdoor storage areas to prevent the run-on of uncontaminated stormwater from adjacent areas, as well as runoff of stormwater from the storage area. The area inside the curb shall slope to a drain, then to a holding tank or public sanitary sewer (if approved) with a positive control such as a lock, valve, or plug. 
Regulated substances stored outdoors must be in product-tight containers that are protected from weather, leakage, accidental damage, and vandalism. Facilities storing regulated substances outdoors must implement security measures that are appropriate for the material stored and the nature of the facility. Measures to be implemented, as appropriate, include: 
a.  Fencing the regulated substance storage unit or the entire site and locking or guarding entrance gates when the storage unit/facility is not in production or is unattended. 
b.  Ensuring that valves permitting direct outward flow of a container's contents have adequate security measures so they remain in the closed position when in non-operating or standby status. 
c.  Preventing unauthorized access to starter controls of pumps. 
d.  Providing facility lighting that will assist in the discovery of releases during hours of darkness and prevention of discharges occurring through acts of vandalism. 
(8)  Secondary containment. Secondary containment must be provided for regulated substance storage units containing regulated substances other than fuel. Secondary containment facilities shall be designed and constructed so that potential polluting material cannot escape from the unit by gravity through sewers, drains, or other means directly or indirectly into a sewer or stormwater collection system or to the waters of the state, including groundwater. Secondary containment shall include protective measures, such as double walls, dikes, vaults, or impervious liners (both natural and synthetic). 
Exterior secondary containment provided by dikes shall be constructed of poured concrete or a pre-manufactured containment tub. Secondary containment shall not be constructed of concrete-block due to its greater susceptibility to cracking and weathering. Exterior secondary-containment areas shall be capable of containing 100 percent of the largest vessel or ten percent of the total volume of tanks in containment, whichever is larger, plus freeboard to contain precipitation from a 25-year storm. Alternatively, the vessel may be an Underwriters Laboratories, Inc.-approved, double-walled tank. If containment is provided by a dike, the containment must be higher than the 100-year flood level. When possible and as appropriate, exterior storage of regulated substances and their containment structures shall be covered to protect the containers from exposure to precipitation. If this is not possible, the base of the dike shall be sloped to a collection point or sump to allow for controlled removal of accumulated stormwater or spilled regulated substances. If the dike is penetrated by a drainage or conveyance pipe, the opening must be sealed on both sides to ensure a liquid-tight penetration. Drainage pipes must have a lockable valve. This valve must be kept closed and locked under normal conditions, until a determination is made by a trained individual that the discharge of the stormwater is acceptable according to federal, state and local regulations. Discharge of accumulated stormwater from a secondary-containment structure containing petroleum products shall be pre-treated, as necessary, to meet all applicable water quality standards prior to discharge to soils, surface water, or a stormwater collection system. 
Secondary containment for indoor ASTs may be provided by the building, as long as discharge from the AST cannot escape the building via floor drains, entrances, or any other means, and no specific containment is required by other regulations. Although not permitted for outdoor containment structures, concrete-block containment may be used indoors with the township's written approval. 
(9)  Floor drains. Floor drains shall discharge to holding tanks, if they are located where public sanitary sewers are not available, subsurface disposal systems are failing, or they are higher-risk facilities located in the WHPZ. Holding tanks shall adhere to the requirements for ASTs and USTs, including secondary containment, unless otherwise approved by the township. 
(10)  Regulated substances in trucks, rail cars, etc. The possession of regulated substances in trucks, trailers, tanker trucks, rail cars, tool cribs, or similar vehicles is prohibited unless otherwise allowed by this article and unless secondary containment is provided that is sufficient to contain the entire contents of the largest distinct compartment of the container. 
(11)  Hazardous waste. Hazardous waste management techniques must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements. When possible, hazardous-waste-generating operations at a facility shall be physically segregated from other operations. Work areas and all storage areas containing hazardous waste shall be located within a containment area with appropriately sealed floors and no direct access outside the facility. 
(12)  Open liquid-waste ponds. Open liquid-waste ponds are prohibited.

ARTICLE VIII. - WASTEWATER POND USE 

Sec. 16-251. - Authority. 
    Michigan townships have been delegated the right to adopt ordinances regulating the public health, safety and general welfare of persons and property within the township. See MCL § 42.15. 
(Ord. No. 849, art. 1, 11-5-2012) 
Sec. 16-252. - Purpose. 
    The Coit Avenue Pit ("CAP") and its shoreline area is an approximately 38-acre area within a 50-acre parcel located along the Grand River and bordered by industrial and commercial property within the township. In 1988, the state approved the use of the CAP for the deposit of the water softening residuals from the water treatment plant ("WTP") of the township. The state concluded that the CAP was "not a waters of the state" as that term is used in R 323.2203(g) and R 323.1205(p), which regulation was enacted by the state pursuant to the Water Resources Protection Act, Part 31, being MCL § 324.13101 et seq. ("state decision").The state's decision was based on its conclusion that the CAP's use for WTP softening residuals, which contain lime and other nondeleterious material, would make it a "pond used exclusively for wastewater conveyance, treatment, or control." The effect of the state decision was that the CAP was not a regulated pond under the Water Resources Protection Act or the federal Clean Water Act, meaning its use for WTP softening residuals did not require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permit. 
    Beginning in 1989 and during all times since and in direct reliance on the state's 1988 decision, the township's WTP has been using the CAP exclusively for WTP softening residuals conveyance, treatment and control. 
    In addition to the CAP, there may be other ponds within the borders of the township that are used exclusively for wastewater conveyance, treatment or control and are not regulated by the state under the Water Resources Protection Act or United States under the Clean Water Act. 
    The purpose of this article is to fulfill the responsibilities of the township to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare in wastewater ponds that are not waters of the state or United States, through the imposition of local restrictions that are designed to ensure that the singular use of the wastewater ponds is preserved; that waste materials in such ponds are not distributed, disturbed, or displaced from their intended deposit; and that persons are not accidentally exposed to the waste materials within these affected areas. 
(Ord. No. 849, art. 2, 11-5-2012) 
Sec. 16-253. - Definitions. 
    In addition to the adoption of the terms shall have the following terms shall have the meanings described in this article:

The CAP and its surrounding area, which is 38 acres of the parcel described in exhibit A to Ord. No. 849, is found to be one affected area in the township. 
    Authorized township officer means the township supervisor, superintendent, manager, community development director, or ordinance enforcement officer. 
    Board means the Plainfield Board of Trustees. 
    CAP means the pond commonly known as the "Coit Avenue Gravel Pit" and is surrounding environs as identified herein. 
    Facilities or fixtures means all structures of the affected area that are used in wastewater conveyance, treatment, or control. 
    MDEQ means the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality or its successor. 
    Ordinance means this wastewater pond use article. 
    Person means any individual or legal body corporate. 
    Sheriff means the elected sheriff of Kent County, including any of his or her officers and authorized and sworn deputies. 
    Township means The Charter Township of Plainfield. 
    USEPA means the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
    Wastewater pond means a drainage way and/or pond used solely or exclusively for wastewater conveyance, treatment, or control as those terms are used in R 323.2203(g) and R 323.1205(p). 
(Ord. No. 849, art. 3, 11-5-2012)

The permissible depth of a parcel created by land division or boundary change shall be measured within the boundaries of each parcel from the abutting road right of way to the most remote boundary line point of the parcel from the point of commencement of the measurement. The permissible minimum width shall be as defined in the zoning ordinance. Upon application to the township board, the township board may, in its sole discretion, grant a greater width to depth ratio based on the following factors: 
a.  Exceptional topographic or physical conditions with respect to the parcel and compatibility with surrounding lands. 
b.  Whether a greater depth to width ratio will detrimentally affect adjacent property and materially impair the intent and purpose of this article. 
c.  Whether the request for greater depth to width ratio is self-created. 
d.  Whether an alternative exist which meets this article's requirements. 
e.  The township board may impose reasonable conditions to any variation from the depth to width ratio requirements, including the requirement that the applicant permanently preserve in an undeveloped state that portion of a parcel exceeding the lot length time's width requirement.

a.  Utility easements in accordance with but not wholly subject to the township master plan; and/or 
b.  Each resulting parcel that is a development site have adequate easements for public utilities from the parcel to existing public utility facilities. 
(6)  Approval of a division or a boundary change is not a determination that the resulting parcels comply with other ordinances or regulations. 
(Ord. No. 773, § VI, 10-17-2005) 
Sec. 28-217. - Allowance for approval of other land divisions or boundary changes.

The township board may grant a variance from the requirements of this article upon a finding, from reasonable evidence, that the following conditions exist: 
(1)  That authorizing a variance will not be of substantial detriment to neighboring property and will not materially impair the intent and purposes of this article. The possibility of increased financial return shall not of itself be deemed sufficient to warrant a variance. 
(2)  That the condition or situation for which the variance is sought is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formation of a general regulation for such condition or situation. 
(3)  That by reason of exceptional narrowness in width or length, or exceptional shape of a parcel on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary situation or condition of the land or of the use or development of property immediately adjoining the property in question, the literal enforcement of the requirements of this article would involve practical difficulties or would cause undue hardship.

(2)  Flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the township and the region; 
(3)  Land development projects and activities alter the hydrologic response of watersheds resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, increased flooding, increased stream channel erosion, and increased sediment transport and deposition; 
(4)  Stormwater runoff produced by land development contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants; 
(5)  Increases of stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and non-point source pollutants have occurred in the past as a result of land development, and constitute deterioration of the water resources of the township and downstream municipalities; 
(6)  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and non-point source pollution, due to land development activities within the township, have resulted in a deterioration of the water resources of the township and downstream municipalities; 
(7)  Increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the township will, absent reasonable regulation and control, adversely affect the township's streams and water resources, and the streams and water resources of downstream municipalities, and they exacerbate existing adverse conditions; 
(8)  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and non-point source pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of stormwater runoff from development projects; 
(9)  The isolated construction of one- or two-family residential structures often, but not always, results in significantly less stormwater runoff, and the negative impacts associated with stormwater runoff, than other types of construction activities when those residential structures are constructed on platted lots or site condominium units for which stormwater review has already occurred or on parcels equal to or larger than one acre. 
(10)  Adopting the standards, criteria and procedures contained in this article and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of stormwater runoff identified in this section; 
(11)  The direct connection fee and the fee for the operation and maintenance costs of drains represent the proportional benefit received by the parcels against which the fees are assessed from the stormwater systems that accomplish the purposes of this article; and, 
(12)  Adopting these standards is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and welfare.

(2)  To minimize increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes from identified new land development; 
(3)  To minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses, culverts and bridges, and other structures; 
(4)  To encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically favorable conditions exist; 
(5)  To prevent an increase in non-point source pollution; 
(6)  To maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological functions, as well as for drainage and other purposes; 
(7)  To minimize the impact of development upon stream bank and stream bed stability; 
(8)  To reduce erosion from development or construction projects; 
(9)  To preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by means of controlling increased flood discharges, stream erosion, and runoff pollution; and, 
(10)  To reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and non-point source pollution, wherever practicable, from lands that were developed without stormwater management controls meeting the purposes and standards of this article.

(1)  The sum of: 
a.  The township's actual costs (including administrative, planning, and design costs), incurred on or after January 1, 1999, for any publicly-owned infrastructure that comprises a drain that the direct connection will utilize; and 
b.  The township's estimated costs (including administrative, planning, and design costs) of publicly-owned infrastructure that the stormwater master plan anticipates will be constructed if the land in a drainage basin is developed; and 
(2)  A fraction, the numerator of which is the estimated stormwater runoff for the development site, and the denominator of which is the combined estimated stormwater runoff of those parcels that utilize a direct connection to the drainage basin and that are or could be developed after the effective date of this ordinance, based upon the types of uses and density permitted in accordance with the township's zoning ordinance. 
(b)  A developer may agree to a voluntary special assessment roll providing that, at such future time as the township constructs new infrastructure for a drain the direct connection utilizes, which infrastructure was not identified in the stormwater master plan at the time the township issued a stormwater permit for a development, the owner of a parcel directly connected to the drain, which parcel was first developed after the effective date of this article, shall pay a direct connection fee to the township, calculated using the formula described in subsection (a), based on the actual costs (including administrative and design costs) of the new infrastructure. Any such special assessment roll shall be recorded with the county register of deeds. 
(c)  A developer shall not be required to pay a direct connection fee if the developer has previously paid its proportional share of the costs of the publicly owned infrastructure upon which the direct connection fee is based. The developer shall have the option of having the direct connection fee calculated, in the case of a phased development project, based on each phase proposed for development or for the entire project. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as relieving a developer of its obligation to pay a direct connection fee for any new development occurring on a development site after the effective date of this article.

Sec. 28-341. - Development not automatically subject to divisions 2 and 4. 
    As to the construction of or an addition to: 
(1)  A single-family detached residential structure; 
(2)  A two-family detached residential structure; or 
(3)  An accessory building that requires a building permit and located on a residential development site of a single-family and two-family detached residential structure, 
the township or its designee may require the developer to comply with one or more of the requirements of divisions 2 and 4 if it is determined by the township superintendent that stormwater management measures are necessary. No later than 15 days after the developer submits to the township an application for a building permit, the superintendent shall determine whether to impose any of the requirements of divisions 2 and 4, and shall within the same time period inform the developer that compliance with one or more of the requirements of divisions 2 and 4 may be required. Thereafter, the township shall determine what, if any, requirements shall be imposed. Any of the requirements of divisions 2 and 4 that are imposed may be relaxed if the superintendent determines that full compliance with the requirement is unnecessary or over burdensome. No occupancy permit shall be issued until all of the requirements imposed are satisfied and completed or the developer has submitted a performance bond in an amount determined by the township superintendent necessary to cover the cost of the remaining requirements. 
    If, after the issuance of a building permit, the builder, developer, property owner or any of their agents create conditions that adversely affect area drainage, whether or not a storm water management permit has been required or issued, the township may issue a "stop work" order on the building permit and/or withhold a certificate of occupancy until the drainage conditions have been satisfied in a manner that is satisfactory to the township. 
    The township may record on individual parcels of property in the township documentation identifying said parcels to include probable drainage issues that may arise in conjunction with their development. This will have the effect of serving notice on current and future owners of said parcels that drainage issues may exist that would prevent the issuance of building permits or filling or grading that could have a detrimental effect on the property or neighboring property.

(Comp. Ords. 1988, § 91.003) 
Sec. 32-33. - Sidewalk construction required. 
(a)  At the time construction of a new principal building or at the time any principal building is expanded on a lot, parcel or unit that abuts a public street or private road, sidewalks shall be constructed as may be specified in the township zoning ordinance, subdivision control regulations set out in chapter 28, article II, the site condominium regulations set out in chapter 28, article III, or as may be specified in the township "sidewalk plan."

(Comp. Ords. 1988, § 91.004; Ord. No. 730, § 4, 2-24-2003) 
Sec. 32-34. - Waiver or indefinite postponement of sidewalk construction. 
(a)  If the township board determines that no useful purpose would be served by requiring sidewalks because of the remote location of the development relative to more densely developed areas or because it seems very unlikely that the required sidewalk will be directly linked with a future extension of the sidewalk, the sidewalk requirement may (i) be modified to require sidewalks on only one side of the street or the township board may waive sidewalk requirements entirely; or (ii) authorize a postponement of required sidewalk construction. In connection with new site condominiums and new subdivisions, a waiver shall only be granted when the average width of the lots or units measured at the building setback lines exceeds 100 feet and only after the planning commission has made its recommendation to the township board. 
(b)  Where the township board authorizes an indefinite postponement of required sidewalk construction, the owner of the property over which the sidewalk construction is to be required shall, as a condition of postponement, enter into an agreement with the township that allows the postponement contingent upon the township requiring sidewalk construction at a later date, said agreement or covenant to run with the land. At such later indeterminate date, the owner of the subject parcel shall upon written notice from the township, construct the required sidewalk within 90 days of said notice unless a longer period of time is granted. 
(c)  When considering the requirements to construct a sidewalk that has been postponed as permitted by this section, the township board may consider the following factors, as well as any other relevant factors: (i) nearby commercial development, (ii) increased density of housing in the vicinity, (iii) the subsequent location of schools, churches, or other noncommercial uses in the area, and (iv) the need to link existing sidewalks that have been extended to locations within a quarter mile of the subject property. These conditions may be considered but shall not be a requirement for terminating the sidewalk construction postponement. 
(d)  In lieu of requesting a postponement by the township board, a property owner, except in the case of new site condominiums and new subdivisions, may request of the township manager or superintendent and the township manager or superintendent may grant a postponement of sidewalks provided an agreement as described in this section is entered into with the township. The township manager or superintendent shall notify the township board of each decision to grant or deny a postponement. A decision by the township manager or superintendent to deny a postponement shall not prohibit the property owner from petitioning the township board for a postponement in the manner described in this section. 
(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a postponement of or variances from the requirement to construct a sidewalk may also be authorized by the township board where the board determines that a strict application of such requirements would result in practical difficulties, including, but not limited to, severe variations in topography, unsuitable soils, or difficulty in providing safe separation between pedestrian and vehicular traffic due to site location, layout, or existing building arrangements.

(b)  Whenever the township manager or superintendent or his designated agent shall determine that a sidewalk is in a state of disrepair or is obstructed, a notice shall be sent by first class mail to the owner of the adjacent lot or parcel to repair or remove obstructions from the sidewalk. The notice shall specify the time period within which such work shall be completed.

ARTICLE V. - VIDEO SERVICE PROVIDER RIGHT-OF-WAY MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 34-150. - Purpose. 
(a)  Under the Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act, video service providers may obtain a franchise to provide video services in the municipality using a standardized, uniform form of franchise agreement established by the MPSC. This form includes the right to use the public right-of-way to provide such service but does not contain right-of-way management and related provisions. One of the municipality's cable operators has obtained such a standardized, uniform form of franchise agreement. 
(b)  The municipality's cable television consent agreement with another of its current cable operators predates the Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and has right-of-way management and related provisions. However, that Act states that as of January 1, 2007, "any provisions" of such an agreement "that are inconsistent with or in addition to" the standardized, uniform form of franchise agreement established by the MPSC "are unreasonable and unenforceable by the franchising entity." 
(c)  Telecommunications providers who obtain a standardized, uniform form of franchise agreement generally will have previously obtained from the municipality a permit under the Metro Act to construct and maintain their telecommunications facilities in the public right-of-way. Such Metro Act permits set forth the terms and conditions for such right-of-way usage, standard forms of such permits were agreed to in a collaborative process between municipalities and providers that was initiated by the MPSC, and such standard forms have since been approved by the legislature and the MPSC. 
(d)  Because telecommunications providers typically provide video services over combined video and telecommunications facilities, such Metro Act permits generally provide adequate public right-of-way related protections for the municipality and the public when such providers are providing video services. 
(e)  Other video service providers, in particular new providers or existing cable operators, may not have a Metro Act Permit issued by the the municipality. 
(f)  The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized, uniform franchise agreement require video service providers with such an agreement to comply with all valid and enforceable local regulations regarding the use and occupation of the public right-of-way in the delivery of video services, including the police powers of the franchising entity, and makes such right-of-way usage subject to the laws of the state and the police powers of the franchising entity. 
(g)  The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized, uniform franchise agreement state that franchising entities shall provide video service providers with open, comparable, nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral access to the public right-of-way, and may not discriminate against a video service provider for the authorization or placement of a video service or communications network in the public right-of-way. 
(h)  The Michigan Constitution reserves reasonable control of their highways, streets, alleys and public places to local units of government, which may exercise such authority through the use of their police powers. 
(i)  The purpose of this article is to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare and exercise reasonable control over the public right-of-way by regulating the use and occupation of such rights-of-way by video service providers who lack a Metro Act Permit from the the municipality. This article does so by setting forth terms and conditions for such usage and occupation from the forms of Metro Act permit approved by the MPSC and approved by the legislature in section 6(1) of the Metro Act, thus providing open, comparable, nondiscriminatory, and competitively neutral access to the public right-of-way and not discriminating against a video service provider for the authorization or placement of a video service or communications network in public right-of-way.

(a)  A base charge, (minimum charge for each billing cycle) shall be payable by every user of the system. The base charge shall be an amount determined from time to time by resolution of the township board. 
    The base charge shall be based on the number of residential equivalent units (REUs) assigned to the premises and shall be payable at whatever intervals may be determined to be the billing cycle. If, due to a change in use, the number of REUs assigned to a premises based on a prior use is higher or lower than the REUs assigned to a current use occupancy or using the premises, the base charge shall be calculated based on the current use of the property. 
    Beginning with the first complete quarterly billing period that ends on or after December 31, 2016, the base charge shall be based on the meter equivalent factor corresponding to the water meter size servicing the premises and shall be payable at whatever intervals may be determined to be the billing cycle. If a customer makes changes to the use or plumbing of the building in such a manner to increase or decrease the meter size, the base charge shall be calculated using the new applicable meter equivalent factor. 
(b)  The township board may impose a base surcharge in addition to the standard base charge for services provided to areas in other municipalities as may be agreed upon between the township board and such other municipalities. 
(Comp. Ords. 1988, § 87.443; Ord. No. 736, § 4.3, 3-17-2003; Ord. No. 763, § 3, 9-7-2004; Ord. No. 834, § 3, 2-7-2011; Ord. No. 2016-874, § 1, 8-15-2016)

Sec. 38-97. - Connection charge and connection surcharge. 
(a)  Each user requesting service from the system shall pay a connection charge to the township based on the meter equivalent factor corresponding to the water meter size servicing the premises. Said connection charge shall be reviewed from time to time to ensure that it reflects payment in recognition of the cost of previous improvements for past water production, treatment, and other system components. The connection charge established per meter equivalent factor shall be an amount determined by the township board by resolution. 
(b)  In addition to the connection charge imposed by this section, the township board may impose additional charges known as connection fee surcharges based on the meter equivalent factor corresponding to the water meter size servicing the premises for the purposes of recouping additional costs specific to certain new or expanded areas of the system and not included in the connection charge. The connection surcharges established per meter equivalent factor shall be amounts determined by the township board by resolution. When establishing a connection fee surcharge, the township board shall specify the area or areas of the system to be covered by the connection surcharge. A connection surcharge imposed by this section shall be paid in the same manner and at the same time as the connection charge. 
(c)  When an existing water customer changes its facilities or operations to result in an increase in the size of the water meter servicing the premises, an additional connection charge (and connection surcharge where applicable) shall be imposed based on the increase in the new meter equivalent factor. 
(d)  For any new connection to the system, the connection charge (and any connection surcharge) imposed in this section shall be paid at the time a construction or building permit is issued. In the case of an increase in the size of the water meter servicing the premises based on a change in facilities or operations pursuant to subsection 38-97(c), the connection charge (and connection surcharge where applicable) shall be paid at the time a construction or building permit is issued or upon commencement of the new operation, whichever occurs first. If the township determines that the water meter size cannot be determined at the time a building permit is issued, the connection charge (and any applicable connection surcharge) shall be calculated based on the estimated water meter size, with any adjustment to said charges based on the size of the water meter actually installed being paid prior to any occupancy permit being issued. 
Notwithstanding the forgoing, as to non-residential premises, payment of the connection charge (and any applicable connection surcharge) may, at the township's option, be paid over a period of time not to exceed five years if the appropriate parties enter into a written agreement approved by the township board allowing such charges to be paid over a period of time. Such agreement may (i) require one or more forms of financial guarantees to ensure payment; (ii) provide for certain penalties upon default including, but not limited to, discontinuation of services, cessation of business activities requiring the increase in the water meter size, and revocation of any unpaid meter equivalent factor allocations to the premises; (iii) charge interest on the deferred charges; and (iv) include any other provisions deemed appropriate by the township board. Nothing herein shall prevent the township from creating a special assessment district to allow payments to be made over a period of time.

The discharger served by a grease trap shall arrange for and carry out the inspection, cleaning and maintenance of the device by a licensed qualified contractor and shall submit to the township or its designee, within ten days of the inspection, cleaning, and maintenance, a report of such inspection, cleaning and maintenance on a form approved by or acceptable to the township, and signed by the contractor and thereafter repeat this inspection, cleaning, maintenance and reporting every 60 days. The discharger shall accomplish said reporting by requiring the contractor to forward a copy of his receipt and statement of services rendered directly to the township or its designee. The receipt and statement must state: 
1.  The condition of the operation ("adequate" or "inadequate"); 
2.  Whether the inlet and outlet of the grease trap was open or closed; 
3.  Whether the grease trap and appurtenances require jetting and whether this service was refused, and 
4.  What services were rendered. 
f.  The township or its designee, in its sole discretion, may determine that conditions on the premises of a user require cleaning and/or maintenance more often or less often than every 60 days. Said determination shall be in writing and signed by the township or its designee. 
g.  Regular grease trap pumping and cleaning requires pumping out all liquids and solids and not leaving any pumpable material remaining in the trap. 
h.  No decanted liquid from the pumped grease trap shall be returned to the grease trap. 
i.  An administrative charge, in an amount established by resolution of the township board, shall be levied against a discharger for each month or portion of a month following the date by which the required report is not submitted. Failure to provide the report or failure to pay any administrative charge shall be grounds for disconnection of the premises by turning off the public water supply or other means, in addition to all other remedies provided by law and ordinance. 
j.  In the event that the licensed contractor fails to provide the required report, and notice of said failure is provided to the owner of the premises, the township or its designee shall accept written evidence of the services provided from the owner, in the form of a copy of the inspection and report of services provided by the licensed contractor. Said written evidence must be provided within ten business days of the first class mailing of the notice. 
(3)  Sand traps and similar interceptors for removal of heavy solids by commercial users, as determined by the director, shall be designed and installed, according to the township design specifications. They shall be located as to be readily accessible for cleaning and shall have a water seal of not less than six inches. Sand traps and similar interceptors shall be cleaned and maintained in accordance with a schedule as submitted to, and approved by, the director. Proof of maintenance and cleaning shall be sent to the director on an annual basis or as approved in the maintenance schedule. 
(4)  Oil/water separators are required at repair garages, gasoline stations with grease racks, grease pits or work racks and at factories, or other facilities, where oily and flammable liquid wastes are produced, separators shall be installed into which all oil-bearing, grease-bearing or flammable wastes shall be discharged before emptying in the building drainage system or other point of disposal. Oil separators shall have a depth of not less than two feet below the invert of the discharge drain. The outlet opening of the separator shall not have less than an 18-inch water seal. An alternative design may be approved by the plumbing inspector for the township, as provided for by the plumbing code. Oil/water separators shall be cleaned and maintained in accordance with a schedule as submitted to, and approved by, the director. Proof of maintenance and cleaning shall be sent to the director on an annual basis or as approved in the maintenance schedule. 
(b)  No discharger shall introduce into the POTW any pollutant(s) which cause pass through or interference. In addition to all other applicable federal, state or local pretreatment standards, prohibitions or requirements (including those of the sewage treatment facility that treats the sewage), the following general and specific standards, prohibitions and requirements of this section apply to each discharger introducing pollutants into the POTW: 
(1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Centigrade using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
(2)  Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts that will cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW or results in interference. 
(3)  Pollutants which cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW, but in no case discharges with a pH lower than 6.5 or a pH greater than 10.0. These pH limits will be evaluated annually as part of the rate study and the limits set forth in this division will be revised as deemed necessary. 
(4)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitutes a hazard to humans or animals or exceed the limitations set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. 
(5)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which either singly, or by interaction, are capable of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(6)  Any substance which, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, may cause a violation of the applicable NPDES permit or any applicable state or federal water quality standards or interferes with any treatment process, or causes treatment residues, sludge or scum, to be unsuitable for reclamation or reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under section 405 of the Clean Water Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act or State standards applicable to the sludge management method being used. 
(7)  Any substance with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(8)  Heat in amounts that will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but, in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature, at the headworks of the POTW, exceeds 40 degrees Centigrade (104 degrees Fahrenheit) unless the MDEQ, upon the request of the POTW, approves the alternative temperature limits. 
(9)  Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference with the POTW. 
(10)  Any unpolluted water including, but not limited to, non-contact cooling water, unless a discharge authorization is approved by the director. 
(11)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration, except as set forth in 10 CFR part 20. Introduction of radioactive wastes that interfere with the operation of the POTW including, but not limited to, the use and disposal of sludge, the recycling of any and all waste products, or if the discharge causes the POTW to violate any local, state or federal laws. 
(12)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. 
(13)  Any discharge of petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, animal fat, vegetable fat, oil, grease, products of mineral oil or any combination thereof at a concentration of greater than 100 milligrams per liter, unless it can be demonstrated that matrix interference is responsible for levels greater than this amount, but, in no case in amounts that will cause an obstruction, interference or pass through in the POTW. 
(14)  Any substances not identified in (13) above, that will become solid or viscous after entering the POTW. 
(15)  Any effluent having an average daily flow greater than two percent of the POTW's average daily flow. The director, upon review, may approve greater discharges subject to conditions as authorized by this division or special conditions he/she deems necessary in order to preserve and protect public health, safety and welfare, subject to conformance with the applicable federal and state law.

(17)  Any detectable level of mercury using EPA Method 245.1 with a detection limit not to exceed 0.2 ug/l unless the user can demonstrate that matrix interference prevents the attainment of this level. In the event that mercury is detected the user shall develop and implement a mercury elimination plan including elements deemed necessary by the director to progress toward the goal of no detectable discharge of mercury. For users whose operation and discharge characteristics are substantially similar a group mercury elimination plan may be acceptable. 
(18)  There shall be no discharge to the POTW of groundwater that has been contaminated with gasoline and related petroleum products that would qualify for a state general discharge permit for gasoline and related petroleum products in accordance with Rule 2191 promulgated pursuant to Act 451, of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1994, as amended, Part 31, except where no other discharge option exists. If discharge to the POTW is desired under these conditions, the discharger must submit a wastewater discharge permit application to the operator of the sewage treatment facility to which said contaminants would flow for approval. The director shall also approve in writing the wastewater discharge permit before any wastewater discharge is permitted into the system. 
(19)  Disposal of septic tank waste into the POTW is prohibited except that the disposal of portable containers of domestic waste including waste from recreational vehicles is permitted upon the written approval of both the director and the operator of the sewage treatment facility to which the waste would flow. 
(20)  Sludge from an industrial or commercial pretreatment system shall not be placed into the POTW. Such sludge shall be disposed of by a licensed hauler in a site approved by the MDEQ.

Secs. 38-179, 38-180. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 819, § 1, adopted September 8, 2009, amended the Code by repealing former §§ 38-179 and 38-180 in their entirety. Former § 38-179 pertained to limitations on wastewater strength, and derived from Ord. No. 781, adopted February 6, 2006. Former § 38-180 pertained to permits, and derived from Ord. No. 781, adopted February 6, 2006. 
Sec. 38-181. - Enforcement, violations, penalties and liabilities. 
(a)  Enforcement. A discharger shall be guilty of a violation of this division if such person: 
(1)  Violates an order of the director; 
(2)  Fails to comply with any provision of this division (or permits issued hereunder or by the owner/operator of the sewage treatment facility which treats the discharger's effluent); 
(3)  Fails to comply with the regulations or rules of the NKSA (the North Kent Sewer Authority Rules and Regulations) for that portion of the system that flows into or is treated by the NKSA sewage treatment facility; or 
(4)  Fails to comply with the rules and regulations of Grand Rapids for that portion of the system that flows into or is treated by the Grand Rapids sewage treatment facility. 
To the extent the rules, requirements and standards contained in the division differ from the rules, requirements and standards of the owner of the sewage treatment facility where the sewage is treated, the stricter rules, requirements and standards shall apply. Whenever the director finds that any user has violated, or is violating, this division, a significant industrial user discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the director may serve upon said user a written notice of violation. Within five days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the NKSA or Grand Rapids as they case may be, or the township to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Recovery of costs incurred by POTW. Any discharger violating any of the provisions of this division, or who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the POTW or sewage treatment facility, shall be liable to the Township and the entity incurring such loss, damage or impairment for any expense, loss or damage caused by such violation or discharge. This shall include, but not be limited to, penalties levied upon the POTW by the USEPA or MDEQ for violation of its NPDES Permit caused by any violation by a discharger, including all actual costs, court, attorney and other related legal fees plus an additional charge of 100 percent of the total costs and/or penalties. 
(c)  Falsifying information. Any person or entity who knowingly makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division, shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided for in section 38-182(a) of this division. 
(d)  Suspension of service and discharge permits. The director may temporarily suspend or permanently revoke the sewage disposal system service and/or the significant industrial user discharge permit of a discharger when it appears that an actual or impending discharge presents or threatens an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, or the environment, interferes with the operation of the POTW, violates any pretreatment limits, or conditions imposed by this division (including those established by the owner/operator of the sewage treatment facility) or any significant industrial user discharge permit issued pursuant to this division. Except in the event of an emergency situation, before the director prohibits a person or entity from discharging sewage into the POTW, the director shall provide the person or entity with notice reasonably intended to apprise the user of the circumstances necessitating such action and the anticipated length of time during which sewage may not be discharged into the POTW. In the event of an emergency, notice shall be given as soon thereafter as practical. Any discharger notified of the suspension of sewage disposal system service and/or the discharger's significant industrial user discharge permit, shall, within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the director, cease all discharges and/or shut off the sewer connection to the POTW. In addition to or in lieu of the discharger taking the necessary steps to cease all discharges, the director may take whatever steps deemed necessary to eliminate the discharge, including prohibiting any sewage from entering the POTW at its point of entry, or by shutting off a portion of the POTW to one or more dischargers at any other location in the system, cessation of Township water service, if applicable, and/or commencing judicial proceedings for injunctive relief to compel the discharger's compliance with such order. The director may reinstate the significant industrial user discharge permit and/or sewage disposal system service and terminate any judicial proceeding upon presentation of proof by the discharger of the elimination of the non-complying discharge or conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above. 
(e)  Director's authority to issue administrative orders. Whenever the director determines that any discharger has violated this division, or any other applicable laws or regulations which the township is authorized to enforce, the director may issue administrative orders of the type listed below, as deemed appropriate under the circumstances. Multiple orders may be issued simultaneously or in combination as a single order with respect to a single discharger. 
(1)  Cease and desist order. A cease and desist order directs the non-complying user to cease illegal or unauthorized discharges immediately or to terminate its discharge altogether. Any person, who uses, applies for use and/or is connected directly or indirectly to the POTW shall be deemed to have consented to inspection pursuant to this section including entrance upon the person's property by the director to take such steps as necessary to eliminate the discharge should the discharger fail to comply with such order. Such order shall be final and in effect until a hearing, if requested by the user, is conducted and a final decision is made by the director. A written request for such hearing shall be made within ten calendar days after receiving the order. 
(2)  Consent order. An agreement between the director and the user that may contain compliance schedules, requirements for reimbursement of the township for damages and costs incurred or remedial actions, fines and administrative penalties, and signatures of the director and the authorized representative. A consent order shall address every identified and potential deficiency in the user's compliance status at the time of the order. 
(3)  Show cause order. Where the violation is not corrected by timely compliance, the director may order any discharger who causes or allows prohibited conduct, to show cause before the director why a proposed permit revocation action should not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the discharger by personal service, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the director regarding the violations, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action and directing the discharger to show cause before the director why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer or authorized representative of the discharger. The proceedings at the hearing shall be considered by the director who shall then enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper activities of the discharger. Appeal of such order may be taken by the discharger in accordance with applicable state law. 
(4)  Compliance order. A compliance order directs the discharger to achieve compliance by a date specified in the order. Compliance orders require industrial users to develop management practices, spill prevention programs and related POTW industrial pretreatment program requirements. 
(5)  Stop work order. Where there is work in progress that constitutes causes or is causing a violation of any provision of this division, the director may issue a stop work order to prevent further violations or damage. 
(f)  Director's authority to require financial assurances. Pursuant to the director's authority to issue administrative orders, the director may require a non-complying industrial or commercial user to post a performance bond sufficient to cover expenses that might reasonably be incurred as a result of future violations. Industrial or commercial users, who have, in the prior two years, been responsible for causing an upset at the POTW, may be required to obtain liability insurance sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of restoring the POTW in the event of another such incident. These requirements may be made conditions of the significant industrial user discharge permit. 
(g)  Judicial proceedings. Following the entry of any order by the director with respect to the conduct of a discharger contrary to the provision of this division, the Township may, following the authorization of such actions by the director, commence a civil, civil infraction or criminal action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the court of competent jurisdiction. Such relief may include, but is not limited to, the following: injunctive relief; suit for damages and costs to the NKSA, Grand Rapids and/or the township including legal expense; municipal civil infraction actions and criminal prosecution seeking fines and imprisonment as permitted by section 38-182(a) of this division and state law. 
(h)  Right of interpretation or ruling. Any discharger shall have the right to request, in writing, an interpretation or ruling by the director on any matter covered by this division and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. 
(i)  Operating upsets. 
(1)  Any discharger experiencing an upset in operations that places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this division, or a significant industrial user discharge permit issued pursuant hereto, shall inform both the director and the operator of the sewage treatment facility to which the sewage flows immediately upon becoming aware of the upset. The director shall make a determination whether this discharge can continue. Upon the director allowing the discharge to continue, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed within five days by the discharger with both the director and the operator of the sewage treatment facility to which the sewage flows. The report shall include: 
a.  A description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's impact on a discharger's compliance status; 
b.  The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and time of noncompliance, and if noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to occur; and 
c.  All steps taken, or to be taken, to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of such upset or other conditions of noncompliance. 
(2)  A documented and verified operating upset shall be an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought by the director against a discharger for any noncompliance with this division or any significant industrial user discharge permit issued pursuant hereto, which arises out of violations alleged to have occurred during the period of the upset. It will not, however, be a defense to an action for damages to the POTW or to persons, property or natural resources caused by the upset. An upset will be considered "documented and bona fide" only if the discharger complies with subsection (a) above and with 40 CFR 403.16(c) and rule 323.2315 of MAC. In any enforcement proceedings the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(3)  The user shall have controlled production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility, until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(4)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of an operating upset shall demonstrate through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
b.  The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and appropriate manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
c.  The user notified the director immediately upon becoming aware of the upset; and 
d.  A written submission, containing the following information, was provided within five days of commencement of the upset: 
1.  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance was expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

Sec. 38-182. - Penalties. 
(a)  Criminal and civil liability. 
(1)  Except as provided in subsection (3), any person or entity in violation of this division, or of any permit issued pursuant hereto or by the owner/operator of the sewage treatment facility which treats a discharger's effluent, or standards, rules and regulations, any order of the director issued pursuant to those rules and regulations or this division, shall be responsible for a municipal civil infraction which the director is authorized to enforce citations pursuant thereto on behalf of the township. Each act of violation and every day upon which any violation is permitted or suffered to exist shall constitute a separate violation and shall be subject to a separate penalty. The director may issue a notice of violation prior to issuing a citation. In the case of a conviction pursuant to this section of a discharger who is not a natural person, any officer or director of a corporation, any officer or partner of a partnership, or any member of a limited liability company, or any officer or owner of a proprietorship is hereby deemed to be a proper person to serve any term of imprisonment imposed by the court as a result of the conviction. 
(2)  In addition to, and expressly not in lieu of, the foregoing any discharger who violates this division, or any permit issued pursuant hereto, or the standards, rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this division, or any order of the director issued pursuant to this division, shall be subject to civil penalties, and to the payment of any damages and costs which may be awarded, by any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(3)  In addition to any applicable state and federal penalties, any person who: 
a.  At the time of a violation knew or should have known that a pollutant or substance was discharged contrary to any provision of this division, or contrary to any notice, order, permit, decision or determination promulgated, issued or made by the director under this division; or 
b.  Intentionally makes a false statement, representation, or certification in an application for, or form pertaining to a permit, or in a notice, report, or record required by this division, or in any other correspondence or communication, written or oral, with the POTW regarding matters regulated by this division; or 
c.  Intentionally falsifies, tampers with, or renders inaccurate any sampling or monitoring device or record required to be maintained by this division; or 
d.  Commits any other act that is punishable under state law by imprisonment for more than 90 days: shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $500.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for up to 90 days, or both at the discretion of the court.

Sec. 38-183. - Record retention. 
(a)  Any person or entity subject to this division shall retain and preserve, for no less than three years, any and all books, drawings, plans, prints, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and records related to compliance with this division. This includes, but is not limited to, records on magnetic or electronic media and any and all summaries of such records, relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analysis of any discharge or other liquids discharged into the POTW. 
(b)  Any and all records which pertain to matters which are the subject of a notice of violation, administrative order, show cause hearing, or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the township pursuant to this division, shall be retained and preserved for five years, or until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired, whichever is later. 
(Ord. No. 781, 2-6-2006; Ord. No. 819, § 1, 9-8-2009) 
Sec. 38-184. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 819, § 1, adopted September 8, 2009, amended the Code by repealing former § 38-184 in its entirety. Former § 38-184 pertained to miscellaneous provisions, and derived from Ord. No. 781, adopted February 6, 2006. 
Sec. 38-185. - User charges. 
(a)  Purpose of charges. Charges for the installation of, connection to and use of the POTW shall be established for the purpose of recovering the cost of construction, reconstruction, maintenance, repair, operation and replacement of the system. Such charges shall be made in accordance with USEPA regulations. Rates and charges shall be levied from time to time by resolution of the township board. 
(b)  Use charges. Rates and charges for sewage disposal service furnished by the POTW shall be charged to all persons using the system. Such charges shall reasonably reflect the proportionate costs of providing the service to the users of the POTW. 
(c)  Determination of user charges. The charges established shall be based upon the water consumption of the user's premises, including water from public and private supplies, as determined by this division and the standards, rules and regulations promulgated pursuant hereto. Where public water is not available, the township shall, at its sole option, estimate water sewage flow or require such metering as the township in its sole discretion may authorize. However, a monthly service charge shall be based upon the size of the water meter. If a premises is served by both public water and a private well (e.g. irrigation system), no water from the private well shall be allowed to enter the POTW unless the director's written approval is obtained and a method of determining usage is in place. 
(Ord. No. 781, 2-6-2006; Ord. No. 819, § 1, 9-8-2009) 
Sec. 38-186. - Rates and charges. 
(a)  Applicability. Users of the system shall pay rates and charges as established by resolution of the township board. Such fees, rates and charges shall be designed to produce revenues that are proportionate to the cost of providing service to each user class of each customer class. Such cost may include but not be limited to operation, maintenance, replacement, depreciation and capital costs of the system. 
(b)  Surcharges and permit fees. Fees and charges for a significant industrial user discharge permit shall be determined by the operator of the sewage treatment facility to which the sewage flows. Said sewage treatment facility may assess fees for analytical testing which may be required as part of a significant industrial user discharge permit and may also assess such other fees and charges within the lawful authority of said sewage treatment facility. 
(c)  Enforcement. Delinquent bills shall be collected as provided for in division 3 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 781, 2-6-2006; Ord. No. 819, § 1, 9-8-2009) 
Sec. 38-187. - Sewer use standards. 
(a)  Sewer service applications and notification. 
(1)  A user desiring to obtain sewer service shall make application on forms prescribed by the township. In the event that sewer service at a premises is continuous through a change of ownership, the new owner must file a notification of change of ownership within ten days. Failure to complete an application or notification may result in discontinuance of service. 
(2)  Whenever a condominium has a single sewer connection servicing the premises, the account shall be made in the name of the condominium association. Sewer service shall not be provided until the condominium association has filed with the Township written proof that it has the authority to enter into such an agreement. 
(b)  Sewer lines. 
(1)  Oversizing shall mean the enlargement of a local collector sewer so that the enlargement will serve as a trunk or interceptor sewer. When the system requires a local collector sewer line to be oversized, it will pay the cost of such oversizing as computed in the following manner: 
a.  In a residential assessment district or a new residential plot, the oversizing share is the difference in the materials cost of the oversized sewer; 
b.  In a commercial, industrial or high density residential development assessment district, the oversizing share is the difference in the materials cost of the oversized sewer; and 
c.  In cases where the larger than normal size sewer line is required solely to provide adequate service to a local service area and is not used as part of the larger network, then the entire cost of the enlargement will be treated in the same manner as a normal sized local collector line and the system will not participate in the oversizing cost. 
(2)  All new sewer lines shall conform to the standard specifications of the township, or its designee, for sanitary sewage collection systems and shall be a minimum of eight inches in diameter in most areas. The director reserves the right to determine the minimum acceptable sewer size in those cases where drainage problems exist or larger size lines are warranted. 
(c)  Sewer laterals, service leads and appurtenances. 
(1)  The township shall be responsible for the maintenance and/or replacement of sewer laterals due to normal deterioration resulting from normal wear and tear, usage and aging of the sewer lateral. The property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance and/or replacement at his/her expense of any damage to the sewer lateral serving his or her property if the township determines that said damage is primarily the result of (i) the property owner, occupant of the property, agent or representative of the property owner misusing the system in any manner including, but not limited to, improper discharges into the system or other action or inaction in violation of this article; (ii) any damage caused to the sewer lateral by the property owner, his or her contractors or agents while connecting to the system or other excavation of or near the sewer lateral; (iii) blockage within the sewer lateral emanating from the service lead, connection point and/or within the structure in which sanitary sewer originates; or (iv) any defects to the sewer lateral or improper installation of the sewer lateral if the sewer lateral was installed by the property owner, his or her contractors or agents. The property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance and/or replacement at his/her expense of the service lead that services any structures on the premises to ensure continuous flow of sewage and to ensure that the system is free from infiltration from the structure to the local collector sewer. Furthermore, if the township determines that damage to the lateral sewer connection point has been caused in full or in part by root intrusion from a tree located on the premises served by the service lead, it shall be the property owner's responsibility to pay for the cost of the repair to the lateral sewer connection point, any other portion of the service lead, and to the sewer lateral. 
(2)  Whenever a service lead and/or sewer lateral is to be extended to the premises, the plumber or contractor may obtain location measurements from the township or its designee. However, the township does not assume responsibility for the accuracy of such location measurements. 
(3)  Every newly constructed structure with plumbing fixture(s) shall have an independent, owner-maintained service lead to the sewer lateral when the system is available. There shall not be more than one structure served by a single sewer lateral and service lead, except upon approval of the director. 
(4)  When a structure is to be demolished, satisfactory arrangements shall be made with the township to disconnect and seal the sewer lateral at the property line or at the point designated by the township or its designee. The sewer lateral disconnection shall be inspected by the township or its designee prior to sealing.

The township board may revise unit factors by resolution, as it deems appropriate. 
(b)  If the use of the premises is not specifically set forth in the tables adopted by the township board by resolution, then the system administrator shall determine the unit factor for the use requested by comparing such use to the uses in the tables adopted by the board. Appeal of such determinations may be made to the township board within 28 days of such determination. 
(Comp. Ords. 1988, § 90.051; Ord. No. 760, 8-16-2004; Ord. No. 774, 11-21-2005; Ord. No. 818, § 1, 7-6-2009; Ord. No. 836, § 14, 2-7-2011; Ord. No. 861, § 3, 11-3-2014; Ord. No. 15-866, § 5, 6-15-2015; Ord. No. 2016-875, § 1, 8-15-2016) 
Sec. 38-421. - Mobile home parks; charges and fees. 
    Because of the unique and temporary nature of mobile home parks within the areas served by the system, there shall be charged to a mobile home park only a single availability charge based on the frontage abutting the sewer line to which connection is made, or, if the township deems appropriate, based on the number of residential units to be served by that connection. The sewer lateral charge shall be as provided in section 38-418. The NKSA joint system connection fee shall be determined in accordance with the North Kent Sewer Authority sewage collection and treatment agreement. 
(Comp. Ords. 1988, § 90.052; Ord. No. 760, 8-16-2004; Ord. No. 774, 11-21-2005; Ord. No. 818, § 1, 7-6-2009; Ord. No. 15-866, § 6, 6-15-2015) 
Sec. 38-422. - Charges; surcharges; no free service. 
(a)  The owner of the premises served and the occupants thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for the sewage disposal services provided to said premises. At the discretion of the township, tenants or land contract purchasers requesting sewage disposal services in their name may be required to deposit with the township the estimated bill for three months in advance of receiving service. Deposits shall be applied to any bill, including penalties and interest, for sewage disposal services delinquent more than 30 days. Any deposit so applied shall be promptly re-deposited by the user. The deposit, in the case of a tenant, shall be returned, less any balance due, when service is discontinued, unless the depositor wishes to apply the deposit to a new account in the township's sewage disposal service area. 
(b)  Charges for sewage disposal services to each premises connected to the sewage disposal system shall include both a base rate and a charge based on the amount of usage (usage rate), established from time to time by resolution of the township board and subject to any obligations and limitations set forth in any agreement pertaining to the system. The base rate shall be determined by multiplying the number of residential equivalent units assigned to the premises by the rate per residential equivalent unit established by township board resolution. 
    Beginning with the first complete quarterly billing period that ends on or after December 31, 2016, the base rate shall be determined by multiplying the meter equivalent factor assigned to the premises by the charge per meter equivalent factor as established from time to time by resolution of the township board. 
    The usage rate shall be established from time to time by resolution of the township board based on the metered water usage for the premises. If a premises is served by the sewage disposal system but not the public water system, both the base rate and usage rate component of the charges for sewage disposal services shall be calculated based on the number of residential equivalent units assigned to the premises, and beginning with the first complete quarterly billing period that ends on or after December 31, 2016, based on a meter equivalent factor as derived in the manner set forth in section 38-411. 
    The township board may impose a surcharge for sewage disposal services for any sanitary sewage that originates outside of the township, as may be agreed upon by the township board and such other municipality and as may be permitted by law and any agreement pertaining to the system. In addition to the regular charges for sewage disposal services, the township board may also impose a sewage disposal services surcharge for areas within the township for purposes of recouping exceptional or unique costs specific to certain portions of the system. In determining whether "exceptional or unique costs" exist, the township may consider, among other factors, whether sewer was permitted to be constructed in a manner that was inconsistent with the township's sanitary sewer master plan, thereby resulting in costs that would not otherwise be present in the operation and maintenance of the system. The sewage disposal services surcharge shall be an amount determined by the township board by resolution according to the number of residential equivalent units or meter equivalent factor assigned to the premises (base rate) and/or according to the amount of usage (usage rate), and shall be reviewed from time to time to ensure that it, when combined with the regular charges for sewage disposal services, reasonably reflects the additional operation and maintenance costs specific to the area covered by the sewage disposal services surcharge. When establishing a sewage disposal services surcharge, the township board shall specify the areas of the system, to include individual parcels, to be covered by the sewage disposal services surcharge. Prior to the establishment of the designated area, the township shall notify the affected property owners, as determined by the assessing records, within the proposed designated area by first class mail. No free service shall be furnished by the system to the township or any person, firm, or corporation, public or private, or any public agency or instrumentality. 
    No availability fee, trunkage connection fee, trunkage connection fee surcharge, NKSA joint system connection fee, sewer lateral fee or any other fee or charge imposed herein shall be waived or reduced by the township. 
    If a separate water meter is installed on a premises for irrigation use only with no metered water making its way into the sewage disposal system, no charges for sewage disposal services shall be billed for said irrigation meter. 
(c)  Following the period of service, charges for services furnished by the system shall be mailed to users on a quarterly basis, or more frequently at the township's discretion. All bills shall be paid within 20 days of mailing and shall be payable to the township. If any bill shall not be paid as required, a late charge of ten percent of the amount billed shall be applied to the current amount past due and collected therewith. Penalty charges will not be compounded. When sewer service is discontinued, any credit or balance due on the account shall not be billed or refunded to the customer if, when combined with any credit or balance due for water services on an account that is being closed, said balance is less than $5.00.

c.  An act of war, whether the war is declared or undeclared, or an act of terrorism. 
(9)  If the township and a claimant do not reach an agreement on the amount of compensation for the property damages or physical injury within 45 days after the receipt of notice under subsection (1), the claimant may institute a civil action in accordance with Act 222. 
(10)  The notice and claim procedures set forth in this section shall be applicable to a sewage disposal system event involving the sewage disposal system. 
(11)  In the event of a conflict between the notice and claim procedures set forth in this section and the specific requirements of Act 222, the specific requirements of Act 222 shall control. 
(12)  As provided in section 19(7) of Act 222, the notice and claim procedures of this section do not apply to claims for non-economic damages (as defined in Act 222) arising out of a sewage disposal system event.

SECTION 3.11 DWELLINGS  SINGLE FAMILY
A. It is recognized that there is a need for safe, attractive, economical single-family
housing in the Community. It is also recognized that manufactured housing,
including mobile homes, may, in part, satisfy this need. It is further recognized,
however, that because it is factory-built, some types of manufactured dwellings
may differ markedly in structure and appearance from traditional site-built
dwellings. Therefore, it is the intent of this Section to provide specific conditions
and standards, which must be met by dwellings intended to be located on
individual lots. These standards are considered necessary to assure compliance
with both minimum structural standards and reasonable compatibility of exterior
appearance for dwellings either previously constructed, or which might be
constructed, on lots in the same vicinity, while also avoiding monotony of
appearance.
The term vicinity, as employed in this section, includes that area within 660 feet
of the lot or parcel upon which a dwelling is proposed to be erected or assembled
and occupied. Any determination of reasonable compatibility of appearance shall
be based both upon the standards established herein and upon the character,
design, and appearance for one or more appropriate single-family dwellings
located within the vicinity of the lot, where 20 or more percent of the properties in
the vicinity are developed with dwellings; or, in instances where the vicinity is not
GENERAL PROVISIONS

ridge shall be ten feet. The pitched roof shall be securely attached to
and exclusively supported by the dwelling. Any type of roofing materials
generally acceptable for, and applied in a manner resulting in
appearance similar to dwellings in the vicinity, may be employed on the
roof of the dwelling, attached additions, and detached accessory
structures.
6. The exterior siding shall consist of horizontal lap siding or other siding of
the same materials as other dwellings in the vicinity and attached in the
same manner as required by the Township Building code.

shall be provided to the door area, or to porches accessible to the door
area, when required by a difference in elevation between the door sill
and the surrounding grade. All steps and/or porches shall be securely
attached to a permanent foundation and shall be constructed in
conformance with the Township Building Code.
10. Additions attached to the dwelling may be constructed if such
construction is in conformance with the standards adhered to in the
construction of the dwelling. If such additions are constructed on site,
they shall be constructed in conformance with the Township Building
Code with materials and workmanship similar in appearance and quality
to the dwelling.
11. It shall be constructed upon a basement or foundation around the entire
perimeter of the dwelling constructed in compliance with the Township
Building Code. The exposed portion of the basement walls or foundation

foundation so as to be watertight in such a way as water will not enter
and shall be anchored to said foundation by an anchor system designed
and constructed in compliance with the Department of Housing and
Urban Development regulations and with Mobile Home Commission
standards.
14. All wheels and towing mechanisms, including the tongue, shall be
removed and none of the undercarriage shall be visible from outside the
mobile home.

SECTION 3.13 GOVERNMENTAL BUILDINGS In addition to other provisions of this ordinance,
the following regulation shall apply to all districts: Municipal, State, or Federal administrative or
service buildings shall be permitted: provided, however, that such use shall be permitted only
upon approval of the Planning Commission after finding that such use will be in conformity with
the character of the adjacent neighborhood and that they are essential to service the
neighborhood or community. All governmental buildings shall be subject to site plan approval by
the Planning Commission which may establish requirements such as architecture, landscaping,
setback and other area regulations, and such other conditions as may be appropriate to ensure
compatibility with the character of the district in which it is located.
SECTION 3.14 GRADE LEVELS All dwelling and business structures shall, subsequent to the
adoption of this ordinance, conform to all established and determined grade levels. In areas
where there are two or more structures in any one block, the average of the grade level thereof
shall determine the grade level for that area. In all areas where no grade level has been
determined or established by building thereon, before any building or structure shall be placed
thereon the appropriate highway authority for that area shall determine a grade level and when so
determined, it shall become the grade level thereof. After the adoption of this ordinance, it shall

SECTION 3.29 WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES. It is the general purpose and intent
of the Township to carry out the will of the United States Congress by authorizing communication
facilities needed to operate wireless communication systems. It also is the purpose of this
section is to establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless communication support
structures and antennas which authorizes their use in a manner that will retain the integrity of
neighborhoods and the aesthetic quality of the overall community.
More specifically, it is the further purpose and intent of this section to: generally locate wireless
communication support structures in non-residential areas; minimize the number of wireless
communication support structures throughout the Township; facilitate adequate and efficient
provision of sites for needed facilities; promote the public health, safety and welfare; minimize the
adverse impact of technological obsolescence of wireless communications facilities; encourage
the joint use of existing and new wireless communication support structure sites; enable wireless
communication support structure and antenna users to provide facilities and services to the
Township quickly, efficiently and effectively; and ensure that facilities are situated in appropriate
locations with respect to other land uses, structures and buildings.
A. PERMITTED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES
There are three methods by which Wireless Communication Facilities are permitted
within the Township, as follows:
1. The following types of Attached Wireless Communication Facilities are permitted
within any zone district subject to the Community Development Department
granting Site Plan Review approval in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
32:
a. Wireless Communication Facilities, which are to be located on an existing
wireless communication support structure which was designed for collocation
and was previously approved by the Planning Commission.
b. Wireless Communication Facilities which are to be located on a lawfully
existing building or structure and which will not extend above the highest point
of the building or structure more than 30 feet or 50 percent of the height of the
existing building or structure, whichever is less.
All applications shall include a Site Plan and shall be reviewed in accordance with
the following standards and conditions, and, if approved, shall be constructed and
maintained in accordance with such standards and conditions:
a. The applicant shall submit a grid map illustrating existing and proposed service
areas and demonstrating why the proposed facility is required at the specific
proposed location.
b. Facilities shall not be injurious to neighborhoods or otherwise detrimental to
the public health, safety and welfare.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-19
c. The maximum height of the new or modified support structure and antenna
shall be the minimum height demonstrated to be necessary for communication
by the applicant. Any building necessary to enclose switching or other related
equipment shall be limited to the maximum height permitted for other buildings
within the zone district in which the facility is being proposed.
d. There shall be unobstructed access to the support structure, for operation,
maintenance, repair, and inspection purposes, which may be provided by an
easement. All access drives shall have a minimum:
(1). Surface Width of 14 feet.
(2). 12 inch sand sub-base with a sub-base drainage system.
(3). Six inch gravel base with a minimum crown of two-tenths (0.2) of one
foot from the centerline of the access drive to the outside edge.
(4). 30 foot by 40 foot turn-around not including the width of the drive.
The location of the drive shall be determined by such factors as: the location of
adjacent thoroughfares and traffic and circulation within the site; utilities
needed to service the wireless communication support structure and any
attendant facilities; the location of buildings and parking facilities; proximity to
residential districts and minimizing disturbance to the natural landscape; and
the type of equipment which will need to access the site.
e. The division of property for the purpose of locating a wireless communication
facility is prohibited unless all zoning and land division requirements and
conditions are met.
f. If an attached wireless communication facility is proposed on the roof of a
building and the equipment enclosure is proposed as a roof appliance or
penthouse on the building, it shall be designed, constructed and maintained to
be architecturally compatible with the principal building. The equipment
enclosure may be located within the principal building or may be proposed as a
separate building. If proposed as a separate building, it shall conform to all
district yard setback requirements for principal buildings.
g. The Planning Commission or Community Development Department shall, with
respect to the support structure and all accessory buildings, review and
approve the application so as to minimize distraction, reduce visibility,
maximize aesthetic appearance, and ensure compatibility with surroundings. It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to maintain the wireless
communication facility in a neat and orderly manner.
h. No signs or advertising of any kind shall be allowed on any wireless
communication support structure or antenna except as may be required by a
governmental agency with the authority to require a sign.
i. A maintenance plan and any applicable maintenance agreement shall be
submitted as part of the required Site Plan for the proposed facility to be
approved by the Planning Commission. At a minimum, it shall include
provisions for maintaining the wireless communication facility, all of the
premises, the access drive and all landscaping. The plan shall be sufficient to
ensure the safety of the facility, to keep the access drive accessible by
GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-20
emergency vehicles at all times and to keep the facilities and landscaping from
becoming a blight on the neighborhood.
j. The Planning Commission may require a performance bond, irrevocable bank
letter of credit, cash deposit or other surety to guarantee the removal of the
facility in the event its removal is required in accordance with Section 3.29 C.
2. Wireless Communication Facilities are permitted as a principal or accessory use
within any Rural Preservation, Rural Estate or Industrial zone district, subject to the
issuance of a Special Use Permit by the Planning Commission in accordance with
the procedures contained in Chapter 27, and the Site Design Standards contained
in Section 27.05 EE.
3. Wireless Communication Facilities are permitted as a principal or accessory use
within any zone district except Rural Preservation, Rural Estate or Industrial,
subject to the issuance of a Special Use Permit by the Planning Commission in
accordance with the procedures contained in Chapter 27 and the Site Design
Standards contained in Section 27.05 FF.
B. FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN GRANTING SPECIAL USE PERMITS UNDER
SECTION 3.29A.2. AND SECTION 3.29A.3.
In addition to any standards for consideration of special use permit applications
pursuant to Chapter 27 of the Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit,
although the Planning Commission may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of
one or more of these criteria if the Planning Commission concludes that the goals of
this ordinance are better served thereby:
1. Height of the proposed wireless communication support structure;
2. Proximity of the wireless communication support structure to residential structures
and residential district boundaries;
3. Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
4. Surrounding topography;
5. Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
6. Design of the wireless communication support structure, with particular reference
to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
7. Proposed ingress and egress; and
8. Availability of suitable existing wireless communication support structures. No new
wireless communication support structure shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Commission that no
existing wireless communication support structure can accommodate the
applicants proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit information requested by
the Planning Commission related to the availability of suitable existing wireless
communication support structures. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no
existing wireless communication support structure can accommodate the
applicants proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-21
No existing wireless communication support structures are located within the
geographic area, which meet applicants engineering requirements.
Existing wireless communication support structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicants engineering requirements.
Existing wireless communication support structures do not have sufficient
structural strength to support applicants proposed antenna and related
equipment.
The applicants proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with
the antenna on the existing wireless communication support structure, or the
antenna on the existing wireless communication support structure would cause
interference with the applicants proposed antenna.
The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share
an existing wireless communication support structure or to adapt an existing
wireless communication support structure for sharing are unreasonable.
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render
existing wireless communication support structures unsuitable.
C. REMOVAL OF ABANDONED OR UNUSED WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
FACILITIES.
1. A condition of every approval of a wireless communication facility shall be
adequate provision for removal of all or part of the facility from the site by users
and owners upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events:
a. When the facility has not been used for six months or more. For purposes of
this section, the removal of antennas or other equipment from the facility, or the
cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of radio signals) shall be
considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse.
b. Upon a determination by the Building Inspector, any wireless communication
support structure that is in use or out of use for any period of time, but due to
obsolescence, damage or lack of maintenance may pose a threat to public
safety.
c. Failure to maintain the facilities in accordance with the requirements of this and
any other applicable ordinances.
2. The situations, in which removal of a facility is required, as set forth in Section
3.29C.1. above, may be applied and limited to portions of a facility.

Section 3.29C.1. above, the property owner or persons who had used the facility
shall immediately apply or secure the application for any required demolition or
removal permits, and immediately proceed with the complete removal and
restoration of the premises to an acceptable condition as reasonably determined by
the Township Building Inspector.
4. If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has not been lawfully
completed within 60 days of the applicable deadline, and after at least 30 days
written notice, the Township may remove or secure the removal of the facility or
required portions thereof, with its actual cost and reasonable administrative charge
GENERAL PROVISIONS
3-22
to be drawn or collected and/or enforced from or under the security posted at the
time application was made for establishing the facility.
SECTION 3.30 GRADING AND ADEQUATE LOT DRAINAGE
A. No No lot shall be filled or graded so as to discharge surface water runoff onto abutting
lots in such a manner as to cause flooding, ponding or surface accumulation of such
runoff thereon.
B. Where a lot is to be filled or graded for the development or expansion of a single family
dwelling, two-family dwelling or similar use in a residentially zoned district on a lot that is
not part of an overall development with an approved drainage plan, the Community
Development Department may require a written or engineered drainage plan drawn to a
readable scale that provides for positive site drainage and prevents soil erosion.
1. The plan shall provide for appropriate and reasonable steps to prevent erosion,
which may include the construction of silt traps, the mulching and temporary or
permanent planting of all areas exposed by grading, the construction of diversions,
channel linings, grade stabilization structures, and bank protection structures, and
shall limit, insofar as is practical, the area of land exposed to erosion resulting from
grading at any one time and the length of time that any area is exposed, and shall,
upon completion of operations, leave the area in a condition where further erosion
will not take place.

In the event any non-conforming structure shall be so damaged and the cost of rebuilding or
restoration shall exceed 60 percent of the market value of such structure as determined by the
assessed value for tax purposes at the time of damage, rebuilding or restoration shall only be
permitted as a special use under the provisions of Chapter 27. The Planning Commission shall
grant a special use permit only upon finding that:
A. Such rebuilding or restoration will not substantially extend the probable duration
of such non-conforming use, had such damage not occurred; or
B. Circumstances are such that the land previously occupied by such
non-conforming use cannot then be reasonably used for a use or structure
conforming to the regulations of the district.
Permitted restoration shall be commenced within a period of six months from the date of said
damage and diligently prosecuted to completion. In the event a request for a special use permit
is denied, the structure can only be used if it is repaired or replaced in conformance with all of the
conditions and requirements of this ordinance existing at the time of replacement.
SECTION 4.04 CHANGES IN TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP. There may be a change in
tenancy, ownership, or management of an existing nonconforming use provided that there is no
change in the nature or character of said nonconforming use except as herein permitted. Any
change in ownership does not remove the nonconformity nor extend any time limits specified
within this Chapter.
SECTION 4.05 CHANGE OR DISCONTINUANCE OF USE. The nonconforming use of a
building, structure or any lot shall not be:
A. Re-established after discontinuance, vacancy, lack of operation, or otherwise
abandoned for a period of 12 consecutive months.
B. Re-established after it has been changed to a conforming use.
NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
4-2
C. A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use, which is
more restrictive than the current use, as a special use under the provisions of
Chapter 27. However, once a nonconforming use is changed to a more
restricted nonconforming use, it may not be changed back to its original use. (By
way of example, a commercial use in an agricultural zone, if changed to
residential, may be allowed, but it may not be changed back to commercial.)
SECTION 4.06 RELOCATION OF A NONCONFORMING BUILDING OR STRUCTURE.
Should a nonconforming building or structure be moved for any reason, for any distance
whatsoever it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it
is moved.
SECTION 4.07 REMOVAL OF NONCONFORMING STATUS. A nonconforming use, building,
structure or lot may be made conforming by appropriate action or modification which caused the
use, building, structure or lot to fulfill the requirements of the district in which it is located. In order
to remove the nonconforming status said modifications and changes must meet the requirements
of the district at the time of said changes or modifications. However, once the nonconforming
status of the use of a building or the nonconforming building, structure or lot has been made
conforming to the conditions and requirements of the district in which it is located, the property
forever loses its nonconforming status and this status may not be reasserted at any time in the
future.
SECTION 4.08 EXPANSION OF A NONCONFORMING USE AND/OR NONCONFORMING
BUILDING, LOT, OR STRUCTURE A nonconforming use of a building, lot or structure or
nonconforming physical standard dealing with a building, structure, or lot may be expanded only
under the following terms and conditions.
A. NONCONFORMING USE. A nonconforming use which existed prior to the
adoption of this ordinance or amendments thereto and which exists in or on a
conforming structure, building or lot may be extended or enlarged to occupy the
entire lot, existing building or structure as a special use under the provisions of
Chapter 27. In considering the grant or denial of a special use permit to allow the
extension or expansion of this nonconforming use, the Planning Commission
shall consider the following criteria and further, the Planning Commission has the
discretion to grant a special use permit with any of the conditions it deems
appropriate:
1. Roads and streets leading to and from the nonconforming use, as well as
any additional traffic flow problems to be created by said expansion.
2. Any increase in noise, odor, fumes, lights, glare, waste, sewer discharge,
or other like detrimental effects created by the proposed expansion.
3. Whether the proposed expansion of the nonconforming use is
compatible with the surrounding areas and properties.
4. Whether the proposed expansion could be made less detrimental to
surrounding properties and areas by the use of appropriate buffering and
screening.
B. NONCONFORMING PHYSICAL STANDARDS WITH RESPECT TO A
BUILDING OR STRUCTURE EXCEPT FOR SINGLE FAMILY AND TWO
FAMILY DWELLINGS. A nonconforming building or structure, which is
nonconforming due to failing to meet all, required physical standards (i.e.
setbacks, lot area, lot width, parking, etc.) may be enlarged or extended,
provided that a special use permit is obtained under the provisions of Chapter 27
NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
4-3
and further provided that the enlargement or extension complies with all required
physical standards. In no event shall the Planning Commission approve
extensions or enlargements to the nonconforming building or structure for a total
of more than 50 percent of the original floor area of the building or structure at
the time it became nonconforming. In considering the granting or denial or
granting with conditions of a special use permit, the Planning Commission shall
consider the following:
1. The scope of the nonconformity of the existing building or structure in
contrast to the minimum physical standards as called for within the
zoning district, including but not limited to:
a. Parking
b. Setbacks
c. Height
d. Lighting
e. Drainage
f. Required public utilities
g. Lot area
h. Lot width
i. Landscaping
j. Compatibility with adjacent properties
2. The Planning Commission has the discretion to grant with conditions a
special use permit to extend or enlarge a nonconforming building or
structure. It is expressly conveyed to the Planning Commission the
authority or power to make conditions effecting the existing structure or
building, as a condition of granting the permission to extend or enlarge a
structure or building. The Planning Commission has the discretion to
impose conditions on the original nonconforming structure or building to
make it less nonconforming up to all conditions which would be required
to make it a conforming structure or building.
C. NONCONFORMING PHYSICAL STANDARDS WITH RESPECT TO SINGLE
FAMILY AND TWO FAMILY DWELLINGS. A nonconforming building or
structure, which is nonconforming due to failing to meet all, required physical
standards (i.e. setbacks, lot area, lot width, parking, etc.) may be enlarged or
extended, provided that the enlargement or extension is approved by the Zoning
Board of Appeals and further provided that the enlargement or extension
complies with all required physical standards. In no event shall the Zoning Board
of Appeals approve extensions or enlargements to the nonconforming building or
structure for a total of more than 50 percent of the original floor area of the
building or structure at the time it became nonconforming. In considering the
grant or denial or grant with conditions of a variance, the Board of Appeals shall
consider the following:
NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
4-4
1. The scope of the nonconformity of the existing building or structure in
contrast to the minimum physical standards as called for within the zoning
district, including but not limited to:
a. Parking
b. Setbacks
c. Height
d. Lighting
e. Drainage
f. Required public utilities
g. Lot area
h. Lot width
i. Landscaping
j. Compatibility with adjacent properties
2. The Board of Appeals has the discretion to grant with conditions a variance
to extend or enlarge a nonconforming building or structure. It is expressly
conveyed to the Board of Appeals the authority or power to make conditions
effecting the existing structure or building, as a condition of granting the
permission to extend or enlarge a structure or building. The Zoning Board of
Appeals has the discretion to impose conditions on the original
nonconforming structure or building to make it less nonconforming up to all
conditions which would be required to make it a conforming structure or
building.
SECTION 4.09 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD Where an existing lot has a lot area
of not less than 90 percent of its zone district requirements and where such lot can provide the
side, front and rear yard requirements of its district, the permitted uses of the district shall be
allowed. An existing lot in single ownership with a lot area that is less than 90 percent of its
district requirements may be utilized for permitted uses and for such purpose the required side
and rear yards may be reduced by the same percentage the lot area of such lot bears to its
district requirements, provided that no side yard shall be less than five feet, no rear yard less than
35 feet (unless the specific district requirements permit a lesser side or rear yard) and that the offstreet
parking requirements are met.
Where two or more adjacent lots are in single ownership and where such lots contain less than
90 percent of the lot area requirements, such lots shall be utilized only in conformance with the
minimum requirements of the district. In the event two or more adjacent lots containing less than
90 percent of the lot area requirements are in single ownership and the Board of Appeals shall
find that there is no practical possibility of obtaining additional land, it may permit their use as
separate lots having less than the required lot area if it shall determine that they can be so used
without adversely affecting the character of the neighborhood. Provided, however, that no side
yard shall be less than five feet, no rear yard less than 35 feet (unless the specific district
requirements permit a lesser side or rear yard), and that off-street parking requirements are met.

SECTION 4.10 EXISTING RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES AND ADDITIONS An existing
residential structure or addition to residential structures in non-residential zones may not be used
for commercial and industrial purposes unless in conformance with the building code.
Nonconforming residential lots in non-residential districts, including non-residential PUD,
(Planned Unit Development Zones), which are used for residential purposes shall conform to
height and area regulations for the R-1 Zone, Chapter 8. Despite provisions of the underlying
district, no nonresidential use other than home occupations, shall be permitted on such lot until
the residential use is abandoned.
SECTION 4.11 REQUIRED AREA OR SPACE Any lot or lots in common ownership and yards,
courts, parking areas or other spaces may be divided, altered or reduced if said area or
dimension as divided, altered or reduced meets the minimum requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance. If already less than the minimum required under the Zoning Ordinance, said area or
dimension shall not be further divided or reduced.

SECTION 6.01 PURPOSE It is the purpose of this district to permit agricultural and related uses
as well as low density single-family homes, along with necessary service and special uses, in a
manner that is consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan of the Township. Limiting the
type and density of development within these districts will minimize development pressures upon
the remaining agricultural lands and will help preserve the open-space, wetlands, topographical
relief and tree cover all of which are abundant within these areas.
It is further intended to defer or prolong the necessity of extending public utilities into these areas
by requiring more intense development to locate within other zone districts where public utilities
are available or are planned to become available. Residential clustering as regulated in Chapter
25, Planned Unit Development District or Chapter 26, Open Space Preservation PUD, is
permitted where public utilities are available.

CHAPTER 7
RE RURAL ESTATE RESIDENTIAL
SECTION 7.01 PURPOSE It is the purpose of this district to protect extensive areas of natural
character while providing a low density residential environment. The regulations are intended to
achieve a balance between preserving the important qualities of the natural environment such as
trees, topographical relief and open-space and satisfying the desire of many families to reside in
these areas.
It is planned and expected that some areas will be served by both public water and sanitary
sewer. It is recognized that with proper planning, the availability of both public utilities can
contribute to the objective of preserving the rural environment while allowing modest density
increases. This may be accomplished by residential clustering as regulated in Chapter 25,
Planned Unit Development District or Chapter 26, Open Space Preservation PUD.
SECTION 7.02 PERMITTED USES Land and/or buildings in this district may be used for the
following purposes only:
A. One detached single-family dwelling on each lot.

The North East Beltline Overlay District
21-1
CHAPTER 21
THE NORTH EAST BELTLINE OVERLAY DISTRICT
SECTION 21.01 DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE. The purpose of this overlay zone is to
implement the 1998 North East Beltline Joint Development Plan; to provide a consistent
development framework; to specify practical development standards; to preserve the natural road
edge, scenic views and steep slopes; and to protect the transportation capacity of this important
community and transportation corridor. This zone is compatible with a similar zone in Grand
Rapids Township and the City of Grand Rapids. The requirements of this overlay zone apply to
all land abutting, within 500 feet of, or gaining access from the East Beltline between 4 Mile Road
and Grand River Avenue; unless otherwise defined.
The following standards shall not apply to developments (including PUDs) approved prior to
January 1, 2002, nor to subsequent amendments or modifications of such developments or
PUDs. However, the requirements of this Overlay Zone shall apply to the elements of a
development (including PUDs) approved prior to the effective date of this Overlay, that were not
specifically addressed in the conditions of approval. That may include building and parking lot
setbacks, landscaping, parking, lighting, signs, grading, storm water management, motor vehicle
and pedestrian access, and architectural façades and building design.
SECTION 21.02 MODIFICATIONS FROM THE REQUIREMENTS. Notwithstanding the
provisions, including specific waiver provisions, of the Overlay District, the Planning Commission
may approve a modification from the requirements of the Overlay Zone based on competent,
material and substantial evidence that:
1. Special conditions or circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land or use
and which are not applicable to other lands or uses in the Overlay Zone.
2. The literal interpretations of this Overlay Zone would deprive the applicant of
property rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the Overlay Zone; and
3. The authorizing of such modification will not be of substantial detriment to
neighboring property and will not be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this
Overlay Zone.
SECTION 21.03 SETBACKS.
1. Background.
One of the goals of the North East Beltline Joint Development Plan is to maintain
?a natural edge along the East Beltline through gracious development
setbacks, preserving natural vegetation and utilizing innovative and low
maintenance landscapes along the corridor and the highway right-of-way.?
2. Setbacks of Buildings and Parking Lots from the East Beltline.
Buildings and parking lots shall be setback from the East Beltline according to
the following schedule:
A. Parking Lot Setback  90 feet, which is measured from the outside edge
of the existing through lane, as of January 1, 2002, to the edge of a
parking lot. Within the setback, a minimum 25-foot wide landscaped
area, measured from the right-of-way to the edge of a parking lot, is
required.
The North East Beltline Overlay District
21-2
B. Setback for a Building equal to or less than 35 feet high  140 feet
measured from the outside edge of the existing through lane, as of
January 1, 2002, with a minimum 25-foot setback between the building
and the right-of-way line.
Building height is measured as the vertical distance from the mean of the
lowest and highest elevation points adjoining the exterior walls of the
structure to the highest point of a flat roof; to the deck line of a mansard
roof; and to the mean height between the eave and ridge of the highest
roof section for a gable, hip or gambrel roof. The height exception
provisions of Section 3.06 of the Zoning Ordinance shall apply where
appropriate.
C. Building Setbacks for Buildings greater than 35 feet high require 2
additional feet of horizontal setback, for every 1 additional foot in building
height above 35 feet.
3. Setback Modifications.
As part of establishing or amending a Special Land Use, or undertaking a Site
Plan review, the Planning Commission may reduce the building and parking
setbacks to the minimum required setback in the underlying zone district and as
part of establishing or amending a PUD the Planning Commission may
recommend that the Township Board reduce building and parking setbacks to
those required in the PUD under any of the following circumstances:
A. The property is not capable of being developed if the minimum building
setback under the Overlay Zone is applied.
B. Application of the minimum building setback under the Overlay Zone
results in a PUD or site plan that negatively impacts environmental
features such as steep slopes, wetlands, or vegetation.
C. Application of the minimum building setback under the Overlay Zone
results in a PUD or site plan that does not further the goals of the Master
Plan.
SECTION 21.04 LANDSCAPING
.
1. Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to maintain the natural edge and views along the
East Beltline, establish a healthy environment by reducing air pollution and heat
gain associated with large paved areas, protect wildlife habitat, safeguard
property value, and enhance the communitys visual character for our citizens
use and enjoyment.
2. Landscape Plan.
A concept landscape plan indicating design intent shall be submitted as part of
Site Plan, Special Land Use, or PUD applications. Following PUD, Special Land
Use or Site Plan approval, a final landscape plan shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission or its designee to confirm compliance with the approved
concept landscape plan. The final plan shall include, but not necessarily be
limited to, the following:

trees are in healthy growing condition, are at least the minimum size, are
the appropriate type, and are spaced according to their likely mature
size.
C. The area below the drip line of an existing tree to be saved should
remain undisturbed. No impervious material should be placed under the
drip line and a tree protection fence must be installed around the trees
during construction at the limit of disturbance. Tree protection symbols
notes and details must be shown on the site plan.
D. Should any tree designated for preservation, for which landscaping credit
is given, die; the owner shall replace the tree with the equivalent species
or with a tree which will obtain the same height, spread and growth
characteristics. The replacement tree must be a minimum of 2.5 inches
caliper.
4. Unaccredited Species.

effective in screening undesirable views.
B. Office, institutional, multifamily residential or mixed-use areas: plantings
should include a minimum of 3 evergreen trees, 2 shade trees and 8
shrubs for every 100 feet of building frontage. The number of plants shall
be proportional to the length of frontage, with fractions rounded up. The
Planning Commission may allow a reduction in the number or a variation
in the mixture of the tree types.
C. Commercial-use areas: plantings should include a mixture of 5 trees for
every 100 feet of building frontage. The number of plants required shall
be proportional to the frontage, with fractions rounded up. Additional
landscaping may be used, but is not required.
A mixture of evergreen, ornamental and shade trees is encouraged. The
Planning Commission may allow a reduction in the number or a variation
in the mixture of the tree types.
D. Parking areas: Continuous plantings, berms or walls shall be installed to
a minimum of 4 feet in height along the East Beltline (plantings
measured after 3 years in the ground). The requirement for plantings,
berms, or walls for parking areas that abut the East Beltline may be
waived by the Planning Commission if, in the judgment of the Planning
Commission, the motor vehicles in the parking lot will be substantially
screened from the road by the final topography or existing vegetation.
(See illustrations below)
The North East Beltline Overlay District
21-5
6. Parking Area Landscaping.
For all parking areas that accommodate 10 cars or more, the following standards
apply.
A. Landscaped islands and shade trees shall be located throughout the
parking lot so as to relieve and shade expanses of parking, and
contribute to the orderly circulation of motor vehicle and pedestrian
traffic. Landscaped islands must be a minimum of 160 square feet and a
minimum of 9 feet wide. Each island should be planted with at least one
canopy tree that is located at least 3 feet from the edge of the island.
B. Landscape islands shall be calculated on the basis of one landscape
island for every 10 parking spaces. Landscape islands may be
aggregated. Landscaped corners count towards the required number of
islands
The Planning Commission may reduce the number of required landscape islands
if it finds that adequate relief and shade is provided by other plantings in and
around the parking area.
7. Minimum Standards for plants and other landscape features.
A. Canopy/shade trees 2.5 inches in caliper
B. Evergreen Trees 5 feet in height
C. Shrubs 24 inches in height

accordance with their natural growth patterns. Withered, diseased or
dead plants shall be replaced within a reasonable amount of time, but no
longer than one growing season.
B. Plants must be controlled by pruning, trimming, or other suitable
methods so that they do not interfere with public utilities, restrict
pedestrian or vehicular access, or constitute a traffic hazard.
C. All planted areas must be maintained in a substantially weed free
condition.
SECTION 21.05 PARKING.
1. Permeable surface for paving.
At the discretion of the Planning Commission, parking areas that are in excess of
the minimum may be surfaced with permeable asphalt, permeable concrete or
turf blocks. The calculations for required storm water management and retention
measures may be adjusted for the use of such paving.
2. Alternative Parking Arrangements.
A. Cooperative Parking - At the discretion of the Planning Commission,
provisions for cooperative parking may be allowed. Cooperative
provisions for off-street parking would be made by contract between two
or more adjacent property owners. The parking area provided on any
one lot could be reduced to not less than one half the number of required
spaces for the use occupying such lot. The lots shall be interconnected
for vehicular passage.
B. Shared Parking - Where a mix of land uses creates staggered peak
periods of parking, shared parking agreements that have the effect of
reducing the total amount of needed parking spaces, are encouraged. In
these cases the required number of parking spaces may be reduced, at
the discretion of the Planning Commission. Retail, office, institutional
and entertainment uses may share parking areas. In no case shall
shared parking include the parking required for residential uses.
C. Deferred Parking - In order to avoid excessive amount of impervious
surface, the Planning Commission may approve a development which
provides less than the minimum number of parking spaces required if the
applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission
that a reduced amount of total parking spaces will meet the projected
parking needs of the project due to:
i. The nature, size, density, location, or design of the proposed
development, including the design of the circulation and parking
plan;
ii. Characteristics of the development which will affect the parking
needs, including factors such as non-conflicting hours of
operation and the sharing of spaces by different users;
iii. Any other factors reasonably related to the need for parking for
the proposed development; and
The North East Beltline Overlay District
21-7
iv. The availability of vacant or otherwise undeveloped land on the
same parcel as shown on the proposed development plan, shall
remain available to provide additional off-street parking space if
additional space is subsequently determined to be necessary by
the Planning Commission to meet the parking needs of the
development. The available land must be of sufficient size to
accommodate the full amount of parking required under the
Zoning Ordinance for the use, may not count as any type of
required open space and shall be permanently reserved for
parking as outlined in a signed and recorded agreement.
3. Bicycle Parking.
One bicycle parking space shall be provided for every 20 motor vehicle spaces of
the first 200 motor vehicle spaces required for non-residential uses. Bicycle
parking shall be provided within a convenient distance to the entrance to the
building. Bicycle parking spaces shall consist of a securely fixed structure that
supports the bicycle frame without damage to wheels or frame and allows the
frame and both wheels to be locked to the structure.
SECTION 21.06 LIGHTING.
1. Purpose.
The purpose of this Section is to provide reasonable regulations to direct the
location, design and use of certain outdoor lighting at appropriate illumination
levels while minimizing its undesirable effects. Specifically, the Section aims to
accomplish, where possible, the following benefits for the public health, safety
and general welfare, and otherwise in the public interest:
A. Maintain safe nighttime driver performance on public roadways by
minimizing both brightly-lighted surfaces and lighting glare.
B. Promote lighting that provides security but is not unduly intrusive or a
nuisance to nearby residents and drivers.
C. Preserve the qualities of the corridor by eliminating intrusive artificial light
and lighting that unnecessarily contributes to ?sky glow?.
2. Definitions.
Average Illumination Levels: The overall average of all points on the surface of
the illuminated area including the brightest and the dimmest points.
Cut-Off-Angle: The angle between the vertical axis of a luminaire and the first line
of sight (of a luminaire) at which the light source is no longer visible.
Cut-off Fixtures: Cut-off fixtures control glare by directing light well below the
horizon, out of the viewers line of sight.
Floodlight: A light fixture designed to light a scene or object to a level greater
than its surroundings. The beam of floodlights may range from narrow field
angles of 10 degrees to wide angles (more than 100 degrees).
Flush Mounted or Recessed Luminaire: A luminaire that is mounted above a
ceiling (or behind a wall or other surface) with the opening of the luminaire level
with the surface.
Foot-candle: A measure of light falling on a given surface. One foot-candle is
equal to the amount of light generated by one candle shining on a square foot
surface one foot away. Foot-candle may be measured both horizontally and
vertically by a light meter.
Glare: The condition that results from insufficiently shielded light sources or
areas of excessive light within the field of view.

D. Light fixtures mounted on canopies shall be recessed so that the lens
cover is recessed or flush with the bottom surface (ceiling) of the canopy
and/or shielded by the fixture or the edge of the canopy so that light is
restrained to no more than 85 degrees from vertical.
E. Gas Pump Canopy
The North East Beltline Overlay District
21-11
As an alternative (or supplement) to recessed ceiling lights, indirect
lighting may be used where light is beamed upward and then reflected
down from the underside of the canopy. In this case light fixtures must
be shielded so that direct illumination is focused exclusively on the
underside of the canopy.
i. Lights shall not be mounted on the top or sides
(fascias) of the canopy, and the sides of the canopy
shall not be illuminated.
ii. The reduction of all lighting levels by at least 50% after 11:00

properties or roads shall not exceed 0.1 foot-candles.
9. Security Lighting.
The purpose of and need for security lighting (i.e. the lighting for safety of
persons and property) must be demonstrated. To the extent that an area is
illuminated for other purposes, independent security lighting will be discouraged.
All security fixtures shall be shielded and aimed so that illumination is directed
only to designated areas and not cast onto other areas. In no case shall lighting
be directed above a horizontal plane through the top of the lighting fixture and the
fixture shall include shields that prevent the light source or lens from being visible
from adjacent properties and roadways. The use of general floodlighting fixtures
shall be discouraged.
10. Illumination of Building Façades.
When buildings and structures are to be illuminated, the Planning Commission
shall approve a design for the illumination and the following shall apply:
A. Lighting fixtures shall be carefully located, aimed and shielded so that
light is directed only onto the building façade. Lighting fixtures shall not
be directed toward adjacent streets, roads, or properties.

SECTION 21.08 GRADING AND STORM WATER.
The North East Beltline Overlay District
21-15
1. Description and Purpose.
Hillsides and natural landforms can be included in the category of critical natural
areas. Unlike many other types of features such as woodlots, wildlife and even
groundwater, once landforms are gone they are not renewable. For this reason,
they play an important role in building community character. This fact is clearly
evident on the East Beltline with its rolling topography. The majority of
participants in the planning process for the North East Beltline Joint Development
Plan viewed these visual attributes as important features. Development of
hillsides can affect the equilibrium of vegetation, surface geology, slopes, soils
and run-off. It can also drastically change the way community or neighborhood
character is perceived. For these reasons, the following regulations shall apply.
2. Protection of wetlands, streams and steep slopes.
A. Streams and Wetlands:
i. Grading or removal of vegetative cover shall not be permitted
within 25 feet of a wetland in any zoning district.
ii. Grading, removal of vegetative cover and construction of new
structures shall not be permitted within 50 feet of an intermittent
stream or 75 feet of a perennial stream.
iii. In residential developments, wetlands shall be located in
required open space rather than on residential lots or units
unless the Planning Commission or the Committee determines
that the location in an open space cannot be reasonably
achieved.
iv. Wetlands and the required buffers for wetlands and streams
shall be delineated on final plats, final site condominium plans,
condominiums and site plans with a clear notation of use
restrictions.
B. Steep Slopes: Steep slopes are slopes of 25% or greater.
i. Grading or removal of vegetative cover shall not be permitted on
land with existing steep slopes, except when:
A. The contiguous area of steep slopes is less than 20,000
square feet; and
B. There is insufficient area outside of stream and wetland
buffers for required sedimentation and erosion control
measures.
ii. Areas containing existing steep slopes should preferably be
included in open space lots or areas.
C. Waiver: Disturbance of Wetlands, Streams and Steep Slopes:Grading or
removal of vegetative cover on wetlands, streams, wetland buffers or
steep slopes is not permitted unless the Planning Commission
determines, based on justification provided by the developer that it is
necessary for road or utility construction, trails, pathways, or storm water
management facilities. If permitted, the grading or removal of vegetative
cover shall only be to the extent necessary to accommodate the
proposed development. In these cases, the Planning Commission may
require planting of areas where grading or removal of vegetative cover
has taken place.
3. Site Plan Review Procedures.
The following site plan review procedures shall apply and will help to minimize
the negative impacts of extensive site grading:
The North East Beltline Overlay District
21-16
A. Site plan review by the Planning Commission shall be required for any

will be used.
SECTION 21.09 MOTOR VEHICLE ACCESS.
1. Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to control and limit motor vehicle access ways and
the distance between them onto the East Beltline. Access ways or driveways
must be correctly spaced so as to protect the capacity of this highway and to
protect the safety of motorists using the highway while allowing reasonable
access.
2. Definition of Access.
For the purposes of this section of this Overlay Zone an ?access? is an entrance
and/or exit for motor vehicles to or from the East Beltline or other public road.
3. Non-signalized Access Spacing.
Adjacent accesses shall be spaced as far apart as on-site circulation allows.
Table 1 shows the minimum non-signalized access spacing as a function of
The North East Beltline Overlay District
21-17
posted speed. These distances are based on average acceleration and
deceleration considered adequate to maintain good traffic operations. A longer
spacing may be required if sight distances are limited at the proposed access
location.

4. Lack of Sufficient Frontage to Maintain Adjacent Spacing.
A. In the event that a particular parcel lacks sufficient frontage to maintain
adequate spacing, the Planning Commission may require one or more
the following.
i. An access point to a side street.
ii. Access to frontage roads or service drives where they exist or
can be constructed.
iii. A shared driveway with the adjacent owners. In such case the
driveway midpoint should be located at the property line between
two parcels. All parties shall agree to the joint driveway in
writing.
If options listed above are not reasonably feasible, the Planning
Commission may allow the next lowest spacing from Table (1). For
example, on 50 mph roadway requiring 140 meters (455 ft.) spacing, the
distance may be reduced to no less then 105m (350 ft.), which is the
spacing for 45 mph speed.
If all the above options are impossible, an access point may be allowed
within the property limits.
B. In the event that two or more adjacent parcels do not have sufficient
frontage to maintain adequate spacing for access, the Planning
Commission may require the dedication of joint access easements or
cross access easements for shared access to the public street.
5. Passing Flares at Driveways, Right-Turn Lanes or Tapers at Intersections, and
Left-Turn Lanes or Passing Flares at Intersections shall be provided in
accordance with Michigan Department of Transportation guidelines.
6. Intersection Corner Clearance:
Accesses shall not be situated within the functional boundary of at-grade
intersections. This boundary includes the longitudinal limits of right turn and left
The North East Beltline Overlay District

CHAPTER 22
10 MILE ROAD OVERLAY DISTRICT
SECTION 22.01 PURPOSE. Ten Mile Road serves as the boundary line between Algoma and
Plainfield Township. It also serves as a major road connecting the City of Rockford with US 131
and as such, 10 Mile Road is a gateway to all three communities. The City of Rockford, Algoma
and Plainfield Townships therefore share a common interest in the future development of 10 Mile
Road.
The future use of the land abutting this roadway particularly at the US 131 interchange, and the
amount of traffic carried by 10 Mile Road will affect all three communities. In order to create a
positive future, cooperation among all three communities is essential.
The three communities of Algoma Township, Plainfield Charter Township and the City of
Rockford have jointly adopted the 10 Mile Road Corridor Plan which sets forth transportation and
land use objectives for the corridor as well as recommendations for future land use.
The intent of the 10 Mile Road Overlay Zone is to provide for a set of zoning regulations to carry
out the 10 Mile Road Corridor Plan. These regulations are compatible with a similar zone in
Algoma Township and the City of Rockford.
The specific purposes of this district are to:
A. Maximize the capacity of the road by limiting, and controlling the number and
location of driveways and requiring alternate means of access through shared
driveways, service drives, and access from side streets.
B. Ensure sufficient right-of-way for future widening of 10 Mile Road as properties
develop and re-develop.
C. Provide non-motorized pathways along 10 Mile Road.
D. Facilitate high-quality development and redevelopment of commercial and office
districts through quality architecture, efficient site design and landscaping.
E. Require low level signs to minimize motorist distraction, avoid blight, and clutter,
promote aesthetics and unify signage with the overall character desired in the
corridor while providing property owners and businesses with an appropriate
mechanism in which to identify their location and business.
F. Require landscaping on sites along the corridor as they develop and redevelop to
attain the desired green space, buffering between uses and the high quality
appearance of the corridor.
G. Preserve important existing natural features which provide a rural atmosphere for
the communities along the corridor.
SECTION 22.02 APPLICABILITY. The standards of this Chapter shall apply to all lands with
frontage along 10 Mile Road to a depth of 500 feet from the existing or future right of way line of
10 Mile Road between Herrington Avenue and Childsdale Avenue, which is illustrated as the 10

24-1
CHAPTER 24
F FLOOD ZONE OVERLAY DISTRICT
SECTION 24.01 PURPOSE It is the intent of this district to apply special regulation to the use of
land in those areas subject to periodic inundation. Such regulation is deemed necessary to
protect the public health, safety, and general welfare and to reduce public and private
expenditures imposed on the community and its residents by such periodic flooding. These
regulations are also intended to reserve areas for the impoundment of water, to stabilize stream
flow and to maintain a proper ecological balance. In addition, these regulations are intended to
comply with the provisions and requirements of the National Flood Insurance program, as
constituted in accord with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, and regulations
promulgated in furtherance of such program by the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development, Federal Insurance Administration.
SECTION 24.02 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance administration in its report
entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for the Township of Plainfield" dated July, 1980 with
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps is hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. The Flood Insurance Study is
on file at the Township Offices. Where Federal Insurance administration data is not available, the
best available flood plain information shall be utilized.
SECTION 24.03 DEFINITIONS For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall be
used:
A. Area of special flood hazard The land in the flood plain subject to a one percent
or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
B. Base flood The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
C. Development Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling,
grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of
special flood hazard.
D. Flood A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas from the overflow of waters or the unusual and rapid
accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
E. Flood Insurance Rate Map (Firm) The official map on which the Federal
Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
F. Flood Insurance Study The official report provided in which the Federal
Insurance Administration has provided flood profiles, as well as the Flood
Boundary-Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
G. Habitable floor Any floor usable for living purposes, which includes working,
sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A floor used
only for storage purposes is not a "habitable floor."
H. New construction Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on
or after the effective date of this ordinance.
F FLOOD ZONE
24-2
I. Regulatory Floodway The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood.
J. Start of construction The first placement of permanent construction of a structure
(other than a mobile home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or
any work beyond the state of excavation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation such as clearing, grading, and filling, nor does it include
the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor
does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main
structure. For a structure (other than a mobile home) without a basement or
poured footings, the "start of construction" includes the first permanent framing or
assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or foundation. For
mobile homes, "start of construction" is the date on which the construction of
facilities for servicing the site on which the mobile home is to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the construction of streets, either final site grading or
the pouring of concrete pads, and installation of utilities) is completed.
K. Substantial improvement Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 25 percent of its market value as
determined by the township assessment records, of the valuation of the
structure, either:
(1) Before the improvement or repair is started, or
(2) If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of
the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure
to comply with existing State or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe occupancy.
SECTION 24.04 DELINEATION OF FLOOD ZONES The flood zones shall overlay zoning
districts delineated on the official zoning map. In addition to other requirements of this Ordinance
applicable to development in the underlying zoning district, compliance with the requirements of
this chapter shall be necessary for all development occurring within the flood zones. Conflicts
between the requirements of this chapter and other requirements of this Ordinance or any other
ordinance shall be resolved in favor of this chapter and other requirements of this Ordinance shall
be resolved in favor of this chapter except where the conflicting requirement is more stringent and
would further the objectives of this chapter. In such cases the more stringent requirement shall
be applied.
A. Flood hazard zone. This zone shall coincide with the boundaries of the areas
designated as A and A9 on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
B. Regulatory floodway zone. The boundaries of the regulatory floodway zone shall
coincide with the floodway boundaries indicated on the Flood Boundary and
Floodway Map.
SECTION 24.05 FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION In all areas of special flood hazard, the
following standards are required.

1. Determine that the permit requirements of this ordinance have been
satisfied.
2. Determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those
Federal, State or local governmental agencies from which prior approval
is required.
3. Determine if the proposed development adversely affects the flood
carrying capacity of the area of special flood hazard. For the purposes of
this ordinance, "adversely affects" means damage to adjacent properties
because of rises in flood stages attributed to physical changes of the
channel and the adjacent over bank areas.
a. If it is determined that there is no adverse effect, then the permit
shall be granted consistent with the provisions of this ordinance.
b. If it is determined that there is an adverse effect, then flood
damage mitigation measures shall be made a condition of the
permit.
4. Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of
the lowest habitable floor (including basement) of all new or substantially
improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a
basement.
5. For all new or substantially improved flood proofed structures:
a. Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structure has been flood proofed.
b. Maintain the required flood proofing certifications.

this ordinance.
7. Notify adjacent communities and the Michigan Department of Natural
Resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and
submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance
Administration, and require that maintenance is provided within the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying
capacity is not diminished.
F FLOOD ZONE
24-6
SECTION 24.08 VARIANCES Variances from the provisions of this Chapter shall be granted
by the Board of Appeals only upon a determination of compliance with the general standards for
variances contained in this ordinance, and each of the following specific standards:
A. A variance shall not be granted within the regulatory floodway zone where the
result would be any increase in flood levels during a base flood discharge, except
upon certification by a registered engineer or the Department of Natural
Resources that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not harmfully
increase the water surface elevation of a base flood. In determining whether a
harmful increase will occur, compliance with Public Act 245 of 1929, as amended
by Public Act 167 of 1968, shall be required.
B. A variance shall be granted only upon:
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in flood
heights in excess of those permitted by this Ordinance, additional threats
to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or
ordinances.
C. The variance granted shall be the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief to the applicant.
D. The Board of Appeals may attach conditions to the granting of a variance to
insure compliance with the standards contained in this ordinance.
E. Variances may be granted for the reconstruction, rehabilitation of structures listed
on the National Register of Historic Places or the Michigan Historic Markers
listing of historic sites or any other state register of historic places without regard
to the requirements of this section governing variances in flood hazard areas.

proposal in the designated flood areas shall not constitute a representation, guarantee, or
warranty of any type by the Township or by any official or employee thereof of the practicality or
safety of any structure or use. Nor do these regulations imply that areas outside the designated
flood areas will be free from periodic flooding or flood damages, and shall create no liability upon,
or a cause of action against such public body, official, or employee for any damage that may
result pursuant thereto.
PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
25-1
CHAPTER 25
PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
SECTION 25.01 DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE. The use, area, height, bulk, and placement
regulations of this Ordinance are primarily applicable to the usual situation of one principal
building on a lot. In certain large developments, these requirements would result in situations
less in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare than if a controlled degree of flexibility
were allowed. The PUD Planned Unit Development District is intended to accomplish the
objectives of the Plainfield Charter Township Zoning Ordinance through a land development
project review process based on the application of site planning criteria to achieve integration of
the proposed land development project with the characteristics of the project area.
It is intended that this District shall afford each type of land use reasonable protection from
encroachment or interference by other incompatible land uses, and that reasonable protection be
afforded to uses adjacent to this District. Areas may be zoned under this District when problems
of size, shape, terrain, topography, adjacent uses, or natural resources may require special
regulations.
Zoning under this chapter of any area of Plainfield Charter Township and all proceedings in
regard thereto shall be done with due consideration for maintenance of reasonable conditions
regarding emission and transmission of injurious or obnoxious noise, fire or explosion hazard,
liquid or solid waste disposal, vibration, gas fumes, smoke, dust, dirt, litter, odor, light, glare,
traffic congestion, ingress and egress, ease of police and fire protection, drainage, lateral land
support, blighting influence, effect on properly values, light and air, overcrowding of persons,
sanitation, general appearance of the area, surface and groundwater quality, and other similar
considerations having an effect on public health, safety and general welfare.
SECTION 25.02 USE REGULATIONS. Land in the PUD District may be developed for various
compatible uses allowed by the Plainfield Charter Township Zoning Ordinance and for other uses
not specifically provided for in the Plainfield Charter Township Zoning Ordinance.
SECTION 25.03 PROCEDURES. Any Zoning District in Plainfield Charter Township may be rezoned
a PUD Planned Unit Development District provided the procedures and requirements set
forth in the following sections are met.
SECTION 25.04. PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN  SUBMISSION AND CONTENT.

SECTION 25.09. PUBLIC HEARING. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing in
accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance set forth in Chapter 34 pertaining to
amendments to this Ordinance and Section 14 of Public Act 184 of 1943, as amended pertaining
PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
25-4
to rezonings for the purpose of receiving comments relative to the final development plan and the
proposed rezoning.
SECTION 25.10. PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW OF FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. The
Planning Commission shall consider the final development plan based on all the requirements of
this Ordinance and specifically the considerations listed in Sections 25.05 and 25.08 and shall,
when appropriate, recommend that specific changes be made to conform with the spirit, purpose,
intent and provisions of this Ordinance and the intent and purpose of the Comprehensive Plan.
If the Planning Commission shall determine that the proposed use of the land as shown on the
final development plan might have an enervating, debilitating or offensive effect on adjacent
properties, whether industrial, commercial, residential or other, through the conflicts of noise,
smoke, odor, dust and dirt, noxious gases, glare and heat, vibrations, fire or explosion hazards,
liquid or solid industrial wastes, traffic, or adverse aesthetic effects, the Commission may require
the owner, through the use of qualified technical persons and acceptable testing techniques, to
demonstrate the devices which shall be utilized to control the factors determined to be offensive.
Upon acceptance by the Planning Commission of such control devices, they shall be incorporated
as a part of the final development plan.
SECTION 25.11. PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL OF THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT
PLAN AND RECOMMENDATION FOR REZONING. The Planning Commission shall forward a
Zoning Report to the Township Board regarding its recommendation. The Planning Commission
may approve the final development plan with changes as it deems appropriate. Upon approval of
the rezoning request by the Township Board, the final development plan, as recommended for
approval by the Planning Commission, shall be incorporated into, and become a part of, the
zoning ordinance text and map. In the event the Planning Commission does not recommend the
final development plan for approval, it shall be returned to the applicant and a copy forwarded to
the Township Board with appropriate notations as to why the development plan was not
recommended for approval.
SECTION. 25.12. REZONING BY THE TOWNSHIP BOARD. After the Planning Commission
has recommended approval or denial of the final development plan, the Township Board shall act
upon the rezoning request. Approval of the rezoning request shall be in accord with the
procedures established in this Ordinance. In the event the Township Board disapproves the
rezoning request, it shall notify the applicant, stating the reasons therefore.
SECTION. 25.13. SITE PLAN APPROVAL. Upon approval of the rezoning and prior to the
issuance of any building permit, the applicant is required to obtain site plan approval in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter 32 for the entire project or any phase as proposed and
approved in the Section 25.08 D.
SECTION 25.14. GENERAL PROVISIONS: PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
DISTRICTS.
A. Minimum Size- In order to be zoned as a PUD District, the proposed area shall
consist of at least five acres and have a minimum of two hundred feet of frontage
on a public or approved private street.
B. Sewer and Water Service - In the event public sewer and/or water service is not
available at the time of development, the PUD may utilize a private sewer and/or
water system, provided such sewer and/or water system is approved by the Kent
County Department of Public Works and/or Health Department, the Township
Board, and the Township Engineer. At such time as public sewer and/or water
service is available, the developer shall make arrangements to connect to said
sewer and/or water system.
PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
25-5
C. Maximum Residential Densities (dwelling units per acre)  In any PUD District
which includes residential dwelling units the maximum densities shall be
determined on the basis of the gross area of the proposed PUD District devoted
to residential use divided by the total number of dwelling units.
In the following districts, the maximum permitted density can vary within any
residential district with the utilization of the clustering/open space preservation
technique. For the purposes of this chapter, the ?clustering/open space
preservation technique? is a predominately single family, attached and detached
residential development in which dwellings units are placed together into one or
more groupings within a defined project area. The dwelling units are separated
from adjacent properties or other groupings of dwellings by substantial open
space that is perpetually protected from development.
A guideline of the possible maximum permitted density, minimum lot size and lot
width when utilizing the clustering/open space technique is provided in the
following tables for areas master planned Rural Preserve and Rural Estate:

The amount of open space shall be, at a minimum, 40 percent of the
gross area of the site as dedicated open space. The following land
areas shall not be classified as dedicated open space for the purposes of
this section:
1. The area within any public street right-of-way.
2. The area within private road access right-of-way.
3. Any easement for overhead utility lines unless adjacent to qualified open
space.

surface water bodies, or wetlands.
5. Fifty percent (50%) of a golf course.
6. The area within a platted lot or site condominium unit.
7. Parking and loading areas.
Open space shall be required along any existing public road frontage
abutting the site. The depth of these areas shall be at least 100 feet not
including the public right-of-way, and this area shall be left in its natural
condition or landscaped to help reduce the view of houses on site from
the adjacent roadway and to preserve the rural view.
The applicant shall provide an open space preservation and
maintenance agreement to the Planning Commission and Township
Board stating that all dedicated open space portions of the development
shall be maintained in the manner approved. The agreement must be
acceptable to the Township Board and may consist of a deed restriction,
covenants that run perpetually with the land, or a conservation easement
in recordable form and enforceable by the Township. Documentation of
recording shall be provided to the Township before building permits are
issued.
D. Comparison Plan. For residential Planned Unit Developments, the Planning
Commission and/or Township Board may require the preparation and submittal
by the applicant a feasible Comparison Plan based on the underlying zoning.
The Comparison Plan shall meet the requirements of Chapter 32, Site Plan
Review and be reviewed by the Community Development Department for
compliance with the requirements of the underlying zoning. The Community
Development Department shall provide an evaluative report on the feasibility of
the comparison plan. The number of dwelling units illustrated on a feasible
comparison plan may be used by the Planning Commission and Township Board
as guideline in determining the appropriate density.
E. Performance Bonds/Letter of Credit- The Planning Commission is empowered to
require a performance bond, letter of credit, or certified check in an amount up to
the estimated cost of improvements associated with the project. Such
performance guarantee shall be deposited with the Clerk of the Township at the
time of the issuance of the permit authorizing the activity or project to insure
faithful completion of the improvements indicated with the approved site
development plan; if not, said performance bond shall be forfeited. The
Township shall rebate a proportional share of the deposit, shown requested by
the depositor, based on the percent of improvements completed as attested to by
the depositor and verified by the Community Development Director. The
Community Development Director may, at his discretion, call upon professional
assistance from the Township Engineer. In cases where the provisions of the
final development plan, as approved, have not been met, the amount of the
aforementioned performance guarantee shall be used by the Township to return
the property to a safe and healthy condition; and the balance, if any, shall be
returned to the applicant.
F. Time limitations on Development  A building permit shall be taken out or
construction activity must have begun for each PUD and the project shall be
under construction within one year after the date of final approval by the
Township Board. If said development does not fulfill this provision, the Planning
Commission may grant a one-year extension provided the developers request an
extension in writing before the one year period expires and present reasonable
evidence to the effect that the PUD has encountered unforeseen difficulties but is
PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
25-7
now ready to proceed. Should the aforementioned provisions not be fulfilled, the
Planning Commission may initiate proceedings to rezone the property back to its
previous zone district classification.
G. Required Improvements Prior to Issuance of Occupancy Permit. The Planning
Commission is hereby empowered to stipulate that all required improvements be
constructed and completed prior to issuing an occupancy permit. In the event
said improvements are partially completed to the point where occupancy would
not impair the health, safety, and general welfare of residents, but are not fully
completed, the Planning Commission may, upon the recommendation of the
Community Development Director, grant an occupancy permit so long as the
developer deposits a performance bond with the Township Clerk in an amount
equal to the cost of the improvements yet to be made; said improvements to be
completed within one year of the date of issuance of the occupancy permit.
H. The Planning Commission and the Township Board are specially authorized to
require the recording of a plat or master deed for a condominium development in
connection with any such application when such would be required by the
Subdivision Control Act of 1967, as amended, for the State of Michigan.
I. Additional Provisions - All of the provisions of the Zoning and other ordinances of
the Township shall control in the PUD District except where inconsistent
therewith, in which case the provisions of the PUD District shall supersede and
control any other such provisions.
J. The Planning Commission and Township Board may impose reasonable
conditions with any approval.

CHAPTER 26
OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
SECTION 26.01 APPLICABILITY. The provisions of this Chapter are intended to carry out the
provisions of Public Act No. 177 of 2001, as amended, being MCLA 125.286h et seq. (?Act
No. 177?). In order for a landowner to exercise the open space preservation option of that
statute, the land involved must be rezoned to a planned unit development (?PUD?) zoning
designation pursuant to this Chapter and all of the requirements of this Chapter must be met.
Additionally, the PUD provisions of Chapter 25 of this Ordinance shall also apply except to the
extent that an express provision of this Chapter modifies the PUD process. Act No. 177 requires
that townships having a population of 1,800 or more and which have a zoning ordinance must
adopt provisions in their zoning ordinances known as ?open space preservation? provisions,
which permit lands satisfying certain criteria to be developed, at the option of the landowner, with
the same number of dwellings on a portion of the land specified in the zoning ordinance, but not
more than 50%, that, as determined by the townships could otherwise be developed under
existing ordinances, laws, and rules on the entire land area. The purpose of this Chapter is to
adopt open space preservation provisions consistent with the requirements of Act No. 177.
SECTION 26.02 DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions shall
apply:
A. ?Land zoned for residential development? shall mean any land located in the RP Rural
Preservation, and RE Rural Estate zoning districts pursuant to this Ordinance.
B. ?Act No. 177? shall mean Public Act No. 177 of 2001, as amended, being
MCLA 125.286h et seq
.
SECTION 26.03 QUALIFYING CONDITIONS.
A. Land may be developed pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter and Act No. 177
only if all of the following requirements and conditions are met:
1. The land is located in the RP Rural Preservation and RE Rural Estate zoning
districts pursuant to this Zoning Ordinance;
2. The development of land pursuant to this Chapter shall not depend upon the
extension of a public sanitary sewer or a public water supply system to the
land, unless the development of the land without the exercise of the clustering
or open space option provided for by this Chapter would also depend on such
extension; and
3. The clustering or open space option provided pursuant to this Chapter shall not
have previously been exercised with respect to the same land.
B. If all of the preceding conditions and requirements listed in this Section 26.03 are
satisfied, the land may be developed, at the option of the landowner, in accordance
with the provisions and requirements of this Chapter.
SECTION 26.04 PERMITTED USES. Only those single-family residential land uses permitted by
the zoning district in which the land is located shall be permitted on land developed or used
pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter.
SECTION 26.05 PROCESS. Only land located in the RP Rural Preservation and RE Rural
Estate zoning districts is eligible for the open space preservation option provided for in this
Chapter and pursuant to Act No. 177. Should the owner of a property within the RP Rural
OPEN SPACE PUD
26-2
Preservation and RE Rural Estate zoning districts desire to take advantage of such option, the
landowner must apply for a PUD rezoning approval pursuant to the procedural requirements of
Chapter 25 of this Zoning Ordinance. Once the land is zoned for a PUD pursuant to this Chapter,
it will be deemed a ?Residential-Open Space Preservation PUD.? All of the normal minimum lot
size, setback, road frontage, lot width, width-to-depth ratio, and other dimensional, frontage, and
area requirements governing the development of land within the zoning district where the land is
located shall apply except to the extent that such standards are expressly varied pursuant to this
Chapter or where the Township Board (upon recommendation of the Planning Commission)
approves such a variation pursuant to the PUD approval process.
SECTION 26.06 APPLICATION AND REVIEW PROCEDURE.
A. The application requirements and review procedures for land proposed to be
developed pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter shall be those stated in
Chapters 25 and 32 of this Ordinance, governing site plans and planned unit
developments, except as otherwise expressly provided in this and this Chapter.
B. In addition to the application materials required by Chapters 25 and 32 of this
Ordinance, an application for the development of land under the provisions of this
Chapter shall also include the following
:
1. The Existing Zoning Plan. The applicant shall prepare and submit to the
Township a site plan for the purpose of demonstrating the number and location of
dwelling units that could be developed on the land at issue under its existing
zoning if the clustering or open space option provided for by this Chapter were
not exercised. The Existing Zoning Plan may be conceptual in nature, but shall
include at least the following information:
a. Date, north arrow and scale, which shall not be more than 1? =
100, and, in all cases, the scale shall be the same as that utilized
for the site development plan illustrating the proposed
development using the clustering option permitted by this Chapter.
b. Location of all streets and driveways, existing and proposed.
c. Location of all lots, illustrating lot area, frontage, and the width of each lot to
demonstrate compliance with the minimum requirements of the applicable
zoning district.
d. Location of all utilities that would be necessary to serve a development
under the Existing Zoning Plan and which would not be located within any
public road right-of-way or private road easement, or on buildable lots.
Such utilities include, but are not limited to, storm water retention or
detention basins, community sewage treatment systems and community
water supply facilities.
e. If development under the Existing Zoning Plan would require the use of
septic tanks and drain fields, the Existing Zoning Plan shall illustrate the
location of all septic tanks and drain fields. The applicant shall submit proof
that the proposed septic tank and drain field location for each lot would be
approved, or has been approved, by the Kent County Health Department.
f. The location of all portions of the land that are unbuildable for residential
purposes due to the presence of wetlands, severe slopes, flood plains, or
other features prohibiting development for residential purposes.
OPEN SPACE PUD
26-3
g. If any portion of the land has frontage on a lake, river, or stream, the
Existing Zoning Plan shall show each such body of water, as well as the
number and location of dwelling units that could be developed with frontage
on or access to each such body of water under existing zoning if the open
space or clustering option provided for by this Chapter were not exercised.
2. The Site Development Plan. The applicant shall also submit a site plan
for the open space or clustering option permitted by this Chapter, which,
in addition to the site plan requirements specified by Chapters 25 and 32
of this Ordinance, shall also include all of the following information:
a. Date, north arrow and scale, which shall not be more than 1? =
100, and, in all cases, the scale shall be the same as that utilized
for the Existing Zoning Plan.
b. The site development plan shall clearly illustrate the portions of the
land that are proposed to remain in a perpetually undeveloped
state and the portions of the land that will be used for clustered
development.
c. The site development plan shall indicate the total number of acres
of land that are proposed to remain in a perpetually undeveloped
state, the total number of acres of land that are proposed to be
used for cluster development, and the percentage of each, as
compared to the total site acreage.
d. The site development plan shall illustrate the location of all lots and
proposed building envelopes and shall indicate the lot area,
frontage, and width of each lot, and the proposed front, side and
rear yard building setbacks. The number of lots on the site
development plan shall not exceed the number of lots on the
Existing Zoning Plan, as approved by the Planning Commission,
and reduced to accommodate non-dwelling structures, if
necessary, as described later in this Chapter.
e. The site development plan shall also illustrate the location and type
of all proposed structures or improvements that are not dwellings.
f. If the proposed clustered development will include septic tanks and
drain fields, the site development plan shall illustrate the location of
all septic tanks and drain fields. The applicant shall submit proof
that the proposed septic tank and drain field location for each lot
has been approved by the Kent County Health Department.
h. If the development is to be served by public streets, proof that the
Kent County Road Commission has approved the design, layout
and construction of the streets.
i. If any portion of the land has frontage on a lake, river, or stream,
the site development plan shall show the proposed location and
number of dwelling units with proposed frontage on or access to a
body of water.
i. The location of any proposed private road(s).
OPEN SPACE PUD
26-4
j. The site development plan shall demonstrate that each of the
proposed residential lots and proposed building envelopes is
?buildable? and fully suited for the construction and use of a singlefamily
residential dwelling.
3. Developable Area. When reviewing an application submitted under the
terms of this Chapter, the Planning Commission shall determine whether
the Existing Zoning Plan accurately reflects the number and location of
dwelling units that could be developed on the land under its existing
zoning if the clustering or open space option provided by this Chapter
were not exercised. If the Planning Commission determines that the
number and/or location of dwellings shown on the Existing Zoning Plan
exceeds the number of dwellings that could be permitted or developed
on the land if it were developed under its existing zoning if the clustering
or open space option provided by this Chapter were not exercised (or the
locations are not accurate), the applicant shall submit a revised Existing
Zoning Plan which accurately reflects the number and location of
dwellings which could have been developed under existing zoning if the
Act No. 177 option were not exercised pursuant to this Chapter. For
purposes of determining the number and location of dwellings that would
have been permitted or developed on the land under its existing zoning if
the clustering or open space option were not exercised, the following
shall be deemed land not developable and shall be excluded from the
formula of determining otherwise developable land area under existing
ordinances:
a. Wetlands as defined by Michigan law.
b. Land located under a lake, pond, river, or stream.
c. Land with slopes exceeding 15%.
d. Land for which an on-site private septic system or private well could not be
utilized under Kent County Health Department regulations.
e. Land located within a flood plain or which is subject to periodic flooding.
4. The Restrictions Document. The applicant shall submit a copy of the
proposed deed restrictions, restrictive covenants, conservation
easement, plat dedication, or other legal document which the applicant
proposes to utilize if the proposed open space or cluster development is
approved pursuant to this Chapter and which would have the legal effect
of preserving in perpetuity the open space required by this Chapter in an
undeveloped state. Such document shall be reviewed and approved by
the Township and the Township Attorney (as to form and content) prior
to recording. At a minimum, the document(s) shall provide for all of the
following:
a. Indicate the proposed permitted use(s) of the undeveloped open space.
b. Require that the open space be maintained forever in an undeveloped
condition, without buildings, structures, or other improvements, except
such drainage improvements, utilities, riding trails, hiking trails, picnic
areas, park or playground equipment, growing of crops, agricultural
OPEN SPACE PUD
26-5
structures, or similar improvements which are approved by the Planning
Commission.
c. Require that the undeveloped open space be maintained by the parties
who have an ownership interest in it.
d. Provide standards for scheduled maintenance of the undeveloped open
space, including necessary pruning and harvesting of trees and new
plantings.
e. The approved restrictions document shall be fully executed by all
of the owner(s) of the land and shall be recorded with the Kent
County Register of Deeds before any lots are sold and before
any building permits are issued.
5. If the site development plan complies and all aspects of the proposed
development satisfy all requirements of this Chapter, the Planning
Commission and Township Board shall approve the site development
plan and the planned unit development rezoning for the proposed
development.
SECTION 26.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR OPEN SPACE.
A. Required Open Space. At least 50%, but no more than 80%, of the land
proposed for development under the provisions of this Chapter shall remain in a
perpetually undeveloped state (i.e., ?open space?) by means of a conservation
easement, plat dedication, restrictive covenant, or other legal instrument that
runs with the land as approved by the Township Board (upon recommendation
by the Planning Commission) and the Township Attorney.
B. Lands to be Set Aside as Open Space. It shall be the Township Board (upon
recommendation from the Planning Commission) that determines which 50% or
more of the land shall be set aside for open space, as well as which portion or
portions of the land may be developed. At the discretion of the Township Board
(upon recommendation from the Planning Commission), the land to be set aside
as permanent open space need not be contiguous. The Township Board (upon
recommendation from the Planning Commission) shall also determine what
percentage of the total land area (between 50% and 80%) shall be set aside as
permanent open space.
C. The following areas shall not constitute open space and may not be utilized to satisfy the
open space requirement:
1. Any areas located within or under any public street easement or right-of-way.
2. Property located under or within any private road or road easement.
3. The land located under or the area within any easement for overhead utility
lines.
4. The area within a platted lot or site condominium unit.
5. Off-street parking areas.

10. Lands with slopes exceeding 15%.
11. Areas subject to flooding or within a flood plain.
12. Areas comprising a golf course (including fairways and holes).
D. Standards for Open Space. The following standards shall apply to the open
space required pursuant to this Chapter:
1. The open space may include a recreational trail, picnic area, childrens play
area, greenway, linear park, an agricultural use or other use which, as
determined by the Planning Commission, is substantially similar to these
uses.
2. The open space shall be available for all residents of the development,
subject to reasonable rules and regulations. The open space may be, but is
not required to be, dedicated to the use of the public.
3. If the land contains a lake, stream or other body of water, the Planning
Commission may require that a portion of the open space abut the body of
water.
4. A portion of the open space shall be located along the public street frontage
abutting the land. The depth of this area shall be at least 50 feet, not
including public right-of-way, and this area shall be left in its natural condition
or be landscaped to help to preserve or enhance the existing views.
5. A portion of the open space shall be reasonably useable by the residents of
the land for passive recreational uses such as hiking or picnicking.
6. Open space shall be located so as to be reasonably accessible to the
residents of the development. Safe and convenient pedestrian access points
to the open space from the interior of the clustered development shall be
provided.
7. Open space shall be located so as to preserve significant natural resources,
natural features, scenic or wooded conditions, bodies of water, wetlands or
agricultural land.
E. Use of Open Space. All dwelling units and other structures and improvements
shall be located outside that portion of the land designated as open space.
However, the Township Board (upon recommendation by the Planning
Commission), at its discretion, may permit structures or improvements to be
located in the open space if the structures and/or improvements would be
consistent with the designated purpose of the open space. By way of example
only, park or playground equipment could be permitted on open space
designated for recreational use, or agricultural structures could be permitted on
open space designated for agricultural use.

SECTION 26.08 INDIVIDUAL LOTS, STREETS, AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS;
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
A. Underlying Zoning District. The development of land under this Chapter shall
comply with all requirements of this Ordinance applicable to the zoning district in
which the land requested to be rezoned from is located, except those setback,
area, lot width to depth ratio, and yard size requirements that must be adjusted to
allow the clustering option permitted under this Chapter where approved by the
Township Board (upon recommendation from the Planning Commission).
B. Uniform Lot Size. Lots for dwellings in the clustered portion of the development
shall be as uniform in area as is reasonably practicable, unless otherwise
approved by the Township Board (upon recommendation from the Planning
Commission).
C. Building Envelopes. The location and area of building envelopes, as proposed by
the applicant, shall be subject to the review and approval of the Township Board
(upon recommendation from the Planning Commission). The location and area
of building envelopes shall be established to achieve the intent and purpose of
the zoning district in which the land is located.
D Required Street Frontage; Lot Width. Each lot shall have a minimum width and
road frontage equal to no less than the greater of (1) 1/2 the minimum lot width
specified for the zoning district in which the land is located, or (2) 60 feet, unless
otherwise approved by the Township Board (upon recommendation from the
Planning Commission). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, each
lot which abuts or has frontage on a lake, river, stream or creek shall have
frontage on such body of water equal to or greater than the minimum lot width
requirement for the zoning district in which the land is located.
E. Maximum Number of Lots. The clustered portion of the development shall contain
no more than the maximum number of lots, as determined from the Existing
Zoning Plan approved by the Planning Commission and Township Board, and as
reduced to reflect the inclusion of non-dwelling unit structures, if any, as described
in subsection G.
F. Non-dwelling Unit Structures. Lots containing non-dwelling structures such as a
clubhouse and its related amenities, shall be subject to all requirements of this
Chapter applicable to lots containing dwellings and shall further be subject to all
other requirements of this Ordinance and other Township ordinances applicable to
the type of structure proposed. However, the Township Board (upon
recommendation by the Planning Commission) may, at its discretion, permit the
enlargement of a lot containing a non-dwelling structure so as to reasonably
accommodate it.
G. Reduction in Lots for Non-Dwelling Structures. If structures other than dwellings,
such as a clubhouse, are constructed on a lot in the clustered portion of the land,
the number of dwelling lots permitted in the clustered portion of the land shall be
reduced as follows:
1. The area of a lot or lots occupied by non-dwelling structures, shall be
calculated and then divided by the average area of a dwelling lot that could be
situated in the clustered development if the non-dwelling structures were not
included in the clustered development, as determined from the approved
OPEN SPACE PUD
26-8
Existing Zoning Plan. If this number is a fraction, it shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole number.
2. The number calculated under subsection 1 shall be subtracted from the
number of dwelling lots that could be permitted in the clustered development
in the absence of the non-dwelling structures, as determined from the
approved Existing Zoning Plan, in order to determine the maximum number of
dwelling lots permitted to be included in the clustered portion of the
development with the non-dwelling structures included.
H. Perimeter Lots. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, the Township
Board (upon recommendation from the Planning Commission) may require that
the clustered development be designed and constructed with lot sizes and
setbacks on the perimeter that will be reasonably consistent with the lot sizes and
setbacks of adjacent uses (planned or existing).
I. Sidewalks. The Township Board (upon recommendation from the Planning
Commission) may require sidewalks.
J. Grading. Grading within the clustered development shall comply with the
following requirements:
1. To preserve the natural appearance of the land, all graded areas, cuts and
fills shall be kept to a minimum. Specific requirements may be placed by
the Township Board on the area of land to be graded or to be used for
building, and on the size, height, and angles of cut-and-fill slopes and the
shape thereof. Retaining walls may be required by the Township Board.
2. All areas indicated as open space on the approved development plan shall
be undisturbed by grading, excavating, structures or otherwise, except as
permitted by the Township Board (upon recommendation from the
Planning Commission). Drainage improvements, utility lines, riding trails,
hiking trails, picnic areas, and similar recreational improvements and
amenities may be placed in open space areas if approved by the Township
Board (upon recommendation from the Planning Commission).
3. Grading within the clustered development shall be planned and carried out
so as to avoid erosion, pollution, flooding or other adverse effects upon the
land, and so as to have only such minimal effect upon lakes, streams,
wetlands, and the environmental characteristics of the land as may be
reasonably feasible.
K. Private Roads. Private roads within a clustered development shall conform to the
Townships Private Road Ordinance. The Township Board (upon
recommendation from the Planning Commission) may, however, modify the
requirements for private roads and in doing so, shall consider the following
criteria:
1. The number and type of dwelling units served by the private road;
2. Traffic generation;
3. Existing topography and vegetation;
4. Security provisions;
OPEN SPACE PUD
26-9
5. Inter-relationship with the public street network;
6. Future installation of public utilities; and
7. Likelihood of public dedication of the roadway.
L. Other Laws. The development of land under this Chapter is subject to all other
applicable Township ordinances, and state and federal laws, rules and regulations,
including, but not limited to, the Township Site Condominium Ordinance, the
Township Subdivision Ordinance, rules relating to suitability of groundwater for onsite
water supply for land not served by a public water system, and rules relating to
the suitability of soils for on-site sewage disposal for land not served by public
sanitary sewers.
M. Access to or Frontage on Lakes and Streams.
1. An approved Residential  Open Space Preservation PUD or other approved
development pursuant to Act No. 177 and this Chapter, shall comply fully with
the lake and river access, frontage, and other requirements of this Ordinance (if
any) with regards to lakes, rivers and streams if the property at issue has
frontage on a lake, river or stream.
2. No approved Residential  Open Space Preservation PUD or other
development approved pursuant to Act No. 177 and this Chapter shall permit
any more lots or dwellings to have access to or frontage upon a lake, river or
stream than would be otherwise legally permissible under existing zoning.
N. County Drain Commissioner Approval. Any matters involved with drainage,
retention/detention ponds, water runoff, and similar matters associated with any
proposed development pursuant to this Chapter shall require the approval of the
Kent County Drain Commissioner and shall be subject to the applicable rules and
regulations of the same.
SECTION 26.09 AMENDMENTS TO AN APPROVED RESIDENTIALOPEN SPACE
PUD.
A. An approved site plan and any conditions imposed upon its approval pursuant to an
approved Residential-Open Space Preservation PUD shall not be changed except
upon the mutual consent of the Township Board (after recommendation by the
Planning Commission) and the applicant, except as otherwise stated below with
respect to minor changes.
B. A minor change may be approved by the Planning Commission. The following items
shall be considered minor changes:
1. Reduction of the size of any building, building envelope, or sign.
2. Movement of buildings or signs by no more than ten (10) feet.
3. Plantings approved in the landscaping plan may be replaced by similar types of
plantings.
4. Changes requested by the Township for safety reasons.

5. Changes which will preserve natural features of the land without changing the
basic site layout
6. Reduction in the number of units in an approved site condominium development
SECTION 26.10 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES. The Township Board, at its discretion, may
require reasonable performance guarantees. Such guarantees shall be conditioned upon faithful
compliance with all of the provisions and requirements of this Chapter and the approved site plan
and PUD. Such performance guarantees shall be in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable
letter of credit, or cash deposit in an amount and form deemed by the Township Board to be
appropriate.
SECTION 26.11 TIME LIMITATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT. Each development approved and
permitted pursuant to this Chapter shall be under substantial construction within one (1) year after
the date of approval of the site plan and PUD by the Planning Commission and Township Board.
If this requirement is not met, the Planning Commission may, at its discretion, grant an extension
not exceeding one (1) year, provided that the applicant submits reasonable evidence showing
that unforeseen difficulties or special circumstances have occurred which caused excusable
delay in the commencement of the cluster or open space development. If the approved

30-1
CHAPTER 30
LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING PROVISIONS
SECTION 30.01 SCOPE AND INTENT It is the intent of this section to require the use of buffer
zones and landscape screening to reduce the negative impacts between potentially incompatible
land uses and to provide for specific landscape requirements within parking areas. It is further
intended to preserve and enhance aesthetic qualities, privacy, and property values within the
Township.
This section is applicable to all new site plans and development proposed after the effective date
of this Chapter. Furthermore, this Chapter is applicable to all expansions, renovations, or
alterations that increase the gross floor area of the structure by 25% or more above the floor area
as it existed on the effective date of this Chapter. In addition, subsection 30.02 F. is applicable to
all new or expanded parking areas having a total of more than 25 parking spaces.
SECTION 30.02 REQUIREMENTS
A. For all uses that require site plan approval, the site shall be landscaped in accordance
with a plan and specifications approved by the Planning Commission (or Director of
Community Development Department if administratively approved). The entire site not
devoted to floor area, parking, access ways or pedestrian use shall be appropriately
landscaped with grass, canopy and coniferous trees, shrubs, and ground cover.
Expansion areas shall be placed in grass and kept weed free. Any areas, which
become disturbed for any reason, shall be restored in accordance with the original
landscape plan unless approved otherwise in writing by the Director of Community
Development Department.
B. Landscaping Plan. A detailed landscape plan indicating design intent shall be
submitted as part of the Planning Commissions site plan review (or the Director of
Community Development Department if site plan review is administrative only) and
shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:
1. Location, general type, quality, and size of existing vegetation, including
specimen trees.
2. Existing vegetation to be saved.
3. Methods and details for protecting existing vegetation during construction.
4. Location, sizes, and labels for all proposed plantings.
5. Typical cross section, including slope, height and width, of berms and the type
of ground cover to be placed on them.

diseased, damaged or dead materials shall be replaced in accordance with the
standards of this ordinance.
C. Tree and Landscape Preservation Requirements.
LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING
30-2
1. Site plans should preserve all quality existing trees wherever feasible, especially in
buffer areas. Relocation of existing trees within the site is also encouraged and all
available measures should be taken to maintain the trees in a healthy condition.
2. Existing trees may be used to fulfill landscaping requirements, if such trees are in
healthy growing condition, are at least the minimum size, are the appropriate type,
and are spaced according to their likely mature size.
3. The area below the drip line of an existing tree to be saved should remain
undisturbed. No impervious material should be placed under the drip line and a
tree protection fence must be installed around the trees during construction at the
limit of disturbance. Tree protection symbols notes and details must be shown on
the site plan.
4. Should any tree designated for preservation, for which landscaping credit is given,
die; the owner shall replace the tree with the equivalent species or with a tree
which will obtain the same height, spread and growth characteristics. The
replacement tree must be a minimum of 2.5 inches caliper.
D. Unaccredited Species. The following species are permitted but will not be credited
toward required landscaping because of their brittleness, susceptibility to disease and
insects, excessive root structure, excessive litter, and or other undesirable
characteristics. The planting of these species is not encouraged.
Botanical Name Common Name
Acer Negundo Box Elder
Ailanthus Altissima Tree of Heaven

the adjacent zoning district as set forth in Table 1 is developed.
7. For reasons of conflicting uses, unfavorable topography or other unique or
extraordinary circumstances, the Planning Commission as part of site plan
review (or the Director of Community Development Department if site plan review
is administrative only) may increase or decrease landscape plantings in any
required buffer zone if any increase or decrease is found to be necessary to
reasonably achieve the intent of this section as stated in Section 26.01 above.
F. Front yard; commercial, industrial zones. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
section, all properties in the C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, O, LI, and I Districts, shall have a
buffer zone in the front yard regardless of the adjacent zoning districts or land uses.
Unless a Type B or Type C buffer zone is otherwise required under subsection 30.02
E., the buffer zone in the front yard shall, at a minimum, be a Type A buffer zone as
described in subsection 30.02 E. above.
G. Parking, landscaping.

used to complement the tree landscaping, but shall not be the sole contribution of
the landscaping. Effective use of earth berms and existing topography is also
encouraged as a component of the landscaping plan.
a. Parking lots exceeding five thousand (5,000) square feet (including all
parking spaces, lanes, drives and other areas devoted to vehicular use)
shall be landscaped with at least one landscaped island. For each
additional five thousand (5,000) square feet (or each additional twenty
(20) spaces, whichever is greater) an additional landscape island shall
be required. Landscape islands shall be at least one hundred eighty
(180) square feet in size, with a minimum width of ten (10) feet.
Landscape islands shall be landscaped with one shade canopy tree and
three (3) shrubs for every eight (8) parking spaces.
b. The Community Development Department may allow the substitution of
bump-outs or other landscaping elements in lieu of landscape islands, as
long as the square footage, width, and landscaping requirements are still
met.
c. Where plant material exists on a site prior to its development, such
landscape material may be used if approved as meeting requirements of
this part.
4. All ground surfaces contained within areas designated on the landscape plan as
planting areas shall be planted and maintained in ground cover. Other
landscape elements such as decks, patios and stepping, stones, landscape
zones, and ponds may also be incorporated into such areas.
5. All landscaping shall be protected from vehicular traffic by standard concrete
curbing and gutter.

one year after the date of planting.
2. The Community Development Department shall keep on file a suggested species
list to accommodate various site situations.
3. In an effort to allow flexibility in design, various types of required landscaping may
be substituted with the approval of the Planning Commission as part of site plan
review provided that the desired screening effect is achieved. If site plan review is
not required, the Director of Community Development Department may approve
such substitution.
4. If a property owner cannot plant trees or shrubs required by this section due to
unfavorable planting conditions, the Director of Community Development
Department may grant the property owner not more than six (6) months after
completion of the building or site improvements to install the required trees or
shrubs. The Director of Community Development Department may require a
performance guarantee as a condition of such approval.
5. All landscaping shall be hardy plant materials and maintained thereafter in a neat
and orderly manner. Withered and/or dead plant materials shall be replaced within
a reasonable period of time but no longer than one (1) growing season.
6. Landscaping areas shall be neatly maintained, including mowing, fertilizing,
pruning, and watering, if necessary.
7. Parking and loading areas shall be landscaped and/or fenced in such a manner as
to reasonably interrupt or screen the areas from view.

SECTION 32.05 ACCESS STANDARDS/REQUIREMENTS
A. General Requirements:
1. Each lot shall be permitted to have one driveway provided the spacing
requirements of this section can be achieved. Additional driveways may be
permitted by the Planning Commission for any site, providing the spacing
and alignment criteria listed below are met, and a traffic impact study is
completed which justifies an additional driveway.
2. The Planning Commission may permit two one-way driveways rather than a
single dual movement driveway for particular uses where safer, more
efficient circulation and function for the drives can be demonstrated.
3. The applicant shall submit evidence indicating that the sight distance
requirements of the Kent County Road Commission are met.
4. Driveways shall be located to minimize interference with the free movement
of traffic, to provide adequate sight distance, and to provide the most
favorable driveway grade.
5. For the driveway accessing a county primary or state highway, there must be
enough on-site storage to accommodate at least five queued vehicles waiting
to park or exit in order to minimize the possibility of waiting vehicles creating
a conflict with street traffic movement.
6. Provisions for circulation between adjacent lots should be provided through
coordinated and/or joint parking systems, or other methods, determined at
the time of the site plan review.
7. Driveway entrances must be able to accommodate all vehicle types having
occasion to enter the site, including delivery vehicles.
8. Driveway placement should be such that loading and unloading activities will
not hinder vehicle ingress or egress.
9. For high traffic generators, or for commercial driveways along 10 Mile Road,
the Planning Commission may require two egress lanes.
SITE PLAN REVIEW
32-4
10. A boulevard entrance must comply with the design requirements of the Kent
County Road Commission.
B. Driveway Spacing Standards For Uses Other Than Single Or Two Family
Dwellings.
1. Minimum spacing between two driveways along 10 Mile Road shall be 230
feet measured from centerline to centerline.
2. Minimum spacing requirements between a proposed driveway and a side
street intersection either adjacent or on the opposite side of the street shall
be at least 230 feet. Such distance may be reduced to 125 feet where a
channelized driveway restricting left turns from the site is proposed.
Measurements are from the near edge of the proposed driveway, measured
at the throat perpendicular to the street, to the near lane edge of the
intersecting street or pavement edge for uncurbed sections.
3. To reduce left-turn conflicts, new driveways shall be aligned with those
across the roadway where possible. If alignment is not possible, driveways
shall be offset a minimum of 230 feet along 10 Mile Road, measured
centerline to centerline. Greater offsets may be required depending on the
expected inbound left-turn volumes of the driveways.
4. For sites with insufficient street frontage to maintain the above spacing
requirements, the Planning Commission may require construction of the
driveway along a side street, a shared driveway with an adjacent property,
construction of a driveway along the property line farthest from the
intersection or require a service road. If these design options cannot be
achieved, the Planning Commission may modify the driveway spacing
standards so as to allow reasonable access provided such driveway does not
create an unsafe traffic condition.
C. Shared Driveways, Frontage Roads And Service Drives for Other Than Single Or
Two Family Dwellings:
1. A shared driveway should be located so the midpoint of the driveway is on
the property line. Owners of the properties shall execute and record a
document to provide for joint use and maintenance.
2. Service roads shall generally be parallel or perpendicular to the front property
line and may be located either along the side or behind principal buildings.
Where site constraints prohibit the development of a rear service drive, the
Planning Commission may permit a front service drive. In considering the
most appropriate alignment for a service road, the Planning Commission
shall consider the setbacks of existing buildings, anticipated traffic flow for
the site and the 10 Mile Road Corridor Plan.
3. The service road shall be within an access easement permitting traffic
circulation between properties. This easement shall be a minimum of 40 feet
wide.
4. The service road easement shall be setback a minimum of 25 feet from the
required right-of-way to allow for snow storage and landscaping.
SITE PLAN REVIEW
32-5
5. Where a service road intersects 10 Mile Road, the edge of the service road
parallel to 10 Mile Road shall be setback a minimum of 60 feet from the edge
of the 10 Mile Road pavement to allow for vehicle stacking.
6. Service roads shall have a base, pavement and curb with gutter in
accordance with Kent County Road Commission standards for public streets,
except the width of the service road shall have a minimum pavement width of
24 feet.
7. The service road is intended to be used exclusively for circulation, not as a
parking or maneuvering aisle. The Planning Commission may require the
posting of ?no parking? signs along the service road.
8. The Planning Commission may approve temporary driveways where a
continuous service road or shared driveway is not yet available. A
performance bond or escrow shall be set up to ensure elimination of
temporary access when the service road or shared driveway is provided. At
such time as the permanent service road or shared driveway is completed,
the site shall connect to the service road or shared driveway and the
temporary drive shall be closed.
9. Each property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of the easement
and service drive.
SECTION 32.06 PROCEDURE The submission of site plans, when required and applicable, shall be
processed in accordance with the following procedures established by this Ordinance and appropriate
statutory regulations.
A. A preapplication conference with the Director of Community Development Department
is recommended to obtain information and guidance prior to preparation of site plans.
There shall be no fee for such conference.
B. Where rezoning of the land would be required to allow the proposed development of
the property as provided for in the site plan, approval of a development plan as
required by Section 34.06 B. 6. shall be considered by the Planning Commission
contingent upon rezoning of the property by the Township Board. Such development
plan approval shall not be construed as assurance of final site plan approval.
C. The application for Site Plan Approval, proposed site development plans, and all other
submission requirements, as herein described, and the payment of the review fee as
established by resolution of the Township Board, must be submitted to the Township
Community Development Department. Upon submission, the Director of Community
Development Department will advise the applicant with respect to review procedures
and will discuss tentative meeting dates.
D. Following receipt of a site plan and a determination that all necessary information is
present, the Planning Commission shall, within 65 days, reject, approve, or
conditionally approve said site plan provided that this time period may be extended
with the consent of the applicant. The applicant shall then be advised of any changes,
modifications or additions deemed necessary by the Planning Commission within ten
(10) days of its action.
E. Upon receiving an approved site plan, the applicant may apply for a building permit. If
the proposal involves a variance, the plan shall be considered by the Zoning Board of
Appeals prior to the issuance of a building permit.
SITE PLAN REVIEW
32-6
SECTION 32.07 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT APPROVAL Upon a finding by the
Community Development Department that an approved site plan complies with all applicable laws and
regulations and that further Planning Commission review is unnecessary, the Director or other
designee of the Community Development Department may approve the following changes to an
approved site plan:
1. Shape, lighting, or appearance of signs.
2. Change of location or type of landscape materials.
3. Internal rearrangement of parking lots.
4. Additions to parking areas provided such addition is for not more than 20
parking spaces.

7. An increase in building size that does not exceed 7,500 square feet or fifteen
percent of the floor area, whichever is smaller.
8. Decrease in the number of lots or units.
9. Any approvals delegated by the Planning Commission.
SECTION 32.08 STANDARDS No site plan shall be approved unless the Planning Commission
finds that the following conditions exist:
A. The use intended shall have parking facilities as required by the Zoning Ordinance,
proper ingress and egress, exits, and entrances, streets, roads, and alleys, and
screening walls and/or fences. The construction of the same shall be engineered,
planned, and installed correctly to assure the needs of public safety, health, and
welfare and to assure rendition of proper services concerning fire and police
protection, disposal of surface water and sanitary sewage, traffic control and
maintenance services as furnished or may be required by the Township, and to
assure preservation and protection of property rights to related or adjoining properties.
B. All elements of the site plan shall be harmoniously and efficiently organized in relation
to topography, the existing natural features of the land, the character of adjoining
property, and type and size of buildings. Structures, walls, fences, and landscaping
will be located so as not to be detrimental to each other or to existing or potential
adjacent development. The site will be so developed as not to impede the normal and
orderly development or improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted in this
Ordinance.
C. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as practicable, by
minimizing tree and soil removal and by topographic modifications which result in
maximum harmony with adjacent areas. Additional or replacement landscaping shall
be provided in accordance with this Ordinance.
D. The site plan shall provide reasonable visual and acoustical privacy for all dwelling
units located therein. Fences, walks, barriers, and landscaping shall be used, as
appropriate, for the protection and enhancement of property and the privacy of its
occupants. Objectionable views or uses shall be screened.

H. All applicable requirements not contained in this Ordinance are satisfied.
SECTION 32.09 CONDITIONS Reasonable conditions may be imposed with approval of a site plan.
The conditions may include those necessary to insure that public services and facilities will be capable
of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by the proposed land use or activity, to
protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources and energy, and to insure
compatibility with adjacent uses of land. Conditions imposed shall meet all of the following
requirements:
A. Protection of existing natural features of the land.
B. Protection of existing and future land uses adjacent to the land described in the site
plan.
C. Compliance with applicable law.
D. Protection of the general health, safety, and welfare in accordance with the valid
exercise of police power.
E. Carry out the intent and purpose of this zoning ordinance.
SECTION 32.10 CHANGES IN AN APPROVED SITE PLAN A site plan, as approved by the
Planning Commission shall become part of the record of approval, and subsequent actions relating to
the activity authorized shall conform to the approved site plan unless a change conforming to the
Zoning Ordinance receives the mutual agreement of the land owner and Planning Commission or the
Director of Community Development Department in accordance with the provisions of Section 32.07.
SECTION 32.11 SITE PLAN APPROVAL - DURATION OF VALIDITY Approval of a site plan shall

ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
33-1
CHAPTER 33
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
SECTION 33.01 CREATION, MEMBERSHIP, TERM OF OFFICE There is hereby created
and/or continued a Township Zoning Board of Appeals (hereafter the ZBA) of five (5) members.
The first member of such Board shall be a member of the Township Planning Commission; the
second member shall be a member of the Township Board; and the remaining three members
shall be selected and appointed by the Township Board from the electors of the Township
residing in the unincorporated areas of the Township; and shall be representative of the
population distribution and of the various interests present in the Township; except as otherwise
provided, an employee or contractor of the Township Board shall not serve as a member of the
ZBA.
The term of each member shall be for three years, except for members serving because of their
membership on the Planning Commission or Township Board, whose terms shall be limited to the
time they are members of the Planning Commission or Township Board respectively, and the
period stated in the resolution appointing them. A successor shall be appointed not more than
one month after the term of the preceding member has expired. All vacancies for unexpired
terms shall be filled for the remainder of their term. The Township Board may appoint not more
than 2 alternate members for the same terms as regular members to the ZBA. Alternate
members shall be selected from the electors of the Township residing outside of incorporated
cities and villages. An alternate member may serve as a regular member of the ZBA in the
absence of a regular member if the regular member is absent from or will be unable to attend 1 or
more consecutive meetings of the ZBA. Any such alternative members may also be called to
serve as a regular member for the purposes of reaching a decision on a case in which the regular
member has abstained for reasons of conflict of interest. The alternate member appointed shall
serve in the case until a final decision is made. The alternate member has the same voting rights
as a regular member of the ZBA.
SECTION 33.02 RULES OF PROCEDURE The ZBA may adopt those rules of procedure it
deems necessary to assist it in the performance of its duties. The ZBA shall elect from its
membership a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and such other officers as deemed necessary; except
that an elected officer of the Township shall not serve as chairman of the Board of Appeals. In
addition, the ZBA may appoint a person from without its membership to serve as recording
secretary. The presence of three (3) members shall constitute a quorum.
A record of the proceedings of each meeting shall be kept by the ZBA, relating evidence
presented by the applicant and the resolution by the ZBA, the vote of each member on each
question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact. These shall be a public record and
filed with the Community Development Department.
SECTION 33.03 POWERS AND DUTIES The ZBA shall hear and decide questions that arise in
the administration of this ordinance, unless otherwise specified herein, including the interpretation
of zoning maps. It shall hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by an administrative official or body charged with the
enforcement of this Ordinance. It shall also hear and decide all matters referred to it or upon
which it is required to pass under the terms of this Ordinance. An appeal may be made by any
person aggrieved or by an officer, department, board, or bureau of the Township, County, or
State. In addition, a variance may be applied for and granted pursuant to Section 4 of the uniform
condemnation procedures act, being Act No. 87 of the Public Acts of 1980. The grounds for
every such determination of the ZBA shall be stated as a public record.
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to give or grant to the ZBA the power or
authority to alter or change this Ordinance or the zoning map. Where there are practical
difficulties in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the Zoning Ordinance, the ZBA, in passing
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
33-2
upon appeals, may vary or modify any of its rules or provisions so that the spirit of this Ordinance
is observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done.
A. Appeals. An appeal may be taken from any person or any governmental
department affected or aggrieved, and review any order, requirement, decision or
determination where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error or
misinterpretation in any order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by the
director or other administrative official or body charged with the enforcement of any
ordinance adopted pursuant to the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act.
1. Appeals shall be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by the board
of appeals by general rule, by the filing with the officer from whom the
appeal is taken and with the ZBA of a notice of appeal specifying the
grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith
transmit to the ZBA all the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
2. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from
except under two conditions:
a. the officer who took the appeal certifies to the ZBA that by reason of
facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property.
b. a restraining order which may be granted by the ZBA or by the
Circuit Court for due cause shown.
3. The ZBA shall select a reasonable time and place for hearing the appeal,
give due notice thereof to the parties, and render a decision on the appeal
without unreasonable delay. A person may appear and testify at the
hearing, whether in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney.
4. In deciding the appeal, the ZBA shall be limited to determining whether or
not the decision that was made was done so using the proper standards
and guidelines in the Ordinance. The decision of the ZBA is limited to the
information that was available to the administrative official or body who
made the decision initially. Additional testimony is not appropriate.
5. If a determination is made that the administrative official or body making the
decision did so improperly, the ZBA may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly,
or may modify, the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed
from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as
ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the
administrative official or body from whom the appeal was taken.
6. The ZBA may hear and decide appeals from the decisions of the
Community Development Director pertaining to interpretations of the zoning
map to determine the precise location of boundary lines between zoning
districts. In making its determination of the boundary lines, the ZBA shall be
governed by the rules of this section and the provisions of Chapter 5.
B. Non-use Variances. Subject to other provisions of this Ordinance, the ZBA shall
have jurisdiction to decide applications for non-use variances. The ZBA shall not
grant a non-use variance unless there is evidence of a practical difficulty in the
official record of the hearing. The ZBA may conclude that an applicant has
established a practical difficulty if the following facts and conditions exist:
1. That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the property that do not apply generally to other properties in thee
same zoning district. Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions may include, but shall not be limited to the following:
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
33-3
a. Exceptional narrowness in width, breadth, length, or shape of a
specific piece of property on the effective date of this Ordinance.
b. Exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary
situation or condition of the land, building, or structure;
c. The use of or development of property immediately adjoining the
property in question, such that the literal enforcement of the
requirements of this Ordinance would involve practical
difficulties.
2. That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in the
same zoning district and in the vicinity. The possibility that compliance with
this Ordinance may prove to be more expensive, or the possibility of
increased financial return if a variance is granted shall not, of itself be
deemed sufficient to warrant a variance.
3. The variance will not be detrimental to adjacent property and the surrounding
neighborhood.
4. The variance will not materially impair the intent and purpose of this
ordinance.
5. That the immediate practical difficulty causing the need for the variance
request was not created by the applicant.
C. Use variances. Under no circumstances shall the ZBA grant a variance to permit
a use not generally or by special exception permitted in the district involved, or
any expressly or by implication prohibited, by the terms of this Ordinance is said
district.
D. Interpretations.
1. Text: The board may hear and decide upon requests for the
interpretation of the provisions of this Ordinance.
a. Text interpretations shall be narrow and address only the situation
being interpreted, be based on a thorough reading of this
Ordinance, and not have the effect of amending this Ordinance.
b. Interpretations shall give weight to practical interpretations by the
Community Development Director and other administrative officials
if applied consistently over a long period of time.
c. Records shall be kept of all interpretations.
SECTION 33.04 COMPENSATION Each member shall receive a reasonable sum as
determined by the Township Board for services in attending each regular or special meeting of
the ZBA. Said compensation and the expenses of the ZBA shall be appropriated annually in
advance by the Township Board.
SECTION 33.05 MEETINGS AND RECORDS Meetings of the ZBA shall be held at the call of
the chairman and at such other times as the ZBA in rules of procedure may specify. The
Chairman, or in his absence the acting Chairman, may administer oaths and compel the
attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the ZBA shall be open to the public. The Board shall
maintain a record of its proceedings which shall be filed in the office of the Township Clerk and
shall be a public record.
SECTION 33.06 PROCEDURE
A. The ZBA shall not conduct business unless a majority of the members is present.
The concurring vote of a majority of the members shall be necessary to reverse
an order, requirement, decision, or determination of the administrative official or
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
33-4
body, or to decide on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this
Ordinance or to effect any variation in said Ordinance.
B. Each appeal or application shall be filed with the ZBA and shall state the
requested relief. The filing fee as determined by Resolution of the Township
Board shall be paid at the time the appeal or application is filed.
When a matter is referred by the Planning Commission as required by the Zoning
Ordinance to the ZBA for consideration, no fee shall be charged.
C. When an application or appeal has been filed in proper form and by the required
date, the ZBA shall fix a reasonable time, for the hearing of the appeal and cause
notices stating the time, place, and object of the hearing to be served. Such
notices shall be served personally or by mail at least fifteen (15) day prior to the
day of such hearing, to the applicant, all persons to whom real property is
assessed within 300 feet of the property that is the subject of the application and
to the occupants of all structures within 300 feet of the property that is the subject
of the application. Said notices shall be addressed to the respective property
owners of record at the address given in the last assessment roll.
D. Upon the day for hearing any application or appeal, the ZBA may adjourn the
hearing in order to permit the obtaining of additional information or to cause such
further notice as it deems proper to be served upon such other property owners
as it decides may be interested in said application or appeal. In the case of an
adjourned hearing, persons previously notified and persons already heard need
not be notified of the time of resumption of said hearing.
E. At the hearing, any party may be heard in person or by agent or attorney.
F. The ZBA may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order to be
made in the premises, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer or
body from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a
permit.
SECTION 33.07 IMPOSITION OF CONDITIONS The ZBA may impose conditions with an
affirmative decision. Conditions may include those necessary to insure that public services and
facilities will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by the
proposed land use or activity; to protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources
and energy; to insure compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a
socially and economically desirable manner. Conditions imposed shall meet all of the following
requirements:
A. Be designed to protect natural resources, the health, safety, and welfare and
social and economic well-being of those who will exercise the land use or activity
under consideration, residents and landowners immediately adjacent to the
proposed land use or activity, and or the community as a whole.
B. Be related to the valid exercise of the police power, and purposes (of the relevant
zone district or section of the Ordinance) which are affected by the proposed use
or activity.
C. Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance, be related
to any standards established in the Ordinance for the land use or activity under
consideration, and be necessary to insure compliance with those standards.

D. The conditions imposed shall be recorded in the record of the approval action,
and shall remain unchanged except as provided by law.
SECTION 33.08 DECISIONS OF THE BOARD The ZBA shall decide all applications and
appeals within 30 days after the final hearing thereon. A copy of the decision shall be transmitted
to the applicant or appellant and to the Building Inspector. Such decision shall be binding upon
the Building Inspector and observed by him, and he shall incorporate the terms and conditions of
the same in the permit to the applicant or appellant whenever a permit is authorized by the ZBA.
A. Any decision of the ZBA shall not become final until minutes of the meeting at which
final action on the request was taken are officially approved and adopted by the ZBA,
unless the ZBA shall find the immediate effect of such order is necessary for the
preservation of property or personal rights and shall so certify on the record. The
decision of the ZBA shall be final; however, any person having an interest affected by
any such decision shall have the right of appeal to the Circuit Court as permitted by
law.
Upon appeal the Circuit Court shall review the record and decision of the ZBA
Board of Appeals to insure that the decision:
1. Complies with the constitution and laws of the state.
2. Is based upon proper procedure.
3. Is supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record.
4. Represents the reasonable exercise of discretion granted by law to the
ZBA.
B. If the court finds the record of the ZBA inadequate to make the review required
by this section, or that there is additional evidence which is material and with
good reason was not presented to the ZBA, the court shall order further
proceedings before the ZBA on conditions which the court considers proper. The
ZBA may modify its findings and decision as a result of the new proceedings, or
may affirm its original decision. The supplementary record and decision shall be
filed with the Circuit Court.
C. No application which has been denied wholly or in part by the ZBA shall be
resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the last denial except as
permitted by the ZBA on grounds of newly discovered evidence or upon,
demonstration by the applicant to the ZBA of a change of circumstances from the
previous application.
D. As a result of the review required by this section, the Circuit Count may affirm,
reverse, or modify the decision of the ZBA.
E. Each variance granted under the provisions of this Ordinance shall become null
and void unless the construction authorized by such variance has been

administrative officials as necessary to administer and enforce this Ordinance including the
receiving of applications, the inspection of premises, the issuing of building permits, and the
institution of proceedings for enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
SECTION 34.02 BUILDING PERMIT REQUIRED It shall be unlawful for any person to
