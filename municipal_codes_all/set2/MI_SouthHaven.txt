BUILDINGS AND BUILDING REGULATIONS
CD10:15
Editor’s note--Ord. No. 980, Sec. 1, adopted April 19, 2010, repealed Sec. 10-255 through 10-261, which pertained to Short Term Rental Dwelling Registration.
ARTICLE X. SHORT-TERM RENTALS
Sec. 10-241. Purpose.
The City Council finds that the short-term rental of dwellings and dwelling units within the City of South Haven is a matter closely connected with the public health, safety and welfare of the community. The City Council has enacted this regulatory ordinance in an attempt to strike an appropriate balance between the interests of community residents, community business owners, visitors to the community, and real property owners wishing to engage in short-term rental of dwellings and dwelling units.
While visitors to the community who rent dwellings and dwelling units on a short-term basis bring many benefits to the community, they can simultaneously create concerns surrounding issues of traffic, parking, congestion, litter, noise, and other similar issues. Meanwhile, issues related to fire safety and life safety codes must be considered in order to maximize the safety and well-being of all in the community. This article is intended to strike the appropriate balance between competing interests.
In striking that balance, the City Council finds that residential properties are primarily situated in single-family residential neighborhoods which are significantly different in character from the mixed-use areas of the City. Residential neighborhoods and mixed-use areas have different tolerances and expectations regarding sounds, parking, congestion, privacy, entertainment, and other activities.
The City Council finds that there is decreased sensitivity to larger occupant loads within the mixed-use areas of the City, given the comparatively larger lot sizes, increased spacing between structures, louder average noise levels, and greater amounts of available parking, compared to conditions existing in single-family residential neighborhoods.
For these reasons, the City Council has determined that mixed-use areas of the City are more appropriate for higher numbers of occupants to be allowed in dwelling units during a short-term rental compared to the single-family residential neighborhoods of the City.
Sec. 10-242. Definitions.
When used in this article, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section:

(b) Building Official – The official defined in MCL 338.2302, who is given authority to administer and enforce adopted building, electrical, mechanical, or plumbing codes for the City of South Haven.
(c) City Manager – The City Manager of the City or the City Manager’s designee.

Sec. 72-2. Public Improvements; costs.
The term “public improvement,” as used in this chapter, shall include the reconstruction in whole or in part of any structure or work as well as the original construction thereof. The cost of surveys, plans and specifications of a public improvement and all expenses incident to the proceedings for the making of such improvement, the making and collecting of the special assessment therefore and the issuance of bonds in anticipation of such special assessments shall be deemed a part of the cost of said improvement. Whenever any property is acquired by condemnation or otherwise for the purpose of any public improvement, the cost thereof, exclusive of that part of such cost representing damages for injury to improvements to such property and the cost of the proceedings required to acquire such property, may be added as a part of the cost of such improvements. No contract or expenditure, except for the cost of preparing necessary legal or financial consultations and engineering plans and estimates, shall be made for the improvement until special assessments to defray the cost of the same shall have been levied, unless the owners of all of the property in the assessment district petition for the public improvement proposed to be made. Any assessment may be made upon the basis of the estimated cost of the improvement if the actual cost has not been definitely determined.

Sec. 72-3. Filing of petition for improvement; contents.

Such notice shall state that the plans and cost estimate are on file with the City Clerk, shall contain a brief description of the proposed improvement and special assessment district and notify property owners that appearance and protest at the hearing is required in order to appeal the amount of the special assessment to the State Tax Tribunal. At the time of such hearing, or any adjournment thereof, which may be without further notice, the Council shall hear any objections to such improvement and to the special assessment district and, without further notice, may revise, correct, amend or change the plans, estimate and/or district, provided that no property shall be added to the district until notice is given as above provided or by personal service upon the owners thereof, and a hearing afforded such owners.
(Ord. No. 833A, Sec. 5, 11-20-95)
Sec. 72-6. Resolution authorizing improvement; restriction.
After the hearing provided for in the preceding section, if the Council desires to proceed with such improvement, it shall adopt a resolution approving the plans and cost estimates as originally presented or as revised, corrected, amended or changed, determine the necessity to proceed with the proposed public improvement, determine the probable life of the improvement; fix the special assessment district therefore and order the Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll.

(e) If, after hearing all objections and making a record of such changes as the City Council deems justified, the City Council is satisfied with the Assessment roll as submitted by the assessor or as corrected by it, the City Council shall pass a resolution confirming such roll. The City Clerk shall endorse the date of confirmation on such assessment roll. Upon such confirmation, the special assessment roll and all assessments contained in it shall be final and conclusive for the purpose of the improvement to which it applies, subject only to adjustment as provided in Sections 79-15 and 19-17.

In the resolution confirming the roll, the Council shall fix the date upon which the special assessment, or the first installment thereof if installment payments are allowed, shall be due and payable; the number of annual installments [not exceeding fifteen (15)] in which the special assessment may be paid; and the rate of interest to be charged upon all deferred installments form a stated date.

Moneys raised by special assessment for any public improvement shall be credited to a special assessment account and shall be used to pay for the costs of the improvement for which the assessment was levied and of expenses incidental thereto, to repay any principal or interest on money borrowed therefore and to refund excessive assessments. Should the amount collected on assessments prove larger than necessary by less than five percent (5%) or the amount of the original roll, the Council may place the excess in any of the funds of the City, but if the excess shall exceed such five percent (5%), the same shall be credited pro rata on the assessments against the several parcels of lands according to the amounts thereof, such credit as to each parcel to be made upon the unpaid installments to inverse numerical order, provided that, if as to any parcel there shall be no unpaid installments or if the unpaid installments are less than the amount of the credit, then such total or surplus amount of credit shall be applied toward payment of the next city tax levied against such property. If the city shall have been assessed for any portion of the cost of the improvement, then it shall be considered in the same category as the owner of private lands and shall be entitled to its share of any such excess, provided that any amount due the city, which in case of private lands would be applied to the payment of city taxes, shall be refunded to the city in cash.

(a) Preliminary plat. The preliminary plat shall be designed in compliance with the provisions of section 78-6, be drawn accurately to a scale of preferably not more than 100 feet to the inch, and shall show or be accompanied by the following information:
(1) A key map showing the platted area in relation to the surrounding areas.
SOUTH HAVEN CODE
CD78:6
(2) Plans of proposed utility layouts (sewers, storm drains and water) showing connections to any existing or proposed utility systems. Contour lines shall be shown on this map. If no public sewage disposal system is available, percolation tests or test holes shall be made as directed by the city engineer or the health department having jurisdiction, and the results shall be submitted with the preliminary plat.
(3) The proposed use of the individual lots in the platted area.
(4) The dimensions and area of the individual lots and their average frontage and area.
(b) Final plat. The final plat shall be prepared as required by the subdivision control act, being Act No. 288 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1967 (MCL 560.101 et seq., MSA 26.430(101) et seq.), as amended.
(Code 1965, Sec. 22.04)
Sec. 78-6. Lot sizes in relation to improvements.
(a) General provisions. It is the intent of this chapter to ensure that the density of all future subdivision development shall be directly related to carefully selected service areas shown on the service area map as primary, secondary, private and industrial service areas. The map is incorporated into and made a part of this chapter by reference. A copy of the map shall be kept on file in the clerk’s office. Primary service areas are those areas in the city and the surrounding area which were on October 7, 1963, provided with or where the city has agreed it will provide public sewer, public water and public electric services. Secondary service areas are those areas in the city and the surrounding area which are now provided with or where the city has agreed it will provide public water and electric services but not public sewer services. Private service areas are those areas where neither public water nor public sewer are provided and where there are no agreements or plans to provide such services. The nonresidential service area is reserved for industrial use. For the purpose of this chapter, subdivisions shall be classified as complete utility, partial utility, potential utility or private service subdivisions. For reasons of health and sanitation, the minimum required area of each lot shall vary according to the type of subdivision, the minimum requirements increasing as the availability of the various public services decreases. In this way, it is hoped that, with the future development of the city and the increasing concentration of population, serious dangers to health will be avoided.
(b) Complete utility subdivision--primary service area. A complete utility subdivision is a subdivision in the primary service area in which arrangements have been made for both public water service and sewage disposal by a public utility system and for the other city services required by this chapter. The minimum average frontage of lots in such subdivision at the building line shall be 70 feet, and the minimum average lot area 8,400 square feet.
(c) Partial utility subdivision--primary service area. A partial utility subdivision is a subdivision in which arrangements have been made for either public water service or sewage disposal by a public utility system, but not for both, and for the other city services required by this chapter in primary service areas. The minimum average lot frontage of all lots in such subdivisions at the building line shall be 80 feet, and the minimum lot area shall be 10,000 square feet.
SUBDIVISIONS
CD78:7
(d) Potential utility subdivision--primary service area. A potential utility subdivision is a subdivision in which at the time of platting neither public water nor sewage disposal by a public utility system can be immediately obtained, but where other city services required by this chapter for partial utility subdivisions are provided. If the potential utility subdivision is located in a primary service area so that it is known that both public water and sewage disposal by a public utility system will eventually become available, the minimum average frontage of all lots at the building line shall be 90 feet and the minimum lot area shall be 13,500 square feet.
(e) Potential utility subdivision--secondary service area. If a potential utility subdivision is located in a secondary service area, where it is or can be served with public water but not with sewage disposal by a public utility system, the minimum average frontage of all lots at the building line shall be 110 feet and the minimum lot area shall be 18,000 square feet.
(f) Private service subdivision--private service area. A private service subdivision is one located outside of either the established primary or secondary service areas so that neither public water or sewage disposal by a public utility system is furnished or contemplated and there are no plans or agreements by any utilities to serve them with water or sewers. The minimum average frontage of lots at the building line shall be 165 feet, and the minimum lot area shall be 35,000 square feet.
(Code 1965, Sec. 22.05)
Sec. 78-7. Improvements required in complete utility subdivisions.
Prior to the granting of final approval for a complete utility subdivision, the subdivider shall either have agreements with the city for the installation of the improvements listed in this section or, in lieu of agreements, provide bonds to install such improvements within three years. The following improvements are required:
(1) Pavement and curbs. A 36-foot graded street, surfaced according to city specifications with asphalt or an equally satisfactory surfacing with concrete curbs and gutters, as approved by the city engineer.
(2) Water. A public water supply of sufficient size, approved by the city engineer, available to each lot within the subdivision, together with a contract for the installation and maintenance and operation of approved fire hydrants in locations approved by the city.
(3) Sewers and drainage. Adequate provision shall be made for culverts, catch basins, storm sewers and sanitary sewers properly connected to or provisions made for connection to an approved system, as approved by the city engineer.
(4) Sidewalks. Five-foot sidewalks shall be installed by the developer in accordance with specifications of the city, subject to inspection and approval by the city engineer.
(5) Shade trees. Shade trees, at least one to a lot, but not closer than 50 feet from trunk to trunk, of a type, size and location approved by the city engineer.
SOUTH HAVEN CODE
CD78:8
(6) Topsoil. No topsoil shall be removed from the site or used as spoil. Topsoil moved during the course of construction shall be distributed and stabilized by seeding or planting as specified by the city engineer.
(7) Street names. Signs shall be placed at all intersections within or abutting the subdivision. Type and location shall be approved by the city engineer.
(Code 1965, Sec. 22.06)
Sec. 78-8. Improvements required in partial utility subdivisions.
In a partial utility subdivision the same improvements are required as in a complete utility subdivision except that:
(1) If a public utility water system is not available, in lieu of the requirements of section 78-7(2), individual wells may be used provided the location and construction of the wells are approved by the city engineer or the health department having jurisdiction; or
(2) If the services of a public utility sanitary sewer system are not available, in lieu of requirements of section 78-7(3), sewage disposal installations may be used, provided they are approved by the city engineer or the health department having jurisdiction.
(Code 1965, Sec. 22.07)
Sec. 78-9. Variations in complete and partial utility subdivisions.
If the average width of all lots in a complete or partial utility subdivision in the primary service area exceeds 90 feet, improvement standards may vary with the density of development to encourage larger lot sizes as follows: A five-foot sidewalk on one side of the street may be permitted instead of two sidewalks.
(Code 1965, Sec. 22.08)
Sec. 78-10. Improvements required in potential utility subdivisions.
The following improvements are required in a potential utility subdivision:
(1) Pavement and curbs. Same as section 78-7.
(2) Sidewalks. Same as section 78-9.
(3) Other provisions. Arrangements shall be made at the time the plat receives final approval for the future installation of both public water and sewage disposal by a public utility system in the primary service area and future installation of public water by a public utility system in the secondary service area. Installation of fire hydrants, adequate storm sewers and topsoil protection as called for in section 78-7 are required. Performance or cash bonds may be required to ensure compliance.

Sec. 78-11. Variations in potential utility subdivisions.
If the average width of all lots in a potential utility subdivision in the secondary service area exceeds 150 feet and the average lot area exceeds 30,000 square feet, the planning commission may vary these standards in proportion to increased lot sizes as follows: Sidewalk provisions may be waived unless needed to provide access to schools or to continue a walk on an existing street.
(Code 1965, Sec. 22.10)
Sec. 78-12. Improvements required in private service subdivisions.
The following improvements are required in a private service subdivision: Roads. A properly graded, drained and seal coated road, as approved by the city engineer, with a minimum width of 24 feet, valley gutters and with concrete, curbs and gutters at the intersections shall be provided.
(Code 1965, Sec. 22.11)
Sec. 78-13. Variances.
(a) If the subdivider can clearly demonstrate that literal enforcement of this chapter is impractical or will impose undue hardship in the use of his land because of peculiar conditions pertaining to his land, the council may permit such variance as, in its sound discretion, it believes to be reasonable and within the general purpose and policy of this chapter.
(b) In making the findings required in subsection (c) of this section, the council shall consider the location and condition of the proposed subdivision, the nature of the proposed variance, as compared with the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of the proposed subdivisions and variances on traffic conditions in the vicinity.
(c) No variance shall be granted unless the council finds that:
(1) There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land.
(2) The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant.
(3) The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or be injurious to property in the area in which the property is situated.
(d) A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for the consideration of the planning commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 82-1. Findings of fact.
The city finds that a significant number of traffic arrests and traffic accidents in the city involve drivers who were operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and/or controlled substances. In addition, the city finds that in traffic accidents involving drivers who were operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and/or controlled substances there is a greater likelihood of personal injury and property damage. As a result of these determinations, a greater operational and financial burden is placed upon the city’s police, firefighting and rescue services by persons who are operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and/or controlled substances.
(Ord. No. 771, Sec. 1, 9-21-92)
Sec. 82-2. Emergency responses.
(a) Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Emergency response means the dispatching of police personnel and equipment, firefighters and equipment or emergency medical personnel and equipment or any combination thereof to the scene of an incident.
Expense of an emergency response means the actual and reasonable costs incurred by the city in making an appropriate emergency response to the incident, including the costs of providing police, firefighting, rescue and emergency medical services at the scene of the incident, but shall include only those costs directly arising because of the response to the particular incident.
Incident means an occurrence, accident or situation caused by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle while the driver was under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs which results in injury to a person, including the driver, or property.
Wrongful conduct means conduct causing injury to any person or property or conduct in violation of local ordinance or state statute.
(b) Negligent operation of motor vehicle; influence of alcohol and/or drugs; wrongful conduct; liability. Any person who is under the influence of alcohol or any drug, or the combination of alcohol and drugs, whose negligent operation of a motor vehicle while under that influence proximately causes any incident requiring and resulting in an emergency response, and any person whose wrongful conduct proximately causes any incident requiring and resulting in an emergency response shall be liable for the expenses of an emergency response by the city to the incident.
(c) Influence of alcohol or drug; inability to operate motor vehicle; presumptions. For purposes of this section, a person is under the influence of alcohol or any drug, or the combined influence of alcohol and drugs, when his physical and/or mental abilities are impaired to a degree that he no longer has the ability to operate a motor vehicle with the caution and care
SOUTH HAVEN CODE

characteristic of a sober person of ordinary prudence. For purposes of this chapter, the presumptions contained in MCL 257.625 et seq., MSA 9.2325, shall apply.
(d) Charge against person liable; collection of debt. The expenses of an emergency response shall be charged against the person violating subsection (b) of this section. The charge constitutes a debt of that person to the city and is collectable by the city in the same manner as in the case of an obligation under a contract, expressed or implied, except that liability for the expenses provided for in this section shall not be insurable, and no insurance policy shall provide or pay for the expenses.
(e) Billing. The chief of police, or his designee, may within ten days of receiving itemized costs, or any part thereof, incurred for an emergency response, submit a bill for these costs by first class mail or personal service to the person liable for the expenses, as enumerated under this chapter. The bills shall require full payment in 30 days from the date of service.
(f) Failure to pay; city attorney to sue to recover. Any failure by a person described in this section as liable for the expenses of an emergency response to pay the bill submitted by the city treasurer within 30 days of service of the bill shall render such matter in default. The city attorney or his designate shall commence a civil suit on behalf of the city to recover the expenses, court costs and attorney fees.

The certificate, in addition to describing the motor vehicles for which insurance is in effect, shall state the name of
SOUTH HAVEN CODE
CD82:6
each person named on the policy, policy declaration, or a declaration certificate whose operation of the vehicle would cause the liability coverage of that insurance to become void.
(c) Violation; penalty. If an owner of a motor vehicle is determined to be responsible for a violation of subsection (a) of this section, the court in which the civil infraction determination is entered may require the person to surrender his operator’s or chauffeur’s license unless proof that the vehicle has insurance meeting the requirements of section 3102 of Act No. 218 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1956 (MCL 500.3102, MSA 24.13102), as amended, is submitted to the court. If the court requires the license to be surrendered, the court shall order the secretary of state to suspend the person’s license and shall forward the surrendered license and a certificate of civil infraction to the secretary of state. Upon receipt of the certificate of civil infraction and the surrendered license, the secretary of state shall suspend the person’s license beginning with the date on which a person is determined to be responsible for the civil infraction for a period of 30 days or until proof of insurance which meets the requirements of section 3102 of Act No. 218 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1956, as amended, is submitted to the secretary of state, whichever occurs later.

Sec. 82-5. Disposition of wrecked or discarded vehicles.
No person in charge or control of any property within the city, whether as owner, tenant, occupant, lessee, or otherwise, shall allow any unregistered or unlicensed; partially dismantled, non-operating, wrecked, junked or discarded vehicle to remain on such property longer than 48 hours; and no person shall leave any such vehicle on any property within the city for a longer time than 48 hours; except that this section shall not apply to a vehicle in an enclosed building, a vehicle on the premises of a business enterprise operated in a lawful place and manner, when necessary to the operation of such business enterprise; or a vehicle in an appropriate storage place or depository maintained in a lawful place and manner by the city.

Sec. 86-2. Liens and enforcement.
(a) Except as may be prohibited by law or by subsection (6) of this section, all rates, fees and charges for public utilities furnished to premises shall be a lien upon the premises served which lien shall become effective immediately upon supplying the public utility service to the premises.
(b) If a tenant is occupying the premises and the tenant is responsible for payment of the rates, fees or charges relating to any public utility, then the owner/landlord of the premises may give notice in writing to the City in the form of an affidavit stating the following:

(c) Rates, fees and charges for any public utility which are delinquent in payment for a period of six (6) months shall be certified by the City Manager to the City Assessor who shall then enter the lien for such delinquent rates, fees and charges on the next tax roll against the premises to which the public utility services were supplied.

SECTION 500. INTENT OF THE RM-1 DISTRICT
The RM-1 District is designed to accommodate those types of low-rise multiple dwelling structures which are similar, in terms of use and structural character, to single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings.

The RM-1 Multiple-Family Residential District is also designed to provide sites for multiple-family dwelling structures and related uses which will generally serve as zones of transition between the nonresidential districts and lower density single-family districts. The multiple-family district is further provided to serve the limited needs for the apartment type of unit in an otherwise single-family community.
SECTION 501. USE REGULATIONS
Land, buildings and structures in RM-1 District may be used for the following purposes only, subject to the review and approval of a site plan by the Planning Commission:
1. All uses as permitted and regulated in the R-1 and R-2 Residential Districts. The short-term rental of a dwelling in the RM-1 district must comply with all applicable provisions of the City Code including, without limitation, registration requirements.

c. The site plan shall be so planned as to provide ingress and egress directly onto a major or minor thoroughfare, except when the Planning Commission finds, upon review of the site plan, that ingress and egress directly onto an adjacent minor street will not be detrimental to the harmonious development of the adjacent properties. Where feasible, the Planning Commission may require that ingress-egress to parking facilities be provided from adjacent alleys so as to minimize curb cuts directly onto the major or minor thoroughfares.
d. The site plan shall be so planned as to recognize yard and general development relationships with adjacent land uses. The Planning Commission may recommend physical features to be provided which will insure harmony in these relationships.
3. Multiple-family dwellings and apartments where not all the units are at ground level.
4. Mobile home parks, when authorized as a special land use by the Planning Commission and provided they are in conformance with all state regulations governing mobile home parks, including Public Act 96 of 1987 as amended.

iii) The premises shall be limited in size to 1,000 square feet in area and shall be architecturally compatible with the surrounding buildings.

ARTICLE XIII
PUD - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
SECTION 1300. DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE
1. It is the purpose of this Article to encourage innovation and variety in land use, design, layout, and type of structures constructed; to achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy and the provision of public services and utilities; encourage useful open space, and provide better housing opportunities particularly suited to the needs of the residents of the City, County and State, provided such opportunities do not unreasonably create any adverse economic, social or environmental impact on surrounding land uses.
2. The use, area, height, bulk and placement regulations of this Ordinance are primarily applicable to the usual situation of one (1) principal building on a lot. In certain developments, including but not limited to condominium, townhouse, and apartment developments, these requirements might result in design and land use arrangements with multiple buildings on a lot and a design less in the interest of public health, safety and welfare than if a controlled degree of flexibility in the regulation of land development were allowed.
3. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) is intended to permit and control the development of preplanned areas for various compatible uses allowed by the City Zoning Ordinance and for other uses not so provided. It is a discretionary review and approval procedure that results in an approved development if all standards of this Article are met and denial if they are not. A PUD approval is a special land use and, as such, has all the rights and privileges of an approved use by right as long as all conditions attached to the approval are complied with.
4. It is intended that uses in a PUD shall afford each type of land use reasonable protection from encroachment or interference by other incompatible land uses, and that reasonable protection be afforded to uses adjacent to a PUD.
SECTION 1301. PUD OBJECTIVES
The following Objectives shall be met by any application for any PUD in order to realize the inherent advantages of coordinated, flexible, comprehensive, and long-range planning and development:
1. To provide more desirable living, shopping and working environments by preserving as much of the natural character of the property as possible, including, but not limited to, open space, stands of trees, brooks, ponds, river and lake shorelines, floodplains, hills and similar natural assets. Developments having water frontage should be designed to preserve public vistas to the maximum extent possible.
2. To encourage the provision of open space and the development of recreational and, where included in the site plan, other support facilities in a generally central location within reasonable distance of all living units and other land uses.
3. To encourage applicants to use a more creative and imaginative approach in the design and operation of development projects including combining and coordinating architectural styles, building forms and relationships, flexibility in design, and planned diversification in the location of structures.
4. To allow phased PUDs with the knowledge that each phase will be constructed as originally approved by the City.
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-73-
5. To promote the use of land that facilitates economic and efficient design and use of public and private infrastructure, buildings, circulation systems, and land use.
6. To ensure a quality of construction that is equal to or better than other new developments within the City.
7. To ensure there are recognizable and substantial benefits to the community achieved by the PUD. These benefits must otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved by development under normal zoning requirements taking into consideration the reasonably foreseeable detriments of the proposed development and use(s); including, without limitation:
a. The long-term protection and/or preservation of natural resources and natural features and/or historical and/or architectural features of a significant quantity and/or quality in need of protection or preservation on a local, state and/or national basis;
b. Reducing to a significant extent the nonconformity of a nonconforming use or structure, i.e., modification of a nonconforming use or structure so that, to a significant extent, it conforms more closely to the requirements of the zoning district in which it is situated.
c. The provision of additional amenities that would not otherwise be provided in a conventional development, including but not limited to more usable open space, recreational facilities, higher quality building materials, etc.
SECTION 1302. PUD ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
No PUD application shall be approved unless the following eligibility requirements are met:
1. Compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance and the underlying zoning district, unless a request for modification meeting the requirements of Section 1306, 2b is submitted and approved for a RPUD.
2. All land for which application is made must be owned or under control of the applicant(s) and remain under control until final action on the PUD application.
3. The parcel of land that is the subject of the PUD application must be capable of being planned and developed as a single, integral land use unit. Noncontiguous parcels separated by a road or waterway may be considered by the Planning Commission and City Council where other benefits to the public are sufficient to warrant their consideration.
SECTION 1303. APPLICATION, REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES
1. An application for a Planned Unit Development shall be submitted and acted upon in accordance with the procedures of Section 1501, 1-3 and this Section.
2. Required Information – The following documents and information shall be submitted with the PUD application:

1) Result in a higher quality of development than would be possible using conventional zoning standards.
2) Are consistent with the PUD Objectives of this Article.
3) The permitted changes or wavers do not impede the continued use or development of surrounding properties for uses that are permitted by this Ordinance.
4) That for reductions in the minimum requirement of the underlying zoning district for single family residential lot area and/or width results in usable open space (not including wetlands, detention, greenbelts, etc.) within the PUD that equals or exceeds the total area of lot area reduction.
e. As a condition of approving these changes or waivers, the City Council may attach additional conditions deemed necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare in lieu of the regulations. Unless the changes or waivers are specifically requested and approved by the Council, the site plan or subdivision plan shall comply with the requirements of this Ordinance.
4. Limitations on Variances from Zoning Board of Appeals: The decision to grant PUD approval or any changes or waivers are not subject to variance approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals. No part of a PUD may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals nor shall an application for variance be accepted.

d. In the CBD, at least thirty (30) percent of the ground floor area of all buildings within the MPUD shall contain retail uses, offices, lodging, restaurants or entertainment related uses.
3. Site development requirements: The following requirements apply only to development within the CBD.
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-81-
a. Building design
1) New buildings shall be designed to blend with the architectural character of existing buildings and shall reflect traditional design details. Those traditional details are expressed around building entrances, window openings, and by building height and scale.
2) Community amenities such as patio/seating areas, water features, art work or sculpture, clock towers, pedestrian plazas with park benches or other features located adjacent to the primary entrance to the building(s) are highly encouraged.
3) The minimum height shall be two (2) stories.
4) Walls
(a) All walls visible from public streets should be designed using materials that are generally consistent with the character of the buildings in the general vicinity, using such materials as brick, cast concrete, stone, approved metal paneling (no more than twenty [20] percent of a building wall), or material similar in appearance or texture.
(b) Building walls facing the street should be designed to assure articulation and architectural design variation. This variation should be used at regular intervals of thirty (30) feet of horizontal distance Variations that could be used include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Recess and projections along the building façade.
(2) Variations in depth for a minimum of ten (10) feet.
(3) Architectural details or features.
(4) Enhanced ornamentation around building entryways.
(5) Streetscape elements.
(6) Variations in building height.
5) Roofs
(a) Roofs should be designed to reduce the apparent exterior mass of a building, add visual interest and be appropriate to the architectural style of the building.
(b) Variations in architectural style are highly encouraged. Visible roof lines and roofs that project over the exterior wall of a building enough to cast a shadow on the ground are highly encouraged, with a minimum overhang of twelve (12) inches. Any overhang into the public right-of-way shall be subject to approval of a License Agreement by the City.
(c) Architectural methods shall be used to conceal flat roof tops and mechanical equipment.
(d) Overhanging eaves, sloped roofs and multiple roof elements are highly encouraged.
6) Facade Transparency
i. Facades on the first floor should be designed to encourage and complement pedestrian-scale
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-82-
activity. It is intended that this be accomplished principally by the use of windows and doors arranged so that the uses within the building are visible from and/or accessible to the street. Active uses of visual interest to the pedestrian may be displayed, including office or lobby areas, retail spaces, etc. Parking areas, truck loading areas, and vehicular access ways are not active uses.
ii. Facade transparency designs should apply to the area of the facade between two (2) and eight (8) feet above the sidewalk. Only clear or lightly tinted, non-reflective glass in windows, doors, and display windows are considered transparent.
iii. Transparency is one method that can be used to avoid blank, windowless walls that are out of character with the Central Business District. A minimum of sixty (60) percent transparency for the street level facade on the front of a building is encouraged to fulfill this intent. For the same reasons, a minimum of forty (40) percent of the street level facade on all other sides of a building facing public rights-of-way (except alleys) or plazas should be transparent.

If the name of the occupant is not known, the term “occupant” may be used in making notification. Notification need not be given to more than one occupant of a structure, except that if a structure contains more than one dwelling unit or spatial area owned or leased by different individuals, partnerships, businesses or organizations, one occupant of each unit or spatial area shall receive notice. In the case of a single structure containing more than four dwelling units or other distinct spatial areas owned or leased by different individuals, partnerships, businesses or organizations, notice may be given to the manager or owner of the structure who shall be requested to post the notice at the primary entrance to the structure. The notice shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the date the application will be considered. The notice shall:

If construction has not commenced and proceeded meaningfully toward completion by the end of this one (1) year period, the Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of the expiration or revocation of said permit, provided, however, that the Planning Commission may waive or extend the period of time in which the permit is to expire if: a) it is satisfied that the owner or developer is maintaining a good faith intention to proceed with construction; b) no significant changes to applicable regulations have occurred; or c) there have been no significant changes in the condition of abutting property or services. This determination of the Planning Commission shall be forwarded to the applicant with a recommended action.

The setback line is not a fixed line over time, it moves landward as erosion continues. For the purpose of the high risk erosion overlay zone, the minimum required setback distance shall be measured landward from the bluffline and shall be construed as running parallel to the bluffline. In the event the bluffline recedes (moves landward), the setback line of the high risk erosion area shall also be construed as to have moved landward a distance equal to the bluffline recession.
SECTION 1602. BOUNDARIES OF HIGH RISK EROSION AREAS
The boundaries of the high risk erosion areas provided below coincide with descriptions provided in the shoreland erosion studies of the Department of Environmental Quality, and are as follows:
HIGH RISK EROSION AREA A1 - Located along the shoreline of Lake Michigan, the north boundary is two hundred (200) feet north of the intersection of the Elkenburg Street right-of-way (extended) and the shoreline. The south boundary is located at the intersection of the Chippewa Court right-of-way and the shoreline.

HIGH RISK EROSION AREA A2- Located along the shoreline of Lake Michigan, the north boundary is located at the intersection of Chippewa Court and the shoreline. The south boundary is located at the southern City limits on the shoreline.
SECTION 1603. SETBACK REQUIREMENTS FROM BLUFFLINE
1. Within the boundaries of the high risk erosion areas established by this Article, no permanent structure shall be located between the ordinary high water mark and the line defining the required setback distance indicated on the table that follows. The required setback distance provided for in this section shall be measured in a landward direction as a distance horizontal from and perpendicular to the bluffline at the closest point to the existing or proposed principal structure. For each high risk erosion area described in Section 1602, the required setback for any principal structure shall be as follows:
Minimum Setback
Requirement from the
Designated High Risk Bluffline
Erosion Area (in feet)
30 years 60 years
___________________________________________________________
Area A1 85’ 160’
Area A2 155’ 295’
2. Modification of the Required Setback Distance. A person who can document with acceptable engineering studies an annual average recession rate which differs from the Department of Environmental Quality’s recession rate data may be granted a modification of the setback requirement for principal structures by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Prior to any modification of the required setback distance, the applicant's engineering studies shall be sent to the Department of Environmental Quality, who shall report to the Zoning Board of Appeals on the accuracy of the applicant's studies. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall only act upon requests for modification of the setback requirement after a determination has been made on the validity of the applicant's data by the Department of Environmental Quality and only after the Zoning Board of Appeals has determined that such modification would not violate the spirit and intent of this Ordinance.

SECTION 1605. MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
The lawful use of any structure within a designated high risk erosion area existing at the time in which this Ordinance is adopted or amended may continue in the same manner and to the same extent although the location of the permanent structure does not conform with the provisions of this Ordinance. A nonconforming permanent structure shall not be repaired, restored, extended, enlarged or removed except in accord with the requirements that follow:
1. Routine Maintenance and Remodeling - Routine repairs and maintenance work required to keep a nonconforming principal structure in sound condition are permitted. Remodeling of a nonconforming principal structure is permitted as long as the structure is neither enlarged or extended in a nonconforming manner. Addition of extra stories shall be construed as the expansion of a nonconforming use.
2. Enlargements to Nonconforming Structures - Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1905, the following special exceptions can be made to accommodate enlargements to existing nonconforming structures upon review and approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
a. Additions to a readily moveable structure which is not in compliance with the required setback distance of a designated high risk erosion area shall be approved if all of the following provisions are complied with:
1) The existing building with the addition will meet the definition of a readily moveable structure.
2) The proposed addition does not reduce the permanent structure's distance from the bluffline.
3) The proposed addition and the existing permanent structure are not less than thirty (30) feet landward of the bluffline.
b. An addition to an existing small nonconforming permanent structure which is not a readily moveable structure shall be approved if, at the date of construction, the provisions of either subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and the provisions of subsection (c) of this Section are complied with as follows:
1) The total of all floor space added shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the foundation size of the permanent structure. The foundation size shall be determined as of the time the permanent structure became nonconforming. When the twenty-five percent (25%) limit on additions (including building up) has been reached, no further additions can be made for the remaining life of the structure. The addition shall not reduce the permanent structure's distance from the bluffline.
2) The addition shall meet the definition of a readily moveable structure and the addition shall be on the landward side of the original permanent structure. A special exception may only be granted if the property owner, as a condition agrees to relocate the readily moveable portion of the permanent structure to a location landward of the setback line when so
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance

-131-
ordered by the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals may make such an order only when the foundation of the existing structure is undermined by erosion.
3) The proposed addition and the existing structure is not less than thirty (30) feet landward of the bluffline.
3. Restoration of Nonconforming Structures -
a. When a nonconforming structure is damaged by a force other than erosion, the Zoning Administrator shall only authorize restoration if damage to the structure conforms with the requirements of Section 1904 and the following standards:
1) The permanent structure, if rebuilt in its existing location, would be no less than twenty (20) feet landward of the bluffline.
2) The reconstructed building would be a readily moveable structure.
b. As a condition for approval of restoration plans, the Zoning Administrator may require:
1) Measures which will aid in stabilizing the bluff other than the construction of erosion control devices.
2) The use of runoff or soil erosion control techniques to prevent any acceleration erosion which may occur during restoration of the structure.
3) The lawful disposal of all debris including the previous foundation resulting from the damage or from the restoration of a principal structure (such as construction materials) in a manner such that the debris poses no safety or health hazard.
4) Other conditions on the restoration of nonconforming principal structures, provided these conditions are consistent with the intent of this Ordinance and consistent with the promotion of the public health, safety and welfare.
c. If a building is more than sixty (60%) destroyed or declared a total loss for insurance purposes, the requirements for new permanent structures shall apply.
SECTION 1606. EXCEPTIONS ON NONCONFORMING PARCELS
The following exceptions can be made to the required setback distance upon review and approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals. Any exception shall be the minimum required for the location of a permanent structure on a nonconforming parcel:
1. To erect, install or move a small readily moveable structure lakeward of the setback line on a nonconforming parcel provided the following are complied with:
a. If a sanitary sewer is not used, the septic system, tile field, or other waste-handling facility shall be located at least as far landward as the lakeward edge of the building.
b. The readily moveable structure shall be located as far landward of the bluffline as possible without violating another provision of this ordinance.
c. The readily moveable structure shall be designed and constructed in accordance with proper engineering standards and building moving restrictions applicable to the subject area. Review and approval of the design to ensure that the building is a readily moveable structure shall be completed prior to issuance of any local permits.
d. The readily moveable structure is not less than thirty (30) feet landward of the bluffline and is not located on a lakeward facing slope of sixty percent (60%) or more.
e. The readily moveable structure meets requirements of other applicable state laws, including but not limited to the provisions of the Natural Resources and
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-132-
Environmental Protection Act, Public Act 451 of 1994, Part 353, formerly known as the Sand Dune Protection and Management Act.
2. If a nonconforming parcel does not have access to and from the place where the structure is proposed to be located of sufficient width and acceptable grade to erect or move a readily moveable structure, or if the application is for a large permanent structure on a nonconforming parcel, a special exception shall be granted to utilize a shore protection structure in place of a portion of the required setback distance. The special exception shall be granted only if all of the following provisions are complied with:
a. If a sanitary sewer is not used, the septic system, tile field, or other waste-handling facility shall be located at least as far landward of the bluffline as the principal building.
b. The permanent structure shall be located landward of the bluffline as far as possible without violating another provision of this Ordinance.
c. The shore protection structure shall be designed to meet or exceed a twenty (20) year storm event at the site for small permanent structures and a fifty (50) year storm event at the site for large permanent structures. A professional engineer shall certify that the shore protection structure has been designed and will be constructed in accordance with these standards. If the shore protection structure is constructed in the waters of the Great Lakes or lies below the ordinary high water mark, a permit pursuant to the provisions of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, Public Act 451 of 1994, Part 325, formerly known as the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act, as amended, shall be obtained for the shore protection structure.
d. The permanent structure shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet from the shore protection structure. If the bluff or dune is unstable due to height, slope, wind erosion, or groundwater seepage, the City of South Haven with input from the Department of Environmental Quality may require a setback of more than thirty (30) feet or an engineered bluff stabilization plan, or both. In areas of steep slopes greater than eighteen (18) percent, a greater setback may be necessary to provide access for maintenance equipment and a safe building site.
e. If the application is for a large permanent structure, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall require compliance with both of the following provisions:
1) The establishment of an escrow account to maintain the approved shore protection structure or bluff stabilization, or both. The amount required in the escrow account shall be reasonable and based on the project design.
2) Notice in the disclosure statement or deed that a portion of the required setback distance has been waived.
f. The proposed permanent structure meets the requirements of other applicable state laws, including but not limited to the provisions of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, Public Act 451 of 1994, Part 353.
SECTION 1607. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The provisions of this Article are considered the "minimum" necessary for reducing erosion hazards and property loss for a thirty (30) year period of recession for small permanent structures and a projected sixty (60) year period for large permanent structures or non-readily moveable structures based upon current engineering and scientific methods of study. Faster or slower rates of erosion may occur. Erosion rates may be increased by natural causes such as high lake levels or major storms, or by man-made causes such as the construction of erosion control devices or by increasing the amount of runoff from the land. Placing a structure landward of the required setback distance is not a guarantee or warranty of safety from erosion damage. Individual property owners concerned with erosion hazards are encouraged to consult with local building officials and personnel of the Department of Natural Resources to arrive at site design plans which may use a greater setback to maximize protection from erosion damage.

SECTION 1737. TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
1. Intent - South Haven recognizes the direct correlation between land use decisions and traffic operations. The intent of this Section is to permit accurate evaluation of expected impacts of proposed projects to assist in decision-making. This Section is further intended to help achieve the following objectives:
a. Provide a standard set of analytic tools and format for preparing traffic impact studies.
b. Allow the community to assess the effects that a proposed project may have on the community by outlining information needed and evaluation procedures to be used.
c. Help ensure safe and reasonable traffic operating conditions on streets and intersections after development of the proposed use.
d. Reduce the negative traffic impacts created by individual developments, and which may negatively impact such developments, by helping to ensure the transportation system can accommodate the expected traffic safely and efficiently.
e. For rezonings, the traffic impact study is intended to evaluate if the rezoning is timely and, if inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan, if the rezoning would be a logical alternative to the Comprehensive Plan.
f. Realize a comprehensive approach to the overall impacts of various developments along a corridor or within part of a community rather than a piecemeal approach.
g. Provide direction to community decision makers, road agencies and developers of expected impacts of a project.
h. Alert the community, transportation agencies, and developers of improvements or modifications needed to the roadway, access or site design.
i. Protect the substantial public investment in the existing street system.

The study shall outline mitigation measures and demonstrate any changes to the level of service achieved by these measures. Any alternatives or suggested phasing of improvements should be described. The mitigation measures may include Items such as roadway widening, need for bypass lanes or deceleration tapers/lanes, changes to signalization, use of access management techniques or a reduction in the proposed intensity of use. Proposed mitigation measures should be discussed with the applicable road agency. The responsibility and timing of roadway improvements shall be described.
k. Preparation Qualifications
The preparation of a thorough traffic impact study requires extensive background and experience in traffic-related analyses. Therefore, the experience of the preparer best defines his or her ability to provide a technically sound analysis. The person responsible for the preparation of the study shall meet the following requirements:
1) Three or more years of recent experience in the preparation of traffic impact studies.
2) The development of impact studies (and similar intersection and/or corridor analyses) comprise a major component of the preparer's recent professional experience. This requires ongoing experience and familiarity with the Highway Capacity Manual techniques as well as the computer software (Highway Capacity software and others) that provide level of service results and other analysis findings needed to fully assess potential impacts.
3) Specific education, training, and/or professional coursework in traffic impact analysis from an accredited college or university or other professional transportation training organization (i.e. National Highway Institute, Northwestern University Traffic Institute, etc.).
4) The study preparer shall be an associate (or higher) member of one or more professional transportation-related organizations, particularly the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) or the Transportation Research Board (TRB). This helps ensure that the preparer is maintaining their knowledge as new research is published and analysis techniques are changed or refined.
5) In addition, the preparer should have one of the following professional qualifications:
a) A registered engineer (PE).
b) A community planner with AICP or PCP certification.
c) A trained professional transportation planner.

SECTION 1738. HOTELS, MOTELS AND SHORT TERM DWELLING UNIT RENTALS
Hotels and motels are intended to furnish temporary lodging to the traveling public. Because lodging units are not intended to be permanent residences, some dwelling unit requirements will not apply. It is therefore important to differentiate between transient and other uses in order to prevent permanent residence in housing that does not meet dwelling unit requirements, and also to regulate housing in accordance with zoning district requirements. In cases where temporary and permanent housing exist upon the same site, hotels and motels must satisfy requirements for both uses. Any residential dwelling unit which is rented for a period of less than 48 hours, or offered or advertised as a daily rental shall be considered a lodging unit, and shall meet the appropriate building and fire codes for a lodging unit, and shall be permitted only in zoning districts which permit hotels, motels or bed and breakfast uses.
1. A guest register shall be maintained and available for inspection by the Zoning Administrator. For each rental, the register shall include at a minimum:
a. Check-in & check-out date & time
b. Lodging unit assigned to family/guests
c. Number in lodging unit
d. Number, type, & registration of vehicles.
2. Every lodging unit shall include at least one bathroom including a toilet, lavatory, and bathtub or shower.
3. Access to any lodging unit shall not require passage through another lodging unit.
4. No lodging unit shall be rented to more than one family at a time.

7. A lodging unit shall not be rented to or occupied by the same guests or family for more than one hundred (100) days in any one hundred-twenty (120) day continuous interval unless in a residence hotel designed and operated for that purpose (like the Nichols Hotel).
8. If any unit, other than a residence hotel, within a hotel or motel is available for exclusive use by one family or guest for more than one hundred (100) days in any one hundred-twenty (120) day continuous interval, the unit shall meet all requirements for a residence within the zoning district, including dwelling unit requirements in Section 1727. This requirement includes innkeeper’s and caretaker's residences.
9. Use of lodging units as residences, and vice versa, constitutes a change of use and shall comply with site plan amendment requirements.
10. A residence hotel shall provide a minimum of one-hundred (100) square feet per lodging room, excluding bathrooms, for each two (2) occupants, with an additional thirty (30) square feet for each additional occupant, to a maximum of four (4) occupants per room; and if more than two stories, have a sprinkler system.

when this Ordinance was adopted or is amended in relevant part may be continued even if it no
longer conforms to the provisions of this Ordinance. However, a legal nonconformity may not be
increased in any manner unless otherwise provided in this Ordinance.
2. Nonconforming uses. The following regulations apply to nonconforming uses:
a. Increases in use. Increases in nonconforming uses include, but are not limited to:
i. Occupying a greater area of land than was occupied at the time the use became nonconforming.
ii. Moving the nonconforming use in whole or part to any other portion of the lot than was occupied when it became nonconforming, unless approved under the provisions of this Article, a variance, or a special use permit.
b. Replacement with conforming use. Whenever a nonconforming use is replaced by
conforming use, the nonconforming use may not be resumed and any subsequent use of the land must conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located.
c. Discontinuance of nonconforming use. Whenever a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of 12 months or more, the nonconforming use may not be resumed and any
subsequent use of the land must conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located.
3. Nonconforming structures. The following regulations apply to nonconforming structures:
a. Change in use in nonconforming structure. A nonconforming structure may not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity, but the use of a nonconforming structure may be changed or altered to any use permitted in the district in which it is located. Further, any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which existed at the time of the relevant adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
b. Destruction. If a nonconforming structure is destroyed by any means to an extent of more than sixty (60%) percent or twice its assessed valuation at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. Where

nonconforming status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or
destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
c. Relocation of structure. If a nonconforming structure is moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is
located.
d. Single-family dwellings in business districts. In business districts, existing single-family
dwellings are permitted to add accessory buildings and uncovered decks in accordance with the requirements of the districts in which they are located.
4. Changes toward conformity. Changes on a lot that help bring it into or closer to conformity with
this Ordinance are permitted. Such activities include, but are not limited to increasing parking
where it is deficient, adding landscaping screening, or fencing where it otherwise is required or
would help mitigate a negative impact on abutting property, or replacing signs which do not
conform with this Ordinance with ones that do.
5. Additions relating to multi-family occupancy. Decks, stairways, fire escapes and wheelchair
ramps shall not be considered an expansion to a multiple-family residential nonconforming
structure in an R-1 or R-2 district if all of the following conditions have been met:
a. The addition meets the dimensional standards of the zoning ordinance;
b. There is no roofing, screening or enclosure of the addition;
c. The height of the floor of a deck addition is not above the first story floor level of the main structure being added to;

e. The baluster area between the flooring and the guardrail or hand railing shall have at least a fifty (50%) percent open area.
6. Fences and dumpster corrals. Fences and dumpster corrals shall not be considered an
expansion of a nonconforming use if the proposed fence or dumpster corral meet the zoning
ordinance standards for a conforming use.
SECTION 1902. NONCONFORMANCE BY REASON OF HEIGHT, AREA, YARDS, PARKING
AND OFF-STREET LOADING
A conforming use which does not conform to height, area, yard, parking or off-street loading provisions only may be altered, remodeled, modernized or enlarged, provided no additional encroachment of such provisions is occasioned thereby.
SECTION 1903. CHANGE OF USE
The use of a nonconforming building may be changed to another nonconforming use if the Zoning Board of Appeals finds that such new use would not markedly change the degree of nonconformance and would preserve or improve the desirability of the adjacent conforming uses. The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose such structural changes, building or site modifications or other requirements as it deems necessary to meet the above requirements. This section shall not be construed to permit the conversion of a nonconforming use to a prior nonconforming use nor to waive other provisions of this Article.
SECTION 1904. RESTORATION AND REPAIRS
Such repairs and maintenance work as are required to keep a nonconforming building or structure in a sound and modern condition may be made. A nonconforming building or structure which is

1. Changes to the location of a foundation or footprint of a nonconforming single-family residence destroyed by fire, wind or other calamity pursuant to Section 1904 may be made if the Zoning Administrator determines that the dimensional nonconformity of the structure is reduced or unchanged by said changes. If the property owner holds title to contiguous lots, or the lot is large enough to reconstruct the changed building footprint in a location which complies with the dimensional standards of the zoning district, the structure shall be rebuilt as nearly as possible in compliance with all Ordinance requirements as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
2. Restoration shall be started within a period of one year of the time of such damage and diligently pursued to completion.
3. Where applicable, restoration of any use, building, or structure, damaged by flood within the floodplain or flood fringe areas, shall require the approval and permission of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Federal Flood Insurance Administration.
4. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official, unless the building has been condemned, in which case it shall not be restored. Restoration to a safe condition shall include changes that bring the nonconforming use into conformity, or more nearly into conformity with this Ordinance.
5. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing, structures within the Monroe Park Subdivision (bounded by Avery Street on the north; North Shore Drive on the east; Lake Michigan on the west; and the Black River on the south) damaged or destroyed by fire, wind, or other calamity may be restored and the occupancy or use, as it existed at the time of such destruction, may be continued or resumed.
SECTION 1905. Reserved for Future Use.
SECTION 1906. ELIMINATION OF NONCONFORMING USES BY ACQUISITION
In accordance with Act 207 of the Public Acts of 1921, as amended, the City Council may, from time to time, acquire properties, or an interest therein, on which nonconforming uses or structures are located by condemnation or otherwise, and may remove such uses or structures and resell the property for a conforming use or develop it for public use. The net cost of said acquisition may be assessed against a benefit district, or may be paid from other sources of revenue.
SECTION 1907. NONCONFORMING DUE TO RECLASSIFICATION
The forgoing provisions of this Article shall also apply to buildings, structures, land, or uses which hereafter become nonconforming due to any reclassification of districts under this Ordinance or any subsequent change in the regulations of this Ordinance.
SECTION 1908. DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING USE
When a nonconforming use of a structure, land, or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for twelve (12) consecutive months, the structure, the land, or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the provisions of the zone district in which it is located.

SEC. 1909. NONCONFORMING LOTS, AND NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
A principal building or structure and customary accessory buildings or structures may be erected on any single nonconforming lot or any single nonconforming lot of record. provided that required yard setbacks and other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot, shall conform to the provisions of this Ordinance in the district in which such lot is located. However, if two or more nonconforming lots of record with continuous frontage in single ownership do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area for each individual lot of record, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Ordinance, and no portion of said undivided parcel shall be used or divided in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this Ordinance.
SECTION 1910. CHANGE OF TENANCY OR OWNERSHIP
The use of a lawful nonconforming use or structure runs with the property and may be sold to another person, provided the nonconforming use of the property remains consistent with the requirements of this Article (see Section 1908).
SECTION 1911. HARDSHIP CASES
Nonconforming buildings or structures may be structurally changed, altered or enlarged with the approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals when the Board finds that the request is a case of exceptional hardship in which failure to grant the relief requested would unreasonably restrict continued use of the property or would restrict valuable benefits that the public currently derives from the property as used in its nonconforming status; except, that any approval for structural changes, alteration or enlargement may be granted only with a finding by the Board that approval will not have an adverse affect on surrounding property and that it will be the minimum necessary to relieve the hardship.
SECTION 1912. PERMITS
It shall not be necessary for an owner of a legal nonconforming structure or use, existing on the effective date of this Ordinance to obtain a Zoning Permit in order to maintain its legal, nonconforming status. However, no nonconforming building, structure, or use for which a zoning or other permit under this Ordinance has been issued, shall be renewed, altered, or extended as may be authorized by this Article until a new Zoning Permit has been issued by the Zoning Administrator. In such cases, the Zoning Permit shall state specifically how the nonconforming building, structure, or use differs from the provisions of this Ordinance.
SECTION 1913. DIMENSIONAL NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
A structure which holds only permitted uses, but which does not meet the dimensional requirements of the zoning district existing at the time of enactment of this Ordinance shall be considered a dimensional nonconforming structure. The structure may continue to be used and maintained, although such structure does not conform to the provisions of this Ordinance, provided there is no increase in the degree or manner of nonconformance to the requirements of the ordinance, with the following exceptions:
a. An addition to a dimensional nonconforming structure which is inside the existing footprint of the structure and meets the zoning district standards for height is permitted.

March 29, 2017

b. A dimensional nonconforming structure which is damaged or destroyed by fire, wind, or other calamity may be restored and the occupancy or use, as it existed at the time of such destruction may be continued or resumed under the provisions of Section 1904.
c. A nonconforming residential structure in the R-1, R-2 or RM-1 Districts may be enlarged along the existing building lines in the rear and side yards only as long as the parallel line of the structure does not encroach any closer to the side or rear property lines than the conditions that presently exist and provided that the resulting setback to the drip edge of the building addition is no closer than three (3’) feet to any property line. Such addition must comply in all other respects with all other provision of this ordinance. (Amended 1/3/11, Ord.988)

Application for certificates of zoning compliance shall be in writing to the Zoning Administrator on forms furnished by that Department, and such certificates shall be issued within five (5) days after receipt of such application if it is found that the building or structure, or part thereof, or the use of land is in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
If such certificate is refused for cause, the applicant therefore shall be mailed a notice of such refusal and cause thereof, within the aforesaid five (5) day period.
SECTION 2105. INSPECTIONS
The Building Inspector shall inspect the site prior to the pouring of footings. The holder of every zoning permit for the construction, erection, alteration, repair, or moving of any building, structure, or part thereof, shall notify the Zoning Administrator and the Building Inspector immediately upon completion of the work authorized by such permit for final inspection.
SECTION 2106. FEES
1. The amount of all Planned Unit Development fees, Site Plan Review fees, Special Land Use fees, Inspection and Certificate of Zoning Compliance fees, Zoning Board of Appeals fees, Amendment fees, and any other fees pursuant to this Ordinance shall be determined, and periodically revised, by adoption of a Schedule of Fees by the South Haven City Council. Fees for review of development proposals, inspections and the issuance of zoning permits or certificates of zoning compliance required under this Ordinance shall be deposited with the City Treasurer in advance of processing any application, issuance of any permit or inspection. Fees shall be based on actual direct costs of inspection and supervision resulting from the enforcement of this Ordinance and may include the cost of filing approvals with other entities, such as the County Register of Deeds. Such fees may also include but are not limited to all costs associated with conducting a public hearing or inspection, including the newspaper notice and area map, postage, photocopying, staff time, Planning Commission, City Council and/or Zoning Board of Appeals time, mileage and any costs associated with reviews by qualified professional planners and/or engineers. Such fees may be collected in escrow with any unexpended balance returned to an applicant according to the procedure described below:
2. A fee is required for any application for approval of a Site Plan, Special Land Use, Planned Unit Development, variance, or other use or activity requiring a permit under this Ordinance, except for projects proposed by the City of South Haven or one of its agencies, or by any other public agency if the fee is waived by the Planning Commission. Either the Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission may require the deposit of fees to be held in escrow in the name of the applicant. An escrow fee shall be required for any project with more than ten (10) dwelling units, or more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of enclosed space, or which requires any more than twenty (20) parking
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-215-
spaces, or is within three hundred (300) feet of the Black River or Lake Michigan. An escrow fee may be requested for any other project which may, in the discretion of the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission create an identifiable and potentially negative impact on public infrastructure or services, or on adjacent properties and because of which, professional input is desired before a decision to approve, deny or approve with conditions is made.
3. The escrow shall be used to pay professional review expenses of engineers, community planners, and any other professionals whose expertise the City values to review the proposed application and/or site plan of an applicant. Professional review shall result in a report to the City indicating the extent of conformance or nonconformance with this Ordinance and to identify any problems which may create a threat to public health, safety or the general welfare. Mitigation measures or alterations to a proposed design may be identified where they would serve to lessen or eliminate identified impacts. The applicant will receive a copy of any professional review hired by the City and a copy of the statement of expenses for the professional services rendered.
4. No application for approval for which an escrow fee is requested will be processed until the escrow fee is deposited with the City Treasurer. The amount of the escrow fee shall be established based on an estimate of the cost of the services to be rendered by the professionals contacted by the Zoning Administrator. The applicant is entitled to a refund of any unused escrow fees at the time a permit is either issued or denied in response to the applicant's request.
5. If actual professional review costs exceed the amount of an escrow, the applicant shall pay the balance due prior to receipt of any Zoning Permit or other permit issued by a representative of the City in response to the applicant's request. Failure of the applicant to make timely payment of any balance due will entitle the City to place a lien on the subject property.
SECTION 2107. PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES AND PERFORMANCE BONDING FOR COMPLIANCE
1. Requirements - In authorizing any Zoning Permit, Temporary Zoning Permit, Special Land Use Permit, Planned Unit Development, site plan approval or variance, the body or official which approves the respective request, as designated by this Ordinance, may require that a performance guarantee or bond be furnished: (1) to insure compliance with the requirements, specifications and conditions imposed with the grant of such approval, permit or variance; (2) to insure the discontinuance of a temporary use by a stipulated time; and (3) to provide sufficient resources for the City to complete required improvements or conditions in the event the permit holder does not.
2. Improvements Covered - Improvements that shall be covered by the performance guarantee or bond include, but are not necessarily limited to: streets and other roadways, utilities, fencing, screening, landscaping, common open space improvements, lighting, drainage and sidewalks. The performance guarantee shall meet the following requirements:
a. Form. The performance guarantee shall be in the form of cash, certified check, irrevocable bank letter of credit, surety bond, or similar instrument acceptable to the City Treasurer, which names the property owner as the obliger and the City as the obligee.
b. Time when Required. The performance guarantee or bond shall be submitted at the time of issuance of the permit authorizing the activity of the project. If appropriate, based on the type of performance guarantee submitted, the City
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-216-
shall deposit the funds in an interest bearing account in a financial institution with which the City regularly conducts business.
c. Amount. The amount of the performance guarantee or bond should be sufficient to cover the estimated cost of the improvements or conditions. Additional guidelines for establishing the amount of a performance guarantee or bond may be prescribed by resolution of the City Council. If none are specified or applicable to the particular use or development, the City Council shall by resolution establish a guideline which it deems adequate to deal with the particular problem while ensuring the protection of the City and its inhabitants.
3. Return of Performance Guarantee or Bond - The Zoning Administrator, upon the written request of the obligor, and pursuant to the procedure in the next subsection, shall rebate portions of the performance guarantee upon determination that the improvements for which the rebate has been requested have been satisfactorily completed. The portion of the performance guarantee to be rebated shall be in the same amount as stated in the itemized cost estimate for the applicable improvement or condition.
4. Withholding and Partial Withholding of Performance Bond - As required improvements are completed, or when all of the required improvements have been completed, the obligor shall send written notice to the Zoning Administrator of completion of said improvements. Thereupon, the Zoning Administrator shall inspect all of the improvements and shall transmit recommendation to the Planning Commission and City Council indicating either approval, partial approval, or rejection of the improvements or conditions with a statement of the reasons for any rejections. If partial approval is indicated, the cost of the improvement or condition rejected shall be set forth.
a. The Planning Commission, or on a planned unit development the City Council, shall either approve, partially approve or reject the improvements or conditions with the recommendation of the Zoning Administrator's written statement and shall notify the obligor in writing of the action of the Planning Commission within 30 days after receipt of the notice from the obligor of the completion of the improvements. Where partial approval is granted, the obligor shall be released from liability pursuant to relevant portions of the performance guarantee or bond, except for that portion adequately sufficient to secure provision of the improvements not yet approved.
b. Should installation of improvements begin and fail to meet full completion based on the approved Site Plan, or if the project area is reduced in size and improvements are only partially completed or conditions only partially met, the City may complete the necessary improvements or conditions itself or by contract to an independent developer, and assess all costs of completing the improvements or conditions against the performance guarantee or bond. Any unused balance remaining would be returned to the applicant, any excess expense would be recorded as a lien on the property.
5. Record of Performance Guarantees - A record of authorized performance guarantees shall be maintained by the Zoning Administrator.

SECTION 2108. ZONING APPROVAL RUNS WITH THE LAND
The approval to engage in any land use activity or to construct a building or structure that is bestowed by a zoning permit, certificate of zoning compliance, or other permit issued under the authority of this Ordinance, or any variance granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals, runs with the land, just like a nonconforming use right, and not with the owner. Thus, any person who relies on a valid permit or approval granted under the terms of this Ordinance, may sell the property to another person who will enjoy the same rights, privileges and restrictions as the seller, provided that the sellers use of the property was not in violation of the Ordinance prior to the sale.

2. The Zoning Administrator shall inform the Department of Environmental Quality if the appeal involves a high risk erosion area or 100 year floodplain issue at the time an appeal is filed. Written notice of an exception request from the minimum required setback distance from a high risk erosion area shall be given to the Department of Environmental Quality at least 14 days prior to the hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals.
SECTION 2110. CONDITIONAL APPROVALS
1. As provided in the City-Village Zoning Act, PA 207 of 1921, site plans for special land uses, planned unit developments or other discretionary approvals may be approved with reasonable conditions.
2. The conditions may include conditions necessary to insure that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by the land use or activity, to protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to insure compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner.
3. A site plan shall be approved if it contains the information required and is in compliance with this Zoning Ordinance and with the conditions imposed pursuant to this Ordinance, other applicable Ordinances, and State and Federal statutes.
4. Decisions rejecting, approving, or conditionally approving a site plan shall be based upon requirements and standards contained in this Zoning Ordinance, other applicable Ordinances, and State and Federal statutes.
5. Once the site plan is approved and properly signed, any necessary special use permit, planned unit development permit, zoning permit, or building permit may be issued.

SECTION 2111. RECORDING CONDITIONS WITH REGISTER OF DEEDS
At the direction of the body or official making the final decision to approve or approve with conditions a planned unit development, special land use, variance or other discretionary approval authorized by this Ordinance, or as otherwise may be specified by this Ordinance, or at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, the approval or approval with conditions may be recorded with the County Register of Deeds of the County in which the property is located.

ARTICLE XXII
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
SECTION 2200. CREATION AND MEMBERSHIP
There is hereby established a Zoning Board of Appeals (“Board”) which shall perform its duties and exercise its powers as provided in Section 5 of Act 207 of Public Acts of 1921, as amended, and in such a way that objectives of this Ordinance shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done.
1. The Board shall consist of seven (7) members appointed by the City Council, one of which shall be a member of the Planning Commission. Appointments shall be as follows: One (1) member appointed for a period of one (1) year; two (2) members appointed for a period of two (2) years; and four (4) members appointed for a period of three (3) years, respectively; thereafter, each member to hold office for the full three (3) year term. Any vacancies in the Board shall be filled by appointment by the City Council for the remainder of the unexpired term.
2. The City Council may appoint not more than two (2) alternates for the same term as regular members of the Board. The alternate members may be called on a rotating basis to sit as regular members of the Board in the absence of a regular member. An alternate member may also be called to serve in the place of a regular member for the purpose of reaching a decision on a case in which the regular member has abstained for reasons of conflict of interest. The alternate member shall serve in the case until a final decision has been made. The alternate member shall have the same voting rights as a regular member of the Board.
3. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall annually elect its Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Secretary according to procedures it adopts in bylaws.
4. The compensation of the appointed members of the Zoning Board of Appeals may be fixed by the City Council.
SECTION 2201. MEETINGS
1. All meetings of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be held at the call of the Chairman and at such times as such Board may determine. All hearings conducted by said Board shall be open to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact; and shall also keep records of its hearings and other official action. The minutes of all meetings shall contain the grounds for every determination made by the Board including reference to pertinent evidence and data considered, all findings of fact and conclusions drawn by the Board, along with the vote of each member on every motion considered on a request under the provisions of Section 2204. A person other than the elected Secretary of the Board may take notes and prepare a draft of meeting minutes, but only minutes approved by a majority vote of the total membership of the Board of Appeals shall be considered official.
2. Five (5) members of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of its business.
3. The Board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, and compel testimony and the production of books, papers, files, and other evidence pertinent to the matters before it.
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-220-
4. All members of the Board shall vote on every matter (no abstentions) unless a member of the Board has a conflict of interest. A member of the Board shall request to be disqualified from a vote in which the member has a conflict of interest. The member shall state the nature of the conflict of interest and the Board shall vote whether to excuse the member from participation because of a conflict of interest. Failure to raise an issue of conflict of interest prior to discussion and vote on a matter before the Board, shall constitute misconduct in office for which the member may be removed, following a hearing.
5. Conflict of interest may include, but is not limited to considering property a Board member owns or has a legal or financial interest in or adjacent property; considering a request by a party a Board member has close ties with, such as a relative, friend, boss, co-worker or neighbor. A fundamental issue is whether the member of the Board believes he or she can objectively consider the request before the Board.
6. The Board shall adopt procedures for the conduct of its meetings in its bylaws.
SECTION 2202. FEES (Amended 9/1/85; Ord. No. 673)
The required fees for a hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals are a part of the cost of any zoning permit and are in addition to other building permit fees. The required fees for any hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be paid as specified in Section 2106 and certain additional expenses may be recovered if there are any additional costs incurred over and above the amount of the required fee. Said costs shall include, but are not limited to, if applicable, any additional hearings, the attendance of the City Attorney at the hearing(s), engineering fees, and professional planner consulting fee. An escrow may be collected to pay for these costs per the procedure in Section 2106.
SECTION 2203. JURISDICTION
The Board, in conformity with the provisions of the City Charter, this Ordinance, and Act 207 of the Public Acts of 1921, as amended, may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination appealed from and shall make such an order, requirements, decision, or determination as, in its opinion, ought to be made and to that end shall have all the powers to hear and decide all matters referred to it or upon which it is required to pass under this Ordinance.
SECTION 2204. APPEALS, INTERPRETATIONS & VARIANCES
Subject to the provisions of Section 2205, the Board, after public hearing, shall have the power to decide applications for appeals, interpretations, and variances filed as hereafter provided:
1. Where it is alleged by the appellant that there is an error or misinterpretation in any order, requirement, decision, grant, or refusal made by the Zoning Administrator or other administrative office in the carrying out or enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance then an appeal or request for Ordinance interpretation shall be filed with the Zoning Board of Appeals on forms established for that purpose. In deciding a request for Ordinance interpretation, the Board shall ensure that its interpretation is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance, the Article in which the language in question is contained, and all other relevant provisions of the Ordinance. All zoning map interpretation questions shall be guided by the standards in Section 302.
2. Where, by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property which existed on the effective date of this Ordinance, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of the land, building, or structure, or of the use or development of property immediately adjoining the property in question, the literal enforcement of the requirements of this Ordinance would
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-221-
involve practical difficulties or would cause unnecessary hardship; provided that the Board shall not grant a variance on a lot of less area than the requirements of its zone district, even though such lot existed at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance if the owner or members of his immediate family owned adjacent land which could, without unnecessary hardship, be included as part of the lot.
3. Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this Ordinance relating to the construction, structural changes in equipment, or alterations of buildings or structures, or the use of land, buildings, or structures so that the spirit of this Ordinance shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done.
SECTION 2205. DIMENSIONAL AND NONUSE VARIANCE STANDARDS
No variance in the provisions of this Ordinance shall be authorized unless the Board finds, from reasonable evidence, that all of the following standards have been met:
1. Such variance will not be detrimental to adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood.
2. Such variance will not impair the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
3. Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions apply to the property in question or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other properties in the same zoning district. Such circumstances shall create a practical difficulty because of unique circumstances or physical conditions such as narrowness, shallowness, shape or topography of the property involved, or to the intended use of the property. See Section 2204(2).
4. Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right similar to that possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and in the vicinity. The possibility of increased financial return shall not of itself be deemed sufficient to warrant a variance.
5. The condition or situation of the specific piece of property or of the intended use of said property, for which the variance is sought, is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such conditions or situation.
6. The condition or situation of the specific piece of property or of the intended use of said property, for which the variance is sought shall not be the result of actions of the property owner. In other words, the problem shall not be self-created.
7. That strict compliance with area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk or density would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose, or would render conformity unnecessarily burdensome.
8. That the variance requested is the minimum amount necessary to overcome the inequality inherent in the particular property or mitigate the hardship.
9 That the variance will relate only to property under the control of the applicant.

SECTION 2206. USE VARIANCE
Upon an appeal for a use variance for a use not regulated by this Ordinance or for a use not permitted within a Zone District, the Board shall forward the request to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall forward a report with recommendation to the Board on the variance request. No use variance for a use not permitted within a Zoning District shall be granted by the Board unless the Board determines that the property cannot reasonably be used in a manner consistent with the existing zoning. The following specific procedure shall be observed unless the petitioner chooses to pursue a Hardship Planned Unit Development through the City Council instead, per the requirements of Article XII.
1. Application Requirements
In addition to the information required for other variance requests, an application for a use variance shall include a plan drawn to scale detailing the specific use and improvements proposed by the applicant, and a summary of the facts which support each of the following conclusions:

b. Applicant's plight is due to unique circumstances peculiar to his property and not to general neighborhood conditions.
c. Applicant's suggested use would not alter the essential character of the area.

ARTICLE XXIV
M-43/I-196 BUSINESS LOOP CORRIDOR OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICT
SECTION 2400. INTENT
1. The M-43/I-196 Business Loop Corridor Overlay Zoning District (the “Corridor Overlay Zone”) is established to enhance the quality and compatibility of development, to establish consistent design guidelines, to encourage the most appropriate use of lands, to promote the safe and efficient movement of traffic and preserve property values along the M-43/I-196 Business Loop through the City of South Haven, Michigan.
Specifically the Corridor Overlay Zone is intended to:
a. Accommodate a variety of uses as permitted by the underlying zoning, and ensure such uses are designed to achieve an attractive built and natural environment.
b. Provide site design standards that are developed specifically for the areas in order to promote harmonious development and complement the natural characteristics in the City.
c. Ensure safe access for vehicles and pedestrians.
d. Provide landowners with reasonable and safe access via the use of shared driveways, service drives, and access from side streets.
e. Require demonstration that prior to approval of any land divisions, the resultant parcel is accessible through compliance with the access standards herein.
f. Ensure that distractions to motorists are minimized by avoiding blight and clutter while providing property owners and businesses with appropriate design flexibility and visibility.
g. Establish uniform standards to ensure fair and equal application.
h. Address situations where existing development within the Corridor Overlay
Zone does not conform to the standards of this chapter.
i. As development continues, it is the intent of the city to provide regulations
which protect the adjacent residential properties.
2. In order to accommodate the varying characteristics found along M-43 and I-196 in the city, this zoning overlay district is divided into three (3) Areas.
a. Area A includes the B-4 zoned parcels along Phoenix Street from the I-196 Interchange west to Blue Star Highway. These areas are characterized as accommodating highway oriented businesses. It is anticipated that large retailers and those needing highway access will continue to be drawn to these areas. (See Figures 1 and 2 regarding general site design intent for Area A.)
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-230-
Figure 1
Figure 2
b. Area B includes the non-single family residential (CBD, B-2 and RM-1) parcels
from the Phoenix Street and Pearl Street intersection west to Broadway Street
and south along Broadway to Superior Street. The area provides for compact
development similar to that found in the Central Business District. Walkability
and nonmotorized access to this area is critical. (See Figure 3 regarding general
site design intent for Area B.)
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-231-
Figure 3
c. Area C comprises the remainder of the corridor overlay properties including
those properties zoned B-2 adjacent to Broadway Street from Superior south to
LaGrange, Phillips and Bailey Streets to Aylworth Avenue. Also included are
properties along the west side of Blue Star Highway south from Phoenix Street to
Superior Street. This is generally an area which is developing with a large
number of medical and professional services. The scale of new development and
the transportation orientation of this Area are important factors in establishing the
site development requirements contained in this Article. (See Figure 4 regarding
general site design intent for Area C.)

3. The overlay zoning map graphically depicts the boundaries of the Corridor Overlay Zone.
SECTION 2401. APPLICABILITY
1. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the regulations herein apply to all existing or future parcels directly adjacent to or having access on the M-43/I-196 Highway corridor through the City of South Haven, as identified on the overlay zoning map.
2. Single-family dwellings are exempt from these Corridor Overlay Zone regulations, unless the dwelling is later changed to a nonresidential use as permitted in the underlying zone.
3. Where the standards of this Corridor Overlay Zone are more restrictive, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, such standards supersede and replace those that apply to the underlying zoning district. For example, if the underlying zoning district illustrated on the City Zoning Map is B-2, the uses listed as permitted in Section 901 of this chapter are permitted for that lot, but the access, landscaping, setbacks, freestanding signs and building facade must comply with this Corridor Overlay Zone.
4. Proposed planned unit developments (PUD) within the Corridor Overlay Zone shall generally be consistent with the standards herein, but may be modified by the planning commission based upon the requirements and criteria for PUDs located in this chapter and the specifics of the particular site and proposed use(s).
SECTION 2402. APPLICABILITY MATRIX
The standards described or referenced in this article apply to both new and
existing development as listed or exempted in the following table for all parcels in
the Corridor Overlay Zone. All development in the Corridor Overlay Zone shall require full compliance with all applicable regulations including reviews, approvals, and permits from the planning commission prior to the start of any project or land disturbance.

SECTION 2403. PERMITTED AND SPECIAL USES
1. Permitted and special land uses within the Overlay Zone shall be as regulated in the underlying zoning district (as designated on the Zoning Map) with the following additional provisions:
a. To ensure adequate information is provided to evaluate the impact on traffic operations, any permitted use that can be expected to generate 50 peak hour directional trips or 100 peak hour trips (in and out) or 1000 trips during a typical day shall be classified as a special land use. Calculations of trips shall be based on the most recent edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The applicant shall be responsible for providing the traffic calculations for review. Where no information is provided, the City shall make the determination. (A guideline that lists typical sizes for various uses where the thresholds are met is available from the zoning administrator.)
b. Any site that provides more than the minimum parking required shall be considered a special land use in this chapter.
c. The use and site design shall comply with the standards of this section and other applicable regulations of the Corridor Overlay Zone.
d. Outdoor cafes and outdoor seating shall be allowed by special use permit in Area B subject to Section 1502 and 1510.34 of this chapter as applicable. Outdoor seating encroaching on public property shall be subject to obtaining a license agreement from city council.
e. For special land uses, the following standards shall be considered along with those listed in Section 1502 of this chapter:
I. The building and site design will be designed to promote consistency and quality of development within the Corridor Overlay Zone.
II. Access spacing from intersections, other driveways, and any median crossovers will meet the standards within the Overlay Zone and will meet
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-235-
the standards of the applicable road agency (MDOT or the Van Buren County Road Commission), and will be the maximum practical.
III. Where shared access is proposed or required, provision will be made to share access with adjacent uses, either now or in the future, and shall include written shared access and maintenance agreements to be recorded with the Van Buren County Register of Deeds.
IV. Traffic impacts associated with the proposed use will be accommodated by the road system without degradation in the level of service1 below one grade (example from B to C) but in no case shall any movement(s) be projected at a level of service below D, unless improvements are being made to address the impacts.
SECTION 2404. SUBMITTAL INFORMATION
In addition to the submittal information required for site plan review in Section 1405 of this chapter, the following shall be provided with any application for site plan or special land use review. Additionally, the information listed in items 1-4 below shall be required with any request for a land division.
1. Existing access points within 500 feet of the frontage, on both sides of any adjoining roads, shall be shown on the site plan or on a separate plan sheet.
2. Information on sight distance. The applicant shall submit evidence indicating that the sight distance requirements of the MDOT or Van Buren County Road Commission, as applicable, are met.
3. Dimensions between proposed and existing drives, intersections, and any median crossovers shall be shown.

If an alternative is proposed, both the original application and the alternative shall be considered at the same public hearing.
3. The Planning Commission shall set a time and place for a public hearing and provide for the legal publishing and proper posting of notices of such hearing, time, and date in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, to be printed not less than fifteen (15) days before the date of the hearing.

Such notices shall include the places and times at which the tentative text or map change(s) may be examined. A record of all notices prepared and sent, and to whom they are sent shall be maintained with the file of the application. The notices shall include the places and times at which the tentative text and/or any rezoning maps may be examined.
4. At said hearing, the Planning Commission shall establish that the applicant has paid to the City the fees required by this Ordinance and that proper notices have been made.
5. The Planning Commission shall hold said public hearing, noting all comments and reports requested, or noting the absence of such. The Planning Commission shall consider each proposed amendment according to the factors in Section 2501.
6. If the Planning Commission votes to recommend approval of such amendment without change, it shall forward the amendment to the City Council with recommendation for approval or denial, which recommendation shall be accompanied by a summary of the comments made at the public hearing and the findings of the Planning Commission relative to the factors in Section 2501.

9. Within two (2) weeks following the decision of the Planning Commission, a copy of the recommendation on the proposed amendment shall be forwarded to the City Council.
10. Following a public hearing, the City Council may adopt or deny said amendment with a concurring vote of a majority of its members, with or without any amendments that have been previously considered at a public hearing.
11. If the City Council considers amendment changes, additions, or departures advisable to the proposed text or zoning map, it shall refer the same to the Planning Commission for a report thereon within a time specified by the City Council. After review of such report, the City Council may then proceed to consider the adoption of any such amendment.
SECTION 2501. FACTORS TO CONSIDER ON AMENDMENTS
1. Scope of Examination - In reviewing any application for an amendment to this Ordinance, the Planning Commission shall identify and evaluate all factors relevant to the application, and shall report its findings in full along with its recommendations for disposition of the application to the City Council within a period of thirty-five (35) days from the public hearing. The matters to be considered by the Planning Commission shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
a. What, if any, identifiable conditions related to the application have changed which justify the proposed amendment?
b. What are the precedents and the possible effects of such precedent which might result from the approval or denial of the application?
c. What is the impact of the amendment on the ability of the City and other governmental agencies to provide adequate public services and facilities, and/or programs that might reasonably be required in the future if the proposed amendment is adopted?
d. Does the proposed district change adversely affect environmental conditions, the character or the likely value of the surrounding property?
e. Does the proposed district change comply with the adopted City Comprehensive Plan? If not, and if the proposed zoning change is reasonable, in light of all other relevant factors, then the Plan should be amended before the requested zoning amendment is approved.
f. If a specific property is involved, can the property in question be put to a reasonable economic use in the zoning district in which it is presently located.
g. Is another procedure, such as a variance, special land use or planned unit development procedure a more appropriate alternative than a rezoning?
2. Outside Agency or Consultant Review - In determining the degree to which a rezoning request conforms with the factors listed above, the Planning Commission may solicit information and testimony from officials in other public offices including, but not limited to, the following agencies:
a. County Health Department
b. County Road Commission
c. County Drain Commission

SECTION 2503. OPTIONS UPON DENIAL OF AMENDMENT REQUEST
A property owner whose amendment or rezoning request is denied may file an appeal with Circuit Court. If the property owner alleges that the denial of the amendment has the result of leaving the property owner with no reasonable or economically viable use of the property, then the property owner may request a Hardship PUD pursuant to the requirements of Article XII or request a use variance pursuant to the requirements of Section 2206.
SECTION 2504. RESUBMITTAL
No application for a rezoning which has been denied by the City Council shall be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of the last denial, except on grounds of newly-discovered evidence or proof of changed conditions found upon inspection by the City Council to be valid.
SECTION 2505. COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ZONING ORDINANCE
The Planning Commission shall in the year 2000 and at intervals of not more than five (5) years thereafter, examine all the provisions of this Ordinance and the location of zoning district boundary lines and shall submit a report to the City Council recommending changes and amendments, if any, which are deemed to be desirable in the interest of public health, safety and general welfare.

3. The following minimum standards are recommended for all landscape materials:
a. Quality. Plant material and grasses should be of generally acceptable varieties and species, free of insects and diseases, hardy to the climate, conform to the current minimum standard of the American Association of Nurserymen, and should have proof of any required governmental regulations and/or inspections.
b. Composition. A mixture of plant material, such as evergreen, deciduous trees and shrubs, is recommended as a protective measure against insect and disease infestation. A limited mixture of hardy species is recommended rather than a large quantity of different species to produce a more aesthetic, cohesive design and avoid a disorderly appearing arrangement.
c. Existing Trees.
1) If existing plant material is labeled "To Remain" on site plans by the applicant or required by the City, protective techniques, such as, but not limited to, fencing or barriers placed at the dripline around the perimeter of the plant material should be installed during construction. No vehicle or other construction equipment should be parked or stored within the dripline of any plant material intended to be saved. Other protective techniques may be used provided such techniques are approved by the City.
2) In the event that healthy trees which are used to meet the minimum requirements of this Ordinance or those labeled to remain are cut down, destroyed, damaged, or excavated at the dripline, as determined by the City, the Contractor should replace them with trees which meet Ordinance requirements.
4. Standards for All Required Landscaped Areas:
a. All landscaping materials should consist of healthy specimens compatible with local climate, soil characteristics, drainage, and water supply. All plant material should be reasonably resistant to drought and disease. Non-nursery derived stock should not be used to satisfy these requirements. All landscaping and landscape elements should be planted, and earth moving or grading performed, in a sound workmanlike manner and according to accepted good planting and grading procedures.
b. Grass or other living plants should be the primary ground cover in required landscaped areas unless a plan for permanently maintaining mulch is approved. Both sod planting and seeding are acceptable.
c. Ground covers other than grass should be planted in required areas to provide complete coverage within two (2) growing seasons. Vines should not be used adjacent to pedestrian areas.
d. Materials such as river rock, cobble, boulders, paving stone, patterned concrete, bark and wood chips should be limited to small areas and should not exceed twenty-five (25%) percent of the required landscaped area unless special circumstances are identified which warrant allowing a larger area in the opinion of the decision body. All such ground covers should be at least six (6") inches deep.
City of South Haven Zoning Ordinance
March 29, 2017
-260-

5. Maintenance: Maintenance should include all reasonable and regular irrigation, weeding, fertilizing, and pruning. Plant materials which show signs of insect pests, diseases and/or damage should be removed immediately or as soon as practical under the seasonal conditions existing and according to the approved site plan. The developer and subsequent owner(s) should be responsible for maintaining all on-site landscaping in a living condition. All landscaped areas should be provided with a readily available and acceptable water supply.
