codes, titles, chapters and sections, shall be known and designated as the
â€œWabasha City Codeâ€, for which designation â€œcode of ordinancesâ€, â€œcodified

â€œand/orâ€, whenever the context requires.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Acts by assistants. When a statute, code provisions or ordinance
requires an act to be done which, by law, an agent or deputy as well may do as
the principal, that requisition shall be satisfied by the performance of the
act by an authorized agent or deputy.

(Prior Code, Â§ 100.05)
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Official statutes. References to â€œMinnesota Statutesâ€ are to Minnesota
Statutes 2018, unless otherwise provided in this code. References to rules and

to those documents in effect on the effective date of this code unless
otherwise provided.
(Prior Code, Â§ 100.07)
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Relation to state law. It is the intent of the City Council that the
provisions of this code are the fullest exercise of the regulatory and other
powers granted to it by state law and the City Charter. When this code imposes
a more stringent rule or standard of conduct than contained in similar
provisions of state law, rule or regulation, it is the intent of the Council
that the provisions of this code prevail over state law, rule or regulation to
the extent permitted by law.
(Prior Code, Â§ 100.09)
Â§ 10.20Â  ENFORCEMENT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Any licensed peace officer of the cityâ€™s Police Department, the County
Sheriff or any Deputy Sheriff shall have the authority to enforce any provision
of this code.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â As permitted by M.S. Â§ 626.862, as it may be amended from time to
time, the City Clerk shall have the authority to administer and enforce this
code. In addition, under that statutory authority, certain individuals
designated within the code or by the Clerk or City Council shall have the
authority to administer and enforce the provisions specified. All and any
person or persons designated may issue a citation in lieu of arrest or
continued detention to enforce any provision of the code.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The City Clerk and any city official or employee designated by this
code who has the responsibility to perform a duty under this code may with the
permission of a licensee of a business or owner of any property or resident of
a dwelling, or other person in control of any premises, inspect or otherwise
enter any property to enforce compliance with this code.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â If the licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of a
premises objects to the inspection of or entrance to the property, the City
Clerk, peace officer or any employee or official charged with the duty of
enforcing the provisions of this code may, upon a showing that probable cause
exists for the issuance of a valid search warrant from a court of competent
jurisdiction, petition and obtain a search warrant before conducting the
inspection or otherwise entering the property. This warrant shall be only to
determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce these
provisions only, and no criminal charges shall be made as a result of the
warrant. No warrant shall be issued unless there be probable cause to issue the
warrant. Probable cause occurs if the search is reasonable. Probable cause does
not depend on specific knowledge of the condition of a particular property.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Every licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of property
within the city shall permit at reasonable times inspections of or entrance to
the property by the City Clerk or any other authorized city officer or employee
only to determine whether the provisions of this code enacted to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the people are being complied with and to enforce
these provisions. Unreasonable refusal to permit the inspection of or entrance
to the property shall be grounds for termination of any and all permits,
licenses or city service to the property. Mailed notice shall be given to the
licensee, owner, resident or other person in control of the property, stating
the grounds for the termination, and the licensee, owner, resident or other
person in control of the property shall be given an opportunity to appear
before the City Clerk to object to the termination before it occurs, subject to
appeal of the Clerkâ€™s decision to the City Council at a regularly scheduled or
special meeting.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the city to enter private property in urgent emergency situations where there
is an imminent danger in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
Â§ 10.98Â  SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Purpose and intent. Administrative offense procedures established
pursuant to this section are intended to provide the public and the city with
an informal, cost effective and expeditious alternative to traditional criminal
charges for violations of certain city code provisions. The procedures are
intended to be voluntary on the part of those who have been charged with
administrative offenses. At any time prior to the payment of the administrative
penalty, as is provided for hereafter, the individual may withdraw from
participation in the procedures, in which event, the city may bring criminal
charges in accordance with the law. Likewise, the city, in its discretion, may
choose not to initiate an administrative offense and may bring criminal charges
in the first instance. In the event a party participates in the administrative
offense procedures, but does not pay the monetary penalty which may be imposed,
the city may bring criminal charges in the district court, and seek to collect
the cost of the administrative offense procedures as part of a subsequent
criminal sentence, in the event the party is charged and is adjudicated guilty
of the criminal violation.
(Prior Code, Â§ 1202.01)
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â â€œAdministrative offenseâ€ defined. An ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSE is a
violation of a provision of the city code and is subject to the administrative
penalties set forth in the schedule of offenses and penalties referred to in
division (G) below.
(Prior Code, Â§ 1202.02)
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Notice. Any officer of the city, the Police Department or any other
person employed by the city, authorized by the Police Chief, and having
authority to enforce the city code, shall, upon determining that there has been
a violation, notify the violator, in writing. The notice shall set forth the
nature, date and time of the violation, the name of the official issuing the
notice and the amount of the scheduled penalty.
(Prior Code, Â§ 1202.03)
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Payment. Once notice is given, the alleged violator may, within 15
days of the time of issuance of the notice, pay the amount set forth on the
schedule of penalties for the violation. The penalty may be paid in person, or
by mail, and payment shall be deemed an admission of the violation. In such
case, no criminal proceeding shall be brought against the violator in district
court.
(Prior Code, Â§ 1202.04)
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Failure to pay. In the event a party charged with an administrative
offense fails to pay the penalty, charges may be brought against the alleged
violator in accordance with applicable statutes and city code in the district
court.
(Prior Code, Â§ 1202.05)
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Disposition of penalties. All penalties collected pursuant to this
section shall be paid to the city and deposited into the General Fund.
(Prior Code, Â§ 1202.06)
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Offenses and penalties. Offenses which may be charged as
administrative offenses and the penalties for these offenses shall be
determined by City Council resolution.

on the basis thereof. If the person shall fail to file the return or corrected
return, the city shall make a return or corrected return for the person based

herein specified for the payment, or an extension thereof, there shall be added
thereto a civil penalty equal to 10% of the amount remaining unpaid.

prescribed by this subchapter, unless it is shown that the failure is not due
to willful neglect, there shall be added to the tax in addition to penalty
provided in division (A) above, a penalty of 10% for each 30-day period or
fraction thereof during which the failure continues, not exceeding 25% in the
aggregate. There shall be a minimum penalty assessed of $25 if penalties in the
aggregate do not exceed that amount. The amount so added to any tax shall be
collected at the same time and in the same manner and as part of the tax unless
the tax has been paid before the discovery of the negligence, in which case the
amount so added shall be collected in the same manner as the tax.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â If any person willfully fails to file any return or make any payment
required by this subchapter, or willfully files a false of fraudulent return or
willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax or payment thereof,
there shall also be imposed as a civil penalty an amount equal to 50% of any
tax (less any amounts paid on the basis of the false or fraudulent return)
found due for the period to which such return related. This penalty shall be
collected as part of the tax, and shall be in addition to any other penalties
provided by this subchapter.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â All payments received shall be credited first to penalties, next to
interest and then to the tax due.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â The amount of tax not timely paid, together with any penalty provided
by this subchapter, shall bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum from the
time the tax should have been paid until payment is made. Any interest and
penalty shall be added to the tax and collected as part thereof.

consuming procedures and formalities prescribed by law pertaining to the
performance of public work, entering rental equipment agreements, purchase of
supplies and materials, limitations upon tax levies, and the appropriation and

room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set forth
on the bill; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, a second bill
will be mailed containing a cutoff notice that if the bill is not paid within
ten days of the mailing of the second bill, service will be discontinued for
nonpayment; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â That any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill
shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his choosing and may present
orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the city official
in charge of utility billing.Â  This official shall be authorized to order that
the customerâ€™s service not be discontinued and shall have the authority to make
a final determination of the customerâ€™s complaint.

herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility service

order the water shut off forthwith.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â No water shall be furnished to consumers unless supplied through a
meter approved by the Utilities Commission, at the rates established and set
forth by the City Council in
Appendix A.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â The property owner is responsible for the water/sewer billing, however
at the request of the owner and upon completion of the rental unit request for
water/sewer services, billing will be sent to the renter of the premises.
Direct billing to the renter does not relieve the owner of responsibility, in
the event the renter fails to pay the bill, the property owner will be
responsible for the unpaid amount.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Any charges which are delinquent by 60 days or more may be certified
by the City Clerk to the County Auditor for collection from the property owner.
The amounts so certified shall be extended by the County Auditor on the tax
rolls against the premises.

produce effluent quality required by the permit or causes a violation of any
applicable local, state or federal regulation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â In the event of discharges to the public sewers which contain
substances or possess characteristics prohibited in division (B) above and this
division (C) or which, in the judgment of the representative, may have a
deleterious effects to the treatment facility, receiving waters, soils,
vegetation or which create a hazard or nuisance, the representative may:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Refuse to accept the waste;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers pursuant to Â§ 307(b) of the Act, being 33 U.S.C. Â§ 1317(b)Â 
and all addenda thereof; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â Require payment to cover all the added costs handling, treating
and disposing of wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â If the representative permits the pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design, installation, maintenance and efficient operation of
the facilities and equipment shall be at the ownerâ€™s expense and shall be
subject to review and approval by the city pursuant to the requirements of the
MPCA.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â No user shall increase the use of process water or in any manner
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in this section,
the national categorical pretreatment standards and any state or local
requirement.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided at the
owners expense when, in the opinion of the representative, they are necessary
for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in
excessive amounts, any flammable wastes, sand, other harmful ingredients. All
interceptors shall be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of interceptors,
including proper removal and disposal of the captured materials by appropriate
means, and shall maintain a record of dates and means of disposal which are
subject to review by the representative.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any material removal and hauling must be performed by the ownerâ€™s
personnel or a currently licensed waste disposal firm and in compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Where required by the representative, industrial users shall install
and maintain, at their own expense, a suitable structure or control manhole
with such necessary meters and other testing equipment needed to facilitate
observation, sampling and measurement of wastewater. The manhole will be safe
and accessible at all times. The Utilities Commission may require submission of
laboratory analyses to illustrate compliance with this chapter any special
conditions for discharge established by the Utilities Commission or responsible
regulatory agency. All measurements, tests and analyses to which reference is
made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition
of Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the
American Public Health Association, and kept for a period of two years.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Where required by the representative, users shall provide
protection from an accidental discharge of substances regulated by this
chapter. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharges of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the ownerâ€™s expense.

Â§ 53.11Â  SEWER CHARGE SYSTEM.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The cityâ€™s Utilities Commission hereby establishes a sewer
service charge system. All revenue collected from users of the wastewater
treatment facilities will be used for annual operation, maintenance,
replacement and capital costs. Each user shall pay a proportionate share of
operation, maintenance and replacement costs based on the users proportionate
contribution to the total wastewater loading.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Charges to users of the wastewater treatment facility shall be
determined and fixed in a sewer service charge system (SSCS) developed
according to the provisions of this chapter. The SSCS adopted by resolution
upon enactment of this chapter shall be published in the local newspaper and
shall be effective upon publication. Subsequent changes in the sewer service
rates and charges shall be adopted by Utilities Commission resolution and
published in the local paper.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Revenues collected through the SSCS shall be deposited in a
separate fund known as the Sewer Service Fund (SSF).
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The community or sewer district of the city hereby establishes a
Sewer Service Fund as an income fund to receive all revenues generated by the
SSCS and all other income dedicated to the wastewater treatment facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The SSF administered by a designated representative shall be
separate and apart from all other accounts. Revenue received by the SSF shall
be transferred to the following accounts established as income and expenditure
accounts:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Operation and Maintenance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Equipment Replacement; and

Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A designated representative shall maintain a proper system of
accounts and records suitable for determining the operation, maintenance,
replacement (OM&R) and debt retirement costs of the treatment facilities and
shall furnish the Utilities Commission with a report of the costs annually.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â At that time, the Utilities Commission shall determine whether
sufficient revenue is being generated for the effective management of the
facilities and department retirement. The Utilities Commission will also
determine whether the user charges are distributed proportionately. If
necessary, the SSCS shall be revised to ensure proportionality of user charges
and sufficient funds.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In accordance with state requirements, each user will be notified
annually in conjunction with a regular billing of that portion of the sewer
service charge attributable to OM&R.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Sewer service charges shall be billed on a monthly basis. Any bill not
paid in full 15 days after the due date will be considered delinquent. At that
time, the user will be charged a 10% penalty for the delinquent bill. The
penalty shall be computed as 10% of the original bill and shall be increased by
the same percent for every month the bill is outstanding. A $50 reconnection
fee will be charged if service has been discontinued due to a delinquent bill.

Â§ 53.99Â  PENALTY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to Â§
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to design, install, maintain,
alter, pump or inspect any individual sewage treatment system in the city, or
cause the same to be done in contrary to or in violation of any provisions of
the individual sewage treatment standards embodied in this chapter. Each day
during which a violation of Â§
53.04 of this chapter is committed, continued or permitted, constitutes a
separate offense.
(Prior Code, Â§ 505.05)
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Upon determination that a user has violated or is violating
applicable provisions of this chapter or related permits, the authorized
representative may issue a notice of violation. Within ten days of the
notification, the violator shall submit to the authorized representative an
adequate explanation for the violation and a plan for the correction and
prevention of the occurrences, including specific actions require. Submission
of a plan in no way relieves the violator of liability for any violations
occurring before or after the issuance of the notice of violation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any violation is subject to a fine not exceeding $2,000. Each day
in which any violation occurs shall be deemed as a separate offense. The fines
may be added to the userâ€™s next sewer service charge and will hence be subject
to the same collection regulations as specified in Â§
53.05 of this chapter. Users desiring to dispute a fine must file a request for
the authorized representative to reconsider within ten days of the issuance of
the fine. If the authorized representative believes that the request has merit,
a hearing on the matter shall convene within 45 days of the receipt of the
request.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â To collect delinquent sewer service charge accounts, the community
or sewer district may file a civil action suit or levy a lien against the
violator. Related attorneyâ€™s fees fixed by court order shall also be collected.
The violator shall be liable for interest on all balances at a rate of 18%
annually.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage occasioned by the

APPENDIX A:Â  DETERMINATION OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGES (METERED)
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Users of the wastewater treatment facilities shall be permitted
into one of the following classes:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Residential;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Non-residential; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Industrial.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Charges to users who discharge NDSW will be calculated on the basis
of metered water use.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Each user shall pay operation, maintenance and replacement costs
in proportion to the userâ€™s contribution of wastewater flows and loadings to
the treatment plant, with a minimum rate for loadings of BOD and TSS being the
rate established for normal domestic strength waste (NDSW) concentrations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The industrial users discharging only segregated NDSW can be
classified as non-residential users for the purpose of rate determination.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Charges for residential and non-residential users will be determined
proportionately according to billable wastewater flow.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Residential users. Billable wastewater volume for residential users
shall be calculated on the basis of metered water usage. The monthly billable
water usage will be based on usage in the first quarter of the calendar year.
The city may require residential users to install water meters for the purpose
of determining billable wastewater volume.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Sewer minimum availability charge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Each customer shall be billed the current minimum sewer charge
in the event that the customer is not connected to city sewer, but there is a
city sewer connection available.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Rates are as set forth in
Appendix B.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Any premises not located within the corporate limits of the
city, which are connected or may hereinafter be connected to the sewer system
shall be charged at a rate equal to twice the in-city rate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The Utilities Commission reserves the right to set rates for any
designated sanitary district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Non-residential users. Billable wastewater volume of non-
residential users may be determined in the same manner as for residential
users; except that, if the city determines that there are significant seasonal
variations in metered water usage resulting in a proportionate increase in
wastewater volume, the billable wastewater will be:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Calculated on the basis of quarterly water usage as recorded
throughout the year; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Calculated on the basis of metered wastewater flow. The city may
require non- residential users to install additional water meters or wastewater
flow meters as may be necessary to determine billable wastewater volume.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â For producers of normal domestic strength wastes:
Uomr = Comr/Tbwv
Â Â Â Â Â Â Where:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Uomr = Unit cost for operation, maintenance and equipment replacement in
$/Kgal
Â Â Â Â Â Â Comr = Total annual OM&R costs
Â Â Â Â Â Â Tbwv = Total annual billable wastewater flow in Kgal
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Local construction costs for the wastewater treatment facility will be
recovered through a debt service charge calculated in a manner consistent with
the user charge as follows: calculation of unit cost for debt service:
Uds = Cds/Tbwv
Â Â Â Â Â Â Where:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Uds = Cost for annual debt service ($/Kgal)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Cds = Cost of annual debt service
Â Â Â Â Â Â Tbwv - Total annual billable wastewater volume (Kgal)
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The sewer service charges established in this chapter will not
prevent the assessment of additional charges to users who discharge wastes in
concentrations greater than NDSW or of unusual character (industrial users).
Special contractual agreements can be made with the users, or a discharge
permit issued to them, subject to the following conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The user pays OM&R costs in proportion to the userâ€™s
contribution of wastewater flows and loadings to the treatment facility and no
user is charged at a rate inferior to the charge for normal domestic strength
wastes; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The sampling of wastewater shall be conducted in accordance with
the techniques established in Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater, latest edition.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A study of unit costs of collection and treatment processes
attributable to flow, BOD, TSS and other significant loadings shall be
developed and used to determine the proportionate allocation of costs to flows
and loadings for industrial users.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â In the event that a user fails to pay his or her sewer rental fee
within a reasonable time as determined by the Commission, the fee shall be
certified by the Clerk and assessed against the property connected to the sewer
system and forwarded to the County Auditor for collection.

stay when persons other than family members are present. If the dog is outside
the proper enclosure, the dog must be muzzled and restrained by a substantial
chain or leash no longer than four feet and under the physical restraint of an
adult. The muzzle must be made in a manner that will prevent the dog from
biting any person or animal but that will not cause injury to the dog or
interfere with its vision or respiration.

into the city. Dogs in violation of this division are subject to impoundment
and destruction.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Seizure. Animal control may immediately seize any dangerous or

reclaimed by the owner of the dog upon payment of maintenance costs, and
presenting proof to animal control that the requirements of this section have
been met. A dog not reclaimed under this division within seven days may be
disposed of and the owner will be liable to the city for maintenance costs. A
person claiming an interest in a seized dog may prevent disposition of the dog
by posting a security in an amount sufficient to provide for the dogâ€™s
maintenance costs. The security must be posted with the city within seven days
of the seizure inclusive of the date seized.
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Subsequent offenses: seizure. If a person has been convicted of
violating a provision of this section, and the person is charged with a
subsequent violation relating to the same dog, the dog may be seized. If the
owner is convicted of the crime for which the dog was seized, the court may
order that the dog be destroyed in a proper and humane manner and the owner pay
the maintenance costs. If the owner is not convicted and the dog is not
reclaimed by the owner within seven days after the owner has been notified that
the dog may be reclaimed, the dog may be disposed of in manner permitted by
law.

of the disposition of the case, that the animal be destroyed based on a written
order containing one or more of the following findings of fact:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The animal is dangerous as demonstrated by a vicious attack, an
unprovoked attack, an attack without warning or multiple attacks; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The owner of the animal has demonstrated an inability or
unwillingness to control the animal in order to prevent injury to persons or
other animals.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Procedure. The Animal Control Officer, after having determined that an
animal is dangerous, may proceed in the following manner: The Animal Control
Officer shall cause one owner of the animal to be notified in writing or in
person that the animal is dangerous and may order the animal seized or make
orders as deemed proper. This owner shall be notified as to dates, times,
places and parties bitten, and shall be given 14 days to appeal this order by
requesting a hearing before the City Council for a review of this
determination.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If no appeal is filed, the Animal Control Officer shall obtain an
order or warrant authorizing the seizure and the destruction of the animal from
a court of competent jurisdiction, unless the animal is already in custody or
the owner consents to the seizure and destruction of the animal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If an owner requests a hearing for determination as to the
dangerous nature of the animal, the hearing shall be held before the City
Council, which shall set a date for hearing not more than three weeks after
demand for the hearing. The records of the Animal Control or City Clerkâ€™s
office shall be admissible for consideration by the Animal Control Officer
without further foundation. After considering all evidence pertaining to the
temperament of the animal, the City Council shall make an order as it deems
proper. The City Council may order that the Animal Control Officer take the
animal into custody for destruction, if the animal is not currently in custody.
If the animal is ordered into custody for destruction, the owner shall
immediately make the animal available to the Animal Control Officer.Â  If the
owner does not immediately make the animal available, the Animal Control
Officer shall obtain an order or warrant authorizing the seizure and the
destruction of the animal from a court of competent jurisdiction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No personÂ  shall harbor an animal after it has been found by to be
dangerous and ordered into custody for destruction.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Stopping an attack. If any police officer or Animal Control Officer is
witness to an attack by an animal upon a person or another animal, the officer
may take whatever means the officer deems appropriate to bring the attack to an
end and prevent further injury to the victim.
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Notification of new address. The owner of an animal which has been
identified as dangerous or potentially dangerous shall notify the Animal
Control Officer in writing if the animal is to be relocated from its current
address or given or sold to another person. The notification shall be given in
writing at least 14 days prior to the relocation or transfer of ownership. The
notification shall include the current owner's name and address, the relocation
address, and the name of the new owner, if any.
Â Â Â (J)Â Â Â Dangerous animal requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Requirements. If the City Council does not order the destruction of
an animal that has been declared dangerous, the City Council may, as an
alternative, order any or all of the following:

be muzzled (if physically possible depending on the type of animal) and
restrained by a substantial chain or leash (not to exceed six feet in length)
and under the physical restraint of a person 16 years of age or older. The
muzzle must be of a design as to prevent the animal from biting any person or
animal, but will not cause injury to the animal or interfere with its vision or
respiration;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â The animal shall have a microchip implant as provided by M.S. Â§
347.515, as it may be amended from time to time;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â All animals deemed dangerous by the Animal Control Officer shall
be registered with the county in which this city is located within 14 days
after the date the animal was so deemed and provide satisfactory proof thereof
to the Animal Control Officer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â If the animal is a cat or ferret, it must be up to date with
rabies vaccination.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Seizure. As authorized by M.S. Â§ 347.54, as it may be amended from
time to time, the Animal Control Officer shall immediately seize any dangerous
animal if the owner does not meet each of the above requirements within 14 days
after the date notice is sent to the owner that the animal is dangerous.
Seizure may be appealed to district court by serving a summons and petition
upon the city and filing it with the district court.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Reclaiming animals. A dangerous animal seized under division (J)(2)
of this section,Â  may be reclaimed by the owner of the animal upon payment of
impounding and boarding fees and presenting proof to animal control that each
of the requirements under division (J)(1) of this section, is fulfilled. An
animal not reclaimed under this section within 14 days may be disposed of as
provided under division (F) of this section, and the owner is liable to the
city for costs incurred in confining and impounding the animal.
Â Â Â (K)Â Â Â Subsequent offenses. If an owner of an animal has subsequently
violated the provisions under this section with the same animal, the animal
must be seized by animal control. The owner may request a hearing as defined in
division (G) of this section. If the owner is found to have violated the
provisions for which the animal was seized, the Animal Control Officer shall
order the animal destroyed in a proper and humane manner and the owner shall
pay the costs of confining the animal. If the person is found not to have
violated the provisions for which the animal was seized, the owner may reclaim
the animal under the provisions of division (J)(3) of this section. If the
animal is not yet reclaimed by the owner within 14 days after the date the
owner is notified that the animal may be reclaimed, the animal may be disposed
of as provided under division (F) of this section and the owner is liable to
the animal control for the costs incurred in confining, impounding and
disposing of the animal.

on the premises of any establishment licensed under this chapter, as set forth
in this section, reflects the prevailing community standards of the city.

of the provisions in this section, or of M.S. Ch. 340A, as it may be amended
from time to time, or any rules promulgated under that chapter, as they may be
amended from time to time. The number of violations shall be determined on the
basis of the history of violations for the preceding three-year period.
Revocation shall occur within 60 days following a violation for which
revocation is imposed.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â A violation of Â§
111.04 of this chapter is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by law and is
justification for revocation or suspension of any liquor, wine or 3.2% malt
liquor license or any other license issued under this chapter or the imposition

Â Â Â PUBLIC GROUND. Highways, roads, streets, alleys, public ways, utility
easements and public grounds in the city.
(Prior Code, Â§ 602.01)
Â§ 112.02Â  PERMIT PROCEDURE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Permit required. A company may not construct, install, repair, remove
or relocate facilities, or any part thereof, in, on, over, under or along
public ground without first obtaining a permit from the city.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Application. Application for a permit is made to the Director.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Issuance of permit. If the Director determines that the applicant has
satisfied the requirements of this chapter, the Director may issue a permit to
the company. An applicant may contest a permit denial or the conditions of
approval by written notice to the Clerk requesting a City Council review within
14 days of the Directorâ€™s action. The Council shall hear any contest of the
Directorâ€™s actions under this chapter within 45 days of the City Clerkâ€™s
receipt of the contest notice. Nothing in this chapter precludes the city from
requiring a franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by requiring a
franchise agreement with the applicant, as allowed by law, in addition to the
issuance of a permit set forth herein.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Permit fee. Before the permit is issued, the applicant requesting the
permit shall pay the fee specified by this code.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Security for completion of work. Prior to commencement of work, the
company must deposit with the city security in the form of certified check,
letter of credit or construction bond, in a sufficient amount as determined by
the Director for the completion of the work. The securities will be held until
the work is completed, plus a period of three months thereafter, to guarantee
that restoration work has been satisfactorily completed. Upon application of
the company, providing such information as the Director may require, if two or
more work projects are to be constructed during a calendar year, the Director
may accept, in lieu of separate security for each project, a single security
for multiple projects in such form and amount as determined, in the discretion
of the Director, to be sufficient to assure completion of all projects which
may be in progress at any one time during that calendar year and to guaranty
that restoration work will be satisfactorily completed. The security will then
be returned to the company with interest if required by law and then interest
at the applicable statutory rate.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Inspection of work. When the work is completed, the company must
request an inspection by the Director. The Director will determine if the work
has been satisfactorily completed and provide the company with written report
of the inspection and approval.
(Prior Code, Â§ 602.03)
Â§ 112.03Â  RESTORATION AND RELOCATION.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Restoration. Upon completion of the work, the company must restore the
general area of the work, including paving and its foundations, to the same
condition that existed prior to commencement of the work and must exercise
reasonable care to maintain the same condition for two years thereafter. The
work must be completed as promptly as weather permits. If the company does not
promptly perform and complete the work, remove all dirt, rubbish, equipment and
material, and restore the public ground to the same condition, the city may put
it in the same condition at the expense of the company. The company must, upon
demand, pay to the city the direct and indirect cost of the work done for or
performed by the city, including, but not limited to, the cityâ€™s administrative
costs. To recover its costs, the city will first draw on the security posted by
the company and then recover the balance of the costs incurred from the company
directly by written demand. This remedy is in addition to any other remedies
available to the city.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Company initiated relocation. The company must give the city written
notice prior to a company initiated relocation of facilities. A company
initiated relocation must be at the companyâ€™s expense and must be approved by
the city, the approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â City required relocation. The company must promptly, and at its own
expense, with due regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently relocate
its facilities whenever the city requires such relocation.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Relocation where public ground vacated. The vacation of public ground
does not deprive the company of the right to operate and maintain its
facilities in the city. If the vacation proceedings are initiated by the
company, the company must pay the relocation costs. If the vacation proceedings
are initiated by the city or other persons, the company must pay the relocation
costs unless otherwise agreed to by the city, company and other persons.
(Prior Code, Â§ 602.05)
Â§ 112.04Â  COMPANY DEFAULT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Notice. If the company is in default in the performance of the work
authorized by the permit, including, but not limited to, restoration
requirements, for more than 30 days after receiving written notice from the
city of the default, the city may terminate the rights of the company under the
permit. The notice of default must be in writing and specify the provisions of
the permit under which the default is claimed and state the grounds of the
claim. The notice must be served on the company by personally delivering it to
an officer thereof at its principal place of business in the state or by
certified mail to that address.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â City action on default. If the company is in default in the
performance of the work authorized by the permit, the city may, after the above
notice to the company and failure of the company to cure the default, take such
action as may be reasonably necessary to abate the condition caused by the
default. The company must reimburse the city for the cityâ€™s reasonable costs,
including costs of collection and attorney fees incurred as a result of the
company default. The security posted under Â§
112.02(E) of this chapter will be applied by the city first toward payment for
the reimbursement.
(Prior Code, Â§ 602.07)
Â§ 112.05Â  INDEMNIFICATION.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Scope. The company will indemnify, keep and hold the city, its elected
officials, officers, employees and agents free and harmless from any and all
claims and actions on account of injury or death of persons or damage to
property occasioned by the construction, installation, maintenance, repair,
removal, relocation or operation of the facilities affecting public ground,
unless the injury or damage is the result of the negligence of the city, its
elected officials, employees, officers or agents. The city will notify the
company of claims or actions and provide a reasonable opportunity for the
company to accept and undertake the defense.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Claim defense. If a claim or action is brought against the city under
circumstances where indemnification applies, the company, at its sole expense,
shall defend the city if written notice of the claim or action is given to the
company within a period wherein the company is not prejudiced in the defense of
the claim or action by lack of the notice. If the company undertakes the
defense, the company shall have complete control of the claim or action, but it
may not settle without the consent of the city, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. This division (B) is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any
defense or immunity otherwise available to the city. In defending any action on
behalf of the city, the company is entitled to assert every defense or immunity
that the city could assert in its own behalf.

sale, possession and use of tobacco, tobacco products and tobacco-related
devices for the purpose of enforcing and furthering existing laws, to protect
minors against the serious effects associated with the illegal use of tobacco,

Â Â Â If any of the descriptions or depictions of sexual conduct described in Â§
133.01 of this chapter are declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be

invalidate this chapter as to other patently offensive sexual conduct included
therein.

research or study.

Â§ 134.01Â  FINDINGS AND INTENT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence
and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an
extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to
use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders
commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are
prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual
offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly
exorbitant.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â It is the intent of this chapter to serve the cityâ€™s compelling
interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children
regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders
and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent
residence.
(Prior Code, Â§ 750.01)

Â Â Â For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
Â Â Â DESIGNATED OFFENDER. Any person who has been convicted of a designated
sexual offense, regardless of whether adjudication has been withheld, in which
the victim of the offense was less than 16 years of age, or has been
categorized as a level ME sex offender under M.S. Â§ 244.052, as it may be
amended from time to time, or successor statute.
Â Â Â DESIGNATED SEXUAL OFFENSE. A conviction, adjudication of delinquency,
commitment under M.S. Ch. 253B, as it may be amended from time to time, or
admission of guilt under oath without adjudication involving any of the
following offenses: M.S. Â§Â§ 609.342, 609.343, 609.344, 609.345, 609.352,
609.365, 617.23, 617.246, 617.247 and 617.293, as they may be amended from time
to time; successor statutes; or a similar offense from another state.
Â Â Â PERMANENT RESIDENCE. A place where the person abides, lodges or resides for
14 or more consecutive days.

a period of 14 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which
is not the personâ€™s permanent address, or a place where the person routinely
abides, lodges or resides for a period of four or more consecutive or non-
consecutive days in any month and which is not the personâ€™s permanent

participate in a holiday event involving children under 18 years of age, such
as distributing candy or other items to children on Halloween, wearing a Santa
Claus costume on or preceding Christmas or wearing an Easter bunny costume on
or preceding Easter. Holiday events in which the offender is the parent or
guardian of the children involved and no non-familial children are present are
exempt from this division (B).
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Measurement of distance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the
requirement shall be measured by following a straight line from the outer

pursuant to M.S. Â§Â§ 243.166 or 243.167, as they may be amended from time to
time;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The residence is also the primary residence of the personâ€™s
parents, grandparents, siblings, spouse or children; and/or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The residence is a property owned or leased by the stateâ€™s

Â Â Â Unless exempt under Â§
153.22 of this chapter, no sign shall be erected, altered, relocated,
maintained or displayed until a sign permit and/or other required authorization
is obtained from the city. The sign permit is in addition to any building or
other permit required to be obtained pursuant to the provisions of the cityâ€™s
Building Code, or other city, county or state law.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Types of approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Sign permit. A fee based city staff authorization process. This is
used to verify that the amount, location and other regulatory requirements for
signs and sign structures are met for each proposed sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Design review/Commission approval. This includes design review by
the Heritage Preservation Commission (HPC) for properties in designated
Historic District(s) and review as part of conditional or interim use permits
by the Planning Commission. In cases where Commission approval is required,
this must occur prior to the issuance of a sign permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Staff approval. This is city staff approval where no fee is
required. Depending on the requirement of the particular district, this is used
for cases where signs that have already been approved are relocated or a sign
face is altered.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Signs that require a conditional or interim use permit (CUP or IUP)
or approval as part of a plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â These signs require a separate application and approval of a
CUP/IUP unless the signage is approved under a CUP/IUP for the entire project
(a CUP or IUP issued under
Ch. 162 of this code of ordinances).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Signs requiring a CUP/IUP associated with a land use that
requires an IUP (under
Ch. 162 of this code of ordinances) require an IUP. Such signs associated with
a land use that requires a CUP require a CUP. For signs that require a CUP/IUP
where the associated use does not require a special permit, a CUP is required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â For signs that require a CUP/IUP or approval as part of a plat,
these may be approved during the platting process as specified in
Ch. 161 of this code of ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â A sign permit is also still required unless indicated in the
approved CUP/IUP. Conditions for signage under a CUP/IUP will be based on the
conditions contained in
Ch. 162 of this code of ordinances under the district the sign is located.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Permits required deadline. Any sign that was not in existence or in
place on the date of the adoption of this chapter, shall not hereafter be
displayed, nor shall any existing sign be enlarged, relocated, changed or
modified until a sign permit for the same has been obtained in accordance with
this section and all other applicable regulations. Any sign that was installed
after 2-10-1988 without a permit is hereby considered an illegal sign.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Permits required for sign maintenance or replacement. When a sign face
alone is being modified or other sign parts that do not change the height,
setbacks or other sign standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Staff approval is required to verify no unauthorized off-premises
signage is being displayed, but no permit or fee is required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If located in the Historic District and color, font or style and
design of the sign face is modified, HPC design review and approval is
required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â For all non-conforming signs where there is a change of the sign
face, staff approval is required for the purpose of verifying that the non-
conformity is not being expanded and to document and record the changes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Maintenance, repair or restoration of non-conforming signs must be
in accordance with Â§
153.20 of this chapter.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Sign permit application requirements. Every application for a permit
shall include the following:

32.49 of this code of ordinances.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Issuance of sign permits in the Historic District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Prior to the issuance of a sign permit for a new sign, the
replacement of an existing sign, or the relocation of an existing sign, in the
Downtown Historic District, the applicant shall receive approval from the
cityâ€™s Heritage Preservation Commission through the design review process. As
an exception, if a sign which was previously approved by the HPC is relocated
to another property/site within the Historic District within one year from HPC
approval, no additional HPC design review is required. A sign permit is still
required to verify that the sign meets the size, location, amount of signage
and all other standards of the district for its new location.

Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Computation of sign face area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The area of a sign face enclosed in a frame or cabinet shall be
determined on the basis of the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet
surrounding the sign face. Where the frame or cabinet is not in the shape of a
rectangle, square, triangle or circle, the sign face area shall be determined

Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The area of an attached sign where the sign consists of
letters, numerals or symbols painted on or affixed to a wall shall be the
entire area within a continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of the
message delineated by the letters, numerals or symbols.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Where the message consists of more than one word, the words
grouped together shall constitute one sign unless the space between words is
greater than the average widths of the letters or symbols used in the sign.

Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The area of an attached or suspended sign where the letters,
numerals or symbols are on a sign surface which is hung or affixed to a
structure shall be the total area of the hung or affixed surfaces. For signs
that contain multiple frames on a single structure and oriented in the same
direction, the sign area shall be determined on the basis of the sum of the
areas of each surface.

Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Freestanding signs (double-faced or back-to-back signs): when the
faces of a back-to-back sign are parallel or within 35 degrees of parallel, the
sign face area shall be determined on the basis of only one side of such sign.
If the sign faces are not within 35 degrees of parallel, the sign face area
shall be determined on the basis of the sum of the areas of each sign face.

Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Individual element and three-dimensional signs: when signs are
constructed of individual elements attached to a building or wall, or for any
three-dimensional sign), the area shall be determined by calculating the area
of an imaginary rectangle drawn around the sign elements (the smallest
rectangle which encloses all of the letters, symbols and characters as seen
from one side).

Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â For signs that are required to meet a certain percentage of wall
facade or other background area, the height of the surface area multiplied by
the width of the surface area, multiplied by the percentage requirement will be
used to determine size of signage allowed.

Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Sight visibility triangle.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No sign taller than 42 inches or with less clearance than eight
feet tall may be placed in the sight triangle of any street or driveway
intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The site triangle is measured from the corner of pavement where two
streets meet, back 25 feet to form the triangle.

Â 
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Sign heights.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component
of the sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The clearance of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the
base of the sign at normal grade to that portion of the sign hanging or mounted
lowest to the ground
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Normal grade shall be construed to be the level of existing
grade prior to sign installation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â When filling to match existing grade levels is done, the
finished grade shall be considered normal. When berming or mounding, solely for
the purpose of locating the sign, the pre-existing grade shall be considered
normal.

Â 
(Prior Code, Â§ 310.10)
Â§ 153.26Â  TEMPORARY SIGNS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â It is not the intent of this section to allow the display of temporary
signage as a means to circumvent the sign regulations for the district in which
the property is located, but rather to allow a full spectrum of options to meet
different signage needs.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Following are three types of temporary signs that are allowed and the
conditions for each. Additional conditions and approval process are contained
in each districts regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â â€œShort-term temporary signsâ€ (intended for one time sales events,
special events and the like).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Short-term temporary signs are allowed for up to 14 consecutive
days for up to four times each year per each property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Unless otherwise specified in the districts standards, only one
short-term temporary sign is allowed per property or parcel at any given time.
If more than one is allowed, each sign placed constitutes a separate sign for
the purpose of time allowed for display (i.e., two signs two times a year, or
four signs one time a year).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Time limits may be run concurrently, but may not be split up
(e.g., cannot split one 14-day period into two separate seven-day periods).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Maximum size is one square foot per each lineal foot of frontage
or the maximum size for the type of sign for the district it will be located,
whichever is smaller.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Short-term temporary signs are allowed in excess of and in
addition to the sign limitations within each district, regardless of the status
of conformity of all other permanent on-premises signs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â See district standards for additional requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â â€œInterim temporary signsâ€ (business start up or short-term
ventures).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â All interim temporary signs must meet the districts sign
standards (e.g., maximum amount, size, locations and setbacks of signs and the
like).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Allowed for up to 60 days in a calendar year per parcel or
address or for a newly established business on each parcel or address.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â â€œChangeable temporary signsâ€ (temporary exhibits, daily, weekly or
monthly specials, annual seasonal events and the like).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â All changeable signs must meet the districts sign standards
(e.g., allowed sign type, maximum amounts, maximum size, locations and setbacks
of signs and the like).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Location (placement) and size of sign must remain consistent.
Brackets or other mounting structure may be utilized, but must not be relocated
without a new permit being issued. Portable signs must be placed in the
approved location authorized on the sign permit (if indicated).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Only the message and design of the sign may be altered through
the use of new sign face, changeable letters or similar methods.
(Prior Code, Â§ 310.11)Â  Penalty, see Â§
153.99
Â§ 153.27Â  SUBSTITUTION OF NON-COMMERCIAL SPEECH AND CONTENT NEUTRALITY.
Â Â Â In any district, for every type of sign that is allowed for commercial
speech, any non-commercial message may be legally substituted when all other
requirements (e.g., size, location, design review, required permits issued) are
met.
(Prior Code, Â§ 310.12)
Â§ 153.28Â  SIGNS IN ROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Right-of-way jurisdictions (state, county or city) will determine type
and placement of signage allowed in their rights-of-way. Property and sign
owners are responsible to verify that signs are located outside of the right-
of-way or appropriate approvals have been secured.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Other than public regulatory, warning, directional and traffic guide
signs erected by a government entity, the city allows portable signs only in
city controlled rights-of-way (local city streets) which meet the following
requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Sign is placed by or with approval of the property owner of the
parcel adjacent to the right-of-way;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Necessary permits or approvals with standards as defined for the
particular district have been procured by the property owner;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Quantity, size and other sign requirements are based on
requirements for portable signs as indicated in each district; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â No sign may be placed in such a way as to obstruct vehicle,
pedestrian or bicycle routes, interchanges or crossing sightlines. Signs which
are deemed an obstruction will be removed or re-located by city staff.

non-commercial speech only and for no other purposes on a first come first
serve basis.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Location, type and design of signage allowed is dictated by the
standards of the district for each property along with those requirements
listed below (in division (B)(4) below). The maximum quantity of signage
allowed (total number of signs allowed) is hereby exempt for these permitted
signs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A staff issued written approval is required for the placement of
any sign on these city- owned properties. An application for approval including
information on the size, type, anchoring method and location of the proposed
sign is required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Signage requirements.

of the posting date or if the sign is posted for an event no longer than ten
days after the event.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â All signs shall be constructed or anchored to prevent movement
of the sign by the wind; except that, an anchoring shall not be permanent and
shall not damage the property on which the sign is placed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â No sign shall be attached to, or leaned against, any street
furniture, utility facility (including poles and boxes), street light,
building, fence, tree, statuary, playground/park amenity or any other present
sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â No sign shall be placed in such a manner as to reduce the
unobstructed path of travel on any sidewalk or path to less than 36 inches, and
if the existing unobstructed path of travel of a sidewalk is 36 inches or less,
no sign shall be placed on that sidewalk.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â No sign shall be placed within a curb cut or ramp installed to
provide improved access to a sidewalk to the disabled.

Â§ 153.46Â  HISTORIC OVERLAY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â General.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The regulations of this section apply to the cityâ€™s Historic
District as described and adopted in
Ch. 159 of this code of ordinances (or as amended). The Historic District was
established to recognize and preserve unique architectural character and
historic value within designated districts in the city. This section,
therefore, places limitations on the type, design, number and placement of
signs in a manner which does not conflict with the historic value and
appearances of designated Historic District(s) and the structures within those
districts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Under
Ch. 159 of this code of ordinances, the cityâ€™s Heritage Preservation Commission
(HPC) is given authority to review proposed activity within the Historic
District and determine if the work to be performed will adversely affect the
heritage preservation landmark or district. As with other modifications
occurring in the Historic District, the HPC will review and make determination
on proposed signage based on adopted city heritage preservation guidelines and
the Secretary of Interior Standards for Historic Preservation.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Compliance. Prior to the issuance of a sign permit for a new sign or
the replacement of an existing sign in the Historic District, the applicant
shall complete a design review application. The HPC shall review the
application and approve or deny the application. Fee for the sign permit is as
established in Â§
32.49 of this code of ordinances. The regulations and limitations for signage
of those properties defined within this section shall be in addition to the
sign regulations of any underlying zoning district.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Sign construction, design and materials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Materials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Signs shall be made of materials historically appropriate to the
building, site or districts history. These include painted or enameled metal,
wood or glass, leaded, stained or etched glass, painted wall signs and fabric
awning or banner signs. The Heritage Preservation Commission may approve signs
constructed of other materials when there is a finding by the Commission that
the materials duplicate the appearance of materials historically used in sign
manufacturing. Plastic (including extruded or vacuum formed) and unfinished
wood are deemed not historically appropriate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Historically appropriate techniques for creating lettering and
designs generally include paint or gilding on a flat surface, individual
letters or logos cut-out and letters or designs mounted on a smooth surface
backing or directly on a building wall and also metal castings or cutouts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Design. Additional information on sign design may be found in the
adopted heritage preservation guidelines (â€œdesign guidelines) for the Downtown
Heritage Preservation District. HPC approval of signage will be based the
regulations contained in this chapter and in the design guidelines.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Lettering. All letter styles shall relate to the character of
the propertyâ€™s architectural elements or use. A sign shall contain no more than
two lettering styles. Lettering shall occupy no more than 60% of the signâ€™s
total area and capital letters shall be no more than 75% of the height of the
sign background.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Clarity. The sign message must be legible which may be
accomplished through the use of words, pictures, names, symbols and logos.
Letters and images must be clearly defined with hard edge lines. Spraying or
airbrushing of words or images is not historically appropriate
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Color. Sign colors shall coordinate with the building facade and
be compatible with the propertyâ€™s use. No more than two colors shall be used
for lettering and a small amount of a third color for highlighting for
lettering is acceptable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Edge frame. Wall signs require a visual boarder frame (three-
dimensional or painted) around the edge of the sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Plastic channels, sliding letters. Changeable copy signs and
panels comprised of plastic channels and sliding letters are not allowed in the
Historic District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Awning signs. Awning signs shall be placed on the awning valance
only and shall not exceed 75% of the height of the valance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Construction and maintenance. All signs, together with all of their
supports, braces, guys and anchors, shall be kept in good repair and in proper
state of preservation and working order. The display surfaces of all signs
shall be kept painted or maintained at all times. Faded, chipped, frayed, torn,
tattered or otherwise damaged signs shall be replaced.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Illumination. In addition to the sign illumination standards
detailed in Â§
153.25 of this chapter, the following shall apply in the Historic District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No sign shall be illuminated by or contain flashing
intermittent, rotating or moving lights or lights creating an illusion of
movement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The use of internally back-lit plastic cabinet type and can
letter signs are not permitted; however, internal lit 3-D signs, back lit/halo,
edgelit and limited neon lit signs will be allowed when there is a finding by
the HPC that the sign emulates the design of signs used historically.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Signs types. Sign types and specific standards for each type are
detailed in underlying zoning districts: TDC - Traditional Downtown Commercial
and Residential Districts.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Location. The HPC shall consider sign location in its design review
and base its approval on location:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Where signs were placed historically;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Where there will be minimal damage to historic materials and
features (avoiding windows, cornices or architectural trim and other features);
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Where the location helps to draw attention to, balances with or
does not compete with the historic architectural characteristics of the
building;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â On masonry buildings, installation anchors for signs shall be
installed into the joint rather than the masonry unit (in the mortar rather
than the brick or stone):

public right-of-way. Verification should be made by private property owners as
to the allowance of signs on their streets or other rights-of-way.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Â§ 154.01Â  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The natural and scenic landscape of the city is among its most
valuable assets and greatly benefits the residents and a significant number of
visitors to the area each year. The degradation of this asset would potentially
risk undermining the very characteristics responsible for economic vitality and
future potential. The city understands and accepts the increasing demand and
need for wireless communication and environmentally responsible energy
technologies as well as other such potential activities that would require the
use of tower facilities. The purpose of this chapter is to protect and preserve
the cityâ€™s natural, cultural and scenic assets in accordance with goals and
policies of the cityâ€™s Comprehensive Plan.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â This chapter is designed and intended to balance the interests of the
residents of the city, telecommunication, other service providers and customers
in the siting of towers (including wireless communication services facilities
and small wind energy conversion systems) within the city. These standards are
also intended:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â To avoid or minimize any adverse impact of the facilities on:
visual; environmental; historically significant areas; health and safety; and
property values;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â To require the use of alternative structures for the purposes of
co-location of carriers and minimize the total number of towers located within
the city;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â To allow the construction of new towers only where all other
opportunities have been exhausted;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â To require the users of communication towers and antenna structures
to configure them in a way that minimizes the need for additional towers in the
city;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â To provide for the removal of towers and associated development
which are no longer being used for their original purposes; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â These regulations are not intended to place any restrictions on

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Â§ 158.001Â  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The city does ordain based on the following findings of fact and
statement of purpose:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The excavation of different mineral resources and aggregates have
the potential for different levels of impact on the community based on:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Content of the mineral resource being excavated;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The excavation process of the resource and its potential impact
on water and air quality and on safety and visual impacts;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The size of particulates which become airborne;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The cleaning, sorting and processing of the resource;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â The amount of material excavated over a given period of time
along with the method of transporting the material away from the mine site; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â The treatment of the land after the resource is removed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Atmospheric particulate matter under the size of ten microns are
respirable; they are small enough to penetrate the nose and upper respiratory
system and enter deep into the lungs. (As supported by The Integrated Science
Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA Integrated Science Assessment for
Particulate Matter (final report)), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
Washington, DC EPA/600R-08/139F, 2009.)
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The respiration of some mineral resources have the potential to
cause health impacts to those breathing them in over time.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The noise and vibrations created by some mining activities impact
neighbors (in particular residential) in a negative manner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The location and depth of a mine has the potential to impact
underground water sources depended upon by the public for drinking water.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The methods and treatment of a mine site after the excavation
process ends has a great impact on the ultimate use of the property and the
impact of that site on neighboring properties and the community as a whole.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The mining of industrial aggregates is generally more intensive
than construction aggregate mining in terms of its negative impact on the land
and the operations impact on plant, animal and human lives within the
community.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â M.S. Â§ 462.357, as it may be amended from time to time, allows: â€œA
municipality may, by ordinance, permit an expansion or impose upon non-
conformities reasonable regulations to prevent and abate nuisances and to
protect the public health, welfare or safety.â€
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Guiding principles of the Comprehensive Plan include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A balanced approach to managing change and growth through
community development, which is the combined efforts to sustain the community
for the benefit of those living in it, considering and weighing all topic areas
identified within this plan;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Creation of an environment that allows for and encourages
economic opportunities for individuals and businesses choosing to locate in the
city;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Creation and maintenance of a healthy environment; providing a
living, working and recreational environment which allows individuals residing
or visiting the city to make choices for a healthy lifestyle;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Creation and maintenance of a human habitat that includes the
natural and physical environment and the relationship of people with that
environment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Preservation of natural and cultural elements which gives the
Wabasha community an exceptional sense of place and attracts people to live and
visit; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Continued commitment to tourism, sharing the natural, cultural
and built environment of the community with visitors and striving to provide
services to meet the needs of that growing industry.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Now, therefore, the city does ordain for the purpose of protecting the
health, safety and general welfare of the community the following standards and
regulations pertaining to mining, mineral resource extraction operations and
subsurface mineral exploration within the city. The objective of this provision
is to minimize soil erosion and land scarring, to monitor the consumption of
natural resources and minimize the impact of these activities on the adjacent
lands, resources and persons residing in the area, preventing mining and
extraction operations from creating a nuisance and health hazards within the
community.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which are described in 40 C.F.R. part 58,
app. E.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â For horizontal and vertical placement of monitors based on a study
(submitted with the air quality plan) to determine the criteria for placement
of air monitoring probes or sample inlets. In most cases, air monitoring probes
and inlets must be located between seven and 23 feet above ground level. As a
result, monitoring sites located at ground level typically require the
installation of an elevated platform or shelter. Air monitoring sites may also
be located on the roof of a building which is no higher than two stories;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â For placement of monitors with spacing from emission sources for
source-oriented or hot- spot monitoring. Air monitors should be located as
close to the area of expected maximum air pollution concentration as safely
possible;
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Spacing from obstructions: buildings and other obstacles can impact
air monitoring results by scavenging pollutants and restricting airflow to the
monitor, resulting in inaccurate air concentration measurements. In general, if
an obstruction is located near an air monitoring site, the distance of the air
monitor from the obstruction must be two-times the height of the obstruction;
Â Â Â (J)Â Â Â The monitoring of ambient air to compare air monitoring results with
air quality standards, The air monitoring site must be measuring ambient air
outside of the facilityâ€™s property line if a fence or other physical
obstruction prevents public access. If no such obstruction exists, air quality
monitors located within a facilityâ€™s property boundary may be considered
ambient. Air monitors must conform to U.S. EPAâ€™s design standards as outlined
in 40 C.F.R. parts 50, 53 and 58. The use of reference or equivalent methods to
help assure the reliability of air quality measurements is required; and
Â Â Â (K)Â Â Â Recording of air concentrations of: total suspended particles (TSP),
inhalable particles (PM10), fine particles (PM2.5) and crystalline silica as
PM10 or PM4 per the standards agreed to in the accepted monitoring plan:

Â§ 158.022Â  WATER RESOURCES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â General. Pollution prevention measure shall be employed at the mine
operation including the following (depending on specific operations, which may
be made condition of permit approval):
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Confinement of equipment/vehicle maintenance activities indoors to
the greatest extent feasible;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Confinement of outdoor fueling activities to designated areas to
the greatest extent possible that are covered, away from high traffic areas,
outside of drainage pathways and on impervious surfaces;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Regularly cleaning of areas used for equipment/vehicle maintenance
and fueling using dry clean-up methods rather than wet (e.g., sweeping,
squeegee and dust pan);
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Use of drip pans under all vehicles and equipment awaiting
maintenance. Empty and clean drip pans and containers rather than leaving them
full;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Proper disposal of liquid waste (including wash water), which shall
not be poured into floor drains, sinks, outdoor storm drain inlets or other
storm drain or sewer connections; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Avoidance of topping off fuel tanks.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Surface water.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The extraction pit/mine operation shall not be allowed to interfere
with surface water drainage beyond the boundaries of the operations property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The work done shall not adversely affect the quality of surface or
subsurface water resources in a negative manner. Surface water originating
outside and passing through the mining site shall, at its point of departure
from the site, be of equal or better quality than the water at the point where
it enters the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The mining operation shall utilize best management practices
specific to pollution prevention so that storm water runoff does not come into
contact with any activities or materials of concern such as petroleum products,
fueling areas and the like.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Engineered structures may be required for new or expanding mines or
suggested for any mine per the Minnesota Storm Water Manual and the Industrial
Storm Water BMP Guidebook.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Ground water protection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Mining activity shall not be allowed if it reduces the use in terms
of quality or quantity of any neighboring domestic well.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Prior to the establishment of new mines or the modification of an
existing mine (per Â§
158.003 of this chapter), the mine operator shall offer property owners with a
domestic well within one-half mile of the mining site an inspection of their
well and associated equipment and structures; evaluation of hydrologic
conditions and sampling of the well water for quality analysis to determine
baseline data. The neighboring property owner shall be given 30 days to respond
to the offer and to allow on-site work after receiving the offer. The mine
operator shall further offer these neighboring private well owners annual
sampling and water quality analysis. This work shall be performed by an
independent, credentialed third party at the expense of the operator. Samples
shall be analyzed by a certified laboratory. Analysis shall include all
chemicals and fuels used at the mine site that may impact ground water. In the
event that monitoring shows that mining or reclamation activities have caused
state or federal ground water quality standards to be exceeded, this
information shall be provided to the MPCA and the operator shall seek to
mitigate these effects by altering site operations and shall supply the well
owner with bottled water for drinking until testing indicates levels are to
pre-mining amounts. The reduction of quality of neighboring domestic wells
shall be one reason for revocation of the mining permit. The city may require
the permit holder to take corrective action in the event it is shown that the
contamination was caused by the operation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The import, storage or disposal of any solid waste, recyclable
materials or refuse generated outside the mine site is not allowed.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Ground water use. Permits for well construction from the county and
for water appropriation from the stateâ€™s DNR shall be required and copies of
these shall be provided to the city. The use of ground water for any mining
activity shall not be allowed if it:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Reduces water availability in existing domestic wells;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Reduces water availability in municipal production wells; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Degrades calcareous fens, wetlands, ponds, lakes, streams, springs,
seeps and watercourses and/or other fish and wildlife habitat.

more in depth existing for any period of at least one month, and occupy an area
of 700 square feet or more, all access to the collections of water shall be
barred by a fence of at least four feet in height.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â In locations where slopes occur that are steeper than one foot
vertical to three feet horizontal existing for a period of one month or more,
access to the slopes shall be barred by a fence or some similar effective
barrier such as a snow fence at least four feet in height. Earthen berms also
may be constructed to prevent access to the steeper slopes.

conditions) and the anticipated travel of damaging vibrations;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The level of significance of a resource as determined by its
official listing on any federal, state or local register and as by the City
Council; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Level of protection afforded to the resource by its official
listing on any federal, state or local register.
Â 
                               Maximum PPV (in/sec)
Structure and Condition        Transient Sources Continuous/Frequent
                                                 Intermittent Sources
Extremely fragile historic     0.12              0.08
structures, ruins or monuments
Fragile buildings              0.2               0.1
Â 
Â Â Â (M)Â Â Â The mine operator shall provide a notification to all property owners
within a one-half mile of the mine site at least 15 days prior to blasting
activity occurring. A copy of the notification shall also be sent to the city
along with a list of those being sent the notification. For blasting

Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All areas directly affected by mining shall be addressed in the
approved reclamation plan to provide that a stable and safe condition
consistent with the post-mining land use is achieved. The reclamation plan may
designate high walls or other unmined and undisturbed natural solid bedrock as
stable and safe and not in need of reclamation or designate other areas
affected by mining including slopes comprised of unconsolidated materials that
exceed a three to one (3:1) slope, whether or not graded, as stable and safe.
For slopes designated as stable under this section, the city may require that a
site-specific engineering analysis be performed by a registered professional
engineer to demonstrate that an acceptable slope stability factor is attainable
at a steeper slope.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Final reclaimed slopes covered by topsoil or topsoil substitute
material may not be steeper than a four to one (4:1) horizontal to vertical
incline, unless recommended by on site-specific engineering analysis performed
by a registered professional engineer. All areas in the extraction pit site
where topsoil or topsoil substitute material is to be reapplied shall be graded
or otherwise prepared prior to topsoil or topsoil substitute material
redistribution to provide the optimum adherence between the topsoil or topsoil
substitute material and the underlying material.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â If the approved post-mining land use includes a body of water, the
approved final grade at the edge of a body of water shall be a slope no steeper
than six to one (6:1).

cover, native vegetation cover and rock cover, similar in type, diversity and
percentage mix and location to pre-mining situation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Use of fast-growing vegetation to stabilize slopes is appropriate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Use of invasive species shall not be allowed in revegetation and
the plan shall address the how invasive species will be managed during the
operation of the mine.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Revegetation success may be determined by:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Comparison to an appropriate reference area;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Comparison to baseline data acquired at the mining site prior to
its being affected by mining; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Comparison to an approved alternate technical standard.
(Prior Code, Â§ 345.07)
Â§ 158.061Â  WATER.
Â Â Â The reclamation plan shall identify final surface and ground water
conditions and no reclamation shall be conducted in a manner which will cause a
permanent lowering of the water table or result in adverse effects on surface
waters or reduce the quality of ground water reasonably available for future
users of ground water.
(Prior Code, Â§ 345.07)
Â§ 158.062Â  ASSESSING COMPLETION OF SUCCESSFUL RECLAMATION.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The criteria for assessing when reclamation is complete shall be
specified in the reclamation plan approved pursuant to this chapter. Criteria
to evaluate reclamation success shall be quantifiable.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Compliance with the revegetation success standards in the approved
reclamation plan shall be determined by:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â On-site inspections by the city or its agent and/or the MN DNR; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Reports presenting results obtained during reclamation evaluations
including summarized data on revegetation, photo documentation or other
evidence that the reclamation plan criteria have been met.
(Prior Code, Â§ 345.07)
Â§ 158.063Â  RETURN TO PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.
Â Â Â In those cases where the post mining land use specified in the reclamation
plan requires a return of the mining site to a pre-existing condition, the
operator shall obtain baseline data on the existing plant community for use in
the evaluation of reclamation success pursuant to this section.
(Prior Code, Â§ 345.07)
Â§ 158.064Â  MAINTENANCE.
Â Â Â During the period of the site reclamation, the operator shall perform any
maintenance necessary to prevent erosion, sedimentation or environmental
pollution, comply with the standards of this subchapter, or to meet the goals

Â§ 159.04Â  REVIEW OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION ACTIVITY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Type of activity. The Commission shall review and approve or
disapprove of construction and demolition activities, including all street and
utility activities, within any heritage preservation landmark or district. In
addition, the Commission shall review and approve or disapprove any of the
following activities in a heritage preservation landmark or district in the
city:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Remodel, repair or alteration (including rehabilitation or
restoration) to a property which in any manner will change the exterior
appearance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â New construction, including parking facilities;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Relocating a building;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Change the nature or appearance of a designated heritage
preservation landmark or district, including landscape features; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Demolition.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Application process. Every application for any type of activity, as
described in division (A) above, in relation to a property designated as a
heritage preservation landmark or district in the city shall be accompanied by
detailed plans for the proposed work to be done. A copy of the design review
application and plans submitted therewith shall be immediately referred to the
Commission by the Historic Officer appointed by the City Council. Building
permits shall not be issued in regard to an application until written approval
is received from the Commission, subject, however, to divisions (C), (E) and
(F) below.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Commission review.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Commission, upon receipt of the application for design review,
shall determine if the work to be performed would adversely affect the heritage
preservation landmark or district based on the adopted heritage preservation
guidelines per Â§
159.05(F) of this chapter. Upon determination of project approval or denial,
the Commission shall notify the applicant in writing. The Commission may, by
rule, delegate to a subcommittee of the Commission its power to review and
approve permit applications. If the subcommittee determines that the work to be
performed pursuant to the permit application complies with the adopted heritage
preservation guidelines, the application shall be approved and the Historic
Officer shall be notified in writing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the application is not approved, the full Commission shall
conduct a public hearing for the purpose of determining whether the work to be
performed adversely impacts the heritage preservation landmark or district.
Notice of the public hearing shall have been published in the official
newspaper of the city and sent to the permit applicant at least ten days prior
to the date of the hearing. The Commission shall review the application and
such plans as were submitted therewith and, after receiving comments from
concerned citizens, shall render its decision thereon as a written order to the
Historic Officer and the Building Inspector. The Historic Officer shall not
issue any required permits until after the ten-day appeal period, as provided
for in division (H) below. In the case of a denial, the Commission shall
furnish the applicant with a copy of the Commissionâ€™s written order and
decision, together with a copy of any recommendations for changes necessary to
be made before the Commission will reconsider the applicantâ€™s permit
application.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Findings. All decisions of the Commission with respect to this section
shall be based on explicit findings which are in accordance with the adopted
heritage preservation guidelines for each individual heritage preservation
landmark or district and the Secretary of the Interiorâ€™s standards for historic
preservation projects.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Appeal to City Council. The Commission, in any written order denying
an application, shall advise the applicant of his or her right to appeal to the
City Council, and shall include this paragraph in all such orders. The
applicant or any party aggrieved by the decision of the Commission shall,
within ten days of the date of the Commissionâ€™s written order and decision,
have a right to appeal the order and decision to the City Council. The appeal
shall be addressed to the City Council and submitted to the Historic Officer.
Two copies of a notice of appeal and statement of reasons setting forth the
grounds for the appeal shall be submitted by the appealing party. The Historic
Officer shall transmit one copy of the notice of appeal and statement to the
City Council and one copy to the Heritage Preservation Commission. The City
Council may modify or over rule the Commissionâ€™s decision, but only if the
project is found to be consistent with the U.S. Secretary of Interiorâ€™s
standards for historic preservation projects.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Limitations. If, within 60 days of receipt of the application by the
Commission, it has neither approved, nor denied, the building permit
application, the plans and permit application shall be deemed to have been
approved by the Commission; and, if all other requirements of the city have
been met, the Historic Officer shall authorize a permit for the proposed work.
No permit shall be issued and no work shall be commenced in the event the
Commission disapproves the application in accordance with this chapter.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Emergency repair. In emergency situations where immediate repair is
needed to protect the safety of the structure and its inhabitants, the Historic
Officer may without Commission action, approve the repair of only those items
needed to ensure safety. The repairs shall be limited to those necessary to
correct the safety emergency. In the case of a permit issued pursuant to this
section, the Historic Officer shall require that the repairs be made in
conformance with the U.S. Secretary of Interiorâ€™s standards for historic
preservation projects and adopted heritage preservation guidelines for the
landmark or district to the extent possible; and a copy of the permit issued
shall be given to the Building Inspector. In addition, the Historic Officer
shall immediately notify the Heritage Preservation Commission of the action and
specify the facts or conditions constituting the emergency situation.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Building Code enforcement. One purpose of this section is to encourage
the sensitive rehabilitation, restoration, stabilization and/or preservation of
historic buildings throughout the city. These rehabilitation and preservation
efforts should provide for the upgrading and maintenance of the safety features
of the building or structure to provide a practical level of safety to the
public and surrounding properties. While ensuring this increased level of
public safety, the enforcement authorities are encouraged to be open to
acceptable alternative solutions and alternative compliance concepts, where
practical, that will permit the continued use of existing buildings and
structures without creating overly restrictive financial burdens on owners or
occupants. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior elements of any building or structure
required by city ordinance.
(Prior Code, Â§ 315.09)Â  (Ord. passed 4-19-2005)
Â§ 159.05Â  ADDITIONAL POWERS.
Â Â Â The Commission shall have the following powers and duties, in addition to
those otherwise specified in this chapter.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The Commission shall conduct a continuing survey of all areas, places,
buildings, structures or similar objects in the city, which the Commission, on
the basis of information available or presented to it, has reason to believe
are or will be eligible for designation as heritage preservation landmarks or
districts.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The Commission shall work for the continuing education of the citizens
of the city with respect to the historic and architectural heritage of the
city. It shall keep current and public an official list of designated heritage
preservation landmarks and districts and shall maintain a map of all properties
and areas designated by the City Council as heritage preservation districts or
landmarks, which shall be kept at City Hall and be available to the public.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The Commission, upon obtaining Council approval, may retain the
services, on a permanent or part-time basis of technical experts and other
persons as may be required to perform the Commissionâ€™s duties.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â The Commission may recommend to the City Council, after review and
comment by the cityâ€™s Zoning and Planning Commission, that certain properties
eligible for designation as heritage preservation landmarks or districts be
acquired by gift, by negotiation or other legal means.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â The Commission shall have authority to solicit gifts and contributions
to be made to the city and to assist in the preparation of applications for
grant funds to be made to the city for the purpose of heritage preservation.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Upon final designation of a heritage preservation landmark or district
by the Mayor and City Council, the Commission shall adopt heritage preservation
guidelines specific to the landmark or district. The guidelines shall detail
allowable architectural and/or site modifications, essential features to be
retained and any other criteria by which future proposals for modifications
shall be judged. These guidelines are intended to provide assurance to owners
of properties within heritage preservation landmarks or districts that the
design review process, per Â§
159.04 of this chapter, will be based on clear and objective standards rather
than the taste of individual Commission members and shall be in conformance
with the Secretary of Interiorâ€™s standards for historic preservation projects.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â The Commission may nominate a heritage preservation landmark or
district to the National Register of Historic Places, but only with the consent
of the Mayor and the City Council.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â The Commission shall make an annual report to the stateâ€™s Historic
Preservation Officer by October 31 of each year.

Inspector and the stateâ€™s Historic Preservation Officer. The Clerk shall also
provide the Historic Officer and the Building Inspector an up-to-date copy of
the U.S. Secretary of Interiorâ€™s standards for historic preservation projects.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The Heritage Preservation Commission is designated as the repository

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Â§ 160.01Â  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
Â Â Â The legislature of the state has, in M.S. Ch. 103F, 412 and 191 and Â§Â§
462.351 through 462.365 and 471.62, as they may be amended from time to time,
delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations
designated to minimize flood losses.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(1.1))
Â§ 160.02Â  FINDINGS OF FACT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in potential loss of life, loss of property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures or flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â This chapter is based upon a reasonable method of analyzing
established by the stateâ€™s Department of Natural Resources.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(1.2))
Â§ 160.03Â  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
Â Â Â It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Â§
160.02(A) of this chapter by provisions contained herein.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(1.3))
Â§ 160.04Â  LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
Â Â Â This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city
shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments thereto as being
located within the boundaries of the Floodway, Flood Fringe or General
Floodplain Districts.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(2.1))
Â§ 160.05Â  OFFICIAL ZONING MAP; ESTABLISHMENT.
Â Â Â The official zoning map, together with all materials attached thereto, is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The
attached material shall include the Flood Insurance Study for the Wabasha
County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and dated 6-29-2000, and the Flood Insurance Rate Map panels
therein 6-20-2000, that are numbered 27157C0095 D, 27157C0210 D 27157C225 D and
27157C0230 D. The official zoning map shall be on file in the office of the
City Clerk and the Zoning Administrator.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(2.2))
Â§ 160.06Â  REGULATORY FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION.
Â Â Â The regulatory flood protection elevation shall be an elevation no lower
than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood, plus any increases in
flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from
designation of a floodway.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(2.3))
Â§ 160.07Â  INTERPRETATION.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation
or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The boundaries of the zoning districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the official zoning map. Where interpretation is needed as to the
exact location of the boundaries of the district as shown on the official
zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions and there is a formal appeal of the
decision of the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment shall make the
necessary interpretation. All decisions will be based on elevations on the
regional (100-year) flood profile and other available technical data. Persons
contesting the location of the district boundaries shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present their case to the Board and to submit technical
evidence.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(2.4))
Â§ 160.08Â  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
Â Â Â It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All
other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(2.5))
Â§ 160.09Â  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
Â Â Â This chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or
land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(2.6))
Â§ 160.10Â  SEVERABILITY.
Â Â Â If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(2.7))

Â Â Â VARIANCE. A modification of a specific permitted development standard
required in an official development standard not stated as acceptable in the
official control, but only as applied to a particular property for the purpose
of alleviating a hardship, practical difficulty or unique circumstance as
defined and elaborated upon in a communityâ€™s respective planning and zoning
enabling legislation.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(2.8))
Â§ 160.12Â  NON-CONFORMING USES.
Â Â Â A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before
the passage or amendment of this chapter, but which is not in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject to the following
conditions.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â No such use shall be expanded, changed, enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its non- conformity.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Any alteration or addition to a non-conforming structure or non-
conforming use which would result in increasing the flood damage potential of
that structure or increasing the flood damage potential of that structure or
use shall be protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in
accordance with any of the elevation on fill or flood-proofing techniques
(i.e., FP-1 through FP-4 flood-proofing classifications) allowable in the
stateâ€™s Building Code, except as further restricted below.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The cost of any structural alterations or additions to any non-
conforming structure over the life of the structure shall not exceed 50% of the
market value of the satisfied. The cost of all structural alterations and
additions constructed since the adoption of the communityâ€™s initial floodplain
controls must be calculated into todayâ€™s current cost which will include all
costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on all
manpower or labor. If the current cost of all previous and proposed alterations
and additions exceeds 50% of the current market value of the structure, then
the structure must meet the standards of Â§Â§
160.26 and
160.27 of this chapter for new structures depending upon whether the structure
is in the floodway or flood fringe, respectively.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â If any non-conforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months,
any future use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter. The
assessor shall notify the Zoning Administrator in writing of instances of non-
conforming uses which have been discontinued for a period of 12 months.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If any non-conforming use or structure is destroyed by any
means, including floods, to an extent of 50% or more if its market value at the
time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed, except in conformity with
the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The applicable provisions for establishing new uses or new
structures in Â§Â§
160.26,
160.27 and
160.28 of this chapter will apply depending upon whether the use or structure
is in the Floodway, Flood Fringe or General Floodplain District, respectively.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(11.0))
Â§ 160.13Â  AMENDMENTS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The floodplain designation on the official zoning map shall not be
removed from floodplain areas unless it can be shown that the designation is in
error or that the area has been filled to or above the elevation of the
regional flood and is contiguous to lands outside the floodplain. Special
exceptions to this rule may be permitted by the Commissioner exceptions to this
rule may be permitted by the Commissioner of Natural Resources if he or she
determines that, through other measures, lands are adequately protected for the
intended use.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â All amendments to this chapter, including amendments to the official
zoning map, must be submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Natural
Resources prior to adoption. Changes in the official zoning map must meet the
Federal Emergency Management Agencyâ€™s (FEMA) technical conditions and criteria
and must receive prior FEMA approval before adoption. The Commissioner of
Natural Resources must be given ten daysâ€™ written notice of all hearings to
consider an amendment to this chapter and the notice shall include a draft of
the ordinance amendment or technical study under consideration.

(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(4.0))
Â§ 160.27Â  FLOOD FRINGE DISTRICT (FF).
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be those uses of land or
structures listed as permitted uses in the underlying zoning use district(s).
If no pre-existing, underlying zoning use districts exist, then any residential
or non-residential structure or use of a structure or land shall be a permitted
use in the flood fringe; provided, the use does not constitute a public
nuisance. All permitted uses shall comply with the standards for flood fringe
permitted uses listed in division (B) below and the standards for all flood
fringe permitted and conditional uses listed in division (E) below.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Standards for flood fringe permitted uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on
fill so that the lowest floor, including basement floor, is at or above the
regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for
structures shall be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood
protection elevation and the fill shall extend at such elevation at least 15
feet beyond the outside limits of the structure erected thereon.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â As an alternative to elevation on fill, accessory structures that
constitute a minimal investment and that do not exceed 500 square feet for the
outside dimension at ground level may be internally flood-proofed in accordance
with Â§
160.26(D)(5)(c) of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The cumulative placement of fill where at any one time in excess of
1,000 cubic yards of fill is located on the parcel shall be allowable only as a
conditional use, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a
structure in accordance with division (A) above.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The storage of any materials or equipment shall be elevated on fill
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The provisions of division (E) below shall apply.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Conditional uses. Any structure that is not elevated on fill or flood-
proofed in accordance herewith.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Standards for flood fringe conditional uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be
utilized to elevate a structureâ€™s lowest floor above the regulatory flood
protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts,
pilings, parallel walls and the like or above-grade, enclosed areas such as
crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Shall be considered above-grade on at least one side of the
structure;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood
resistant materials; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the
following additional standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Design and certification. The structureâ€™s design and as-built
condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
as being in compliance with the general design standards of the stateâ€™s
Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at
or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within
these components during times of flooding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-
grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be
designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal
flooding is to be used as a flood-proofing technique. When openings are placed
in a structures walls to provide for entry of flood waters to equalize
pressures, the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices; provided that, they permit the automatic entry and exit
of flood waters; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant
materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the stateâ€™s
Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles
or storage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Basements, as defined by Â§
160.11 of this chapter, shall be subject to the following.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Residential basement construction shall not be allowed below the
regulatory flood protection elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory
flood protection elevation; provided, the basement is structurally dry flood-
proofed in accordance with division (D)(3) below.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All areas of non-residential structures including basements to be
placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall be flood-proofed
in accordance with the structurally dry flood- proofing classifications in the
stateâ€™s Building Code. Structurally dry flood-proofing must meet the FP-1 or
FP-2 flood-proofing classification in the stateâ€™s Building Code and this shall
require making the structure water-tight with the walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy. Structures flood-proofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification shall not
be permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â When, at any one time, more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other
similar material is located on a parcel for such activities as on-site storage,
landscaping, sand and gravel operations, landfills, roads, dredge spoil
disposal or construction of flood control works, an erosion/sedimentation
control plan must be submitted unless the community is enforcing state-approved
shoreland management ordinance, the plan must clearly specify methods to be
used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the 100-
year or regional flood event. The plan must be prepared and certified by a
registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to
the governing body. The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal
of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of
flooding, flammable, explosive or potentially injurious to human, animal or
plant life is prohibited.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Storage of other materials or equipment may be allowed if
readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood warning
and in accordance with a plan approved by the governing body.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The provisions of division (E) below shall also apply.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Standards for all flood fringe uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above
an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection
elevation. If a variance to this requirement is granted, the Board of
Adjustment must specify limitations on the period of use or occupancy of the
structure for times of flooding and only after determining that adequate flood
warning time and local flood emergency response procedures exist.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Commercial uses (accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad
tracks and parking lots) may be at elevations lower than the regulatory flood
protection elevation. However, a permit for the facilities to be used by the
employees or the general public shall not be granted in the absence of a flood
warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area would be
inundated to a depth greater than four feet per second upon occurrence of the
regional flood.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Measures shall be taken to minimize interference with normal plant
operations especially along streams having protracted flood durations. Certain
accessory land used such as yards and parking lots may be at lower elevations
subject to requirements set out in division (E)(2) above. In considering permit
applications, the consideration shall be given to needs of an industry whose
business requires that it be located in floodplain areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Fill shall be properly compacted and the slopes shall be properly
protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for
removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures
properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMAâ€™s
requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection
standards for multi-structure or multi-lot developments. These standards should
be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of
special flood hazard area designation will be requested.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Floodplain developments shall not adversely affect the hydraulic
capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse
or drainage system where a floodway or other encroachment limit has not been
specified on the official zoning map.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Standards for travel trailers and travel vehicles are contained in
Â§
160.42(C) of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system that resists flotation, collapse and lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use
of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state or local anchoring requirements for resisting wind
forces.
(Prior Code, Â§ 0325(5.0))
Â§ 160.28Â  GENERAL FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Permissible uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The uses listed in Â§

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All other uses shall be subject to the floodway/flood fringe
evaluation criteria pursuant to division (B) below. Section
160.26  of this chapter shall apply if the proposed use is in the Floodway
District and Â§
160.27 of this chapter shall apply if the proposed use is in the Flood Fringe
District.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Procedures for floodway and flood fringe determinations within the
General Floodplain District.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Upon receipt of an application for a conditional use permit for a
use within the General Floodplain District, the applicant shall be required to
furnish such of the following information as is deemed necessary by the Zoning
Administrator for the determination of the regulatory flood protection
elevation and whether the proposed use is within the floodway or Flood Fringe
District:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A typical valley cross-section showing the channel of the
stream, elevation of land areas adjoining each side of the channel, cross-
sectional areas to be occupied by the proposed development, and high water
information;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Plan (surface view) showing elevations or contours of the
ground; pertinent structure, fill or storage elevations; size, location and
spatial arrangement of all proposed and existing structures on the site;
location and elevations of streets; photographs showing existing land uses and
vegetation upstream and downstream; and soil type; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Profile showing the slope of the bottom of the channel or flow
line of the stream for at least 500 feet in either direction from the proposed
development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The applicant shall be responsible to submit one copy of the above
information to a designated engineer or other expert person or agency for
technical assistance in determining whether the proposed use is in the Floodway
or Flood Fringe District and to determine the regulatory flood protection
elevation. Procedures consistent with Minn. Rules parts 6120.5000 through
6120.6200 shall be followed in this expert evaluation. The designated engineer
or expert is strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed technical evaluation
methodology with the respective Department of Natural Resources Area
hydrologist prior to commencing the analysis. The designated engineer or expert
shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Estimate the peak discharge of the regional flood;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based
upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional
flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage
increase than one-half foot shall be required if, as a result of the additional
stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of
encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach shall be assumed in
computing floodway boundaries.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The Zoning Administrator shall present the technical evaluation and
findings of the designated engineer or expert accept the technical evaluation
and the recommended Floodway and/or Flood Fringe District boundary or deny the
permit application. The governing body, prior to official action, may submit
the application and all supporting data and Department of Natural Resources or
the Planning Commission for review and comment. Once the floodway and flood
fringe boundaries have been determined, the governing body shall refer the
matter back to the Zoning Administrator who shall process the permit
application consistent with the applicable provisions of Â§Â§
160.26 and
160.27 of this chapter.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Special conditions applying to the property in question do not
apply generally to other property or structures in the district or vicinity in
which the land is located and are not the result from the actions of the owner/
applicant;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographic conditions of the land involved, a particular hardship to the owner
would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter
of the regulations were to be carried out;

to community health, safety or general welfare and will not materially impair
the purposes of the subdivision regulations or the public interest;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The proposed variance will not substantially increase congestion of
the public streets or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public
safety, substantially diminish or impair property values within the vicinity;
and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The variance requested is the minimum variance necessary to
alleviate the practical difficulty.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Conditions. City Council may grant the variance and impose certain
conditions which are directly related to and bear rough proportionality to the
impact created by the variance. The variance may not be granted for a use that
is not allowed in that particular zoning district, that is inconsistent with
the Comprehensive Plan or that is not in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of the zoning ordinance and this chapter.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Procedures. An application for a variance shall be filed, in writing
with the Zoning Administrator or designee at the time when the preliminary plat

Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â General. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a land surveyor
licensed in the state. Prepared plats shall comply with M.S. Ch. 505 and M.S. Â§
462.358, as they may be amended from time to time, and all other statutes and
requirements which are applicable.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Plan of the entire area. Where a tract of land is proposed for
subdivision that is a part of a larger logical subdivision unit, the Planning
Commission may require that a plan of the entire area be provided. This plan
would be used by the Commission to aid in judging the proposed plat.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Preparation. The final plat shall be prepared by a land surveyor
licensed in the state. Prepared plats shall comply with M.S. Ch. 505 and M.S. Â§
462.358, as they may be amended from time to time, and the platting standards
as adopted by the stateâ€™s Association of County Surveyors as administered by

Â§ 161.24Â  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Review criteria. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable due
to flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities.
All lots within the floodplain districts shall contain a building site at or
above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All subdivisions shall be
connected to water and sewer treatment facilities that comply with the
provisions of this chapter and have road access both to the subdivision and to
the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood
protection elevation. For all subdivisions located in floodplain districts, the
regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access
roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and
preliminary platting documents. The regulatory flood protection elevation is
defined in Â§
161.11 of this code of ordinances.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Floodway/flood fringe determinations in the General Floodplain
District. In the General Floodplain District, applicants shall provide the

Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the
special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated
above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMAâ€™s requirements incorporate specific
fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or
multi-lot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the
initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area
designation will be requested.
(Prior Code, Â§ 300.12)
DESIGN STANDARDS
Â§ 161.35Â  GENERAL STREET DESIGN.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The design of all streets shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic, to
topographic conditions, to runoff of storm water and to the proposed uses of
the area to be served.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets
in new subdivisions shall make provision for the proper projection of streets
in the adjoining areas.
(Prior Code, Â§ 300.13)
Â§ 161.36Â  STREET DESIGN.
Â Â Â The following standards of street design for both public and private streets
shall be observed by the subdivider. If the average lot width of the lots
served by the public street is in excess of 150 feet, the subdivider may
request that the street width and grade conform to the rural standards for
local streets. Rural streets do not require curb and gutter. The Planning
Commission shall take into account future density of the area when determining
whether rural standards are appropriate. The Planning Commission may consider
the rural standards for streets where the average lot width is less than 150
feet if a finding is made that the area served by the road has rural qualities
and will not support further development.
Â 
Street Category Right-of-Way  Surfaced Minimum Maximum Grade Minimum Grade
                Minimum Width Width
Arterial        70 feet       44 feet*         6%            0.4%

NOTES TO TABLE:
* Measured from gutter line to gutter line of curb.
Â 
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Cul-de-sacs. The right-of-way radius shall measure 50 feet for single-
family residential land use and 60 feet for all other land uses. In urban
sections, the measurements provided in this division (A) shall be determined
from the center of the cul-de-sac to gutter line of curb. In rural sections,
such measurements shall be from center of cul-de-sac to edge of roadway
surfacing.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Street jogs. Streets jogs shall only be permitted subject to City
Engineer approval.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Street intersections. Streets shall intersect at right angles whenever
possible and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than 60 degrees,
unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Access to arterial and collector roadways. Where a proposed plat is
adjacent to an arterial or collector roadway, spacing between access points
shall not be to less than 660 feet (one-eighth mile) for collectors and 1,320

Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Improvements shall be made in all subdivisions according to the
following requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Monuments. As per M.S. Ch. 505;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Streets. Streets shall be graded to the full width of the right-of-

subdivider shall submit an agreement and letter of credit equal to one and one-
quarter times the City Engineerâ€™s estimated cost of the required improvements,
as approved by the City Engineer to assure the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The subdivider shall pay for the cost of all improvements
required in the subdivision;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Guaranteed completion of the required improvements within a two-

period, all amounts held under the escrow agreement or letter of credit shall
be turned over and delivered to the city and applied to the cost of the
required improvements. Any balance remaining after the improvements have been
made shall be returned to the owner or subdivider.
(Prior Code, Â§ 300.19)
Â§ 161.42Â  SIDEWALKS AND/OR SHARED-USE PATHS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Location criteria. The placement of sidewalks or shared-use paths will
be determined by the location of the plat/subdivision. In evaluating the need
for sidewalks or shared-use paths, the city shall consider the sidewalk and
trail plan maps, as defined in the cityâ€™s Comprehensive Plan, land use and
traffic along roadways. Sidewalks will be required where needed to provide a
connecting link to existing or planned sidewalks or shared-use paths on
adjacent properties in order to fill gaps in the pedestrian network.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Design standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All sidewalks and shared use paths must meet ADA requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The minimum width of a sidewalk shall be five feet and the minimum
width of a shared use path shall be eight feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The city will utilize the MnDOT standards to determine appropriate
design standards for all pedestrian facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Sidewalks located along roadways should have a four-foot minimum
landscaped boulevard where feasible to accommodate snow storage.
(Prior Code, Â§ 300.20)
Â§ 161.43Â  PARKLAND DEDICATION.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Findings, purpose; scope.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Findings. The City Council finds that as the population grows there
will be an increased need for land that can be devoted to public recreational
purposes to serve both the residents of new developments and existing residents
of the city. The City Council also finds that much of the cityâ€™s existing
recreation infrastructure, due to age and usage, is in need of repair or
replacement. The City Council further finds that parklands must compete for
financial resources with other community needs and, therefore, may not be able
to be adequately funded entirely from the present tax levy, or that to do so
may not be equitable to existing residents. Therefore, subdividers may have to
contribute funds for parklands.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Purpose. The purpose of parkland dedication is to provide a
mechanism whereby the city is able to obtain, for public use, land that can be
used for newly created parks, recreational facilities, playgrounds, trails or
open space; or a reasonable cash payment that can be used to acquire land or
facilities for that purpose; as authorized by the provisions of M.S. Â§ 462.358,
subd. 2b, as it may be amended from time to time.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Scope. The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to all
applicants who request to subdivide land for the development of residential
units. The provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to a person seeking to
subdivide land for an assisted-living facility, residential care facility or to
develop land for a non-residential purpose.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Dedicated land required. To obtain city approval for a subdivision, an
applicant shall dedicate public land for the following uses; parks,
recreational facilities, trails or open space in a quantity of land equal to
0.1 acre per residential dwelling unit proposed to be developed in conjunction
with the subdivision.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Minimum standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â At least 50% of the gross area of the land required to be dedicated
pursuant to division (B) above shall have a natural slope of 4% or less, be
largely clear of forest vegetation, and shall not be located in an existing
watercourse, 100-year floodway, drainage easement or storm water ponding area.
In addition, that portion of the land must have a cover of at least six inches
or more of topsoil, suitable for the seeding and cultivation of grass.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the land proposed to be dedicated has a natural slope in excess
of the standard set forth in division (C)(1) above, but may be engineered to
provide for a slope that meets those requirements, the City Council may, upon
the favorable recommendation of the City Engineer, permit the lands to be
dedicated to satisfy the requirements of division (B) above.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Certain activity prohibited. Following the dedication of any land, no
person shall remove trees, vegetation or topsoil therefrom, nor shall the lands
be used for the purpose of stockpiling earth or construction material, or
disposal of construction debris, without the consent of the city.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Cash payment in lieu of land dedication. If, in the City Councilâ€™s
judgment, the quantity of land to be subdivided is of a size or configuration
that dedication of a portion thereof:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Is not feasible or practical;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Will not create a parcel suitable for a park, recreational
facility, playground, trail or open space purposes; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Is adjacent or readily accessible to an existing park, recreational
facility, trail or open space facilities; the requirement of dedication of land
imposed by division (B) above may be satisfied by a payment of cash by the
subdivider to the city, or a suitable provision in a development agreement
between the subdivider and the city governing the development of the land in
question. The payment shall be made prior to the execution of the final plat by
the appropriate city officials in an amount equivalent to the fair market value
of the land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated. The City
Engineer shall determine the fair market value per acre of the undeveloped land
proposed to be subdivided at the time the preliminary plat is proposed, giving
due consideration to the value assigned similarly situated land by the county
assessor following its subdivision. The required payment shall be computed by
multiplying the value of the land per acre by the number of acres required to
be dedicated.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Proceeds. All funds received by the city pursuant to division (E)
above shall be deposited by the City Clerk in a park capital improvement fund
to be established by City Council resolution, and disbursed only for the
purposes set forth therein.
(Prior Code, Â§ 300.21)
IMPROVEMENTS; COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE
Â§ 161.55Â  IMPROVEMENTS; ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Before building permits are signed by the city, all applicants shall
be required to complete, in accordance with the City Councilâ€™s decision and to
the satisfaction of the City Engineer, all street, utility and other
improvements. This includes lot improvements on the individual lots of the
subdivision as required by these regulations, those specified in the final
subdivision plat, those approved by the City Council, and to dedicate same to
the city. The improvements shall be free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The City Council will not accept dedication of required improvements
until the City Engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the applicantâ€™s
engineer or surveyor has certified compliance with these regulations, those
specified in the final subdivision plat and those approved by the City Council.
Upon the approval and recommendation, the City Council shall consider accepting
the improvements for dedication in accordance with the established procedure.
(Prior Code, Â§ 300.22)
Â§ 161.56Â  INSPECTIONS OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The city shall provide for inspection of required improvements during
construction and ensure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay
to the city an inspection fee that will equal the actual cost of inspection.
These fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the city and no building
permits shall be issued until all fees are paid.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â If the City Engineer finds, upon inspection, that any of the required
improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the cityâ€™s
construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible
for completing the improvements.
(Prior Code, Â§ 300.23)
Â§ 161.57Â  MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
Â Â Â The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements on the
individual subdivided lots, such as erosion control, and provide for snow
removal on streets, if required, until acceptance of the improvements by the
city.
(Prior Code, Â§ 300.24)
Â§ 161.99Â  PENALTY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for
not more than 90 days, or both.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Any person aggrieved by the provisions of this chapter may have such
section, rule, regulation, decision or order reviewed by an appropriate remedy
in the district court, subject to the provisions of M.S. Â§ 462.361, as it may
be amended from time to time.

Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Whenever, in any zoning district, a use is neither permitted nor
allowed through a conditional or interim use permit reference, the use shall be
considered prohibited. In such cases, the City Council, Planning Commission or
property owner may request a study by the city to determine if the use is
acceptable and, if so, what zoning would be most appropriate and the
determination as to conditions and standards relating to development of the
use. The study shall include consideration of the adopted Comprehensive Plan of
the city. The cityâ€™s Planning Commission, upon receipt of the staff study, may
initiate an amendment to this chapter to provide for the particular use under
consideration or may find that the use is not compatible for development within
the district or the city.

hereafter erected, converted, moved, enlarged or structurally altered, and use
of any land shall be in compliance with the regulations established herein for

multi-family dwellings or other such uses are explicitly allowed for that
zoning district.

Â§ 162.030Â  VARIANCES.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Purpose. To hear requests for variances from the literal provisions of
the chapter in instances where their strict enforcement would cause practical
difficulties because of circumstances unique to the individual property under
consideration, and to grant such variances only when it is demonstrated that
the actions will be in keeping with the spirit and intent of the ordinance
maintaining public safety and welfare.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Procedure. An application for a variance shall be filed in writing
with the Planning Administrator or designee on forms provided and shall pay a
filing fee, as established from time to time by City Council. As part of the
application, the applicant must state his or her practical difficulty and
provide a building or site plan showing the details of the variance needed. An
application may be rejected by the Planning Administrator or designee if
required information is not provided and a written notice explaining the reason
for rejection is given to the applicant within 15 days from submission of the
incomplete application.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Notice. Notice of the time and place of a public hearing shall be
mailed to all parties owning real property within 350 feet of the subject
property however, failure of any property owner to receive the notification
shall not invalidate the proceedings. The mailing shall be made at least ten
days prior to the date of hearing. The Planning Administrator or designee shall
set the date for a public hearing and shall have the hearing notice published
at least once in the legal newspaper, not less than ten days prior to the
hearing. The Board shall, thereafter, reach its decision within 60 days from
the filing of the application unless a written notice stating the reasons for
an extension is sent to the applicant with an anticipated length of extension
specifically stated, which may not exceed an additional 60 days (120 total)
unless approved by the applicant in writing.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Standards and criteria for variance. The Board of Adjustment will
consider varying the regulations of this chapter of city code if a â€œpractical
difficultyâ€ is shown to exist for the property in question. The Board of
Adjustment may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises
benefitted by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards
established in this chapter of city code. The variance will not permit
standards lower than those required by any state law. The Board will not issue
a variance unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to
it in each specific case that all of the following are met.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The term PRACTICAL DIFFICULTY means that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The property owner purposed to use the property in a reasonable
manner that is not otherwise permitted;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The plight of the property owner is due to circumstances unique
to the property, not created by the property owner; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The variance, if granted will not alter the essential character
of the locality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In its consideration of a variance request, the Board of Adjustment
shall consider the following questions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The property in question cannot be put to a reasonable use if
used under conditions allowed by the official controls because of the
particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the
specific property involved, a practical difficulty to the owner as
distinguished from mere inconvenience;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The conditions upon which a petition for a variance is based are
unique to the property or extraordinary circumstances apply for which the
variance is sought, were not created by the land owner, and are not applicable,
generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Economic considerations alone shall not constitute a practical
difficulty if reasonable use for the property exists under the terms of the
ordinance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The granting of the variance will not alter the essential
character of the locality and will not be detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the
property is located;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â The variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and
air to adjacent property or substantially increase the congestion of the public
streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Whether the variance request is the minimum variance which would
alleviate the practical difficulties; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â No order of the Board of Adjustment granting a variance shall be
valid for a period longer than six months from the date of the order unless the
building permit is obtained within the period and the erection or alteration of
a building is started or within the period.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Authorized variances. Variances may be granted only to allow a
reduction in the performance standards within each zoning district or to vary
regulations other than use in Â§
162.071 of this chapter. The Board of Adjustment may not permit a variance for
any use that is not allowed in the zoning district of an effected property.

specified) to be in harmony with their general purpose and intent of city code
and the Comprehensive Plan. A determination shall be made by the Board of
Adjustment within 60 days from the submission of a complete application unless
notice is provided in writing to the applicant that additional time is required

days to make a determination unless the applicant provides a request for
extension in writing to the Planning Administrator or designee.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â City Council notice. Appeals of a decision by the Board of
Adjustment may be taken by any person to City Council, by filing a written

proposed within a PUD, no additional conditional use permit is required to be
obtained, but additional conditions may be placed on the PUD. Specific uses and
performance standards for each PUD shall be delineated in the pre-application
meeting, concept, preliminary and final PUD and development agreement and those
uses shall become permitted uses with the acceptance of the PUD and agreement.
Any change of uses proposed after the preliminary PUD acceptance will be
considered an amendment to the PUD and will require an additional preliminary
PUD approval.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Procedure for processing a planned unit development application. There
are four stages to the PUD process: pre-application meeting; concept plan;
preliminary PUD plan; and final PUD plan, as described below.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Pre-application meeting. Before filing an application for a concept
PUD, the developer shall arrange for and attend a pre-application meeting with
the Planning Administrator or designee, City Engineer and other appropriate
regulatory agencies to review applicable ordinances, regulations and plans in
the area to be developed. At this time, the developer shall submit a concept
plan of the proposed development showing the proposed density, lots, building
layouts, uses, roadway and pedestrian layout, public and common open space and,
if available, the proposed connections to community facilities, surrounding
neighborhood information, existing natural resources and topography of the
site. The concept plan will be reviewed by city staff to provide an advisory
review for conformity to the provision of
Ch. 151 of this code of ordinances and this chapter without incurring major
costs prior to the submission of a preliminary plan and/or plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Concept plan. Following the pre-application meeting, the applicant
will submit the concept plan to the Planning Administrator or designee to be
placed on the next available Planning Commission meeting. The Commission will
review the concept plan and make recommendations to the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Preliminary PUD plan. Following the concept plan review by the
Planning Commission, the applicant may submit an application for a preliminary
PUD and plat approval concurrently (if applicable), with all supporting data
and documentation as referenced in the application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The PUD application shall be filed with the Planning
Administrator or designee on forms provided with any necessary exhibits,
narrative and documents attached and in the quantity specified. A PUD
application with all the required documentation for a complete submittal will
be provided at or before the pre-application meeting to the owner and/or
developer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The city may excuse an applicant from submitting any specific
item of information or document required if they find it to be unnecessary.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The city may require the submission of any additional
information or documentation which they determine is necessary for the propose
PUD plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â PUD plan and preliminary plat consideration.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â After verification by the cityâ€™s Planning Administrator or
designee that the preliminary PUD plan and plat, and rezone, if applicable, and
supporting data is complete, the Planning Commission shall hold a public
hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â After the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall report
its findings and make recommendations to the City Council. Notice of the
hearing shall consist of a legal property description, description of the
proposed project and rezone if applicable and be published in the official
newspaper at least ten days prior to the healing. Written notification of the
hearing shall also be mailed at least ten days prior to owners of land within
350 feet of the boundaries of the property proposed for development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The city may request additional information from the applicant
concerning any matters it deems appropriate or retain expert testimony at the
expense of the applicant concerning such other matters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The City Council shall consider the requested PUD after the
receipt of the report and recommendations from the Planning Commission within
the time allotted by state statute. If the Planning Commission fails to make a
report within 60 days after receipt of the application, then the City Council
may proceed without the report. The City Council may approve the preliminary
PUD plan and preliminary plat, and rezone, if applicable, and attach such
conditions, as it deems reasonable or deny the application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â City Council may return the PUD to the Planning Commission for
further review.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Final PUD plan. Following approval of the preliminary plan and/or
plan, the applicant may submit an application for final PUD and plat approval
concurrently (if applicable), with all supporting data and documentation as
referenced in the application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The PUD application shall be filed in writing with the Planning
Administrator or designee on forms provided with any necessary exhibits,
narrative and documents attached and in the quantity specified. A final PUD
application with all the required documentation for a complete submittal will
be provided to the owner and/or developer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Following the preliminary PUD approval, the applicant shall
within six months, submit the final PUD Plan for City Council approval. If the
platting is occurring simultaneously, the applications can be reviewed at the
same time
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The final PUD will be approved if City Council finds that it is
compliant with the approval of the preliminary plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Rezoning: approval of the final plan shall be considered a
formal approval attaching the â€˜floatingâ€™ PUD Overlay District to the parcel/
s proposed for the PUD. The city shall follow public notice procedures in the
same manner as a rezoning.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â PUD order certificate of compliance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Upon completion of all conditions and requirements of the PUD
imposed by Planning Commission and City Council, and consistent with state and
federal law and city code and with the other standards and requirements herein
contained, an order authorizing development and use in accordance with the
final approved PUD shall be issued by the Planning Administrator or designee.
The PUD order shall incorporate the final PUD plan and shall specify in writing
the final conditions of approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All of the provisions of this chapter applicable to the zone
district or overlay districts within which the PUD is located shall apply,
except as otherwise provided in the PUD order.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Upon approval by City Council, the applicant will record the final
PUD plan, plat and district regulations, if applicable, with the County
Recorder and provide a certified copy to the city.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â PUD performance standard guidelines.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Height. The maximum height of buildings in PUDs shall not exceed 35
feet in height unless the City Council determines that a taller structure will
not create an adverse impact on the surrounding area. Under no circumstances
may a structure permitted as part of a PUD exceed 50 feet in height. In order
to assist in this decision, the city will require the following from the
project applicant:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A detailed explanation as to the reason for the desired increase
in height;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A detailed explanation of how the increased height will not
create an adverse visual impact; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Drawings or other visual renderings that show what the proposed
development will look like may be requested by the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Open space requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â At least 50% of the total project area must be preserved as open
space, with at least 25% as common open space.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Road rights-of-way, land covered by road surfaces, parking areas
and all structures are considered developed areas and shall not be included in
the computation of minimum open space.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Open space may include improved outdoor recreational facilities
for use by owners, guests of the dwelling units, occupants of transient units
or the public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â PUDs in a Shoreland Zone must contain open space meeting all of
the following criteria.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way or land covered by
road surfaces, parking areas or structures, except water-oriented accessory
structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the
computation of minimum open space.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Areas with physical characteristics unsuitable for development
in their natural state and areas containing significant historic sites or
unplatted cemeteries must be preserved in the open space.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Open space may contain water-oriented accessory structures or
facilities if they meet or exceed design standards of shoreland standards in Â§
162.072 of this chapter and are centralized.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks,
must be preserved as open space. For residential PUDs, at least 50% of the
shore impact zone area of existing developments or at least 70% of the area of
new developments must be preserved in its natural or existing state. For
commercial PUDs, at least 50% of the shore impact zone must be preserved in its
natural state.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Erosion control and storm water management plans.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Plans must be designed, and the construction managed, to
minimize the likelihood of serious erosion occurring either during or after
construction. This must be accomplished by limiting the amount and length of
time of bare ground exposure. Temporary ground covers, sediment entrapment
facilities, vegetated buffer strips or other appropriate techniques must be
used to minimize erosion impacts on surface water features or storm water
systems. Erosion control plans approved by a soil and water conservation
district may be required if project size and site physical characteristics
warrant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â PUDs must be designed and constructed to effectively manage
reasonably expected quantities and qualities of storm water runoff.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â PUDs within shoreland.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Impervious surface coverage within any tier must not exceed 25%
of the tier area; except that, for commercial PUDs, 35% impervious surface
coverage may be allowed in the first tier of general development lakes with an
approved storm water management plan and consistency herewith.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more
groups and located on suitable areas of the development. They must be designed
and located to meet or exceed the dimensional standards for the relevant
shoreland classification including: setback from the ordinary high water level,
elevation above the surface water features and maximum height.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Shore recreation facilities, including, but not limited to,
swimming areas, docks and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps, must be
centralized and located in areas suitable for them. Evaluation of suitability
must include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation, soils, depth
to ground water and bedrock or other relevant factors. The number of spaces
provided for continuous beaching, mooring or docking of watercraft must not
exceed one for each allowable dwelling unit or site in the first tier
(notwithstanding existing mooring sites in an existing commercially used
harbor). Launching ramp facilities, including a small dock for loading and
unloading equipment, may be provided for use by occupants of dwelling units or
sites located in other tiers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Structures, parking areas and other facilities must be treated
to reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by
vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color or other means, assuming
summer, leaf on conditions. Vegetative and topographic screening must be
preserved, if existing, or may be required to be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Accessory structures and facilities, except water-oriented
accessory structures, must meet the required principal structure setback and
must be centralized.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â PUDs must be connected to publicly-owned water supply and sewer
systems.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â City costs. Any costs directly related to a PUD including, but not
limited to, professional fees and expenses incurred by the city for
consultants, including, but not limited to, planners, engineers, architects and
attorneys, who the city determines in its sole judgment are necessary to assist
the city in reviewing, implementing or enforcing the provisions of this
chapter, shall be reimbursed to the city by the applicant from a deposit made
by the applicant with the city. The amount of the deposit, or any addition
thereto required by the city, shall be established by the City Council, which
shall thereafter, from time to time, make an accounting thereof to the
applicant. The city and the applicant may agree to share the costs of
consultants based upon a specific written agreement.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Revisions or changes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Changes to a final PUD (map or text) will follow the same process
as a new PUD application. New conditions may be imposed based on criteria and
conditions in place at the time of the application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Applications for a minor change shall be submitted to the Planning
Administrator or designee and will be reviewed by staff and placed on the next
available Planning Commission for their review. If determined that the
requested change is â€œminorâ€, the changes can be approved administratively. The
applicant will record all documents with the County Recorder and provide a copy
to the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If a plan or section is given final approval and, thereafter, the
land owner shall abandon the plan that has been approved or if the land owners
shall fail to commence the PUD within 18 months after final approval has been
granted, the approval shall terminate unless a time period is extended by the
Planning Commission upon written application from the land owner. The PUD
Zoning District created shall revert back to the zoning classification that
applied prior to approval of the PUD District.
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Phasing and guarantee of performance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Planning Commission shall compare the actual development
accomplished with a PUD order on a periodic basis.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Upon recommendation of the Planning Commission and for good cause
shown by the developer, the City Council may change the development schedule as
required by the PUD order.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The construction and provision of all of the common open space and
public and recreational facilities which are shown on the final PUD plan must
proceed at least at the same (but not slower than) rate as the construction of
dwelling units, transient units or other useable buildings in the PUD, if any.
The Planning Department shall review all of the building permits issued for the
PUD and examine the construction that has taken place on the site. If the City
Planner finds that the rate of construction of dwelling units, transient units
or other useable buildings in the PUD is greater than the rate at which common
open spaces and public and recreational facilities have been constructed and
provided, he or she may forward this information to the City Council with a
recommendation for action.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A development agreement shall be entered into by the developer to
ensure completion of the PUD in a timely manner and that provides for security
for the performance of the developerâ€™s obligation under the final PUD plan and
PUD order including a performance bond or letter of credit.
Â Â Â (J)Â Â Â Control of planned unit development following completion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â After a PUD order has been issued, the use of the land and the
construction, modification or alteration of any buildings or structures within
the PUD shall be governed by the PUD order, the development agreement and
applicable building and fire codes. After a PUD order has been issued, no
changes shall be made in the approved final PUD plan, except as provided in
this chapter or as provided below.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Any minor extensions, alterations or modifications of existing
buildings or structures may be authorized by the Planning Commission if they
are consistent with the purposes and intent of the final PUD plan and PUD
order. No change authorized by this chapter may increase the square cubic
volume of any building or structure by more than 10%.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Any building or structure that is totally or substantially
destroyed by fire or other casualty may be reconstructed only in compliance
with final PUD plan unless an amendment to the final PUD plan and PUD order is
approved under the provisions of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Changes in the use of the common open space may be authorized
only by an amendment to the final PUD plan and PUD order under this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Any other changes in the final PUD plan and PUD order must be
authorized by an amendment pursuant to this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements, public
dedication and acceptance or other equally effective and permanent means must
be provided to ensure long-term preservation and maintenance of open space. The
instruments must include all of the following protections:

shape of lots; the use, size, type and location of structures on lots; the
installation and maintenance of water supply and sewage treatment systems; the
grading and filling of any shoreland area; the cutting of shoreland vegetation;
and the subdivision of land shall be in full compliance with the terms of this
section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Enforcement. The Planning Administrator or designee is responsible
for the administration and enforcement of this section. Any violation of the
provisions of this section or failure to comply with any of its requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection
with grants of variances or conditional uses) shall constitute a misdemeanor
and shall be punishable as defined by law. Violations of this section can occur
regardless of whether or not a permit is required for a regulated activity
pursuant to division (D)(1) below or Â§
162.028 of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statute.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A guest cottage must be located or designed to reduce its
visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by use of
vegetation, topography, increased setbacks or color (assuming summer leaf-on
conditions).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â Public waters. Lots intended as controlled accesses to public
waters or as recreation areas for use by owners of non-riparian lots within
subdivisions are permissible and must meet or exceed the following standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â They must meet the width and size requirements for residential
lots and be suitable for their intended uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â If docking, mooring or over water storage of more than six
watercraft is to be allowed at a controlled access lot, then the width of the
lot (keeping the same lot depth) must be increased by 5% of the requirements
for riparian residential lots for each watercraft beyond six.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â They must be jointly owned by all purchasers of lots in the
subdivision or by all purchasers of non-riparian lots in the subdivision who
are provided riparian access rights on the access lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments must be
developed that specify which lot owners have authority to use the access lot
and what activities are allowed. The activities may include watercraft
launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring or docking. They must also
include other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly
conflict with general public use of the public water or the enjoyment of normal
property rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of the non- significant
conflict activities include swimming, sunbathing or picnicking. The covenants
must limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total
number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked or stored over
water, and must require centralization of all common facilities and activities
in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and
vegetation alterations. They must also require all parking areas, storage
buildings and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as
much as practical from view from the public water, assuming summer, leaf-on
conditions.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Design criteria for structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â High water elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance with
any floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do not
exist, along Brewery Creek, the elevation to which the lowest floor, including
the basement, is placed or flood-proofed must be determined as follows.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â By placing the lowest floor at least three feet above the flood
of record, if data are available. If data are not available, by placing the
lowest floor at least three feet above the ordinary high water level, or by
conducting a technical evaluation to determine effects of proposed construction
upon flood stages and flood flows and to establish a flood protection
elevation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Technical evaluations must be done by a qualified engineer or
hydrologist consistent with Minn. Rules parts 6120.5000 to 6120.6200, governing
the management of floodplain areas. If more than one approach is used, the
highest flood protection elevation determined must be used for placing
structures and other facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor
placed lower than the elevation determined in this item if the structure is
constructed of flood-resistant materials to the elevation, electrical and
mechanical equipment is placed above the elevation and, if long duration
flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action and
wind driven waves and debris.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Water-oriented accessory structures. Each lot may have one water-
oriented accessory structure not meeting the normal structure setback in
divisions (F)(1) through (F)(5) above if this water- oriented accessory
structure complies with the following provisions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet in height,
exclusive of safety rails and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square
feet. Detached decks must not exceed eight feet above grade at any point.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high
water level must be at least ten feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility
as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by use of vegetation,
topography, increased setbacks or color (assuming summer, leaf-on conditions).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must not
be enclosed or used as a storage area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human
habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â As an alternative for general development waterbodies, water-
oriented accessory structures used solely for watercraft storage, and including
storage of related boating and water-oriented sporting equipment, may occupy an
area up to 400 square feet; provided, the maximum width of the structure is 20
feet as measured parallel to the configuration of the shoreline.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Stairways, lifts and landings. Stairways and lifts are the
preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up
and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet
the following requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on
residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public
open space recreational properties and planned unit developments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not
exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used
for commercial properties, public open space recreational properties and
planned unit developments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts or
landings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Stairways, lifts and landings may be either constructed above
the ground on posts or pilings or placed into the ground; provided, they are
designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Stairways, lifts and landings must be located in the most
visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the
public water assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Facilities such as ramps, lifts or mobility paths for physically
handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas;
provided that, the dimensional and performance standards herein are complied
with in addition to the requirements of Minn. Rules Ch. 1340.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Significant historic sites. No structure may be placed on a
significant historic site in a manner that affects the values of the site
unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a
public repository.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Steep slopes. The Planning Administrator or designee must evaluate
possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters
before issuing a permit for construction of sewage treatment systems, roads,
driveways, structures or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined
necessary, conditions must be attached to issued permits to prevent erosion and
to preserve existing vegetation screening of structures, vehicles and other
facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming summer, leaf-
on vegetation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Height of structures. All structures in residential districts,
except places of worship and non-residential agricultural structures, must not
exceed the height limits specified in the underlying zoning districts.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Topographic alterations/grading and filling.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the construction
of structures, sewage treatment systems and driveways under validly issued
construction permits for these facilities do not require the issuance of a
separate permit. However, the grading and filling standards in this chapter
must be incorporated into the issuance of permits for construction of
structures, sewage treatment systems and driveways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Public roads and parking areas are regulated by division (I) below.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Notwithstanding divisions (H)(1) and (H)(2) above, a zoning permit
will be required based on the following table unless a property owner provides
evidence that the fill meets the standards outlined in the State DNRâ€™s
â€œShoreline Alterations: Beach Blanketâ€ publication (dated October 2012 or as
revised). *Amount of square feet is the project area where work is occurring
not the entire property.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to
during the issuance of construction permits, zoning permits, conditional/
interim use permits, variances and subdivision approvals.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Grading or filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 wetland
must be evaluated to determine how extensively the proposed activity would
affect the following functional qualities: (*This evaluation must also include
a determination of whether the wetland alteration being proposed requires
permits, reviews or approvals by other local, state or federal agencies such as
a watershed district, the stateâ€™s Department of Natural Resources or the United
States Army Corps of Engineers.)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Fish and wildlife habitat;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Recreational use;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Shoreline or bank stabilization; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Note worthiness, including special qualities such as historic
significance, habitat for endangered plants and animals, or others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that
ensures only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest
time possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for
temporary bare soil coverage and a permanent vegetation cover must be
established as soon as possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before
they reach any surface water feature must be used.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control
standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil
and water conservation districts and the United States Soil Conservation
Service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that
creates an unstable slope.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must
be reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope stability and must
not create finished slopes of 30% or greater.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff impact
zones.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public
waters must first be authorized by the DNR Commissioner under M.S. Â§ 103G.245,
as it may be amended from time to time.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are
accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent
or nearby properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â Placement of natural rock riprap, including associated grading
of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted under the
following circumstances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to
one foot vertical or meets the average slope of the current bank throughout the
project area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The landward extent of the riprap is within ten feet of the
ordinary high water level.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The height of the riprap above the ordinary high water level
does not exceed three feet or the meets the average height of the current bank
throughout the project area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Along any shore open to the public (public land or right-of
way):
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â At least one pedestrian path or stairway for each parcel of
land under separate ownership is provided for access to the water; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Placement of riprap will not cover beaches (areas typically
above water at normal water level) unless the DNR verifies the need in order
for shore stabilization.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (l)Â Â Â A zoning permit is required for excavations where the intended
purpose is connection to public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons and
harbors. This may be issued only after the Commissioner of the DNR has approved
the proposed connection to public waters.
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Placement and design; roads, driveways, parking areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take
advantage of natural vegetation and topography in shoreland areas where it
still exists to achieve maximum screening from view from public waters.
Documentation must be provided by a civil engineer or landscape architect that
all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to minimize and
control erosion to public waters consistent with the field office technical
guides of the local soil and water conservation district, or other applicable
technical materials.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads and
access related parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones, but must
be designed and constructed to take advantage of natural vegetation and
topography in shoreland areas where it still exists, to achieve maximum
screening from view from public waters and minimize and control erosion to
public waters. Construction requiring grading and filling as identified in
division (H) above must meet all zoning permit requirements listed in that
division.
Â Â Â (J)Â Â Â Storm water management; general standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When possible, existing natural drainage ways, wetlands and
vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter and retain storm
water runoff before discharge to public waters.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will
minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential
and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and
protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment
on the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â When development density, topographic features and soil and
vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle storm water
runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed
facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes,
waterways and ponds may be used. Preference must be given to designs using
surface drainage, vegetation and infiltration rather than buried pipes and
human-made materials and facilities
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â When constructed facilities are used for storm water management,
documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that they are designed
and installed consistent with the field office technical guide of the local
soil and water conservation district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â New constructed storm water outfalls to public waters must provide
for filtering or settling of suspended solids and skimming of surface debris
before discharge.
Â Â Â (K)Â Â Â Forest management standards. The harvesting of timber and associated
reforestation must be conducted consistent with the provisions of the stateâ€™s
Non-Point Source Pollution Assessment-Forestry and the provisions of Water
Quality in Forest Management â€œBest Management Practices in Minnesotaâ€.
Â Â Â (L)Â Â Â Extractive use standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Site development and restoration plan. An extractive use site
development and restoration plan must be developed, approved and followed over
the course of operation of the site. The plan must address dust, noise,
possible pollutant discharges, hours and duration of operation and anticipated
vegetation and topographic alterations. It must also identify actions to be
taken during operation to mitigate. Adverse environmental impacts, particularly
erosion and must clearly explain how the site will be rehabilitated after
extractive activities end.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Setbacks for processing machinery. Processing machinery must be
located consistent with setback standards for structures from ordinary high
water levels of public waters and from bluffs.
Â Â Â (M)Â Â Â Conditional uses. Conditional uses allowable within shoreland areas
shall be subject to the review and approval procedures established in Â§
162.029 of this chapter. The following additional evaluation criteria and
conditions apply within shoreland areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Evaluation criteria. The Planning Commission shall review the
application and consider the waterbody, the topography, vegetation and soils
conditions on the site and only issue a CUP where there are findings to ensure:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The prevention of soil erosion or other possible pollution of
public waters, both during and after construction;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The visibility of structures and other facilities as viewed from
public waters is limited in undeveloped areas and screened as deemed
appropriate in developed areas;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The site is adequate for water supply and sewage treatment; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The types, uses and numbers of watercraft that the project will
generate are compatible in relation to the suitability of public waters to
safely accommodate these watercraft.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Conditions attached to conditional use permits. The Planning
Commission, upon consideration of the criteria listed above and the purposes of
the shoreland section, shall attach conditions to the issuance of conditional
use permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter and
the adopted Comprehensive Plan. Conditions imposed will be based on the goals
of maintaining or improving water quality and/or the scenic and natural
atmosphere from the protected public water. Conditions may include, but are not
limited to, the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Increased setbacks from the ordinary high water level;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Limitations on the natural vegetation to be removed or the
requirement that additional vegetation be planted;

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Additional storm water management infrastructure or procedures.
Â Â Â (N)Â Â Â Non-conformities. All legally established non-conformities as of the
date of this chapter may continue, according to applicable state statutes and
regulations stated in divisions (F) and (G) above; except that, the following
standards will also apply in all shoreland areas:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Lots of record in the office of the countyâ€™s Register of Deeds on
the date of enactment of local shoreland controls that do not meet the
requirements of divisions (F) and (G) above may be allowed as building sites
without variances from lot size requirements; provided, the lot has been in
separate ownership from abutting lands at all times since it became
substandard, was created compliant with official controls in effect at the time
and sewage treatment and setback requirements of this chapter are met.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A variance from setback requirements, if necessary, must be
obtained before any use, sewage treatment system, or building permit is issued
for a lot. In evaluating the variance, the Board of Adjustment shall consider
sewage treatment and water supply capabilities or constraints of the lot and
shall deny the variance if adequate facilities cannot be provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If, in a group of two or more contiguous lots under the same
ownership, any individual lot does not meet the requirements of divisions (F)
(1) through (F)(5) above, the lot must not be considered as a separate parcel
of land for the purposes of sale or development. The lot must be combined with
the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each
meeting the minimum lot area requirements for that area of shoreland as much as
possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A deck addition to a structure not meeting the required setback
from the ordinary high water level may be allowed without a variance if all of
the following criteria and standards are met:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were
established;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no
reasonable location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing ordinary high
water level setback of the structure;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level does
not exceed 15% of the existing setback of the structure from the ordinary high
water level or does not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more
restrictive; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed or
screened.
Â Â Â (O)Â Â Â Sewage treatment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any premises used for human occupancy must be provided with an
adequate method of sewage treatment, as follows.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The city sewer system must be used where available.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â All private sewage treatment systems must meet or exceed the
State Pollution Control Agencyâ€™s standards for individual sewage treatment
systems contained in the document titled, â€œIndividual Sewage Treatment Systems
Standards, Chapter 7080â€, a copy of which is hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of
divisions (O)(1)(a) and (O)(1)(b) above must be upgraded, when a permit or
variance of any type is required for any improvement on, or use of, the
property. For the purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall
be considered conforming if the only deficiency is the setback from the
ordinary high water level.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Sewage systems installed according to all applicable local
shoreland management standards adopted under M.S. Â§ 103F.201, as it may be
amended from time to time, in effect at the time of installation may be
considered as conforming unless they are determined to be failing; except that,
systems using cesspools, leaching pits, seepage pits or other deep disposal
methods, or systems with insufficient separation from ground water shall be
considered non-conforming.
Â Â Â (P)Â Â Â Water supply. Any public or private supply of water for domestic
purposes must meet or exceed standards for water quality of the stateâ€™s
Department of Health and the stateâ€™s Pollution Control Agency.
Â Â Â (Q)Â Â Â Subdivision provisions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Land suitability. Each lot created through subdivision, including
planned unit developments (PUD) must be suitable in its natural state for the
proposed use with minimal alteration. Suitability analysis shall consider
susceptibility to flooding, existence of wetlands, soil and rock formations
with severe limitations for development, severe erosion potential, steep
topography, inadequate water supply or sewage treatment capabilities, near
shore aquatic conditions unsuitable for water based recreation, important fish
and wildlife habitat, presence of significant historic sites or any other
feature of the natural land likely to be harmful to the health, safety or
welfare of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.

land suitability.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Consistency with other controls. In areas not served by publicly-
owned sewer and water systems, a subdivision will not be approved unless
domestic water supply is available and sewage treatment consistent with all
other sections of this subdivision can be provided for on every lot. In
unsewered areas, each lot shall meet the minimum lot size requirements of that
district, and have at least a minimum contiguous lawn area that is free of
limiting factors sufficient for the construction of two standard soil treatment
systems. Lots that would require use of holding tanks must not be approved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Information requirements. Sufficient information must be submitted
by the applicant to make a determination of land suitability. The information
shall include at least the following:

the â€œtoeâ€ and the â€œtopâ€ of bluffs and the minimum building setback distances
from the top of the bluff and the lake or stream.
Â Â Â (R)Â Â Â Planned unit developments (PUDs).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Planned unit developments (PUDs) are allowed in the S-2 shoreland
area for new projects on undeveloped land and redevelopment of previously built
sites.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â PUDs must be processed according to Â§
162.071 of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â PUDs may utilize a tier system to allow for additional density
within the shoreland area, as based on the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Shoreland tier dimensions (measured from the ordinary high water
level proceeding landward):
Â 
                         Unsewered (feet) Sewered (feet)
Brewery Creek            300              300
Pool 4 - first tiers     200              200
Pool 4 - all other tiers 267              200
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The suitable area within each tier is calculated by excluding
from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs or land below the ordinary high water
level of public waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are then
subjected to either the residential or commercial PUD density evaluation steps
to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The base density for residential uses in the S-2 Zone is
indicated in Â§
162.071(F)(2)(c) of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Commercial uses may be incorporated into a PUD as long as all
zoning layers allow and be included within the density transfer process. For
the purpose of determining density of a commercial use:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Determine the average residential dwelling unit square footage
(interior living space) within the PUD project; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Apply this to the proposed commercial unit, with each one
dwelling unit amount of square footage in the proposed commercial use being
equivalent to one dwelling unit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any
other tier further from the waterbody within the same zoning district, but must
not be transferred to any other tier closer to the water.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Increases to the site base densities listed in division (F)(2)
(c) above are allowable only if the dimensional standards in division (F)(2)(b)
above, the general requirements stated herein are met, and the structure
setbacks from the ordinary high water levels is increased by 50% greater than
minimum setback or the impact on the waterbody is reduced through vegetative
management, topography or other means and the setback is at least 25% more than
otherwise minimum. Allowable dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases
for residential or commercial PUDs:
Â 
       Maximum Density Increase by Tier (percent)
First  50
Second 100
Third  200
Fourth 200
Fifth  200
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Existing resorts or other land uses and facilities may be converted
to residential common interest communities through the city platting process,
as outlined in
Ch. 161 of this code of ordinances.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The growth of the transportation system may occur in a manner that
is comprehensive in nature and supportive of the public good.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A TIS prepared consistent with the provisions of this chapter
will be required. All roads and intersections serving a proposed use must be
determined to be capable of handling the future projected traffic generated by
the use. No application for a development identified as requiring a TIS will be
deemed complete unless it is accompanied by a TIS. All projects requiring a TIS
will require a conditional use permit no matter the zoning district in which
the project is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A traffic impact study shall identify:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â What improvements, if any, are needed to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Ensure safe ingress to and egress from a site;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Maintain adequate street capacity and appropriate level of
service on public streets serving the development;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Ensure safe and reasonable traffic operating conditions on
streets and at intersections along the proposed route; avoid creation of or
mitigate existing hazardous traffic conditions;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Minimize the impact of non-residential traffic on residential
uses along the route; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Safeguard the public investment in the existing street system.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The road system investments to the city, county and state road
systems necessary to serve anticipated development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Traffic impact studies shall include the following information:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â An analysis of current and future traffic operations and
intersection improvement needs at all site access points in the affected
transportation routes. This operational evaluation shall include on-site
circulation as it may affect access, on-site and off-site turn lanes and
required vehicle storage, the potential need for signalization or other traffic
control, and review of sight distance, vehicle turning movements and other
intersection safety aspects. The proposed access plan should be consistent with
the standards of the cityâ€™s transportation plan (contained in the adopted
Comprehensive Plan or as amended) and with county or state requirements for
access management;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â An analysis of the impact of site-generated traffic on the level
of service of affected intersections and public streets along the proposed
route. Affected road segments or intersections are where the additional traffic
volume created by the proposed development is greater than 10% of the current
traffic volume (for road segments) or the current entering volume (for
intersections). Examples of possible effects include, but are not limited to,
pedestrian and bicyclist safety hazards, traffic noise or turning movementâ€™s
conflicts with other driveways or intersecting roads;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â For developments expected to generate more than 60 heavy vehicle
trips per day, an analysis of the intersections and road segments these trucks
would use to enter and exit the city limits is required. Issues of concern
include structural capacity, impacts of slow moving vehicles on roadway safety
and the need for intersection operation improvements to accommodate truck
traffic;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â An analysis of the impact of the proposed development on
residential uses (where the abutting land use is predominately residential)
along the proposed route to identify any potential adverse effects of the
proposed development and mitigation measures to address any impacts. Examples
of possible effects include, but are not limited to: non-residential traffic
impacts on residential neighborhoods; pedestrian and bicyclist safety hazards;
traffic noise; or turning movement conflicts with other driveways or
intersecting roads;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A detailed list of the transportation infrastructure
improvements needed to mitigate the impact of the development and estimated
costs of these improvements; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â An explanation of how improvements that are identified to
mitigate the traffic impact of the development meet commonly accepted
engineering design standards and access management criteria.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The TIS shall be led by a traffic or transportation engineer, or
other qualified professional with experience in the preparation of the
analysis. The city shall have the final approval of the selection of the
professional or shall employ other professionals (such as the City Engineer) to
review the TIS on the cityâ€™s behalf. The applicant shall be responsible for the
costs of preparation of the TIS and of the City Engineerâ€™s review.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The standards for traffic service that shall be used to evaluate
the findings of traffic impact studies are:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Level of service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The level of service standard for all highway corridor
operations (including freeway mainline, merging areas and ramp junctions, and
arterial and collector intersections or corridors) should meet the level of
service standards listed in the table below. Level of service should be
calculated using the Transportation Research Boardâ€™s Highway Capacity Manual.
Where the existing level of service is below these standards, a TIS shall
identify those improvements needed to maintain the existing level of service
and what additional improvements would be needed to raise the level of service
to the standards indicated; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The Highway Capacity Manual estimates the quality of traffic
flow in letter grades, referred to as levels of service. A and B represent
uncongested conditions, C and D are approaching congestion and E and F are very
congested.
Â 
Levels of Service for the City of Wabasha
Land Use    Street Type              Level of Service
Commercial  City Street              MidC
Commercial  County State Aid Highway C/D Midpoint

Residential City Street              B
Residential County State Aid Highway MidC
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Number of access points. The number of access points shall be
the minimum needed to provide adequate access capacity for the site. The
spacing of access points shall be consistent with the road authorityâ€™s access
management requirements. If the road authority has not adopted access
management requirements, then there shall be spacing of 300 feet between access
points, or the maximum available distance if there is less than 300 feet
between an access point and the nearest adjoining intersection or driveway on
an adjacent parcel;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Residential street impact. Without mitigative measures, non-
residential development shall contribute no more than 20% of the traffic on any
local street for which residentially zoned property makes up more than 50% of
the street frontage;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Vehicle storage. The capacity of storage bays and auxiliary
lanes for turning traffic shall be adequate to ensure turning traffic will not
interfere with through traffic flows on any public street;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Internal circulation. On-site vehicle circulation and parking
patterns shall be designed so as not to interfere with the flow of traffic on
any public street and shall accommodate all anticipated types of site traffic;
and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Safety. Access points shall be located and designed to provide
for adequate intersection and stopping sight distance and appropriate
facilities to accommodate acceleration and deceleration of site traffic. The
geometric design of access points shall meet the standards of the access
management requirements of the road authority connecting to the proposed
development site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The city shall require either the applicant or the owner or user of
the property on which the project is proposed to post a security in such form
and sum as determined by the City Engineer. The amount of the security shall be
sufficient to cover the cityâ€™s extraordinary cost and expense of repairing,
from time to time, any highways, streets or other public ways where such repair
work is made necessary by the special burden resulting from hauling and travel
for the proposed project. The amount of the security shall also be sufficient
to ensure compliance with all requirements of this chapter, and the particular
permit, and to pay the expense the city may incur as a result of the permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The requirement for a transportation impact study may be
waived by the city after consulting with road authority representatives with
roads comprising any designated haul routes (the countyâ€™s Highway Engineer for
affected county roads in the county, the City Engineer for any affected city
roads, the District Engineer of MnDOT District 6 for state or federal highways,
or the town board or its designee for township roads), if it is determined
that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A transportation impact study is not necessary to determine
needed road improvements on roadway access points or portions of haul routes
under their jurisdiction, and that for roadways and the intersections along
haul routes under their jurisdiction, no unsafe or hazardous conditions will be
created by the development as proposed;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The applicant has provided performance bonds or other
guarantees providing adequate assurance that anticipated damage to roads can be
mitigated and/or that unsafe conditions can be mitigated or avoided; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The use is seasonal or short-term, less than three months in
total, with peak daily trip generation that exceeds the major traffic
generators thresholds, but whose annual average trip generation does not pose a
risk to the road infrastructure or traffic safety of the facility and adjacent
road network based on evaluation of the cumulative pavement impact expected and
geometric design of the roadway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â This waiver shall not preempt the authority of the stateâ€™s
Department of Transportation to require a traffic study on any state or federal
highway nor the authority of any affected jurisdiction to require a traffic
study under an applicable ordinance. A waiver will not be granted to haul any
product that is deemed hazardous or a potential threat to the health of the
public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Applications for major traffic generator waiver shall be made to
the Zoning Administrator or designee on forms provided by his or her office.
Only one waiver will be granted per 12-month period per site. Completed
applications shall be forwarded to the City Engineer for review and then to the
Street Commission for consideration at an upcoming meeting. The application
must include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A detailed description and map of the proposed haul route;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Number of daily and total trips requested,;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Haul days and hours; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Any other data that the City Engineer might request to make a
determination on the waiver application.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When calculation of the number of required off-street parking
spaces results in a fraction, the fraction shall be rounded up to the next
highest number.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When the number of off-street parking spaces is based on the
maximum number of persons or patrons, this shall be defined by Building or Fire
Code requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â When the number of off-street parking spaces is based on the number
of employees, this shall be defined by the number of employees at the facility
during the largest shift regardless of full-time status.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In cases where future potential uses of a building or development
site will generate additional parking demand, the city may require a proof of
parking plan for the difference between minimum parking requirements and the
anticipated future demand.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The Planning Commission may consider reducing the number of spaces
required for passenger vehicles owned by the business if evidence is provided
that adequate storage is being provided off-site.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â The parking requirement for uses not listed in this section may be
established by the city based on the characteristics of the use and available
information on parking demand for such use.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â The Planning Commission shall consider varying the amount, location
and design requirements for parking in PUDs if a finding is made that changing
standards provides adequate parking for the proposed development and better
meets the goals of Â§
162.071 of this chapter.

NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS
Â§ 162.120Â  PURPOSE.
Â Â Â It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide for the regulation of non-
conforming buildings, structures and uses and to specify those requirements,
circumstances and conditions under which non- conforming buildings, structures
and uses will be operated and maintained. It is necessary and consistent with
the establishment of zoning districts that non-conforming buildings, structures
and uses not be permitted to continue without restriction. Furthermore, it is
the intent of this chapter that all non-conforming uses shall eventually
brought into conformity.
(Prior Code, Â§ 305.08)Â  (Ord. passed 12-18-2007; Ord. passed 7-2-2018)
Â§ 162.121Â  DEFINITIONS.
Â Â Â For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
Â Â Â EXPAND or EXPANSION. Any increase in a dimension, size, area, volume or
height, any increase in the area of use, any placement of a structure or part
thereof where none existed before; any addition to a site feature such as a
deck, patio, fence, driveway, parking area or swimming pool; any improvement
that would allow the land to be more intensely developed; any move of
operations to a new location on the property; any increase in intensity of use
based on a review of the original nature, function or purpose of the non-
conforming use; increase in the hours of operation, traffic, parking, noise,
exterior storage, signs, exterior lighting, types of operations, types of goods
or services offered, odors, area of operation, number of employees or such
other factors deemed relevant by the city.
Â Â Â IMPROVEMENT. Making the non-conforming use better, more efficient or
aesthetically pleasing, including any change that does not replicate what pre-
existed. A mere expansion, enlargement or intensification of a non-conforming
use does not constitute an improvement for that reason alone.
Â Â Â NON-CONFORMING LAND USE. An activity using land, a building or structure, or
a combination thereof, for a purpose that was lawful when established and which
is not permitted by the provisions of existing land use regulations.
Â Â Â NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURE. A structure that was constructed in compliance
with the land use regulations in effect at that time with respect to certain
standards such as location, height, setback or size, but no longer complies in
that regard with existing land use regulations.
Â Â Â NON-CONFORMING LOT. A lot that was lawfully established prior to adoption or
applicable amendment of this chapter, which fails to conform to the present
area or dimensional requirements of this chapter.
Â Â Â REPLACEMENT, RECONSTRUCTION or RESTORATION. The repair of a building or
structure that duplicates the condition of the building prior that existed
prior to the construction activity.
(Prior Code, Â§ 305.08)Â  (Ord. passed 12-18-2007; Ord. passed 7-2-2018)
Â§ 162.122Â  RIGHTS.
Â Â Â Pursuant to M.S. Â§ 462.357, subd. 1e, as it may be amended from time to
time, any non-conformity, including the lawful use or occupation of land or
premises existing at the time a city code amendment created the non-conformity,
may be continued with any necessary approvals, including through repair,
replacement, restoration, maintenance or improvement, but not including
expansion, unless authorized by this chapter.

Â§ 162.123Â  LAWFUL NON-CONFORMITY.
Â Â Â The burden of proof to show a lawful non-conformity rests with the applicant
and/or property owner. Documentation as to a non-conformity existing prior to
adoption or changes to this chapter of city code may be required if an
application for any permit or zoning action is received.
(Prior Code, Â§ 305.08)Â  (Ord. passed 12-18-2007; Ord. passed 7-2-2018)
Â§ 162.124Â  EXPANSION PROHIBITED.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Lawful non-conforming uses and structures may not expand or intensify
unless allowed to do so under this chapter or by other law (such as with the
issuance of a special permit, if require). Only that portion of the land or
structure in actual use may be so continued and the structure may not be
extended, enlarged, reconstructed, substituted, moved or structurally altered,
except when required to do so by law or order or so as to comply with the
provisions of this chapter, unless the value of the extension, enlargement,
reconstruction, substitution or structural alteration of the structure does not
exceed 50% of the assessorâ€™s market value of the structure at the time of the
alteration and a building permit for the alterations is submitted to the city
for approval within 180 days of the date of the removal or damage.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Substitution of new equipment or similar changes related to the non-
conforming use may be permitted by the Board of Adjustment if such equipment or
change will reduce the incompatibility of the non-conforming use with the
neighboring uses. Application for the approval will follow the process of
appeals. (See Â§
162.031 of this chapter.)
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â If the non-conforming use is discounted or terminated for a period of
12 months, any future use of the structure or land shall conform to the
provisions of this chapter.
(Prior Code, Â§ 305.08)Â  (Ord. passed 12-18-2007; Ord. passed 7-2-2018)
Â§ 162.125Â  CHANGES AND SUBSTITUTIONS.
Â Â Â Once a non-conforming use or structure has been changed to conform, it shall
not revert back to a non-conforming use or structure.
(Prior Code, Â§ 305.08)Â  (Ord. passed 12-18-2007; Ord. passed 7-2-2018)
Â§ 162.126Â  SUBSTANDARD LOTS.
Â Â Â In any district, an allowable use and its accessory structures may be
erected on any lawful non- conforming lot or parcel; providing, the lot or
parcel was of record in the office of the countyâ€™s Register of Deeds before the
effective date of the ordinance establishing the minimum lot standard. The lot
or parcel shall be in separate ownership from abutting lands, if abutting lands
and the substandard lot are owned by the same owner, the substandard lot shall
not be sold or used without full compliance with the provisions of this
chapter. If, in separate ownership, all other district requirements (uses,
setbacks, building heights and the like) shall be complied with.
(Prior Code, Â§ 305.08)Â  (Ord. passed 12-18-2007; Ord. passed 7-2-2018)
Â§ 162.999Â  PENALTY.
Â Â Â Any person, firm or corporation who fails to comply with the provisions of
this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a misdemeanor,
subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 90
days, or both. Each day a violation exists or continues shall constitute a
separate offense.
(Prior Code, Â§ 305.03)Â  (Ord. passed 12-18-2007; Ord. passed 7-2-2018)
