PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Ramsey, Minnesota. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1978 Code, as supplemented and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1978 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Jo Ann Thieling, City Clerk, and Mr. William Goodrich, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed in this part is the city Charter, which Charter was originally adopted on May 22, 1984. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform and the same scheme for expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code has been used. A consistent scheme of capitalization has also been used. Additions for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
State Law reference- City Charters generally, Minn. Stats. ch. 410. 

CHAPTER 1. - NAME, BOUNDARIES, POWERS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 1.1. - Name and boundaries. 
    The City of Ramsey, Anoka County, Minnesota, shall continue to be a municipal corporation under that name and with the same boundaries as now are or hereafter may be established. The city clerk shall keep in his/her office at least two copies of this Charter with amendments, and shall maintain in each copy an accurate and up-to-date description of the boundaries. The copies of the Charter, amendments and boundary descriptions shall be available for public inspection anytime during regular office hours. 
(Ord. of 1-24-2001) 
Sec. 1.2. - Powers of the city. 
    The city shall have all powers which it may now or hereafter be possible for a municipal corporation in this state to exercise in harmony with this Charter and with the constitutions of this state and of the United States and with the statutes of this state. It is the intention of this Charter to confer upon the city every power which it would have if it were specifically mentioned, unless otherwise provided in this Charter. The Charter shall be construed liberally in favor of the city, and the specific mention of particular municipal powers in other sections of this Charter does not limit the powers of the city to those thus mentioned. Unless granted to some other officer or body, all powers are vested in the council. 
Sec. 1.3. - Charter a public act. 
    This Charter shall be a public act and need not be pleaded or proved in any case. 
CHAPTER 2. - FORM OF GOVERNMENT 

Sec. 2.1. - Form of government. 
    The form of government established by this Charter is the "Mayor-Council Plan" as defined by current Minnesota state statutes. Except as otherwise provided by state statutes or this Charter, all powers of the city are vested in the city council. 
Sec. 2.2. - Boards and commissions. 
    There shall be no separate administrative board of health, library board, or any other administrative board or commission except for the administration of a function jointly with another political subdivision. The council shall itself be and perform the duties and exercise the powers of such boards and commissions provided for by state statutes. The council may, however, establish or abolish by ordinance boards or commissions to advise the council with respect to any municipal function or activity, or to perform quasi-judicial functions. Notice of initial formation and all vacancies shall be published in the city newsletter and in the legal newspaper. Membership of various boards and commissions shall not exceed nine members, at least two-thirds of which shall be residents of the City of Ramsey. 
Sec. 2.3. - Council composition and election. 
2.3.1  Mayor and council. The council shall be composed of the mayor, elected at large, two councilmembers elected at-large, and four councilmembers, each of whom shall be elected from a separate ward as established or amended pursuant to this Charter. The mayor and councilmembers shall be qualified electors. Each councilmember elected from a ward shall be a resident of the ward, but a change in ward boundaries does not disqualify a councilmember from serving the remainder of a term. Except as hereinafter provided, councilmembers shall serve for a term of four years and until a successor is elected and qualifies. The mayor shall serve for a term of four years and until a successor is elected and qualifies. The elections for the mayor and councilmembers shall be held as provided in subsection 2.3.3. 
2.3.2  Wards. The city shall be divided into four separate wards. The boundaries of such wards shall be determined by ordinance based upon population as determined by the most recent federal decennial census and shall be as equal in population as practicable and each ward shall be composed of compact, contiguous territory. An ordinance designating the boundaries of the city's election wards shall be enacted within 60 days after the state legislature has been redistricted or by May 10 in the year ending in two, whichever comes first. The wards shall be designated as ward numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
2.3.3  Transition schedule. 
2.3.3.1  For the 2002 city wide election only: 
(1)  Councilmembers elected in the year 2000 shall be assigned to the ward in which he/she resides.

(3)  Two at-large councilmembers shall be elected, with the candidate receiving the highest number of votes serving a four year term and the candidate receiving the second highest number of votes serving a two-year term. 
2.3.3.2  For the 2004 city wide election only: 
(1)  Councilmembers from ward numbers 2 and 4 shall be elected. 
(2)  One at-large councilmember shall be elected to serve a four-year term. 
(3)  A mayor shall be elected. 
2.3.3.3  Thereafter and commencing with the city wide election in 2006, there shall be biennial city wide elections with councilmembers from ward numbers 1 and 3 and an at-large councilmember elected, and at the next city wide election councilmembers from ward numbers 2 and 4, an at-large councilmember and a mayor shall be elected.

Sec. 2.4. - Incompatible offices. 
    No member of the council shall hold any paid municipal office or employment through the city other than that to which elected. Further, until one year after the expiration of his/her term, no mayor or councilmember shall be appointed or employed by the city in a compensated position which was created, or the compensation for which was increased, during his/her term as mayor or councilmember. 
Sec. 2.5. - Vacancies. 
    A vacancy in the council, whether it be in the office of mayor or councilmember, shall be deemed to exist in the case of the failure of any person elected thereto to qualify, or by reason of the death, resignation in writing filed with the city clerk, removal from office, non-residence in the city, conviction of a felony of any such person after his/her election, or by reason of the failure of any councilmember without good cause to attend council meetings for a period of three consecutive months. In each such case, the council shall publicly declare by resolution, the vacancy to exist within 15 days of its occurrence and such vacancy shall be filled according to the provisions of section 4.5. 
(Ord. No. 09-18, § 2, 12-8-2009) 
Sec. 2.6. - The mayor's powers and duties. 
2.6.1  The mayor shall preside at meetings of the council and shall have a vote as a member. The mayor shall be recognized as the head of the city government for all ceremonial purposes, by the courts for serving civil process, and by the governor for purposes of martial law, but shall have no administrative duties. 
2.6.2  Consistent with the responsibility to accept considerable leadership over the general conduct of city affairs, the mayor shall study the operations of the city government and recommend desirable changes and improvements to the council. The mayor shall also deliver messages to the council and the public, including a comprehensive message on the state of the city, as soon as practicable after the beginning of each year of his/her term of office. 
2.6.3  At the first meeting of each year the council shall choose an acting mayor from the councilmembers. He/she shall perform the duties of mayor during the disability or absence of the mayor, or, in the case of vacancy in the office of mayor, until a successor has been appointed and qualifies. 
(Ord. of 12-6-2001) 
Sec. 2.7. - Salaries. 
    The mayor and councilmembers shall receive such compensation as is fixed by the council in accordance with state statutes. Any increases in such compensation shall not become effective until after the next municipal election. Other officers and employees of the city shall receive such salaries or wages as may be fixed by the council. 
Sec. 2.8. - Investigation of city affairs. 
    The council may make investigations into the affairs of the city and the conduct of any city department, office or agency and for this purpose may subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony, and require the production of evidence. The council shall provide for an audit of the city's accounts at least once a year by the state department in charge of such work or by a certified public accountant. At any time, the council may provide for an examination or audit of the city accounts of any city officer or agency, and it may provide for any survey or research study of any subject of municipal concern. 
CHAPTER 3. - COUNCIL PROCEDURES 

Sec. 3.1. - Council meetings. 
    The council shall meet regularly at least once each month at such times and places as the council may designate by ordinance. The mayor or any three members of the council may call special meetings of the council upon at least 24 hours notice to each member, and such reasonable public notices as may be prescribed by council rule in compliance with state statutes. The 24 hours notice shall not be required in an emergency. A state of emergency shall be deemed to exist when the public peace, health, morals, safety or welfare are in immediate jeopardy. To the extent provided by state statutes, all meetings of the council and its committees shall be public, and any citizen shall have access to the minutes and records of the council at all reasonable times. During any of its public meetings, the council shall not prohibit, but may place reasonable restrictions upon citizens' comments and questions and citizen input shall be provided for at the beginning of each council meeting.

No prosecution shall be based upon the provisions of an emergency ordinance until 24 hours after the ordinance has been adopted, filed with the city clerk, and either has been posted in three conspicuous places in the city or published as provided for in this Charter, or the person charged with violation thereof had actual notice of the ordinance prior to the act or omission resulting in the prosecution. 
(Ord. of 1-24-2001) 
Sec. 3.7. - Signing and publication of ordinances. 
    The final version of every ordinance shall be read in full prior to passage by council unless such reading is waived by a majority vote of the council, provided that a copy of the ordinance is posted or otherwise made available to the public at least three working days prior to the meeting at which it is to be adopted. The ordinance shall then be signed by the mayor, attested to by the city clerk, and filed and preserved by the city clerk. Each ordinance, or summary of such ordinance, shall be published at least once in the official newspaper. This summary of each ordinance shall include, in layman's terms, the intent of the ordinance. To the extent and in the manner provided by state statutes, an ordinance may incorporate by reference, a state statute, a state administrative rule or a state regulation, a code, or an ordinance or part thereof, without publishing the material referred to in full. 
(Ord. of 1-24-2001) 
Sec. 3.8. - Procedure on resolutions.

Sec. 3.9. - When ordinances and resolutions passed by city council take effect. 
    Every resolution and emergency ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its adoption or at such later date as it specifies. Every other ordinance shall take effect 30 days after its publication or at such later date as it specifies. 
Sec. 3.10. - Amendment and repeal of ordinances and resolutions. 
3.10.1  An ordinance or resolution which repeals all or part of a previous ordinance or resolution, respectively, shall give the number, if any, in the title of the ordinance or resolution to be repealed in whole or in part. No ordinance or resolution shall be amended by reference to the title alone, but an ordinance or resolution which amends such ordinance or resolution, respectively, shall set forth in full each section to be amended and shall indicate by appropriate type or symbols, matter to be omitted or added. Amendment or repeal of an ordinance or resolution shall require a majority vote of all members of the council, unless otherwise provided in this Charter or by state statutes. 
3.10.2  Repeal of initiative ordinances. An ordinance passed under the initiative power shall not be repealed or amended by the council except by submission to the voters of the question by the council at a regular municipal or special election. 
Sec. 3.11. - Review and revision of ordinances and indexing of resolutions. 
    The city shall review, revise and rearrange its ordinance code and its resolution index with such additions and deletions as may be deemed necessary by the council at least once every two years. The ordinance code and the resolution index may be published in a book, pamphlet or loose-leaf form and copies shall be made available by the council at the office of the city clerk for general distribution to the public for a reasonable charge. Incorporation in such a code shall be a sufficient publication of any ordinance provision not previously published, if a notice is placed in the official newspaper for at least two successive weeks that copies of the codification are available at the office of the city clerk. 
(Ord. of 1-24-2001)

(Ord. No. 16-12, § 1, 11-7-2016) 
Sec. 2-273. - Purchasing practices. 
(a)  Ethics/relations with vendors. The City of Ramsey holds its employees to the highest ethical standards. Purchases shall be conducted so they foster public confidence in the integrity of the city's procurement system, and open and free competition among prospective suppliers. In keeping with this value, employees should avoid the following practices when making purchases on behalf of the city: 
(1)  Circumventing competitive bidding requirements. Examples of this include: 
a.  Splitting purchases so that they can be made through several small purchases. 
b.  Using the emergency procedure process when no true emergency exists. 
c.  Using a "sole source" exemption when competition is available. 
(2)  Denying one or more vendors the opportunity to bid on a contract when they have no history of default or failure in performance. Examples of this include: 
a.  Using unreasonably restrictive specifications. 
b.  Pre-qualifying bidders on a discriminatory basis. 
c.  Removing companies from a bidders list without just cause. 
d.  Requiring unnecessary high bonding. 
(3)  Giving favored vendors an unfair advantage. Examples of this include: 
a.  Providing vendors with non-public information regarding their competition's offer in advance of a bid opening. 
b.  Making information available to favored vendors and not to others. 
c.  Giving unfavored vendors inaccurate or misleading information. 
(4)  Accepting gifts from vendors. 
a.  Minn. Stat. § 471.895 prohibits government employees from receiving gifts except where they are included as part of the cost of a product, good or service provided (such as a meal provided as part of a conference). 
(Ord. No. 16-12, § 2, 11-7-2016) 
Sec. 2-274. - Decentralized purchasing. 
    The City of Ramsey has a decentralized purchasing program, meaning that each department is responsible for making its own purchases of materials and services for their operation. Such items as office supplies, paper products and other general supplies that are used throughout the city will be centrally assigned to one department for purchase. The responsibility lies within each department to obtain bid or quotes, maintain records of bids or quotes, prepare purchase orders, receive deliveries and approve invoices for payment. 
(Ord. No. 16-12, § 3, 11-7-2016) 
Sec. 2-275. - Purchasing alternatives. 
(a)  Uniform Municipal Contracting Law, Chapter 471.345. It shall be the policy of the City of Ramsey that the Uniform Municipal Contracting Law, Minn. Stats. ch. 471.345 shall be the policy of the city. Changes in this law will automatically become the policy of the city. City policy may be more restrictive then state law, but may not be less restrictive. Records of quotes and bids shall be retained for at least one year after the completion of the contract or purchase or until the annual audit for the year of purchase is completed, whichever is longer. 
(b)  Sealed bids/major purchases (see League of Minnesota Cities Information Memo entitled Competitive Bidding Requirements in Cities). 
(1)  A formal sealed bid procedure is required for all purchases in excess of $100,000.00 except professional services. 
(2)  A purchase (contract) that exceeds $100,000.00 cannot be split into several smaller purchases (contracts) to avoid the sealed bid process. 
(3)  City council approves all bids and specifications. 
(4)  A published notice is required in the official city newspaper at least ten days in advance of the bid opening. The notice may also be published on the city's official website or in a recognized trade journal. 
(5)  A public construction project that exceeds $50,000.00 must meet the responsible contractor requirements (Minn. Stats. § 16C.285). 
(6)  All bid openings are to be administered by the city administrator and/or the originating department. 
(7)  The preparation of all specifications are to be the responsibility of the city administrator and/or the originating department. 
(8)  Required authorization for plans and specifications is the responsibility of the city administrator and/or the originating department. 
(9)  The city council must formally approve the bid contract. 
(c)  Quotes/intermediate purchases. If a purchase is estimated to exceed $25,000.00 but not to exceed $100,000.00, the purchase may be made either by sealed bids or by direct negotiation based upon quotations. If a purchase is made in this range, staff members are required to obtain at least two written quotes and the quotations must be kept on file for at least one year. All such quotes must be forwarded to the finance department with the purchasing documents. 
    If a purchase is estimated to be $25,000.00 or less, the purchase may be made by either obtaining quotations or by buying the item directly on the "open market." If the quotation option is chosen, at least two quotes will be obtained and forwarded to the finance department with the purchasing documents. 
(d)  Professional service contracts. 
(1)  Cities are not required to follow the competitive bidding process when contracting for professional services such as those provided by doctors, engineers, lawyers, architects, accountants, as well as other services requiring technical, scientific or professional training. 
The city retains outside professional services in the area of: 
a.  Legal; 
b.  Planning; 
c.  Auditing; 
d.  Assessing; 
e.  Engineering; 
f.  Banking; 
g.  Towing. 
    Those contracts for professional services which are included in the city's general fund budget will be approved annually with formal adoption of the city's budget. 
(e)  Request for proposals (RFP). 
(1)  RFP's will generally be used to solicit proposals for professional services. 
(2)  An RFP will automatically be solicited for those services that exceed a city cost of $15,000.00 or have a value to the solicitor in excess of $15,000.00 (ex: Towing contract). 
(3)  An RFP will be solicited every three years (for standard city services such services as legal and towing) to five years (for banking and auditing). City council may, at its discretion, formally extend a current standard services contract upon the recommendation of city staff. 
(4)  Authorization by city council will be given to staff to issue a RFP. 
(5)  All RFP's will be advertised in the city's official newspaper and on the city's official website. 
(6)  City council must formally approve the proposal. 
(7)  Typical information to address in RFP's includes: 
a.  Background and scope of the project. 
b.  The project's budget to ensure that the proposals stay within that range. 
c.  Proposal requirements should include adequate information to allow for proper review and evaluation including:

10.  Submit deadline: date, time, project name, and addressee. 
11.  Statement: "Proposers are solely responsible for delivery of their proposals to the city before the deadline. Any proposal received after the deadline will not be considered and will be returned." 
12.  Information about where questions should be directed. 
Note: Staff should make sure that all proposers are given the same information. 
Attach a copy of the agreement proposed to be used for the project, including the city's insurance certificate. The agreement includes provisions to which the firm must agree, so it is important that they see the agreement up front. It is suggested that the RFP be submitted to the city attorney for review prior to distribution. 
(f)  Emergency purchases. Under Minnesota's Emergency Management Act, the city has the authority to enter into contracts during an emergency without following many normally required procedures. An emergency is defined as "an unforeseen combination of circumstances that calls for immediate action to prevent a disaster from developing or occurring". A disaster is "a situation that creates an actual or imminent serious threat to the health and safety of persons, or a situation that has resulted or is likely to result in catastrophic loss to property or the environment, and for which traditional sources of relief and assistance within the affected area are unable to repair or prevent the injury or loss". 
    During an emergency or disaster, the city council may waive compliance with the time-consuming procedures or formalities concerning: 
(1)  The performance of public work. 
(2)  Contracting. 
(3)  Incurring obligations. 
(4)  Renting equipment. 
(5)  Purchasing supplies and materials. 
    Emergency purchases will only be allowed when the mayor issues a proclamation declaring an emergency, and the steps listed in Minn. Stats. § 12.29 are completed. 
(g)  Cooperative purchasing agreements. Where a purchase contract has been awarded by the State of Minnesota, another local government, a cooperative of local governments, or a federal agency in compliance with applicable state statutes, and where it is legally permissible for the City of Ramsey to participate, a purchase may be though the vendor named in that contract without advertising for bids or obtaining quotes. 
(h)  Credit card use. According to Minn. Stats. § 471.382, the city council may authorize the use of a credit card by any city officer or employee otherwise authorized to make a purchase on behalf of the city. 
(1)  Authority for credit card holder. City staff having authority to make certain purchases will be eligible credit cardholders. A department director may request a credit card for city authorized purchasers when there is a demonstrated efficiency to be gained. The assistant finance director must review and approve each request before the card is issued. Before any credit card is issued, the authorized cardholder will be required to acknowledge and agree to the terms of use by signing the form entitled "Terms of the City of Ramsey MasterCard". 
The department director is responsible for notifying the assistant finance director when any changes occur to the cardholder's status. 
(2)  Types of purchases allowed by credit card. A purchase by credit card must comply with all statutes, rules, and city policies applicable to city purchases. Specifically: 
a.  All purchases must be made by the authorized card holder. 
b.  All credit card purchases must comply with the city's purchasing policy guidelines for quotes and bids. 
c.  All expenditures must be within the limits established by the department budget. 
(3)  Types of purchases prohibited. Use of a city credit card is prohibited for the following purchases: 
a.  Personal purchases of any kind. 
b.  Alcoholic purchases of any kind. 
If a city employee makes a purchase by credit card that is inconsistent with this policy and/or is not approved by the council, the employee is personally liable for the amount of the purchase. 
(4)  Procedures and documentation. Finance will receive the monthly bill and respective cardholder will receive a copy of the monthly statement of charges. The cardholder is responsible for obtaining and attaching detailed invoices and receipts for all charges on the statement and provide a public purpose/description of the expense and submit all of the documentation to the department director or designee by the due date. Payment will be made if the billing matches all completed credit card invoices and receipts. 
(i)  Public purpose expenditures. Pursuant to the statutes and laws of the State of Minnesota which regulate the expenditure of public funds for public purposes, the Ramsey City Council believes it is necessary and appropriate to provide assistance and guidelines to the officials, employees, and representatives of Ramsey to aid in the determination of when public funds may be spent for a public purpose. 
    To provide that assistance and guidance the Ramsey City Council adopted Resolution #06-11-369 discretionary expenditures policy that outlined the following items that are deemed to meet the city council definition of public purpose expenditures: 
(1)  Meals and refreshments. 
a.  Meals are allowed as part of a city business meeting in which the character of the meeting would involve predominantly non-city employees. 
b.  When they are part of a breakfast/lunch/dinner meeting for official city business when it is the only practical time to meet and when it involves non-city employee participants (i.e. business developers or business representatives). Only the expenses incurred by city employee(s) may be reimbursed. The city administrator is allowed some discretion regarding expenditures for meals as per the personnel policy. 
c.  When they are part of the structured agenda for an offsite conference, workshop, seminar, training session, or meeting in which the city administrator or a department director has authorized the employee to attend for training and development purposes (this does not include routine staff meetings). 
d.  All meetings shall be scheduled to minimized inclusion of meals.

3.  Other recognition events that may arise. 
(3)  Special events. Special events such as Happy Days, National Night Out, the Volunteer Recognition event and other events that involve or invite participation by the general public. These events and any city expenditures for them require prior specific approval by the city council and also include city expenditures for participation fees, donated gifts, door prizes, etc. 
(4)  Community and business relations. The city recognizes the importance of establishing and maintaining a positive image with the business and civic community. Participation in certain periodic or annual events is a necessity to maintain a positive image. Annual dinners or galas, or golf tournaments that are sponsored by an organization that the city has a business or community relationship with are examples of business and civic community events (i.e. chambers of commerce and other community partners). 
a.  The city administrator will coordinate participation at such events to ensure representation and ensure that duplication is avoided for purposes of cost containment. 
b.  The city administrator will review on an annual or semi-annual basis upcoming events to discuss attendance and representation at business and community events. 
c.  The city council will annually establish a maximum amount of community and business relation expenses by an affirmative approval.

Employees may be supplied with uniforms, clothing, boots and other gear necessary for the performance of their job as per the City of Ramsey Personnel Policy or applicable labor agreements.

ARTICLE VII. - ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT OF ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS 

Sec. 2-331. - Findings. 
    The city council has determined that the health, safety, good order, general welfare, and convenience of the public is threatened by certain public nuisances or violations of this Code on property within the city limits and finds the need for alternative methods of enforcing this Code. While criminal fines and penalties have been the most frequent enforcement mechanism, there are certain negative consequences for both the city and the accused. The delay inherent in that system does not ensure prompt resolution. Accordingly, the city council finds that the use of abatement, administrative citationing, and administrative hearings is an addition to any other legal remedy that may be pursued. The city has the option to utilize any of the following three procedures to enforce this Code. These procedures may be used separately, or in combination, to alleviate the violation.

ARTICLE II. - ALARM SYSTEMS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 08-22, §§ 2, 3, adopted July 22, 2008, repealed former Art. II, §§ 14-19-14-26, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Art. II pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code of 1978, § 7.28 and Ord. No. 89-07, adopted April 25, 1989. 

Sec. 14-19. - Purpose. 
    The city council deems it necessary to provide for the special and express regulation of alarm systems which are designed to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent attention and to which public safety personnel are expected to respond in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The regulation is necessary in order to reduce the increasing frequency of false alarms in the city. The great number and increasing frequency of these false alarms requires intensive, time-consuming efforts by the police department and fire department and thereby distracts from and reduces the level of services available to the rest of the community. This diminishes the ability of the city to promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community. In consideration for the necessity on the part of the city to provide numerous public safety services in one area to work to the detriment of members of the general public, it is hereby decided that the alarm systems shall be regulated by a penalty process. 
(Ord. No. 08-22, § 3, 7-22-2008)

The provisions of this ordinance are not applicable to alarm systems affixed to automobiles, boat trailers, house trailers, and recreational motor vehicles. 
    Alarm user means the person, firm partnership, association, cooperative, company or organization of any kind in control of any building, structure, or facility wherein an alarm system is maintained.

    Calendar year shall mean the period January 1 through December 31 of each year. 
    Cancelled alarm means an alarm that is cancelled prior to unit arrival, and is not considered a "false alarm." 
    False alarm means an alarm signal eliciting a response by public safety personnel when a situation requiring a response does not, in fact, exist, and which is caused by the activation of the alarm system through mechanical failure, alarm malfunction, intentional acts, improper installation or the inadvertence of the owner or lessee of an alarm system or their employees, agents or of a third party. Alarms activated by conditions such as snow, rain, mist, or fog are considered false alarms for the purposes of this section, but do not include alarms caused by severe climatic conditions such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, utility line mishaps, or other violent conditions of nature. 
    Public safety personnel means the law enforcement and fire department officers of the city. 
(Ord. No. 08-22, § 3, 7-22-2008)

(2)  Misdemeanor criminal penalties. 
a.  An alarm user that fails to pay an administrative civil penalty per subsection 14-21(1) shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
b.  An alarm user that fails to receive approval for a written plan of action per subsection 14-21(1)d. shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(Ord. No. 08-22, § 3, 7-22-2008) 
Sec. 14-22. - Assessment. 
    Unpaid civil penalties shall be certified as an assessment against the property on which the alarm was located. 
(Ord. No. 08-22, § 3, 7-22-2008) 
Sec. 14-23. - Duration. 
    For the purposes of this section, any accrued false alarms will expire at the end of each calendar year. 
(Ord. No. 08-22, § 3, 7-22-2008) 
Sec. 14-24. - Exemptions. 
(a)  Alarms cancelled prior to unit arrival will not be considered a false alarm. 
(b)  False alarms will be excused, and shall not be accrued toward the two alarm limit, during the 60-day period after the initial installation of an alarm system at a location.

(d)  A business or residence with two or more separate alarm systems shall be treated as having one system in reference to the amount of false alarms permitted prior to being penalized. 
(e)  Certain entities exempt. The United States Government, State of Minnesota, City of Ramsey, or any departments thereof, are exempt from the penalties stated above. 
(Ord. No. 08-22, § 3, 7-22-2008) 
Sec. 14-25. - Appeal process. 
    An alarm user that is required to pay a penalty as a result of false alarms may make a written appeal within ten days of notice by the city of the false alarm charge to the chief of police. The police or fire chief will then review the appeal for possible dismissal of the false alarm charge. 
(Ord. No. 08-22, § 3, 7-22-2008) 
Sec. 14-26. - Prohibitions. 
    No person shall install, monitor or use and possess an operative alarm which utilizes taped or prerecorded messages which deliver a telephone alarm message to the Anoka County Communication Center or the city police or fire departments directly or via city administration lines.

Sec. 26-481. - General. 
(a)  Purpose. The council finds that pawnbrokers potentially provide an opportunity for the commission of crimes and their concealment because such businesses have the ability to receive and transfer stolen property easily and quickly. The council also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving pawnbrokers. The purpose of this article is therefore to prevent pawn broking from being used as facilities for commission of crimes and to assure that such businesses comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(b)  Provisions of state law adopted. The provisions of Minn. Stats. ch. 325J and as amended from time to time are hereby adopted by reference as if fully set forth at this point.

(2)  A license under this section shall authorize the licensee to carry on its business only at the permanent place of business designated in the license. No license may be transferred to a different location or a different licensee. 
(d)  APS established. To help the police department better regulate current and future pawn businesses, decrease and stabilize costs associated with the regulation of the pawn industry, and increase identification of criminal activities in the pawn industry through the timely collection and sharing of pawn transaction information, this section also implements and establishes the use of the automated pawn system (APS). 
(e)  License limitation. No more than three pawnbroker licensed businesses shall be permitted by the city at any one time. Priority shall be given to qualified applicants for renewal of existing licenses. 
(f)  License fee.

Sec. 34-22. - Mixed martial arts. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prevent the practice of non-licensed mixed martial arts as defined in subsection (b) of this section.

Sec. 34-23. - Predatory offender residency restrictions. 
(a)  Findings and purpose. Repeat predatory offenders present an extreme threat to the public safety of a community as a whole, and especially to children. Predatory offenders are likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses. Most predatory offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of predatory offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, unmistakably steep. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety, and welfare of citizens of the City of Ramsey by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers and where certain predatory offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence. 
(b)  Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions will apply unless the context or intent clearly requires a different meaning:

    Day care means any facility, public or private, licensed by the State of Minnesota or Anoka County, in which care, training, supervision, habilitation or developmental guidance for children is provided on a regular basis and for periods less than 24 hours per day. 
    Designated predatory offender means any person who has been categorized as a Level III predatory offender under Minn. Stats. § 244.052, a successor statute, or a similar statute from another state in which that person's risk assessment indicates a high risk of re-offense. 
    Facilities for children means all public parks, parkways, park facilities, parkland, public or private schools, designated public school bus stops, libraries, group homes, foster homes, day care and child care facilities, public recreation centers, non-profit or commercial recreation centers, public or private playgrounds, public or commercial swimming pools, public beaches, youth centers, athletic fields used by children, crisis centers or shelters, care facilities for children's skate park or rink, movie theaters, bowling alleys, facilities for children's clubs, e.g. scouting, public recreational areas and trails including conservation areas, jogging trails, hiking trails, walking trails, bicycle trails, offices for child protective services, places of assembly, and specialized schools for children, including but not limited to, tutoring, gymnastics, dance and music schools. 
    Licensed child care facility means any facility, center, home or institution licensed by the State of Minnesota pursuant to Minn. Stats. ch. 245A, where children are cared for pursuant to the requirements of a license issued by the Minnesota Department of Human Services.

    Place of assembly means a place of assembly, synagogue, temple, mosque, or other facility that is used for prayer by persons of similar beliefs or a special purpose building that is designated or particularly adapted for the primary use of conducting, on a regular basis, religious services and associated accessory uses by a religious congregation. 
    School means any public or non-public educational institution providing instructional services to children, which shall include any structure, land, or facility owned, leased or used for operation of the school or school activities.

(c)  Prohibitions; measurement of distance; penalties; exceptions. 
(1)  Prohibited location of residence: It is unlawful for any designated predatory offender to establish a permanent residence or temporary residence within 2,000 feet of any school, day care, licensed child care facility, place of assembly, or facility for children. 
(2)  Prohibition present in safety zone: It is unlawful for any designated predatory offender to be present within 100 feet of any facility for children or day care facility. 
(3)  Measurement of distance: For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight line form the property line of the permanent residence or temporary residence to the nearest outer property line of the school, day care, licensed child care facility, place of assembly, facility for children, or park. 
(4)  Violations: A designated predatory offender who violates this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. Each day a designated predatory offender maintains a residence in violation of this chapter constitutes a separate violation.

The city administrator, or designee, shall review annually, and if appropriate, update the map to reflect any changes in the prohibited locations. The map shall not be deemed conclusive or all-encompassing since some prohibited locations change from time to time including, but not limited to, other places where children are known to congregate. 
(e)  Restrictions relating to rental property; penalties. 
(1)  It is unlawful for a property owner to let or rent any place, structure, or part thereof, trailer or other conveyance, with the knowledge that it will be used as a permanent or temporary residence by any person prohibited from establishing such permanent or temporary residence pursuant to this chapter if such place, structure, or part thereof, trailer or other conveyance, is located within a prohibited location as set forth in subsection (c) above. 
(2)  A property owner violating subsection (c) above shall be guilty of a petty misdemeanor. Each day a property owner violates subsection (c) above constitutes a separate violation. 
(3)  If a property owner discovers or is informed that a tenant is a designated predatory offender after signing a lease or otherwise agreeing to let the designated predatory offender reside on the property, the owner or property manager may evict the offender without further liability to the offender. 
(4)  Violation of subsection (e) may be cause to suspend or revoke the property owner's rental license. 
(f)  Severability. Should any section, subdivision, clause, or other provision of this chapter be held invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of this title as a whole, or of any part thereof, other than the part held to be invalid.

DIVISION 2. - PREMISES CONDUCIVE TO HIGH-RISK SEXUAL CONDUCT 

Sec. 34-68. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Booths, stalls or partitioned portions of a room or individual rooms. 
(1)  The phrase "booths, stalls, or partitioned portions of a room or individual rooms" means: 
a.  Enclosures specifically offered to persons for a fee or as an incident to performing high-risk sexual conduct; or 
b.  Enclosures that are part of a business operated on the premises that offers movies or other entertainment to be viewed within the enclosure, including enclosures wherein movies or other entertainment is dispensed for a fee. 
(2)  The phrase "booths, stalls, or partitioned portions of a room or individual rooms" does not mean enclosures which are private offices used by the owners, managers, or persons employed on the premises for attending to the tasks of their employment, and which are not held out to the public or members of the establishment for hire or for a fee or for the purpose of viewing movies or other entertainment for a fee, and are not open to any persons other than employees. 
    Doors, curtains or portal partitions means full, complete, nontransparent closure devices through which one cannot see or view activity taking place within the enclosure. 
    Hazardous site means any commercial premises, building or structure, or any part thereof, which is a site of high-risk sexual conduct.

(Code 1978, § 5.15.02; Ord. No. 91-14, 9-2-1991) 
Sec. 34-69. - Findings. 
    It is found that there are within the city commercial premises, buildings and structures, or parts thereof, which, by reason of the design and use of such premises, buildings or structures are conducive to the spread of communicable disease of danger to persons frequenting such premises, buildings and structures, and to the public health, safety and welfare of the community. The health, safety and welfare of all persons in the city must be protected through the application and enforcement of standards regulating such premises, buildings and structures, in order to eliminate the possibility of the spread of, or infection by, contagious disease. The sexually transmittable disease of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), currently found to be irreversible and uniformly fatal, is found to be of particular danger to persons in this community. The incidence of this disease is found to occur in discernible population groups. The risk factors for obtaining or spreading the disease are associated with high-risk sexual conduct. The commercial premises, buildings and structures where persons are placed at risk of infection from this disease or other communicable diseases facilitated by their design or use for high-risk sexual conduct are in need of regulation, and of establishment of minimal standards for the prevention of the spread of this disease and other communicable diseases for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare of the community. 
(Code 1978, § 5.15.01; Ord. No. 91-14, 9-2-1991)

(a)  In exercising powers conferred by this division or any other section of this Code relating to communicable diseases, the city's health authority shall be guided by the most recent instructions, opinions and guidelines of the Center for Disease Control of the United States Department of Health and Human Services which relate to the spread of infectious diseases. 
(b)  In order to ascertain the source of infection and reduce its spread, the city's health authority, and persons under the health authority's direction and control, shall have full power and authority to inspect or cause to be inspected, and to issue orders regarding any commercial building, structure or premises, or any part thereof, which may be a site of high-risk sexual conduct. If the health authority determines that a hazardous site exists, the health authority shall declare it to be a public health hazard and public health nuisance and shall then: 
(1)  Notify the management, owner or tenant of the premises that the health authority has reasonable belief that the premises, building or structure is a hazardous site. 
(2)  Issue two written warnings at least ten days apart to the management, owner, or tenant of the premises stating the reasons for the health authority's belief that the premises, building, or structure is a hazardous site. 
(3)  Once such notice and warnings have been issued, the health authority, or the health authority's appointee shall proceed as follows: 
a.  After the management, owner or tenant of the premises has been notified in writing as to the basis of the health authority's determination, the management, owner or tenant shall have ten days from the date of the last warning to request a hearing before the health authority or the health authority's appointee for a determination as to the existence of such hazardous site. If the management, owner or tenant of the premises does not request a hearing within ten days of the date of the last warning notice, the health authority shall then cause the premises to be posted with a warning advising the public that the premises have been declared a hazardous site. The health authority shall cause orders to be issued to the management, owner or tenant of the premises constituting the hazardous site to take corrective measures to prevent high-risk sexual conduct from taking place within the premises. 
b.  If the management, owner or tenant of the premises requests a hearing, the hearing shall be held before the health authority or the health authority's appointee at a date not more than 30 days after demand for a hearing. After considering all evidence, the health authority or the health authority's appointee shall make a determination as to whether the premises constitute a hazardous site. The health authority shall then issue a decision based upon all evidence presented. If the health authority or the health authority's appointee makes a determination that the premises constitute a hazardous site, the health authority shall then issue an order and cause the premises, building or structure to be posted with a warning advising the public that the premises have been declared a hazardous site. 
(4)  If, within 30 days from issuance of the orders to the management, owner or tenant of the hazardous site, the health authority determines that such corrective measures have not been undertaken, then the health authority may order the abatement of the hazardous site as a public nuisance, which shall be enforced by mandatory or prohibitory injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction; or may secure a court order for the closure of the premises constituting the hazardous site until the premises, building, or structure is in compliance with the standards set forth in section 34-71. 
(5)  Any person who removes, destroys, or defaces warnings posted on premises shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

Such areas shall be lighted in a manner that the persons in the area used for viewing motion pictures or other forms of entertainment are visible from the adjacent public rooms, but such lighting shall not be of such intensity as to prevent the viewing of the motion pictures or other offered entertainment. 
(c)  The standards as set forth in this division shall not apply to buildings, structures and premises that are lawfully operating as hotels, motels, apartment complexes, condominiums or roominghouses.

It shall be the duty of the city to promptly collect delinquent accounts, and the city shall notify each delinquent customer or, in case the customer cannot be found, then the person in charge of the premises, of the amount of the bill due.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, Minn. Stats. § 435.191. 
Sec. 46-4. - Senior citizen and total disability special assessment deferral. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to permit the council, at its discretion, to defer the payment of any special assessment for any homestead property owned by all persons 65 years of age or older or retired by virtue of a permanent and total disability for whom it would be a hardship to make the payments. 
(b)  Procedure to obtain and review a deferred assessment. 
(1)  The deferment shall be applied for by the owner on a form prescribed by the county auditor supplemented by the city administrator to establish the qualification of the owner for such deferment. The application shall be made at the time the project is authorized and in all cases it must be made before the final assessment rolls are approved by the council. If the application is granted it shall be automatically renewed each following year on September 30 of each year, unless the applicant's situation changes so that a hardship as defined in subsection (d) of this section no longer exists or the deferment terminates pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to file an intentionally erroneous application for deferral or for any person to fail to notify the city administrator of a change in circumstance that would terminate the deferral, which such notice shall be given promptly and not later than September 30 following the change in circumstances. 
(2)  If the deferment is granted, the city administrator shall notify the county auditor who shall record all notice thereof with the county recorder's office, which notice shall set forth the amount of the assessment, plus the interest rate and period of time during which interest shall accrue. 
(c)  Interest on deferred assessment. Interest on the deferred assessment shall accrue at the same rate as on non-deferred assessments. Interest shall cease to accrue on the date when the assessment would have been paid in full had it not been deferred. The maximum amount due on the assessment will then be the original assessment plus interest accrued during the original assessment term. 
(d)  Standards and guidelines for determining the existence of a hardship and a disability. A hardship shall be deemed prima facie to exist when all of the following apply: 
(1)  The annual gross income of the applicant according to their most recent federal income tax return plus any tax-exempt income does not exceed $12,000.00. If no such return was made, the city administrator shall require the applicant to submit other pertinent information to show that this qualification is met. 
(2)  The special assessments to be deferred exceed $300.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the council may consider exceptional and unusual circumstances pertaining to an applicant not covered by the standards of this subsection (d)(2); but any determination shall be made in a nondiscriminatory manner and shall not give the applicant an unreasonable preference or advantage over other applicants. 
(3)  Retirement by reason of permanent and total disability shall be deemed prima facie to exist when the applicant presents a sworn affidavit by two licensed medical doctors attesting that the applicant is unable to be gainfully employed because of a permanent and total disability.

(Code 1978, § 4.10.02; Ord. No. 01-10, 5-27-2001) 
Sec. 50-20. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Generally. 
(1)  In order to provide for the health, safety and well-being of its citizens, as well as to ensure the structural integrity of its streets and the use of the rights-of-way, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances. Although the general population bears the financial burden for the upkeep of the rights-of-way, a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rights-of-way is their frequent excavation by persons whose equipment is located therein. 
(2)  Right-of-way obstruction is a source of frustration for merchants, business owners and the general population that must avoid these obstructions or change travel or shopping plans because of them and has detrimental effect on commerce. Persons whose equipment is located within the right-of-way are the primary cause of these frequent obstructions. 
(3)  The city holds the rights-of-way within its geographical boundaries as an asset in trust for its citizens. The city and other public entities have invested millions of dollars in public funds to build and maintain the right-of-way. The city recognizes that some persons, by placing their equipment in the right-of-way and charging the citizens of the city for goods and services delivered thereby, are using this public property for private gain and profit. 
(4)  The state legislature has recognized that it is in the public's interest that the use and regulation of rights-of-way be carried on in a fair, efficient, competitively neutral, and substantially uniform manner, while recognizing such regulation must reflect distinct engineering, construction, operation, maintenance, and public and worker safety requirements and standards applicable to various users of rights-of-way. Further, the legislature has determined that because increasing numbers of persons may seek usage of rights-of-way, municipalities such as the city must be and have been authorized to regulate use of rights-of-way. Consistent with this mandate, the city has endeavored to model its right-of-way standards and regulations of general applicability. 
(5)  In response to the foregoing, the city enacts this article relating to right-of-way permits and management, together with an ordinance making necessary revisions to other Code provisions. This article imposes fair, efficient, competitively neutral, uniform, and reasonable regulations on the placement and maintenance of equipment currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein. This article is intended to complement the regulator roles of state and federal agencies. Under this article, persons disturbing and obstructing the rights-of-way will bear a fair share of the financial responsibility for their integrity. Finally, this article provides a recovery of out-of-pocket and projected costs from persons using rights-of-way. 
(b)  Legislative power. By enactment of this article, the council exercises its lawful police power and common law authority, and all statutory authority that is available to it, including, but not limited to, the powers conferred on it under Minn. Stats. §§ 237.162 and 237.163, while preserving all power and authority to further require franchises from right-of-way users under Minn. Stats. §§ 216B.36, 222.37, 300.03, and 412.11, and other provisions of law.

(a)  Operations. 
(1)  Each registrant shall, at the time of registration and by December 1 of each year, file a construction and major maintenance plan with the city. Registrants must use commercially reasonable efforts to anticipate and plan for all upcoming projects and include all such projects in a construction or major maintenance plan. Such plan shall be submitted using a format designated by the city and shall be submitted using a format determined by the city to be necessary to facilitate the coordination and reduction in the frequency of excavations and obstructions of rights-of-way. 
(2)  The plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following information: 
a.  The specific locations and the estimated beginning and ending dates of all maintenance and service area expansion projects to be commenced during the next calendar year (in this article, a next-year project).

The tentative locations and beginning and ending dates of all maintenance and service area expansion projects contemplated for the five years following the next calendar year (in this article, a five-year project). The service area expansions that are a direct result of city growth and service is statutorily required would not be included in the five-year plans, but would be included as plats are received and approved by the city. 
(3)  The term "project" in this article shall include both next-year projects and five-year projects. However, the addition of new services, by either by new construction or customer development, in areas already served by the registrant, shall not be considered a project. These additions shall follow all requirements pertaining to excavation and right-of-way permits as outlined in this article. 
(4)  By January 1 of each year the city will have available for inspection in it offices a composite list of all projects of which it has been informed in the annual plans. All registrants are responsible for keeping themselves apprised of the current status of this list. 
(5)  Thereafter, by February 1, each registrant may change any project in its list of next-year projects, and must notify the city and all other registrants of all such changes in said list. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a registrant may at any time join in a next-year project of another registrant that was listed by the other registrant. The city shall provide a list of all registrants and their contact information to all registrants prior to the February 1 deadline upon request. 
(b)  Additional next-year projects. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may, for good cause shown, allow a registrant to submit additional next-year projects.

(Code 1978, § 4.10.08; Ord. No. 01-10, 5-27-2001) 
Sec. 50-31. - Permit requirement. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this code, no person may obstruct or excavate the right-of-way without first having obtained the appropriate right-of-way permit from the city to do so. Routine maintenance, as defined in this article, shall be specifically exempt from the requirements of obtaining a permit for work in the right-of-way. 
(1)  Excavation permit. An excavation permit is required to allow the holder to excavate that part if the right-of-way described in such permit and/or to hinder free and open passage over the specified portion of the right-of-way by placing equipment described therein, to the extent and for the duration specified therein. 
(2)  Obstruction permit. 
a.  An obstruction permit is required to allow the holder to hinder free and open passage over the specified portion of right-of-way by placing equipment, vehicles, or other obstructions described therein on the right-of-way for the duration specified therein. 
b.  No person may excavate or obstruct the right-of-way beyond the date specified in the permit unless such person: 
1.  Makes a supplementary application for another right-of-way permit before the expiration of the initial permit; and 
2.  A new permit or permit extension is granted. 
c.  Permits issued under this article shall be conspicuously displayed at all times at the indicated work site and shall be available for inspection by the city inspector and authorized city personnel. 
(Code 1978, § 4.10.09; Ord. No. 01-10, 5-27-2001) 
Sec. 50-32. - Right-of-way restoration. 
(a)  The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the right-of-way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the permit, increased by as many days as work could not be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or when work was prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under section 50-33 all in the sole determination of the city. In addition to repairing its own work, the permittee must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including the paving and its foundations, to the reasonably same condition that existed before the commencement of the work. The permittee must inspect the area of work and use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for 36 months thereafter. 
(b)  In its application for an excavation permit, the permittee may choose to have the city restore the right-of-way. In any event, the city may determine to perform the right-of-way restoration and shall require the permittee to pay a restoration fee to provide for reimbursement of all costs associated with such restoration. In the event permittee elects not to perform restoration, city may, in lieu of performing the restoration itself, impose a fee to fully compensate for the resultant degradation as well as for any and all additional city costs associated therewith. Such fee for degradation shall compensate the city for costs associated with a decrease in the useful life of the right-of-way caused by excavation and shall include a restoration fee component. Payment of such fee does not relieve a permittee from any restoration obligation. 
(1)  City restoration. If the permittee chooses at the time of application for an excavation permit that restoration of the right-of-way will be performed by the city, such permittee shall post an additional performance and restoration bond, or other financial security acceptable to the city's finance officer, in an amount, determined by the city, to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the right-of-way to its pre-excavation condition. 
(2)  Permittee restoration. If the permittee chooses at the time of application for an excavation permit to restore the right-of-way itself, such permittee shall post an additional performance and restoration bond, or other financial security acceptable to the city's finance officer, in an amount determined by the city to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the right-of-way to its pre-excavation condition. If, 36 months after completion of the restoration of the right-of-way, the city determines that the right-of-way has been properly restored, the surety on the performance and restoration bond posted pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be released. 
(c)  The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and with the materials specified by the city. The city shall have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The city, in exercising this authority, shall be guided but not limited by the following standards and considerations: 
(1)  The number, size, depth and duration of the excavation, disruptions or damage to the right-of-way; 
(2)  The traffic volume carried by the right-of-way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the right-of-way; 
(3)  The pre-excavation condition of the right-of-way; the remaining life-expectancy of the right-of-way affected by the excavation; 
(4)  Whether the relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage of the right-of-way; and 
(5)  The likelihood that the particular method of restoration would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the right-of-way that would otherwise take place. 
(d)  By choosing to restore the right-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for 36 months following its completion. During this 36-month period it shall, upon notification from the city, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary, using the method required by the city. Said work shall be completed within 25 calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the city, not including days during which work cannot be done because of circumstances constituting force majeure or days when work is prohibited as unseasonable or unreasonable under section 50-33 all in the sole determination of the city. 
(e)  If the permittee fails to restore the right-of-way in the manner and to the condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and timely complete all repairs required by the city, the city at its option may perform or cause to be performed such work. In that event the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost of restoring the right-of-way. If permittee fails to pay as required, the city may exercise its rights under the performance and restoration bond. 
(Code 1978, § 4.10.13; Ord. No. 01-10, 5-27-2001) 
Sec. 50-33. - Other obligations. 
(a)  Obtaining a right-of-way permit does not relieve permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, franchises or other authorizations and to pay all fees required by the city, any other city, county, state or federal rules, laws or regulations. A permittee shall comply with all requirements of local, state and federal laws, including Minn. Stats. §§ 216D.01-216D.09 (One Call Excavation Notice System). A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work. 
(b)  Except in the case of an emergency, and with the approval of the city, no right-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work.

(c)  At the time of inspection the city inspector may order the immediate cessation of any work that poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety or well-being of the public. The city inspector may issue an order to the registrant for any work that does not conform to the applicable standards, conditions or codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for revocation of the permit. Within ten days after issuance of the order, the registrant shall present proof to the city that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has to be presented within the required time, the city may revoke the permit pursuant to section 50-70.

(5)  After six months of the passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived, a new registrant, or a registrant who has not submitted a plan as required in this subsection (a), shall submit complete and accurate mapping data for all its equipment at the time any permits are sought under this article. 
(b)  Information regarding equipment of right-of-way users constructed or located prior to May 10, 1997, need only be supplied in the form maintained, however, all right-of-way users must submit some type of documentary evidence regarding the location of equipment within the rights-of-way of the city. 
(c)  At the request of any registrant, any information requested by the city, which qualifies as a trade secret under Minn. Stats. § 13.37(1)(b) shall be treated as trade secret information as detailed therein.

To protect health, safety and welfare, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional equipment within the right-of-way if there is insufficient space to accommodate all of the requests of registrants or persons to occupy and use the right-of-way. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the right-of-way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for the particular service, the condition of the right-of-way, the time of year with respect to essential utilities, the protection of existing equipment in the right-of-way, and future city plans for public improvements and development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest.

Sec. 50-67. - Denial of permit. 
    The city may, in accordance with Minn. Stats. § 237.163, subd. 4, deny any application for a permit as provided in this article. 
(1)  Mandatory denial. Except in the case of an emergency, no right-of-way permit will be granted: 
a.  To any person required by section 50-26 to be registered who has not done so; 
b.  To any person required by section 50-30 to file an annual report but has failed to do so; 
c.  For any next-year project not listed in the construction and major maintenance plan required under section 50-30 unless the person used commercially reasonable efforts to anticipate and plan for the project. Service area expansions that are a direct result of city growth and statutorily required service provision would not be considered grounds for denial; 
d.  For any project, which requires the excavation of any portion of the right-of-way, which was constructed or reconstructed within the proceeding five years. Service area expansions that are a direct result of city growth and statutorily required service provision would not be considered grounds for denial; 
e.  To any person who has failed within the past three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance, with the requirements of this article more than two times. If a project is in dispute or judicial proceedings, it shall not be considered as grounds for mandatory permit denial and regular permitted work should continue; 
f.  To any person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of a permit under section 50-70; and 
g.  If, in the sole discretion of the city, the issuance of a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The city, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the right-of-way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(2)  Permissive denial. The city may deny a permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the right-of-way, or when necessary to protect the right-of-way and its users. The city may consider one or more of the following factors: 
a.  The extent to which the right-of-way space where the permit is sought is available; 
b.  The competing demands for the particular space in the right-of-way; 
c.  The availability of other locations in the right-of-way or in other rights-of-way for the equipment of the permit applicant; 
d.  The applicability of ordinance or other regulations of the right-of-way that affect location of equipment in the right-of-way; 
e.  The degree of compliance of the applicant with the terms and conditions of its franchise, if any, this article, and other applicable ordinances and regulations; 
f.  The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the right-of-way; 
g.  The condition and age of the right-of-way, and whether and when it is scheduled for total or partial reconstruction based upon five-year project plans filed with the city; and 
h.  The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage to the right-of-way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional parts of the right-of-way. 
(3)  Discretionary issuance. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1)c and d of this section, the city may issue a permit in any case where the permit is necessary: 
a.  To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the permit applicant; 
b.  To allow such customer to materially improve its utility service; or 
c.  To allow a new economic development project, and where the permit applicant did not have knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of service, or the development project when said applicant was required to submit its list of next-year projects. 
(4)  Permits for additional next-year projects. Notwithstanding the provisions of section subsection (1)c of this section, the city may issue a permit to a registrant who was allowed under section 50-30 to submit an additional next-year project, or in the event the registrant demonstrates that it used commercially reasonable efforts to anticipate and plan for the project, such permit to be subject to all other conditions and requirements of law, including such conditions as may be imposed under section 50-63. Service area expansions that are a direct result of city growth and statutorily required service provision would not be considered as additional projects. However, these projects would be added to the project list as the approved plats are received from the city. When these service area expansions require changes in the five-year maintenance plans these will also be updated accordingly.

Sec. 50-68. - Work done without a permit. 
(a)  Emergency situations. 
(1)  Each registrant shall immediately notify the city or the city's designee of any event regarding its equipment that it considers to be an emergency.

Within five business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the registrant shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with this article for the actions it took in response to the emergency. 
(2)  In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding a registrant's equipment, the city may attempt to contact the local representative of each registrant affected, or potentially affected, by the emergency. Should the contacts for the registrant be unavailable or fail to respond to the request, the city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the registrant whose equipment occasioned the emergency. 
(b)  Non-emergency situations. Except in the case of an emergency, any person who, without first having obtained the necessary permit, obstructs or evacuates a right-of-way must subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said permit, pay double all other fees required by city ordinance, including, but not limited to, criminal fines and penalties, and deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any damage to the right-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this article.

Stats. § 237.163, subd. 4, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without fee refund, in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any condition of the permit. A substantial breach by the permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  The violation of any material provision of the right-of-way permit; 
(2)  An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of the right-of-way permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon the city or its citizens; 
(3)  Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application of a right-of-way permit; 
(4)  The failure to maintain the required bonds and/or insurance; 
(5)  The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or 
(6)  The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order issued pursuant to section 50-35. 
(b)  If the city determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation or any condition of the permit, the city shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Further, a substantial breach, as stated in subsection (a) of this section, will allow the city, at the city's discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit. 
(c)  Within five days of receiving notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the city with a plan, acceptable to the city inspector, for its correction. The permittee's failure to so contact the city inspector, the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or the permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. Further, permittee's failure to so contact the city inspector, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year. 
(d)  From time to time, the city may establish a list of conditions of the permit that, if breached, will automatically place the permittee on probation for one full year, such as, but not limited to, working out of the allotted time period or working on right-of-way outside of the permit. 
(e)  If a permittee, while on probation, commits a breach as outlined in this section, the permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and the permittee will not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs. 
(f)  If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in connection with such revocation. 
(g)  Probation. While in a probationary status, a permittee will incur double the normal fee for said permit, and pay double all other fees required by city ordinance, to allow for the added costs associated with the monitoring of the permittee.

The minimum size water service from the watermain to the curb stop shall be one-inch copper. 
(b)  The corporation cock inserted in the distributing pipe must be of the size specified on the permit order. Every copper service pipe must be laid sufficiently waving to allow not less than one foot of extra length in such manner as to prevent rupture by settlement. The service pipe must be placed sufficiently below the surface in all cases, so protected or arranged as to prevent rupture from freezing. All services shall be inspected by the city prior to being backfilled. 
(c)  No person shall make any attachment to any pipe or water fixture in premises from which water has been shut off, or make any connection with any service pipe which is not in use between the water mains and the meters, without the party desiring such work to be done having first made application to and obtaining a written permit from the city for the performance of such work, and no person shall make any replacement tap or connect any tap or connection theretofore made in any water main without first removing the old service and plugging the water main. When a new building is erected on the site of an old one, and it is desired to increase or change the old water service, no connection with the mains shall be permitted until all the old service has been removed and the main plugged. 
(d)  The service pipe must extend from the main to the inside of the building, or, if not taken into a building, then to the hydrant or other fixtures which it is intended to supply. A stop cock accessible from the surface through a sleeve, without digging in all cases, must be placed outside in a box at the property line. All stop boxes and cocks must be approved by the city. All stop boxes at the property line must be set in front of the building intended to be supplied or as approved by the city. The stop cock, together with box and cover, are the property of the city and all unauthorized persons are forbidden to interfere with them. 
(e)  The service pipe from the city water main to the meter shall enter the building so that the meter horn is in a horizontal position. In no case should there be more than 12 inches of pipe exposed between the point of the entrance through the basement floor and the stop. 
(f)  The water pipe connecting with the municipal water main shall have no joints therein when located under the basement or slab floor. 
(g)  If, for any cause, a person laying the service pipe should fail to have the corporation cock inserted or the connection made to the curb stop at the time specified in the application, a written notice to that effect must be left with the city fixing another day on which said connection will be made. A notice must be given at least two days previous to the excavation for the laying of a service pipe and the connection made before 4:00 p.m., except in a special case and then the work shall be done only on written order from the city.

ARTICLE V. - STORM DRAINAGE UTILITY 

Sec. 58-194. - Storm sewer system; statutory authority. 
    The provisions of Minn. Stats. § 444.075, authorizes cities to impose just and reasonable charges for the use and availability of storm sewer facilities ("charges"). By this article, the city elects to exercise such authority. 
(Code 1978, § 4.80.01; Ord. No. 00-01, 3-13-2000) 
Sec. 58-195. - Findings and determinations. 
    In providing for such charges, the findings and determination set out in this article are made. 
(1)  In the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare, the city has constructed, operated and maintained a storm sewer system ("the system"). This article is adopted in the further exercise of such authority and for the same purposes. 
(2)  The system, as constructed, heretofore has been financed and paid for through the imposition of special assessments and ad valorem taxes. Such financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were used. It is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the further costs of improving, maintaining and operating the system through the imposition of charges as provided in this article. 
(3)  In imposing charges, it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable. Taking into account the status of completion of the system, past methods of recovering system costs, the topography of the city and other relevant factors, it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of operating, maintaining and improving the system on the basis of the expected stormwater runoff from the various parcels of land within the city during a standard five-year rainfall event. 
(4)  Assigning costs and making charges based upon expected typical stormwater runoff cannot be done with mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits. The provisions of this article undertake to establish a reasonable and practical methodology for making such charges. 
(Code 1978, § 4.80.02; Ord. No. 00-01, 3-13-2000; Ord. No. 00-10, 9-5-2000) 
Sec. 58-196. - Rates and charges. 
(a)  Residential equivalent factor. Rates and charge for the use and availability of the system shall be determined through the use of a residential equivalent factor (REF). For the purposes of this article, one REF is defined as the ratio of the average volume of surface water runoff coming from one acre of land and subjected to a particular use, to the average volume of runoff coming from one acre of land subjected to typical single-family residential use within the city during a standard five-year rainfall event. 
(b)  Residential equivalent unit. Rates and charges for the use and availability of the system shall be determined through the use of a residential equivalent unit (REU). For the purposes of this article, one REU is defined as the product of the acreage of a particular parcel multiplied by the REF. 
(c)  Determination of REFs and REUs. The REF shall be based on the relative runoff generated by any land use compared to the expected runoff from a typical half-acre single-family dwelling. This relationship shall be interpreted as a function of the percent of the total lot area that is impervious and shall be applied as determined in the table below.

For the purpose of this article, the term "impervious" shall mean any ground surface that is not substantially covered with vegetation and produces run-off amounts that are in excess of undeveloped land. Paths and parking areas that consist of gravel and dirt will be considered impervious surface. 
(d)  Appeals. Appeals from the city administrator's determination of the proper classifications may be made to the city council. The council may adjust, by ordinance, the storm drainage fee for a parcel or a class of parcels based upon hydrologic data to be supplied by property owners, which data demonstrates a hydrologic response substantially different from the standards. Such adjustments of stormwater drainage fees shall not be made retroactively. 
(Code 1978, § 4.80.03; Ord. No. 00-01, 3-13-2000; Ord. No. 00-10, 9-5-2000) 
Sec. 58-197. - Establishing basic rate. 
    In determining charges, the council shall, from time to time, by ordinance, establish a basic system rate to be charged against one acre of land having an REF of one. The charge to be made against each parcel of land shall then be determined by multiplying the REU times the basic system rate. 
(Code 1978, § 4.80.04, subd. 1; Ord. No. 00-01, 3-13-2000; Ord. No. 00-10, 9-5-2000) 
Sec. 58-198. - Standardized acreage. 
    For the purpose of simplifying and equalizing charges against property used for residential purposes, the following process shall be used. Single-family, two-family, townhouse units and farmland properties that contain only a farmstead and typical associated outbuildings shall be considered as a single-family residential property. Single-family residential properties shall be considered to have an acreage of one-fourth acre and an REF of 1. Single-family properties with a business on the site shall be charged one-half the residential rate and one-half the business rate until such time as the business is no longer active on the site, at which time the rate shall be the standard single-family residential rate. The property owner shall be responsible for notifying the city of this change of status.

Sec. 58-199. - Adjustments of charges. 
    The city council may, by resolution, from time to time, adopt policies providing for the adjustment of charges for parcels or groups of parcels, based upon hydrologic data supplied by affected property owners, demonstrating an actual hydrologic response substantially different from the REF being used for the parcel. Such adjustment shall be made only after receiving the recommendation of the city administrator and shall not be made effective retroactively. If the adjustment would have the effect of changing the REF for all or substantially all of the land uses in a particular classification; however, such adjustment shall be accomplished by amending the REF table in section 58-196. 
(Code 1978, § 4.80.06; Ord. No. 00-01, 3-13-2000) 
Sec. 58-200. - Excluded lands. 
    No charge for system availability or service shall be made against land which is either public street right-of-way or vacant and unimproved with substantially all of its surface having vegetation as ground cover. 
(Code 1978, § 4.80.07; Ord. No. 00-01, 3-13-2000) 
Sec. 58-201. - Supplying information. 
    The owner, occupant or person in charge of any premises shall supply the city with such information as the city may reasonably request related to the use, development and area of the premises. Willful failure to provide such information or to falsify it is a violation of this article. 
(Code 1978, § 4.80.08; Ord. No. 00-01, 3-13-2000) 
Sec. 58-202. - Estimated charges. 
    If the owner, occupant or person in charge of any premises fails or refuses to provide the information requested, as provided in section 58-201, the charge for such premises shall be estimated and billed in accordance with such estimate, based upon information available to the city. 
(Code 1978, § 4.80.09; Ord. No. 00-01, 3-13-2000) 
Sec. 58-203. - Drainage and erosion control. 
(a)  Drainage plan. In the development improvement or alteration of land, the direction, quantity or quality of drainage shall not be changed unless plans for the development are submitted to the city engineer and are found to be in compliance with the city's comprehensive surface water management plan or have received a variance from the appropriate water management organization as necessary. Runoff shall be properly channeled into a storm drain, watercourse, ponding area or other public facility. 
(b)  Erosion and sediment control plan. Prior to the issuance of a building or grading permit for any development, improvement or alteration of land, a plan for erosion and sedimentation control shall be presented with the site plan. The erosion and sedimentation control plan shall specify the measures to be used before, during and after construction until the soil and slope are stabilized by permanent cover. These control measures shall be maintained in good working order until site stabilization occurs. 
(c)  Plan approval. In areas which are susceptible to erosion hazard or sedimentation damage, the city may require the erosion and sedimentation control plan to be approved by the appropriate water management organization prior to the issuance of a permit. 
(d)  Approval. Plans and provisions required for compliance with this article must be submitted to the community development director for approval.

Sec. 117-2. - Rules of construction and interpretation. 
(a)  Conflicting conditions. Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this chapter are either more or less restrictive than comparable conditions by another provision of this chapter or by other chapters of this Code, rule or regulation of the city, the provision which imposes the more restrictive condition, standard, or requirement shall prevail. 
(b)  Language rules of construction. The language set forth in the text of this chapter shall be interpreted in accordance with the following rules of construction: All measured distances expressed in feet shall be the nearest tenth of a foot. All distances unless otherwise specified shall be measured horizontally. 
(Code 1978, §§ 9.01.06, 9.21.03; Ord. No. 73-05, 5-21-1973; Ord. No. 75-08, 6-27-1975; Ord. No. 85-02, 8-12-1985; Ord. No. 86-2, 8-25-1986) 
Sec. 117-3. - Enforcement of penalties. 
(a)  Any violation of this chapter may be enjoined by the council through proper legal channels. Each day a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  In case any building, structure, or land is proposed to be erected, reconstructed, altered, converted, maintained or used in violation of this chapter, the council, in addition to other remedies, may institute in the name of the city any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or abate such building, structure, or land, or to prevent, in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business, or use constituting a violation. 
(Code 1978, § 9.01.07; Ord. No. 73-05, 5-21-1973) 
Sec. 117-4. - Official map. 
(a)  Purpose. Land that is needed for future street purposes and as sites for other necessary public facilities and services is frequently diverted to non-public uses which could have been located on other lands without hardship or inconvenience to the owners. When this happens, public uses of land may be denied or may be obtained only at prohibitive cost or at the expense of dislocating the owners and occupants of the land. Identification on an official map of land needed for future public uses permits both the public and private property owners to adjust their building plans equitable and conveniently before investments are made which will make such adjustments difficult to accomplish. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a uniform procedure for the proper use of official maps as authorized by Minn. Stats. §§ 462.351-462.36. 
(b)  Initiation of proceedings. Proceedings for adoption, amendment, or repeal of an official map or any part thereof may be initiated by: 
(1)  A recommendation of the planning commission; or 
(2)  Action by the city council on its own initiative, recommendation of an advisory commission, request of an outside governmental body, or petition of 35 percent of the owners of affected property. 
(c)  Sketch maps and reports. Every proposal or request for an official map for its amendment or repeal, however initiated, shall be accompanied by a sketch map or plat showing the lands proposed to be included and the public purpose to be served. The council may request a report of the city engineer as to the feasibility of any construction involved. 
(d)  Reference to planning commission. Except when proceedings have been initiated by recommendation of the planning commission, every proposed official map or change in a map shall be referred to the planning commission for advice and recommendation thereon, and such recommendation shall be submitted to the city council within 60 days after reference to the planning commission along with the report of the commission on the effect of the proposal on the comprehensive plan of the city. If no recommendation is received by the council from the planning commission within 60 days after reference of the proposal to the commission by the council, the council may take such action as it may deem proper upon the proposal without further action by the planning commission. 
(e)  Notice and hearing. 
(1)  Notice. Upon receiving the recommendation of the planning commission or after 60 days from the submission of the proposal to the planning commission without a recommendation from the commission, the council may call a public hearing on the proposal. A notice of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing and a description of property to be included in the mapped streets and public grounds shall be published in the official newspaper at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. At least ten days prior to the hearing the clerk shall also mail a copy of the notice to each owner of land situated within or abutting any street or other public ground shown on the official map. For purposes of this notice the owners shall be determined by the records of the county auditor and the notice shall be addressed to the last known address as shown by the auditor's records. Failure to serve any such notice shall not invalidate the proceedings. 
(2)  Hearing. At the time and place specified in the notice, the council shall hear evidence and arguments concerning the proposal. The hearing may be continued from time to time not exceeding 60 days without further notice. A final vote on the proposal shall be taken by the council within such 60-day period. 
(f)  Preparation and filing of maps. The official map shall be prepared in sufficient detail to permit the establishment of future acquisition lines on the ground. In unplatted areas a minimum of a centerline survey shall be made prior to the preparation of the final draft of the official map. The accuracy of the future acquisition lines shown on the official map shall be attested to by a registered land surveyor. After enactment of any ordinance adopting an official map or amending or repealing a previous official map ordinance, a certified copy of the official map or section to which the ordinance relates together with an attached copy of the ordinance shall be filed with the county recorder. 
(g)  Effect. After an official map has been adopted and filed, the issuance of building permits to construct a new building or structure or expand an existing building or structure or issue a land use or zoning permit (collectively "development permit") by the city shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. The city shall deny every application for a development permit within any area designated on the official map for street or other public purposes. Whenever any street or highway is widened or improved or any new street is opened, or any interest in lands for other public purposes is acquired by the city, the city is not required in such proceedings to pay for any building or structure placed without a permit or in violation of conditions of a permit within the limits of the mapped street or outside of any building line that may have been established upon the existing street or within any area thus identified for public purposes. The adoption of an official map does not give any right, title or interest in areas identified for public purposes thereon, but the adoption of the map does authorize the city to acquire such interest without paying compensation for buildings or structures erected in such areas without a permit or in violation of the conditions of a permit. 
(h)  Appeals. Whenever a development permit is denied pursuant to this chapter, the official map board of appeals and adjustments may, upon appeal filed with it by the owner of the land, and after receiving the advice and recommendations of the planning commission, grant a development permit in an area designated on the official map for a street or other public purpose in any case in which the board finds, upon the evidence and the arguments presented to it, that the entire property of the appellant of which the area designated for public purposes forms a parcel that cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such a development permit is granted, and that balancing the interest of the city in preserving the integrity of the official map and of the comprehensive plan and the interest of the property owner in the use of his property and in the benefits of ownership, the grant of such permit is required by considerations of justice and equity. Failure of the planning commission to report on the proposal within 30 days after referral of the matter to it is deemed to be the recommendations and advice of the planning commission. The official map board of appeals and adjustments shall hold a public hearing upon the appeal after notice of the hearing has been published in the official newspaper once at least ten days before the hearing. If the board authorizes issuance of a development permit, it shall specify the exact location, ground area, height, and other details as to the extent and character of the use or building for which the development permit is granted. If the board authorizes issuance of a development permit, the council shall have six months from the date of the decision of the board to institute proceedings to acquire such land or interest therein, and if no such proceedings are started within that time, the city shall issue the development permit if the application otherwise confirms to this Code.

Sec. 117-49. - Zoning amendments. 
(a)  Purpose. The city council may adopt amendments to the zoning ordinance and zoning map in relation both to land uses within a particular district or to the location of the district lines. Such amendments shall not be issued indiscriminately, but shall only be used as a means to reflect changes in the goals and policies of the community as reflected in the plan or changes in conditions in the city.

For the purpose of giving mailed notice, the zoning administrator may use any appropriate records to determine the names and addresses of owners. The failure to give mailed notice to individual property owners, or defects in the notice, shall not invalidate the proceedings, provided a bona fide attempt to comply with this section has been made. 
(f)  Additional hearings. If, after any public hearing upon an amendment, the proposed amendment is revised or further revised to include land previously not affected by it, the planning commission shall hold another public hearing, pursuant to public notice, before proceeding to vote on the amendment.

Sec. 117-50. - Conditional rezonings. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of conditional rezoning is to formalize development standards to ensure consistency and compatibility with surrounding land uses and neighborhoods. 
(b)  Procedure. The procedure for changing zoning district boundaries (rezoning) shall be as follows: Execution of a conditional rezoning agreement (CRA) recorded with the subject property shall be compulsory for all rezonings to multiple-family commercial, and/or industrial districts, including the following: 
(1)  R-2 Medium Density Residential District.

(Code 1978, § 9.03.04; Ord. No. 73-05, 5-21-1973; Ord. No. 86-2, 8-25-1986; Ord. No. 95-02, 2-13-1995; Ord. No. 00-04, 5-22-2000; Ord. No. 03-20, 8-25-2003) 
Sec. 117-51. - Conditional use permits. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide the city with a reasonable degree of discretion in determining the suitability of certain designated uses upon the general welfare, public health, and safety. A conditional use is a use that, because of certain characteristics, cannot be properly classified as a permitted use in the zoning district within which it is proposed. Conditional use permits are designed to meet the problem which arises where certain uses, although generally compatible with the basic use classification of a particular zone, should not be permitted to be located as a matter of right in every area included within the zone because of hazards inherent in the use itself or special problems which its proposed location may represent. 
(b)  Procedure. 
(1)  Request for conditional use permits, as provided within this chapter shall be filed with the city on an official application form. Such application shall be accompanied by a fee and escrow as provided for in section 117-48. Such application shall also be accompanied by a sufficient number of copies as required by the zoning administrator of detailed written and graphic materials fully explaining the proposed change, development, or use. The request shall be considered as being officially submitted when the information requirements of this section are met. 
(2)  Proof of ownership or authorization: If the applicant is other than fee title owner, then the fee title owner must also join in the application. 
(3)  Upon the request for a conditional use permit being officially submitted, a public hearing before the planning commission shall be scheduled following proper hearing notification. 
(4)  Notice of hearing. 
a.  Notice of a hearing for a conditional use request shall consist of the following: 
1.  The address and a legal description of the parcel; 
2.  Description of request; 
3.  Time of hearing; 
4.  Place of hearing; and 
5.  Purpose of hearing. 
b.  The notice shall be published in the official newspaper at least ten days prior to the hearing and written notification of said hearing shall be mailed at least ten days prior to all parcel owners within 350 feet of the boundary of the parcel for which a conditional use is being sought. A copy of the notice and a list of the property owners and addresses to which the notice was sent shall be attested and made a part of the records of the proceeding. 
c.  For the purposes of written notification, and in the absence of more accurate information, the parcel owner of record at the county shall be used. 
d.  Failure of a property owner to receive the notice shall not invalidate any such proceedings as set forth within this section provided a good faith attempt has been made to comply with the notice requirements of this section. 
(5)  When an applicant proposes any construction or alteration that would exceed a height of 200 feet above ground level at the site, or any construction or alteration of greater height than an imaginary surface extending upward and outward at a slope of 100 feet to one inch from the nearest point of the nearest runway of a public airport, then the zoning administrator shall notify the Mn/DOT commissioner at least 30 days in advance. 
(6)  The planning commission shall conduct the hearing, report its findings and make recommendations to the council. 
(7)  The planning commission and the council shall consider possible adverse effects of the proposed conditional use. This consideration shall be based upon (but not limited to) the following factors: 
a.  The nature of the land upon which the use is to be located. 
b.  The nature of adjoining land or buildings. 
c.  The effect upon traffic into and from the premises, or to any adjoining roads. 
d.  Whether or not the use will be unduly dangerous or otherwise detrimental to persons residing or working in the vicinity of the use, or to the public welfare. 
e.  Whether or not if this use will substantially adversely impair the use, enjoyment or market value of any surrounding property. 
f.  Whether the proposed use will be harmonious with and in accordance with the specific objectives of the comprehensive plan. 
g.  Whether the proposed use will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity and whether such a use will not change the essential character of that area. 
h.  Whether the proposed use will be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring uses. 
i.  Whether the proposed use will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services, such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures, or schools; or whether the persons or agencies responsible for the establishments of the proposed use shall be able to adequately provide any such service. 
j.  Whether the proposed use will create excessive additional requirements at public cost for public facilities and services and whether it will be detrimental to the economic welfare of the community. 
k.  Whether the proposed use will involve uses, activities, processes, materials and equipment and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare, or odors. 
l.  Whether the proposed use will be consistent with the intent and purposes of this chapter. 
(8)  At any time during the consideration of the request for a conditional use permit, the council, planning commission, and/or city staff shall have the authority to request additional information from the applicant or to retain expert testimony with the consent and at the expense of the applicant, the information is to be declared necessary to establish performance conditions in relation to all pertinent sections of this chapter. Failure on the part of the applicant to supply all necessary supportive information shall be grounds for denial of the request or rejection of the application as incomplete. 
(9)  The planning commission shall make a findings of fact and recommend such actions or conditions relating to the request as it deems necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
(10)  The council shall not consider a request for a conditional use permit until it has received a report and recommendation from the planning commission. Upon completion of the report and recommendation of the planning commission, the request for a conditional use permit shall be placed on the agenda for the next regular council meeting occurring no sooner than ten days after the final action of the planning commission on the request; provided, however, that such ten-day period may be waived by the council. Such reports and recommendations shall be entered in and made part of the permanent written record of the council meeting. 
(11)  Upon receiving the report and recommendation of the planning commission, the council shall have the option to set and hold an additional public hearing if it deems necessary. 
(12)  If, upon receiving the reports and recommendations of the planning commission, the council finds that specific inconsistencies exist in the review process and thus the final recommendation of the council will differ from that of the planning commission, the council may before taking final action, refer the matter back to the planning commission for further consideration. This procedure shall be followed only one time for any one conditional use permit request. 
(13)  After receiving the reports and recommendations of the planning commission and, receiving any additional information referred to in this division, and considering the criteria listed in this division, the council shall with a majority vote take one of the following actions: 
a.  Approval. 
1.  By resolution adopt findings of fact and conclusions that support approval of the requested conditional use permit.

Sec. 117-52. - Interim use permits. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose and intent of allowing interim uses is: 
(1)  To allow a use for a limited period of time that reasonably utilizes the property where it is not reasonable to utilize it in the manner provided in the comprehensive guide; and 
(2)  To allow a use that is presently acceptable but that, with anticipated development will not be acceptable in the future. 
(b)  Application, public hearing, notice and procedure. The application, public hearing, public notice and procedure requirements for interim use permits shall be the same as those for conditional use permits as provided in section 117-51. 
(c)  Standards of issuance. 
(1)  The planning commission may recommend an interim use permit and the council may issue such interim use permits only if it finds that: 
a.  The use conforms to the zoning regulations; 
b.  The date or event that will terminate the use can be identified with certainty;

Sec. 117-53. - Variances. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for deviations from the terms of this chapter including restrictions placed on nonconformities. Variances shall only be permitted when they are in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the ordinance and when the terms of the variance are consistent with the comprehensive plan. Variances may be granted when the applicant for the variance establishes that there are practical difficulties in complying with this chapter. Practical difficulties, as used in connection with the granting of a variance, means that the property owner proposes to use the property in a reasonable manner not permitted by the zoning ordinance; the plight of the landowner is due to circumstances unique to the property not created by the landowner; and the variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. Economic considerations alone do not constitute practical difficulties. 
(b)  General provisions and standards. 
(1)  The planning commission shall serve as the board. However, any action of the board may be appealed to the council by any affected person if notice of such an appeal is received by the zoning administrator within ten days of the final action of the board. 
(2)  Review criteria. Conditions governing considerations of variance requests: 
a.  In considering all requests for a variance and in taking subsequent action, the city staff, the board and the council shall make a finding of fact that the proposed action will not: 
1.  Impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property. 
2.  Unreasonably increase the congestion in the public street. 
3.  Have the effect of allowing any uses prohibited in the applicable zoning district, permit a lesser degree of public health, safety, and general welfare protection than established by this chapter, or permit standards which are lower than those required by state law. 
4.  Increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety. 
5.  Unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the neighborhood, or in any way be contrary to the intent of this chapter. 
6.  Violate the intent and purpose of the comprehensive plan. 
7.  Violate any of the terms or conditions of subsection (b)(2)b of this section. 
b.  A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted unless it can be demonstrated that that the conditions for granting a variance under Minn. Stats. § 462.357, subd. 6(2) have been satisfied. 
c.  Application for a variance shall set forth reasons that the variance is justified in order to make reasonable use of the land, structure or building. 
d.  Should the board find that the conditions outlined in this division apply to the proposed parcel, the board may grant a variance from the terms of this chapter so as to relieve such practical difficulties to the degree considered reasonable, provided such relief may be granted without impairing the intent of this chapter. The board, in the case of variances, based upon a report and recommendation by the city staff, shall have the power to impose such conditions related to the variance regarding the location or structure, as it may deem advisable in the interest of the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
(c)  Variance procedures; processing.

Failure on the part of the applicant to supply all necessary supportive information shall be grounds for denial of the request or rejection of the application as incomplete. 
(8)  The applicant or the applicant's representative shall appear at the board public hearing in order to answer questions concerning the request for a variance. 
(9)  After receiving the reports and recommendations of the city staff and, receiving any additional information referred to in this subdivision, and considering the criteria listed in this section, the board shall with a majority vote decide whether to approve or deny a request for variance.

Such extension shall be requested in writing and filed with the city at least 30 days before the expiration of the original variance. The request for extension shall state facts showing a good faith attempt to complete or use the variance. Such petition shall be presented to the council board for decision. 
(e)  Performance security. 
(1)  Upon approval of a variance, the city shall be provided, where deemed necessary by the board, with a surety bond, cash escrow, certificate of deposit, securities, or cash deposit prior to the issuing of building permits or initiation of work on the proposed improvements or development. This security shall guarantee conformance and compliance with the conditions of the variance and the provisions of this Code. 
(2)  The security shall be in the amount equal to the city engineer's or building official's estimated costs of labor and materials for the proposed improvements or development. 
(3)  The city shall hold the security until completion of the proposed improvements or development and a certificate of occupancy indicating compliance with the provisions of the variance and this Code has been issued by the building official.

Sec. 117-57. - Nonconforming structures and uses. 
(a)  Intent. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures and uses and to specify those requirements, circumstances and conditions under which nonconforming buildings, structures and uses will be operated and maintained. This chapter establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate area for the location of uses that are allowed in that district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of these districts that nonconforming buildings, structures and uses not be allowed to continue without restriction. Furthermore, it is the intent of this section that all nonconforming uses shall be eventually brought into conformity or terminated. 
(b)  Regulations. 
(1)  Whenever a lawful nonconforming use of a structure or land or occupancy is discontinued for a continuous period of one year, any future use of said structure or lands shall be made to conform with the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, any nonconformity, including the lawful use or occupation of land or premises existing at the time of the adoption of an additional control under this chapter, may be continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance, or improvement, but not including expansion, unless it is a nonconforming use that is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater than 50 percent of its market value, and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is damaged. In this case, the city may impose reasonable conditions upon a building permit in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent property. Any subsequent use or occupancy of the land or premises shall be a conforming use or occupancy.

Sec. 117-88. - District and development area boundaries. 
    District and development area boundaries shown within the lines of roads, streams, and transportation rights-of-way shall be deemed to follow the centerlines. The vacation of roads shall not affect the location of such district or development area boundaries. When the zoning administrator cannot definitely determine the location of a district or development area boundary by such centerlines, by the scale or dimensions stated on the zoning map, or by the fact that it clearly coincides with a property line, the zoning administrator shall interpret the location of the district or development area boundary with reference to the scale of the zoning map and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this Code. When a district or development area boundary line divides a lot of record into two or more districts or into both development areas, any portion of the lot within 50 feet of such division may be used for any use of either district or development area as approved by the board. The Metropolitan Urban Service Area (MUSA) boundary line, however, defines the limits of sewered area. Any area outside of the MUSA boundary shall not be served with sewer.

Sec. 117-89. - Districts. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, the city is divided in the following zoning districts: 
(1)  R-1 Residential (MUSA-Villas). The intent of this district is to accommodate detached single-family dwelling units on suitable land within the Metropolitan Urban Service Area at a maximum net density of four units per acre. 
(2)  R-1 Residential (MUSA-Detached Single Family Homes). The intent of this district is to accommodate single-family dwelling units on suitable land within the Metropolitan Urban Service Area at a maximum net density of three units per acre or four units per acre through the use of a Planned Unit Development (PUD). 
(3)  R-1 Residential (Rural Developing). The intent of this district is to accommodate single-family dwelling units outside of the Metropolitan Urban Service Area at a maximum gross density of one unit per 2.5 acres. 
(4)  R-2 Residential. The intent of this district is to accommodate duplexes, twinhomes, attached and detached townhomes, or multifamily units at a maximum density of seven units per acre and a minimum density of four units per acre. 
(5)  R-3 Residential. The intent of this district is to accommodate townhomes or multifamily units at a maximum density of 15 units per acre and a minimum density of seven units per acre. 
(6)  B-1 Business District. The intent of this district is to provide a commercial area for goods and services for the surrounding neighborhoods and community on a smaller scale than the B-2 District. 
(7)  B-2 Highway Business District. The intent of this district is to provide for and limit the establishment of motor vehicle oriented or dependent businesses and convenience-type, high intensity commercial and service activities characteristically located along major traffic carriers. 
(8)  B-3 Business District. The purpose of this district is to provide for large-scale commercial development, including retail, entertainment, restaurant, and other complementary commercial uses. The district is intended to provide a commercial environment that is functional for both pedestrians and automobiles, complete with high-quality building design, materials, and landscaping. The district is further intended to accommodate larger-scale and more convenience-oriented commercial users than are envisioned for the Town Center zoning district located east of Armstrong Blvd. 
(9)  H-1 Highway 10 Business District. The intent of this district is to allow for uses that minimize traffic and vehicular access points, and facilitate orderly transition of the corridor while allowing property owners the ability to utilize their property for economic benefit until such time as the U.S. Highway 10 transportation system improvements are initiated. 
(10)  E-1 Employment District. The intent of this district is to accommodate general industrial activities. 
(11)  E-2 Employment District. The intent of this district is to provide for the mix of typically large volumes or bulk commercial goods and services, wholesale/warehouse activities and limited retail activities. 
(12)  MU-PUD Mixed Use Planned Unit Development. The intent of this district is to provide for a range of retail and service commercial, office, and residential uses that are organized and planned in a comprehensive manner. The MU-PUD District is created for development seeking alternative regulations that embody more traditional neighborhood design (TND) principles to promote a better integration of uses that might typically be separated and to provide for an adequate mixture of commercial and residential uses. 
(13)  PUD Planned Unit Development. The intent of this district is to provide a district which will encourage the following: Flexibility in land development, diversity in housing types and prices, efficiency in use of public infrastructure, the conservation of energy, preservation of unique land characteristics, and efficient use of land, open space, and public facilities. 
(14)  Public/Quasi-Public District. The intent of this district is to provide for public and private recreational uses, government buildings and facilities, and schools. 
(15)  Town Center. The intent of this district is to create a focal point in the community that embodies the principles of transit-oriented and mixed-use development. The town center embodies a distinctly different development pattern and is comprised of subdistricts including mixed-use core, commercial, workplace, and neighborhoods subdistricts. 
(16)  Overlay districts. The intent of overlay districts is to add additional standards and requirements to land and/or uses where the need for such additional standards and requirements is to protect the public health and safety or to preserve environmentally sensitive areas. The following overlay districts exist in the city: 
a.  Critical River Area Overlay District. The intent of this district is to protect and establish development standards for the Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area, as set forth and legally described in Minnesota State Executive Order No. 7919.

Sec. 117-109. - Uses not provided for within zoning districts. 
    Whenever in any zoning district a use is neither specifically permitted or denied, the use shall be considered prohibited. In such case, the council or the planning commission, on their own initiative or upon request, may conduct a study to determine if the use is acceptable and the determination as to conditions and standards relating to development of the use. The council, planning commission or property owner, upon receipt of the staff report shall, if appropriate, initiate an amendment to this chapter to provide for the particular use under consideration or shall find that the use is not compatible for development within the zoning district.

Sec. 117-110. - Residential development transitioning. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to require a residential development transition plan in order to promote orderly transition between residential developments. The historical platting of lands for urban and rural residential development has created character elements that are difficult to intermingle when the land use densities vary. This section provides techniques to mitigate lot size and density impacts between residential developments. 
(b)  Transitioning. The term "transitioning" for the purposes of this section is defined as the lot density change between one residential development and another. 
(c)  Transitioning options. Transitioning options are available to facilitate the best possible land use and development pattern between new residential developments with adjacent residential neighborhoods. The following is a list of transitioning techniques that may be used to create reasonable transitioning between existing residential neighborhoods and new developments. The city shall determine which options are acceptable means to provide for the transitioning. Developers that are required under this section to provide transitioning may seek guidance from the city prior to preliminary platting via a formal sketch plan review process or by informal city approved means. Transitioning options are as follows: 
(1)  Natural features. Natural features described in this subsection (c)(1) are available to be used as transitioning between existing single-family residential neighborhoods and proposed residential development with higher densities. 
a.  Existing topographical features such as hills and swales. 
b.  Wetlands, lakes, rivers, and streams. 
c.  County and state highways, or Metropolitan State Aid (MSA) collector streets. 
d.  A minimum 300-foot-wide, undeveloped, natural distance separation that will not be eligible for future development. 
(2)  Landscape buffering. Landscape buffering is a technique available for transitioning between existing single-family residential neighborhoods and proposed residential developments with higher densities that uses either existing or newly planted vegetation. 
a.  Determination of buffering attainment level. 
1.  Proposed urban development adjacent to existing urban development. This subsection applies to proposed urban residential developments that are adjacent to an existing single-family urban residential neighborhood. Matching the proposed residential development to the adjacent existing neighborhood in the following chart determines the level of buffering or "attainment" required. The numeric attainment level is matched to the level found in the chart in subsection (c)(2)b of this section. 
Transition Attainment Level Existing Adjacent Urban Use Vacant R-1 Zone Proposed Use R-1 Zone NA NA R-2 Zone NA Level 1 R-3 Zone NA Level 2 PUD Zone NA As determined necessary by the city  
2.  Proposed urban development adjacent to existing single-family rural neighborhoods. This section applies to proposed residential developments that are adjacent to existing rural residential neighborhoods. Matching the proposed use to the adjacent use in the following chart determines the level of buffering or "attainment" required. The numeric attainment level is matched to the level found in the chart in subsection (c)(2)b of this section. 
Transition Attainment Level Impacted Rural Use R-1 Zone and Central Rural Preserve Area, and Rural Preserve R-1 Zone and Rural 
Developing Proposed Use R-1 Zone Level 4 Level 3 R-2 Zone Level 4 Level 4 R-3 Zone Level 4 Level 4 PUD Zone - Transition attainment level shall be determined by correlating the overall density to the R-1, 2, or 3 Districts and then applying the corresponding attainment level. The city shall have the authority to make a determination on the proper attainment level if determined necessary.  
b.  Methods to achieve buffering attainment level. The following chart is used to determine appropriate landscape buffers when the level of attainment is determined from the charts in subsection (c)(2)a.1 and 2 of this section. 
Options to achieve attainment Level 1 Vegetative Buffer "A" Level 2 Vegetative Buffer "B" Vegetative Buffer "A" with Berm Level 3 Vegetative Buffer "C" Vegetative Buffer "B" with Berm Level 4 Vegetative Buffer "D" Vegetative Buffer "C" with Berm  
1.  Vegetative buffer yard definitions: 
(i)  Vegetative Buffer "A" - A minimum 25 feet width in common ownership with the following planting schedule per 100 feet of property boundary adjacent to an impacted use: 
A.  2 overstory trees. 
B.  2 evergreen trees. 
C.  2 understory trees. 
(ii)  Vegetative Buffer "B" - A minimum 35 feet width in common ownership with the following planting schedule per 100 feet of property boundary adjacent to an impacted use: 
A.  4 overstory trees. 
B.  4 evergreen trees. 
C.  4 understory trees. 
(iii)  Vegetative Buffer "C" - A minimum 45 feet width in common ownership with the following planting schedule per 100 feet of property boundary adjacent to an impacted use: 
A.  8 overstory trees. 
B.  8 evergreen trees. 
C.  8 understory trees. 
(iv)  Vegetative Buffer "D" - A minimum 55 feet width in common ownership with the following planting schedule per 100 feet of property boundary adjacent to an impacted use: 
A.  16 overstory trees. 
B.  16 evergreen trees. 
C.  16 understory trees. 
2.  Minimum plant sizes: 
(i)  Overstory deciduous trees: 2.5 inch caliper. 
(ii)  Coniferous trees: six feet in height. 
(iii)  Understory trees: 1.5 inch caliper. 
3.  Plant species. All trees required by this section shall be indigenous to the appropriate hardiness zones and physical characteristics of the site. 
4.  Berms. Berms shall be a maximum of six feet in height. Good quality fill suitable for berm construction and growing plant materials shall be used. Berms should be designed with aesthetic appeal by incorporating breaks and irregular groupings. 
5.  Buffers. Any of the following buffers may qualify as an acceptable method of attainment for transitioning (in whole or in part) if deemed acceptable by the city: 
(i)  Existing topographical features on vacant lands such as hills and swales; 
(ii)  Wetlands, lakes, rivers, and streams; 
(iii)  County and state highways, or Metropolitan State Aid (MSA) collector streets. 
(3)  Matching of densities. When lower density areas and higher density areas are adjacent to each other and are required to provide transitioning, the matching of densities along the perimeter of the new development properties may be used. The city, as part of the sketch plan review process, shall indicate whether the proposed subdivision must use the matching of density technique. The city shall take into account the configuration of the development lot, the configuration of adjacent lots, the density of adjacent lots, and the general land use patterns in the area. The development may be allowed to make up the density in the interior of the property whenever the matching of densities is used. However, the developer is not guaranteed to receive the full compliment of remaining units allowed under the city's zoning code. All developments using the matching of density method shall be processed as a planned unit development. 
(4)  Other alternatives. Other alternatives to transitioning can be used where agreed upon by the developer and the city.

Sec. 117-118. - The COR district. 
(a)  Intent. The primary intent of the COR district is to create a focal point in the community that embodies the principles of transit-oriented and mixed-use development. The COR district envisions a distinctly different development pattern, with a more urban structure of streets and blocks, than the suburban and rural patterns that have shaped the community to date. The COR area is comprised of a number of distinct subdistricts intended to define the type and intensity of uses, location of amenities and overall character of development. The COR district incorporates the COR development plan and development framework by reference to provide necessary building and site design features that are essential to a pedestrian environment. 
(b)  The COR subdistrict definition. The COR district consists of five subdistricts that define the type and intensity of land use. 
(1)  COR-1 mixed-use core subdistrict. The mixed-use core is intended to provide a mix of residential, retail, service, professional, community service, recreational and similar uses on every block near, and within easy walking distance of the transit station. The broadest variety and highest intensity of uses, including high density housing and lodging facilities, are encouraged near the station. Vertically-integrated mixed use projects with retail, restaurant and service uses, especially at corner locations, are strongly encouraged. This district incorporates the highest architectural and design standards to encourage pedestrian mobility and street activity. The majority of the uses within this district will rely on parking structures to accommodate the parking needs of customers and employees. In order to contribute to an active pedestrian environment, each block within the COR-1 subdistrict shall include at least two of the following uses: commercial, office, civic and/or residential use. 
(2)  COR-2 (COR-2 and 2b) commercial subdistrict. The COR-2 commercial subdistrict is designated to provide a location for retail commercial that has building and/or site designs inconsistent with the COR-1 subdistrict, including larger scale retail and other auto-oriented commercial uses. Such uses tend to benefit from direct highway access and good visibility, and may have market areas that extend beyond the community. These commercial and auto-oriented uses shall be clustered in compact identifiable areas and not present the look of typical strip suburban development. Buildings shall be designed with a pedestrian orientation and relationship to the primary street that is compatible with the adjacent COR-1 subdistrict. The COR-2 subdistrict is further defined by a COR-2b subdistrict that allows for additional flexibility in allowing larger-scale retail that is intended to anchor the development and support the mixed-uses within the development. 
(3)  COR-3 and COR-3a workplace subdistrict. The workplace area is intended to accommodate medical and technology-related office and research uses, as well as other office uses and ancillary retail and service uses designed to support serve employees and office visitors. Uses with high concentrations of employees are most desirable. The COR-3 subdistrict is further defined by a COR-3a subdistrict that allows exclusively schools. Due to the unique design and site layout needs of a school, different standards are in place in the COR-3a subdistrict than other development within the COR-3 subdistrict. 
(4)  COR-4 (COR-4a, COR-4b and COR-4c) neighborhood subdistrict. The neighborhood subdistrict is intended to include a full range of housing types, from small-lot single-family detached to high-density senior and general apartments, as well as a limited number of small-scale retail and office uses at appropriate locations (i.e., at corners). Neighborhood design incorporates many traditional single-family neighborhood features such as alleys, carriage houses (secondary units), front porches, and traditional street lighting. Neighborhoods shall be designed with suitable transitions between different housing types, and with well-integrated open space and natural amenities within walking distance of all homes. Traditional neighborhood design of streets, sidewalks and paths provide easy pedestrian mobility throughout the subdistrict. Protection of natural areas and corridors that link the natural environment to everyday life is emphasized in this area. The COR-4 subdistrict is further defined into three categories according to the residential net density: 
a.  The COR-4a subdistrict is the lowest density area in the COR-4 district allowing up to ten dwelling units per acre. 
b.  The COR-4b subdistrict is the medium density area in the COR-4 district allowing up to 15 dwelling units per acre. This area is located along higher volume roadways within the COR and along its perimeter. 
c.  The COR-4c subdistrict shall provide the highest densities in the COR-4 District requiring a minimum of 15 dwelling units per acre. This area is adjacent to the mixed-use core. 
(5)  COR-5 park and open space subdistrict. The park and open space subdistrict is intended to preserve environmental features, provide amenities and create focal points and community gathering places within easy access of all areas of the COR. 
(c)  The COR development regulations. 
(1)  Uses. Table 1 specifies permitted and conditional uses within each subdistrict of the COR district. Any use may be combined within buildings (vertically) or in separate buildings (horizontally), unless otherwise specified.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 19-05, § 2, adopted March 12, 2019, set out provisions intended for use as § 117-124. For purposes of classification, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as § 117-125. 
Secs. 117-126-117-143. - Reserved. 
Subdivision II. - Environmental Protection Overlay Districts 

Sec. 117-144. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The uncontrolled use of shorelands of the city affects the public health, safety and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution of public waters, but also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare to provide for the wise development of shorelands of public waters. The Legislature of Minnesota has delegated responsibility to the municipalities of the state to regulate the subdivision, use and development of the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, preserve the economic and natural environmental values of shorelands, and provide for the wise utilization of waters and related land resources. This responsibility is recognized by the city. 
(b)  The city council finds that the Mississippi River Corridor within the city is a unique and valuable local, state, regional and national resource. The river is an essential element in the local, regional, state and national transportation, sewer and water and recreational systems and serves important biological and ecological functions. The prevention and mitigation of irreversible damage to this resource and the preservation and enhancement of its natural, aesthetic, cultural and historic values is in furtherance of the health, safety and general welfare of the city. 
(c)  The council further finds that the Critical Area District is characterized by certain soil types, slopes and water levels that are unsuitable for development. The preservation of trees and woodlands, marshes, swamps, wetlands, drainageways and watercourses within the Critical Area District serves important ecological, recreational and aesthetic functions to the benefit of existing and future residences of the city and, therefore, is in furtherance of the health, safety and general welfare of the city. 
(d)  In addition to the Shorelands and Critical Area District, the city council finds that the wetlands are a valuable local, state, regional and national resource. The wetlands provide recreation and serve as drainage areas, important biological and ecological functions. 
(e)  It is the purpose and intent of this subdivision to prevent and mitigate irreversible damage to these natural resources and to preserve and enhance their values to the public. Development shall be so regulated so as to minimize the risk of environmental damage to these areas. By doing so, private homeowners and governmental units are protected from incurring high maintenance and capital costs resulting from the necessity to correct the deficiencies encountered as a result of inappropriate or improper development. 
(Code 1978, § 9.21.01; Ord. No. 75-08, 6-27-1975; Ord. No. 85-02, 8-12-1985; Ord. No. 86-2, 8-25-1986) 
Sec. 117-145. - Establishment of district boundaries. 
    This section shall apply to all public and private lands within the following described districts of which the critical area and the shorelands shown on the official environmental overlay map. This overlay map is adopted as a part of this Code. 
(1)  The critical area overlay district. The Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area as set forth and legally described in Minnesota State Executive Order No. 7919 as recorded in the State Register, Monday, March 12, 1979. This district hereinafter is called Critical River Area and shall be identified on the official environmental overlay map referenced in this section. 
(2)  Wetlands. 
a.  The state department of natural resources (DNR) uses the U.S. Fish and Wildlife classification system for wetlands and currently requires a permit for alteration of wetland Types 3-5 which are 2.5 acres or larger. 
b.  Wetland Types 1, 2 and 6 and wetlands as small as one acre are recognized as having importance as storm sewer ponding basins, but the DNR does not presently require permits for alteration of these areas. 
c.  In the city, there is an abundance of wetlands, some found along the edges of the streams and rivers and the others in upland depressional areas. The wetlands are not concentrated in one area, but rather scattered throughout the community. All Type 3, 4 and 5 wetlands of 2.5 acres or more as referenced in this section have been mapped by the DNR and the county and shall be identified on the official environmental map referenced in this section. A copy of the public waters/wetlands map as prepared by the county is on file at the city offices and is adopted as part of this Code. This Code shall apply to an impact area within 50 feet of all Type 3, 4, and 5 wetlands and Type 1, 2, and 6 wetlands one acre in size or larger. 
(3)  Shoreland Overlay District. 
a.  In order to guide the wise development and utilization of shorelands of protected waters for the preservation of water quality, natural characteristics, economic values and the general health, safety and welfare, certain protected waters in the city have been given a shoreland management classification. 
b.  These protected waters of the city have been classified by the commissioner of natural resources as follows: 
Natural Environment Lakes DNR I.D. # 1. Shack Eddy 2-109 2. Itasca 2-110 3. Rogers 2-104

Sec. 117-146. - Environmental permits and standards. 
(a)  Environmental permit. 
(1)  To ensure that the policies in this subdivision are properly implemented, any person undertaking development to or on any land within the overlay districts shall, prior to commencing the work, obtain an environmental permit from the city. Except as hereinafter provided in this subdivision, no person shall perform any development in the overlay districts without first having obtained an environmental permit (hereinafter called permit) from the city. Exempted from this environmental permit requirement shall be all lots within a plat of record in the county recorder's office. Outlots contained within a plat shall not be exempted from this permit requirement. 
(2)  Notwithstanding this permit exemption, development occurring on any lot, whether in a plat or not, must comply with and conform to the permit standards as outlined in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  Permit standards. The following standards shall be met when any development is undertaken within the overlay districts: 
(1)  No filling, grading, dredging, excavation or construction shall be allowed within any wetlands area; nor on lands abutting, adjoining or affecting said areas if such activity upon those adjacent areas is incompatible with city policies expressed here, in other documents and in the relevant stormwater drainage study. Development is improper and therefore prohibited which may result in loss and damage to public and private improvements through inundation by floodwaters and subsequent expensive construction of storm sewers and other public projects, in the permanent destruction of natural resources, loss of water retention facilities, open space and wildlife habitats and impairment of public and private water supplies. Minimum area requirements for building sites shall be determined in accordance with this Code, the standards of the Shoreland Overlay District and the Critical Rivers Area Overlay District. 
(2)  Filling. 
a.  A minimum amount of filling may be allowed when necessary, but in no case shall the following restrictions on total amount of filling be exceeded. Since the total amount of filling that can be permitted is limited, the city, when considering permit applications, shall consider the equal apportionment of fill opportunity to riparian landowners. 
b.  Total filling shall not cause the total natural flood storage capacity of the wetland to fall below the projected volume of runoff from the entire area wetland water shed generated by a ten-year storm. 
c.  Total filling shall not cause the total natural nutrient stripping capacity of the wetland to fall below the nutrient production of the wetland watershed shed for its projected development. 
d.  Only fill, free of chemical pollutants and organic wastes, may be used. Wetlands shall not be used for solid waste disposal. 
e.  Grading and filling in overlay district areas or any alteration of the natural topography where the slope of the land is toward a protected water or a watercourse leading to a protected water must be authorized by a permit. The permit may be granted subject to the conditions that: 
1.  The smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for as short a time as feasible. 
2.  Temporary ground cover, such as mulch, is used and permanent ground cover, such as sod, is established. 
3.  Methods to prevent erosion and trap sediment are employed. 
4.  Fill is stabilized to accepted engineering standards. 
(3)  The removal of natural vegetation shall be restricted to prevent erosion into protected waters, to consume nutrients in the soil, and to preserve aesthetics. Removal of natural vegetation in the overlay districts shall be subject to the following provisions: 
a.  Selective removal of natural vegetation is allowed, provided that sufficient vegetative cover remains to screen cars, dwellings and other structures when viewed from the water. 
b.  Clear cutting of natural vegetation is prohibited. 
c.  Natural vegetation shall be restored insofar as feasible after any construction project is completed to retard surface runoff and soil erosion. 
d.  Additional provisions. 
1.  The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to permitted uses that normally require the removal of natural vegetation. 
2.  Development shall be conducted so that the maximum number of trees are preserved by the locating of structures in existing cleared areas and natural clearing and the utilization of other site design techniques. 
3.  Grading, contouring and paving shall be performed to minimize any detrimental affect on root zone aeration and stability of existing trees. Existing trees shall be provided with a watering area equal to at least one-half the crown cover. 
4.  When trees are removed, the permittee will restore the density of trees, utilizing nursery stocks of a minimum of 13/4 inch diameter measured one foot above the ground, using species generally accepted as suitable for the purpose to that which existed before the development provided that in no case need the density exceed ten trees per acre. 
5.  Development shall not reduce the existing crown cover greater than 50 percent and shall be conducted in such a manner as to preserve the understory and prevent litter. 
6.  Trees used in reforestation or landscaping must be compatible with the local landscape and climatic conditions. 
(4)  No on-site sewage disposal systems shall be allowed which do not meet the requirements of this Code. 
(5)  No development shall be permitted on land having a slope in excess of 45 percent. All very steep slopes (18 percent and over) shall be protected. No development of slope from 12 to 18 percent shall be permitted unless the applicant can prove that the following conditions are met: 
a.  The foundation and underlying material of any material of any structure, including roads, shall be adequate for slope condition and soil type. 
b.  The applicant can demonstrate that development during and after construction can be accomplished without increasing erosion and runoff and that there is proper utilization of controls to reduce runoff to non-destructive levels. 
c.  The proposed development presents no danger of falling rock, mud, uprooted trees or other material to structures, recreational facilities, public lands and public waters down hill. 
d.  All structures other than buildings and roadway surfaces but including retaining walls shall meet the following design requirements: 
1.  Retaining walls or terrace contours shall not exceed five feet in height; 
2.  Construction shall be of natural stone, wood, or concrete; 
3.  The use of gabbions non-wood pilings, metal retaining walls and pre-cast or cast in place concrete retaining walls is specifically prohibited; and 
4.  The minimum width of terraces shall be ten feet. 
(c)  Emergency work and exemptions. 
(1)  When emergency work is performed under this subdivision, the person performing it shall report the pertinent facts relating to the work to the city engineer and zoning administrator prior to the commencement of work. The zoning administrator shall review the facts and determine whether an emergency exists and shall be written memorandum authorize the commencement of the emergency exception or deny the emergency exception, in which case no work may be commenced. A person commencing emergency work shall within ten days following the commencement of that activity, apply for the issuance of an environmental permit and on the issuance thereof may be required to perform such work as is determined to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment to the wetland occasioned by such emergency work. 
(2)  The removal of trees, seriously damaged by storms or other acts of God, or diseased trees, shall not be prohibited. 
(d)  Permit applications; required data. 
(1)  Environmental permits except where hereinafter noted, shall be issued by the council after written findings from the planning commission and city staff.

(3)  Any revision of the originally approved site plan must be approved by the council after findings by the planning commission and zoning administrator. 
(4)  A permit may be approved subject to compliance with conditions that are specifically set forth in the permit and are necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements contained in this subdivision. Such conditions may, among other matters, limit the size, kind or character of the proposed development, require the construction of other structures including special foundations and soil stabilization structures, establish required monitoring procedures, require such alterations of the site as may be necessary, require execution of an agreement between the city and the developer, require a surety in the form of a performance bond, cash escrow or letter of credit in an amount of 150 percent of the expected development costs as determined by the city engineer. Accompanying such agreement shall be a statement from the owner indicating the city's right of entry to the property if it becomes necessary to complete the agreed upon work. 
(f)  Fees. A schedule of fees for the examination and approval of site plans leading to an environmental permit and the inspection of all required improvements and conditions in such plans shall be determined by ordinance. Prior to approval of any site plan, such fees shall be paid to the zoning administrator and be deposited to the credit of the general fund. 
(g)  Effect of permit. The granting of an environmental permit under the provisions of this subdivision shall in no way affect the owner's or the permittee's responsibility to obtain the approval required by any other statute, ordinance or regulation of any federal or state agency or subdivision thereof.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 15-15, § 2, adopted November 24, 2015, repealed the former subdivision III, §§ 117-180-117-191, and enacted a new subdivision III as set out herein. The former subdivision III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code of 1978, § 9.22.01-9.22.13; Ord. No. 79-13, adopted October 29, 1979; Ord. No. 84-06, adopted September 29, 1984; Ord. No. 86-2, adopted August 25, 1986; Ord. No. 87-01, adopted October 17, 1988; Ord. No. 92-07, adopted July 13, 1992; Ord. No. 09-02, adopted February 24, 2009. 

Sec. 117-180. - Statutory authorization and purpose. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The legislature of the State of Minnesota has, in Minn. Stats. ch. 103F and ch. 462, delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council does ordain as follows. 
(b)  Purpose. 
(1)  This subdivision regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the city. These flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. It is the purpose of this Section to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions. 
(2)  National Flood Insurance Program compliance. This subdivision is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 59-78, as amended, so as to maintain the city's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(3)  This subdivision is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development. 
(Ord. No. 15-15, § 2, 11-24-2015) 
Sec. 117-181. - General provisions. 
(a)  This subdivision adopts the floodplain maps applicable to the city and includes three floodplain districts: floodway, flood fringe, and general floodplain. 
(1)  Where floodway and flood fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps, the standards in section 117-183 or 117-184 will apply, depending on the location of a property. 
(2)  Locations where floodway and flood fringe districts are not delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the general floodplain district. Within the general floodplain district, the floodway district standards in section 117-183 apply unless the floodway boundary is determined, according to the process outlined in section 117-185. Once the floodway boundary is determined, the flood fringe district standards in section 117-184 may apply outside the floodway. 
(b)  Lands to which this subdivision applies. This subdivision applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the official zoning map and/or the attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of the floodway, flood fringe, or general floodplain districts. 
(1)  The floodway, flood fringe and general floodplain districts are overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts. The standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other requirements in the underlying zoning district. In case of a conflict, the more restrictive standards will apply. 
(c)  Incorporation of maps by reference. The following maps, together with all attached material, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the official zoning map and this subdivision. The attached material includes the Flood Insurance Study for Anoka County, Minnesota, and Incorporated Areas and the flood insurance rate maps enumerated below, all dated December 16, 2015 and all prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. These materials are on file in the community development department. 
 27003C0142E  27003C0186E  27003C0144E  27003C0257E  27003C0165E  27003C0280E  27003C0166E  27003C0281E  27003C0167E  27003C0282E  27003C0170E  27003C0283E  
(d)  Regulatory flood protection elevation. The regulatory flood protection elevation (RFPE) is an elevation no lower than one foot above the elevation of the regional flood plus any increases in flood elevation caused by encroachments on the floodplain that result from designation of a floodway. 
(e)  Interpretation. The boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by scaling distances on the flood insurance rate map. 
(1)  Where a conflict exists between the floodplain limits illustrated on the official zoning map and actual field conditions, the flood elevations shall be the governing factor. The zoning administrator must interpret the boundary location based on the ground elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first National Flood Insurance Program map showing the area within the regulatory floodplain, and other available technical data. 
(2)  Persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the planning commission and to submit technical evidence. 
(f)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. It is not intended by this subdivision to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or other private agreements. However, where this subdivision imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this subdivision prevail. 
(g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. This subdivision does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This subdivision does not create liability on the part of the city or its officers or employees for any flood damages that result from reliance on this subdivision or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(h)  Severability. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this subdivision is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of law, the remainder of this subdivision shall not be affected and shall remain in full force. 
(i)  Annexations. The flood insurance rate map panels adopted by reference into section 117-181(c) above may include floodplain areas that lie outside of the corporate boundaries of the city at the time of adoption of this subdivision. If any of these floodplain land areas are annexed into the city after the date of adoption of this subdivision, the newly annexed floodplain lands will be subject to the provisions of this subdivision immediately upon the date of annexation. 
(Ord. No. 15-15, § 2, 11-24-2015) 
Sec. 117-182. - Establishment of flood zone districts. 
(a)  Districts. 
(1)  Floodway district. The floodway district includes those areas designated as floodway on the flood insurance rate map adopted in section 117-181. For lakes, wetlands and other basins (that do not have a floodway designated), the floodway district includes those areas designated as zone A or AE on the flood insurance rate map that are at or below the ordinary high water level as defined in Minn. Stats. § 103G.005, subd. 14. 
(2)  Flood fringe district. The flood fringe district includes those areas designated as floodway fringe on the flood insurance rate map adopted in section 117-181 as being within zone AE but being located outside of the floodway. For lakes, wetlands and other basins (that do not have a floodway designated), the flood fringe district includes those areas designated as zone A or AE on the flood insurance rate map panels adopted in section 117-181 that are below the 1% annual chance (100-year) flood elevation but above the ordinary high water level as defined in Minn. Stats. § 103G.005, subd. 14. 
(3)  General floodplain district. The general floodplain district includes those areas designated as zone A or zone AE without a floodway on the flood insurance rate map adopted in section 117-181, but not subject to the criteria in sections 117-182(a)(1) and (2) above. 
(b)  Compliance. Within the floodplain districts established in this subdivision, the use of any land, the use, size, type and location of structures on lots, the installation and maintenance of transportation, utility, water supply and waste treatment facilities, and the subdivision of land must comply with the terms of this subdivision and other applicable regulations. All uses not listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in sections 117-183, 117-184, and 117-185, respectively, are prohibited. In addition, a caution is provided here that: 
(1)  New and replacement manufactured homes and certain recreational vehicles are subject to the general provisions of this subdivision and specifically section 117-188. 
(2)  Modifications, additions, structural alterations, normal maintenance and repair, or repair after damage to existing nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses of structures or land are regulated by the general provisions of this subdivision and specifically section 117-190. 
(3)  All structures must be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(4)  As-built elevations for elevated or floodproofed structures must be certified by ground surveys and flood-proofing techniques must be designed and certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as specified in the general provisions of this subdivision and specifically as stated in section 117-189.

(b)  Standards for floodway permitted uses: 
(1)  The use must have a low flood damage potential. 
(2)  With the exception of the uses listed in [section] 117-183(a)(5), the use must not obstruct flood flows or increase flood elevations and must not involve structures, fill, obstructions, excavations or storage of materials or equipment. 
(3)  Any facility that will be used by employees or the general public must be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of four upon occurrence of the regional (one percent chance) flood. 
(c)  Conditional uses. The following uses may be allowed as conditional uses following the standards and procedures set forth in section 117-189(d) of this subdivision and further subject to the standards set forth in section 117-183(d), if otherwise allowed in the underlying zoning district or any applicable overlay district. 
(1)  Structures accessory to the uses listed in section 117-183(a) and the uses listed in subsections (c)(2) through (9) below. 
(2)  Extraction and storage of sand, gravel, and other materials. 
(3)  Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves, and water control structures. 
(4)  Storage yards for equipment, machinery, or materials. 
(5)  Placement of fill or construction of fences that obstruct flood flows. Farm fences, as defined in section 117-1, are permitted uses. 
(6)  Travel-ready recreational vehicles meeting the exception standards in section 117-188(b)(2). 
(7)  Levees or dikes intended to protect agricultural crops for a frequency flood event equal to or less than the ten-year frequency flood event. 
(d)  Standards for floodway conditional uses: 
(1)  All uses. A conditional use must not cause any increase in the stage of the one percent chance or regional flood or cause an increase in flood damages in the reach or reaches affected. 
(2)  Fill; storage of materials and equipment: 
a.  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
b.  Fill, dredge spoil, and other similar materials deposited or stored in the floodplain must be protected from erosion by vegetative cover, mulching, riprap or other acceptable method. Permanent sand and gravel operations and similar uses must be covered by a long-term site development plan. 
c.  Temporary placement of fill, other materials, or equipment which would cause an increase to the stage of the one percent chance or regional flood may only be allowed if the city has approved a plan that assures removal of the materials from the floodway based upon the flood warning time available. 
(3)  Accessory structures: 
a.  Accessory structures must not be designed for human habitation. 
b.  Accessory structures, if permitted, must be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of flood waters: 
1.  Whenever possible, structures must be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and 
2.  So far as practicable, structures must be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining structures. 
c.  Accessory structures must be elevated on fill or structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classifications in the Minnesota State Building Code. All floodproofed accessory structures must meet the following additional standards: 
1.  The structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement and designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls; and 
2.  Any mechanical and utility equipment in the structure must be elevated to or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or properly floodproofed. 
d.  As an alternative, an accessory structure may be internally/wet floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 floodproofing classifications in the Minnesota State Building Code, provided the accessory structure constitutes a minimal investment and does not exceed 576 square feet in size. A detached garage may only be used for parking of vehicles and limited storage. All structures must meet the following standards: 
1.  To allow for the equalization of hydrostatic pressure, there must be a minimum of two "automatic" openings in the outside walls of the structure, with a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; and 
2.  There must be openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings must be no higher than one foot above the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. Using human intervention to open a garage door prior to flooding will not satisfy this requirement for automatic openings. 
(4)  Structural works for flood control that will change the course, current or cross section of protected wetlands or public waters are subject to the provisions of Minn. Stats. § 103G.245. 
(5)  A levee, dike or floodwall constructed in the floodway must not cause an increase to the one percent chance or regional flood. The technical analysis must assume equal conveyance or storage loss on both sides of a stream. 
(6)  Floodway developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system. 
(Ord. No. 15-15, § 2, 11-24-2015) 
Sec. 117-184. - Flood fringe district (FF). 
(a)  Permitted uses. Permitted uses are those uses of land or structures allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) that comply with the standards in subsection (b) below. 
(b)  Standards for flood fringe permitted uses. 
(1)  All structures, including accessory structures, must be elevated on fill so that the lowest floor, as defined, is at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. The finished fill elevation for structures must be no lower than one foot below the regulatory flood protection elevation and the fill must extend at the same elevation at least 15 feet beyond the outside limits of the structure. 
a.  All service utilities, including ductwork, must be elevated or water-tight to prevent infiltration of floodwaters. 
b.  As an alternative to elevation on fill, an accessory structure that constitutes a minimal investment and that does not exceed 576 square feet in size may be internally floodproofed in accordance with [section] 117-183(d)(3). 
(2)  The cumulative placement of fill or similar material on a parcel must not exceed 1,000 cubic yards, unless the fill is specifically intended to elevate a structure in accordance with subsection (a) above, or if allowed as a conditional use under section 117-184(c)(3) below. 
(3)  The storage of any materials or equipment must be elevated on fill to the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(4)  The storage or processing of materials that are, in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life is prohibited. 
(5)  Fill must be properly compacted and the slopes must be properly protected by the use of riprap, vegetative cover or other acceptable method. 
(6)  All new principal structures must have vehicular access at or above an elevation not more than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation, or must have a flood warning/emergency evacuation plan acceptable to the city. 
(7)  Accessory uses such as yards, railroad tracks, and parking lots may be at an elevation lower than the regulatory flood protection elevation. However, any facilities used by employees or the general public must be designed with a flood warning system that provides adequate time for evacuation if the area is inundated to a depth and velocity such that the depth (in feet) multiplied by the velocity (in feet per second) would exceed a product of four upon occurrence of the regional (one percent chance) flood. 
(8)  Interference with normal manufacturing/industrial plant operations must be minimized, especially along streams having protracted flood durations. In considering permit applications, due consideration must be given to the needs of industries with operations that require a floodplain location. 
(9)  Flood fringe developments must not adversely affect the hydraulic capacity of the channel and adjoining floodplain of any tributary watercourse or drainage system. 
(10)  Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles must meet the standards of section 117-188. 
(c)  Conditional uses. The following uses and activities may be allowed as conditional uses, if allowed in the underlying zoning district(s) or any applicable overlay district, following the procedures in section 117-189(d). conditional uses must meet the standards in [subsections] (b)(4) through (10) above and section 117-184(d). 
(1)  Any structure that is not elevated on fill or floodproofed in accordance with section 117-184(b)(1)a. and b. 
(2)  Storage of any material or equipment below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
(3)  The cumulative placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill when the fill is not being used to elevate a structure in accordance with [subsection] (b)(1) above. 
(d)  Standards for flood fringe conditional uses. 
(1)  The standards listed in sections 117-184(b)(4) through (10) apply to all conditional uses. 
(2)  Basements, as defined in section 117-1, are subject to the following: 
a.  Residential basement construction is not allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation. 
b.  Non-residential basements may be allowed below the regulatory flood protection elevation provided the basement is structurally dry floodproofed in accordance with [section] 117-184(d)(3). 
(3)  All areas of nonresidential structures, including basements, to be placed below the regulatory flood protection elevation must be floodproofed in accordance with the structurally dry floodproofing classifications in the Minnesota State Building Code. Structurally dry floodproofing must meet the FP-1 or FP-2 floodproofing classification in the Minnesota State Building Code, which requires making the structure watertight with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures wet floodproofed to the FP-3 or FP-4 classification are not permitted. 
(4)  The placement of more than 1,000 cubic yards of fill or other similar material on a parcel (other than for the purpose of elevating a structure to the regulatory flood protection elevation) must comply with an approved erosion/sedimentation control plan. 
a.  The plan must clearly specify methods to be used to stabilize the fill on site for a flood event at a minimum of the regional (one percent chance) flood event. 
b.  The plan must be prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or other qualified individual acceptable to the city. 
c.  The plan may incorporate alternative procedures for removal of the material from the floodplain if adequate flood warning time exists. 
(5)  Storage of materials and equipment below the regulatory flood protection elevation must comply with an approved emergency plan providing for removal of such materials within the time available after a flood warning. 
(6)  Alternative elevation methods other than the use of fill may be utilized to elevate a structure's lowest floor above the regulatory flood protection elevation. These alternative methods may include the use of stilts, pilings, parallel walls, etc., or above-grade, enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages. The base or floor of an enclosed area shall be considered above-grade and not a structure's basement or lowest floor if: 
a.  The enclosed area is above-grade on at least one side of the structure. 
b.  It is designed to internally flood and is constructed with flood resistant materials. 
c.  It is used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage. The above-noted alternative elevation methods are subject to the following additional standards: 
1.  Design and certification. The structure's design and as-built condition must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as being in compliance with the general design standards of the Minnesota State Building Code and, specifically, that all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities must be at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation or be designed to prevent flood water from entering or accumulating within these components during times of flooding. 
2.  Specific standards for above-grade, enclosed areas. Above-grade, fully enclosed areas such as crawl spaces or tuck under garages must be designed to internally flood and the design plans must stipulate: 
(i)  The minimum area of openings in the walls where internal flooding is to be used as a floodproofing technique. There shall be a minimum of two openings on at least two sides of the structure and the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. The automatic openings shall have a minimum net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding unless a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that a smaller net area would suffice. The automatic openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters without any form of human intervention; and 
(ii)  That the enclosed area will be designed of flood resistant materials in accordance with the FP-3 or FP-4 classifications in the Minnesota State Building Code and shall be used solely for building access, parking of vehicles, or storage.

Sec. 117-185. - General floodplain district (GF). 
(a)  Permitted uses. 
(1)  The uses listed in [section] 117-183(a), floodway district permitted uses, are permitted uses. 
(2)  All other uses are subject to the floodway/flood fringe evaluation criteria specified in [section] 117-185(b) below. Section 117-183 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the floodway district. Section 117-184 applies if the proposed use is determined to be in the flood fringe district. 
(b)  Procedures for floodway and flood fringe determinations. 
(1)  Upon receipt of an application for a permit or other approval within the general floodplain district, the zoning administrator must obtain, review and reasonably utilize any regional flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source. 
(2)  If regional flood elevation and floodway data are not readily available, the applicant must furnish additional information, as needed, to determine the regulatory flood protection elevation and whether the proposed use would fall within the floodway or flood fringe district. Information must be consistent with accepted hydrological and hydraulic engineering standards and the standards in [section] 117-185(b)(3) below. 
(3)  The determination of floodway and flood fringe must include the following components, as applicable: 
a.  Estimate the peak discharge of the regional (one percent chance) flood. 
b.  Calculate the water surface profile of the regional flood based upon a hydraulic analysis of the stream channel and overbank areas. 
c.  Compute the floodway necessary to convey or store the regional flood without increasing flood stages more than one-half foot. A lesser stage increase than one-half foot is required if, as a result of the stage increase, increased flood damages would result. An equal degree of encroachment on both sides of the stream within the reach must be assumed in computing floodway boundaries. 
(4)  The zoning administrator will review the submitted information and assess the technical evaluation and the recommended floodway and/or flood fringe district boundary. The assessment must include the cumulative effects of previous floodway encroachments. The zoning administrator may seek technical assistance from a designated engineer or other expert person or agency, including the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, before presenting the technical evaluation and findings to the city council. The city council must formally accept the technical evaluation and the recommended floodway and/or flood fringe district boundary or deny the permit application. The city council, prior to official action, may submit the application and all supporting data and analyses to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, or the planning commission for review and comment. 
(5)  Once the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries have been determined, the city council shall refer the matter back to the zoning administrator to process the permit application consistent with the applicable provisions of sections 117-183 and 117-184. 
(Ord. No. 15-15, § 2, 11-24-2015) 
Sec. 117-186. - Subdivisions.

f.  The placement of fill, excavation of materials, or the storage of materials or equipment within the floodplain. 
g.  Relocation or alteration of a watercourse, including new or replacement culverts and bridges), unless a public waters work permit has been applied for. 
(2)  Application for permit. Permit applications must be submitted to the zoning administrator on forms provided by the zoning administrator. The permit application must include the following as applicable: 
a.  A scaled site plan showing all pertinent dimensions, existing or proposed buildings, structures, and significant natural features having an influence on the permit. 
b.  Location of fill or storage of materials in relation to the stream channel. 
c.  Copies of any required municipal, county, state or federal permits or approvals. 
d.  Other relevant information requested by the zoning administrator as necessary to properly evaluate the permit application. 
(3)  Certificate of zoning compliance for a new, altered, or nonconforming use. No building, land or structure may be occupied or used in any manner until a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued by the zoning administrator stating that the use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this subdivision. 
(4)  Certification. The applicant is required to submit certification by a registered professional engineer, registered architect, or registered land surveyor that the finished fill and building elevations were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this subdivision. Floodproofing measures must be certified by a registered professional engineer or registered architect. 
(5)  Record of first floor elevation. The zoning administrator must maintain a record of the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new structures and alterations or additions to existing structures in the floodplain. The zoning administrator must also maintain a record of the elevation to which structures and alterations or additions to structures are floodproofed. 
(6)  Notifications for watercourse alterations. Before authorizing any alteration or relocation of a river or stream, the zoning administrator must notify adjacent communities. If the applicant has applied for a permit to work in public waters pursuant to Minn. Stats. § 103G.245, this will suffice as adequate notice. A copy of the notification must also be submitted to the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA. 
(7)  Notification to FEMA when physical changes increase or decrease base flood elevations. As soon as is practicable, but not later than six months after the date such supporting information becomes available, the zoning administrator must notify the Chicago Regional Office of FEMA of the changes by submitting a copy of the relevant technical or scientific data. 
(c)  Variances.

(2)  Adherence to state floodplain management standards. A variance must not allow a use that is not allowed in that district, permit a lower degree of flood protection than the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area, or permit standards lower than those required by state law. 
(3)  Additional variance criteria. The following additional variance criteria of the Federal Emergency Management Agency must be satisfied: 
a.  Variances must not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
b.  Variances may only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
c.  Variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(4)  Flood insurance notice. The zoning administrator must notify the applicant for a variance that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and 
b.  Such construction below the base or regional flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification must be maintained with a record of all variance actions. 
(5)  General considerations. The city may consider the following factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and conditional uses in floodplains: 
a.  The potential danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments. 
b.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of others. 
c.  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems, if any, and the ability of these systems to minimize the potential for disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions. 
d.  The susceptibility of any proposed use and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
e.  The importance of the services to be provided by the proposed use to the community. 
f.  The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location. 
g.  The availability of viable alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding. 
h.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
i.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive land use plan and flood plain management program for the area. 
j.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
k.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site. 
(6)  Submittal of hearing notices to the department of natural resources (DNR). The zoning administrator must submit hearing notices for proposed variances to the DNR sufficiently in advance to provide at least ten days' notice of the hearing. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist. 
(7)  Submittal of final decisions to the DNR. A copy of all decisions granting variances must be forwarded to the DNR within ten days of such action. The notice may be sent by electronic mail or U.S. Mail to the respective DNR area hydrologist. 
(8)  Record-keeping. The zoning administrator must maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and must report such variances in an annual or biennial report to the administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program, when requested by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(d)  Conditional uses. 
(1)  Administrative review. An application for a conditional use permit under the provisions of this subdivision will be processed and reviewed in accordance with section 117-51 of the City Code. 
(2)  Factors used in decision-making. In passing upon conditional use applications, the city council will consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this subdivision, and those factors identified in section 117-189(c)(5). 
(3)  Conditions attached to conditional use permits. The city council may attach such conditions to the granting of conditional use permits as it deems necessary to fulfill the purposes of this subdivision. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Modification of waste treatment and water supply facilities. 
b.  Limitations on period of use, occupancy, and operation. 
c.  Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions.

(a)  Continuance of nonconformities. A use, structure, or occupancy of land which was lawful before the passage or amendment of this subdivision but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this subdivision may be continued subject to the following conditions. Historic structures, as defined in [section] 117-1, are subject to the provisions of sections 117-190(a)(1)-(5). 
(1)  A nonconforming use, structure, or occupancy must not be expanded, changed, enlarged, or altered in a way that increases its flood damage potential or degree of obstruction to flood flows except as provided in [section] 117-190(a)(2) below. Expansion or enlargement of uses, structures or occupancies within the floodway district is prohibited. 
(2)  Any addition or structural alteration to a nonconforming structure or nonconforming use that would result in increasing its flood damage potential must be protected to the regulatory flood protection elevation in accordance with any of the elevation on fill or floodproofing techniques (i.e., FP-1 thru FP-4 floodproofing classifications) allowable in the Minnesota State Building Code, except as further restricted in subsections 117-190(a)(3) and 117-190(a)(6) below. 
(3)  If the cost of all previous and proposed alterations and additions exceeds 50 percent of the market value of any nonconforming structure, then the entire structure must meet the standards of section 117-183 or 117-184 for new structures depending upon whether the structure is in the floodway or flood fringe district, respectively. The cost of all structural alterations and additions must include all costs such as construction materials and a reasonable cost placed on all manpower or labor. 
(4)  If any nonconforming use, or any use of a nonconforming structure, is discontinued for more than one year, any future use of the premises must conform to this subdivision. The assessor must notify the zoning administrator in writing of instances of nonconformities that have been discontinued for a period of more than one year. 
(5)  If any nonconformity is substantially damaged, as defined in section 117-1, it may not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this subdivision. The applicable provisions for establishing new uses or new structures in section 117-183 or 117-184 will apply depending upon whether the use or structure is in the floodway or flood fringe, respectively. 
(6)  Any substantial improvement, as defined in section 117-1, to a nonconforming structure requires that the existing structure and any additions must meet the requirements of section 117-183 or 117-184 for new structures, depending upon whether the structure is in the floodway or flood fringe district.

State Law reference- Shoreland management, Minn. Stats. § 103F.201 et seq.; municipal shoreland management, Minn. Stats. § 103F.221. 

Sec. 117-221. - Statutory authorization and policy. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The ordinance from which this subdivision is derived is adopted pursuant to the authorization and policies contained in Minn. Stats. ch. 103F, Minn. Rules pts. 6120.2500-6120.3900, and the planning and zoning enabling legislation in Minn. Stats. ch. 462. 
(b)  Policy. The uncontrolled use of shorelands of the city affects the public health, safety and general welfare not only by contributing to pollution of public waters, but also by impairing the local tax base. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the public health, safety and welfare to provide for the wise subdivision, use and development of shorelands of public waters. The state legislature has delegated responsibility to local governments of the state to regulate the subdivision, use and development of the shorelands of public waters and thus preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve the economic and natural environmental values of shorelands, and provide for the wise use of waters and related land resources. This responsibility is recognized by the city. 
(Code 1978, § 9.25.01; Ord. No. 04-32, 5-30-2005) 
Sec. 117-222. - General provisions and definitions. 
(a)  Jurisdiction. The provisions of this subdivision shall apply to the shorelands of the public water bodies as classified in section 117-224. Pursuant to Minn. Rules pts. 6120.2500-6120.3900, no lake, pond, or flowage less than ten acres in size in municipalities or 25 acres in size in unincorporated areas need be regulated in a local government's shoreland regulations. A body of water created by a private user where there was no previous shoreland may, at the discretion of the city council, be exempt from this subdivision. 
(b)  Compliance. The use of any shoreland of public waters; the size and shape of lots; the use, size, type and location of structures on lots; the installation and maintenance of water supply and waste treatment systems, the grading and filling of any shoreland area; the cutting of shoreland vegetation; and the subdivision of land shall be in full compliance with the terms of this subdivision and other applicable regulations. 
(Code 1978, § 9.25.02, subds. 1, 2; Ord. No. 04-32, 5-30-2005) 
Sec. 117-223. - Administration. 
(a)  Permits required. 
(1)  A building permit is required for the construction of buildings or building additions (and including such related activities as construction of decks and signs), the installation and/or alteration of sewage treatment systems, and those grading and filling activities not exempted by section 117-225(g)(2). Application for a permit shall be made to the building official on the forms provided. The application shall include the necessary information so that the building official can determine the site's suitability for the intended use and that a compliant sewage treatment system will be provided. 
(2)  A permit authorizing an addition to an existing structure shall stipulate that an identified nonconforming sewage treatment system, as defined by section 117-225(g)(7)b, shall be reconstructed or replaced in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. 
(b)  Certificate of zoning compliance. The zoning administrator shall issue a certificate of zoning compliance for each activity requiring a permit as specified in this subdivision. This certificate will specify that the use of land conforms to the requirements of this subdivision. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized by permit shall be deemed a violation of this subdivision and shall be punishable as provided in this subdivision. 
(c)  Variances. Variances may only be granted in accordance with section 117-53 and Minn. Stats. ch. 462, as applicable. In addition to the criteria established in section 117-53, the board of adjustment must also determine whether the property is used seasonally or yearround. Conditions may be imposed in the granting of a variance to ensure compliance and to protect adjacent properties and the public interest. For existing developments, the application for variance must include documentation, either through existing records or an inspection report by a licensed Minnesota Pollution Control Agency septic inspector, documenting that a conforming individual sewage treatment system is present for the intended use of the property. If a variance is issued that will have the affect of allowing additional bedroom on the property, the property owner shall be required, if necessary, to upgrade the nonconforming individual sewage treatment system in conjunction with the issuance of the variance. If the variance does not have the affect of allowing additional bedrooms, the property owner shall have a maximum of two years to upgrade the nonconforming system. A failed system determined to be an imminent public health threat must be reconstructed within 45 days, regardless of the intended use permitted by the variance. 
(d)  Notifications to the department of natural resources. 
(1)  Copies of all notices of any public hearings to consider variances, zoning amendments, subdivisions, or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls must be sent to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked at least ten days before the hearings. Notices of hearings to consider proposed subdivisions/plats must include copies of the subdivision/plat. 
(2)  A copy of approved amendments and subdivisions/plats, and final decisions granting variances or conditional uses under local shoreland management controls must be sent to the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative and postmarked within ten days of final action. When a variance is approved after the department of natural resources has formally recommended denial in the hearing record, the notification of the approved variance shall also include the board of adjustment's summary of the public record/testimony and the findings of fact which supported the issuance of the variance.

(4)  Additional special provisions. 
a.  Residential subdivisions with dwelling unit densities exceeding those in the tables in subsections (e)(2) and (3) of this section can only be allowed if designed and approved as residential planned unit developments under section 117-227. Only land above the ordinary high water level of public waters can be used to meet lot area standards, and lot width standards must be met at both the ordinary high water level and at the building line. The sewer lot area dimensions in subsection (e)(2) of this section can only be used if publicly owned sewer system service is available to the property. 
b.  Subdivisions of double, triple, and quad unit buildings on natural environment lakes must also meet the following standards: 
1.  Each building must be set back at least 200 feet from the ordinary high water level; 
2.  Each building must have common sewage treatment and water systems in one location and serve all dwelling units in the building; 
3.  Watercraft docking facilities for each lot must be centralized in one location and serve all dwelling units in the building; and 
4.  No more than 25 percent of a lake's shoreline can be in duplex, triplex, or quad developments. 
c.  One guest cottage may be allowed on lots meeting or exceeding the duplex lot area and width dimensions presented in subsections (e)(1) through (3) of this section, provided the following standards are met: 
1.  For lots exceeding the minimum lot dimensions of duplex lots, the guest cottage must be located within the smallest duplex-sized lot that could be created including the principal dwelling unit; 
2.  A guest cottage must not cover more than 700 square feet of land surface and must not exceed 15 feet in height; and 
3.  A guest cottage must be located or designed to reduce its visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks or color, assuming summer leaf-on conditions. 
d.  Lots intended as controlled accesses to public waters or as recreation areas for use by owners of nonriparian lots within subdivisions are permissible and must meet or exceed the following standards: 
1.  They must meet the width and size requirements for residential lots, and be suitable for the intended uses of controlled access lots; 
2.  If docking, mooring, or over-water storage of more than six watercraft is to be allowed at a controlled access lot, then the width of the lot (keeping the same lot depth) must be increased by the percent of the requirements for riparian residential lots for each watercraft beyond six, consistent with the following table: 
Controlled Access Lot Frontage Requirements Ratio of lake size to shore length 
(acres/mile) Required increase in frontage 
(percent) Less than 100 25 100-200 20 201-300 15 301-400 10 Greater than 400 5  
3.  They must be jointly owned by all purchasers of lots in the subdivision or by all purchasers of nonriparian lots in the subdivision who are provided riparian access rights on the access lot; and 
4.  Covenants or other equally effective legal instruments must be developed that specify which lot owners have authority to use the access lot and what activities are allowed. The activities may include watercraft launching, loading, storage, beaching, mooring, or docking. They must also include other outdoor recreational activities that do not significantly conflict with general public use of the public water or the enjoyment of normal property rights by adjacent property owners. Examples of the non-significant conflict activities include swimming, sunbathing, or picnicking. The covenants must limit the total number of vehicles allowed to be parked and the total number of watercraft allowed to be continuously moored, docked, or stored over water, and must require centralization of all common facilities and activities in the most suitable locations on the lot to minimize topographic and vegetation alterations. They must also require all parking areas, storage buildings, and other facilities to be screened by vegetation or topography as much as practical from view from the public water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. 
(f)  Placement, design, and height of structures. 
(1)  Placement of structures on lots. When more than one setback applies to a site, structures and facilities must be located to meet all setbacks. Where structures exist on the adjoining lots on both sides of a proposed building site, structure setbacks may be altered without a variance to conform to the adjoining setbacks from the ordinary high water level, provided the proposed building site is not located in a shore impact zone or in a bluff impact zone. Structures shall be located as follows: 
a.  Structure and on-site sewage system setbacks (in feet) from ordinary high water level*. 
Classes of Public Waters Structures Setbacks* Unsewered Sewered Sewage Treatment System Lakes  Natural environment 150 150 150  Recreational development 100 75 75  General development 75 50 50 Tributary streams 100 50 75  
*One water-oriented accessory structure designed in accordance with subsection (f)(2) of this section may be set back a minimum distance of ten feet from the ordinary high water level. 
b.  Additional structure setbacks. The following additional structure setbacks apply, regardless of the classification of the water body: 
Setback From: Setback 
(in feet) Top of bluff 30 Unplatted cemetery 50 Right-of-way line of federal, state, or county highway 50 Right-of-way line of town road, public street, or other roads or streets not classified 20  
c.  Bluff impact zones. Structures and accessory facilities, except stairways and landings, must not be placed within bluff impact zones. 
d.  Uses without water-oriented needs. Uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or parcels without public waters frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, must either be set back double the normal ordinary high water level setback or be substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. 
(2)  Design criteria for structures. 
a.  High water elevations. Structures must be placed in accordance with any floodplain regulations applicable to the site. Where these controls do not exist, the elevation to which the lowest floor, including basement, is placed or floodproofed must be determined as follows: 
1.  For lakes, by placing the lowest floor at a level at least three feet above the highest known water level, or three feet above the ordinary high water level, whichever is higher; 
2.  For rivers and streams, by placing the lowest floor at least three feet above the flood of record, if data are available. If data are not available, by placing the lowest floor at least three feet above the ordinary high water level, or by conducting a technical evaluation to determine effects of proposed construction upon flood stages and flood flows and to establish a flood protection elevation. Under all three approaches, technical evaluations must be done by a qualified engineer or hydrologist consistent with Minn. Rules pts. 6120.5000-6120.6200 governing the management of floodplain areas. If more than one approach is used, the highest flood protection elevation determined must be used for placing structures and other facilities; and 
3.  Water-oriented accessory structures may have the lowest floor placed lower than the elevation determined in this item if the structure is constructed of flood-resistant materials to the elevation, electrical and mechanical equipment is placed above the elevation and, if long duration flooding is anticipated, the structure is built to withstand ice action and wind-driven waves and debris. 
b.  Water-oriented accessory structures. Each lot may have one water-oriented accessory structure not meeting the normal structure setback in this subdivision if this water-oriented accessory structure complies with the following provisions: 
1.  The structure or facility must not exceed ten feet in height, exclusive of safety rails, and cannot occupy an area greater than 250 square feet. Detached decks must not exceed eight feet above grade at any point; 
2.  The setback of the structure or facility from the ordinary high water level must be at least ten feet; 
3.  The structure or facility must be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks or color, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions; 
4.  The roof may be used as a deck with safety rails, but must not be enclosed or used as a storage area; 
5.  The structure or facility must not be designed or used for human habitation and must not contain water supply or sewage treatment facilities; and 
6.  As an alternative for general development and recreational development waterbodies, water-oriented accessory structures used solely for watercraft storage, and including storage of related boating and water-oriented sporting equipment, may occupy an area up to 400 square feet provided the maximum width of the structure is 20 feet as measured parallel to the configuration of the shoreline. 
c.  Stairways, lifts, and landings. Stairways and lifts are the preferred alternative to major topographic alterations for achieving access up and down bluffs and steep slopes to shore areas. Stairways and lifts must meet the following design requirements: 
1.  Stairways and lifts must not exceed four feet in width on residential lots. Wider stairways may be used for commercial properties, public open-space recreational properties, and planned unit developments; 
2.  Landings for stairways and lifts on residential lots must not exceed 32 square feet in area. Landings larger than 32 square feet may be used for commercial properties, public open-space recreational properties, and planned unit developments; 
3.  Canopies or roofs are not allowed on stairways, lifts, or landings; 
4.  Stairways, lifts, and landings may be either constructed above the ground on posts or pilings, or placed into the ground, provided they are designed and built in a manner that ensures control of soil erosion; 
5.  Stairways, lifts, and landings must be located in the most visually inconspicuous portions of lots, as viewed from the surface of the public water assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, whenever practical; and 
6.  Facilities such as ramps, lifts, or mobility paths for physically handicapped persons are also allowed for achieving access to shore areas, provided that the dimensional and performance standards of the items in subsections (f)(2)c.1 to 5 of this section are complied with in addition to the requirements of Minn. Rules ch. 1340. 
d.  Significant historic sites. No structure may be placed on a significant historic site in a manner that affects the values of the site unless adequate information about the site has been removed and documented in a public repository. 
e.  Steep slopes. The city engineer must evaluate possible soil erosion impacts and development visibility from public waters before issuing a permit for construction of sewage treatment systems, roads, driveways, structures, or other improvements on steep slopes. When determined necessary, conditions must be attached to issued permits to prevent erosion and to preserve existing vegetation screening of structures, vehicles, and other facilities as viewed from the surface of public waters, assuming summer, leaf-on vegetation. 
(3)  Height of structures. All structures in residential districts, except churches and nonresidential agricultural structures, must not exceed 35 feet in height. 
(g)  Shoreland alterations. Alterations of vegetation and topography will be regulated to prevent erosion into public waters, fix nutrients, preserve shoreland aesthetics, preserve historic values, prevent bank slumping, and protect fish and wildlife habitat. 
(1)  Vegetation alterations. 
a.  Vegetation alteration necessary for the construction of structures and sewage treatment systems and the construction of roads and parking areas regulated by this subdivision are exempt from the vegetation alteration standards that follow. 
b.  Removal or alteration of vegetation, except for agricultural and forest management uses as regulated in this subdivision is allowed subject to the following standards: 
1.  Intensive vegetation clearing within the shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes is not allowed. Intensive vegetation clearing for forest land conversion to another use outside of these areas is allowable as a conditional use if an erosion control and sedimentation plan is developed and approved by the soil and water conservation district in which the property is located. 
2.  In shore and bluff impact zones and on steep slopes, limited clearing of trees and shrubs and cutting, pruning, and trimming of trees is allowed to provide a view to the water from the principal dwelling site and to accommodate the placement of stairways and landings, picnic areas, access paths, livestock watering areas, beach and watercraft access areas, and permitted water-oriented accessory structures or facilities, provided that: 
(i)  The screening of structures, vehicles, or other facilities as viewed from the water, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions, is not substantially reduced; 
(ii)  Along rivers, existing shading of water surfaces is preserved; and 
(iii)  The provisions of this subsection (g)(1) of this section are not applicable to the removal of trees, limbs, or branches that are dead, diseased, or pose safety hazards. 
(2)  Topographic alterations/grading and filling. 
a.  Grading and filling and excavations necessary for the construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways under validly issued construction permits for these facilities do not require the issuance of a separate grading and filling permit. However, the grading and filling standards in this subdivision must be incorporated into the issuance of permits for construction of structures, sewage treatment systems, and driveways. 
b.  Public roads and parking areas are regulated by this subdivision. 
c.  Notwithstanding subsections (g)(2)a and b of this section, a grading and filling permit will be required for: 
1.  The movement of more than ten cubic yards of material on steep slopes or within shore or bluff impact zones; and 
2.  The movement of more than 50 cubic yards of material outside of steep slopes and shore and bluff impact zones. 
d.  The following considerations and conditions must be adhered to during the issuance of construction permits, grading and filling permits, conditional use permits, variances and subdivision approvals: 
1.  Grading or filling in any type 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 wetland must be evaluated to determine how extensively the proposed activity would affect the following functional qualities of the wetland. This evaluation must also include a determination of whether the wetland alteration being proposed requires permits, reviews, or approvals by other local, state, or federal agencies such as a watershed district, the state department of natural resources, or the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The applicant will be so advised. 
(i)  Sediment and pollutant trapping and retention; 
(ii)  Storage of surface runoff to prevent or reduce flood damage; 
(iii)  Fish and wildlife habitat; 
(iv)  Recreational use; 
(v)  Shoreline or bank stabilization; and 
(vi)  Noteworthiness, including special qualities such as historic significance, critical habitat for endangered plants and animals, or others. 
2.  Alterations must be designed and conducted in a manner that ensures only the smallest amount of bare ground is exposed for the shortest time possible; 
3.  Mulches or similar materials must be used, where necessary, for temporary bare soil coverage, and a permanent vegetation cover must be established as soon as possible; 
4.  Methods to minimize soil erosion and to trap sediments before they reach any surface water feature must be used; 
5.  Altered areas must be stabilized to acceptable erosion control standards consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation districts and the United States Soil Conservation Service; 
6.  Fill or excavated material must not be placed in a manner that creates an unstable slope; 
7.  Plans to place fill or excavated material on steep slopes must be reviewed by qualified professionals for continued slope stability and must not create finished slopes of 30 percent or greater; 
8.  Fill or excavated material must not be placed in bluff impact zones; 
9.  Any alterations below the ordinary high water level of public waters must first be authorized by the commissioner under Minn. Stats. § 103G.245; 
10.  Alterations of topography must only be allowed if they are accessory to permitted or conditional uses and do not adversely affect adjacent or nearby properties; and 
11.  Placement of natural rock rip-rap, including associated grading of the shoreline and placement of a filter blanket, is permitted if the finished slope does not exceed three feet horizontal to one foot vertical, the landward extent of the rip-rap is within ten feet of the ordinary high water level, and the height of the rip-rap above the ordinary high water level does not exceed three feet. 
e.  Connections to public waters. Excavations where the intended purpose is connection to a public water, such as boat slips, canals, lagoons, and harbors, must be controlled by local shoreland controls. Permission for excavations may be given only after the commissioner has approved the proposed connection to public waters. 
(3)  Placement and design of roads, driveways, and parking areas. 
a.  Public and private roads and parking areas must be designed to take advantage of natural vegetation and topography to achieve maximum screening from view from public waters. Documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that all roads and parking areas are designed and constructed to minimize and control erosion to public waters consistent with the field office technical guides of the local soil and water conservation district, or other applicable technical materials. 
b.  Roads, driveways, and parking areas must meet structure setbacks and must not be placed within bluff and shore impact zones, when other reasonable and feasible placement alternatives exist. If no alternatives exist, they may be placed within these areas, and must be designed to minimize adverse impacts. 
c.  Public and private watercraft access ramps, approach roads, and access-related parking areas may be placed within shore impact zones provided the vegetative screening and erosion control conditions of this section are met. For private facilities, the grading and filling provisions of subsection (g)(2) of this section must be met. 
(4)  Stormwater management. The following general and specific standards shall apply: 
a.  General standards: 
1.  When possible, existing natural drainageways, wetlands, and vegetated soil surfaces must be used to convey, store, filter, and retain stormwater runoff before discharge to public waters. 
2.  Development must be planned and conducted in a manner that will minimize the extent of disturbed areas, runoff velocities, erosion potential, and reduce and delay runoff volumes. Disturbed areas must be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment on the site. 
3.  When development density, topographic features, and soil and vegetation conditions are not sufficient to adequately handle stormwater runoff using natural features and vegetation, various types of constructed facilities such as diversions, settling basins, skimming devices, dikes, waterways, and ponds may be used. Preference must be given to designs using surface drainage, vegetation, and infiltration rather than buried pipes and manmade materials and facilities. 
b.  Specific standards: 
1.  Impervious surface coverage of lots must not exceed 25 percent of the lot area. 
2.  When constructed facilities are used for stormwater management, documentation must be provided by a qualified individual that they are designed and installed consistent with the field office technical guide of the local soil and water conservation districts.

(iii)  Uses that depend on patrons arriving by watercraft may use signs and lighting to convey needed information to the public, subject to the following general standards: 
A.  No advertising signs or supporting facilities for signs may be placed in or upon public waters. Signs conveying information or safety messages may be placed in or on public waters by a public authority or under a permit issued by the county sheriff; 
B.  Signs may be placed, when necessary, within the shore impact zone if they are designed and sized to be the minimum necessary to convey needed information. They must only convey the location and name of the establishment and the general types of goods or services available. The signs must not contain other detailed information such as product brands and prices, must not be located higher than ten feet above the ground, and must not exceed 32 square feet in size. If illuminated by artificial lights, the lights must be shielded or directed to prevent illumination out across public waters; and 
C.  Other outside lighting may be located within the shore impact zone or over public waters if it is used primarily to illuminate potential safety hazards and is shielded or otherwise directed to prevent direct illumination out across public waters. This does not preclude use of navigational lights. 
2.  Uses without water-oriented needs must be located on lots or parcels without public waters frontage, or, if located on lots or parcels with public waters frontage, must either be set back double the normal ordinary high water level setback or be substantially screened from view from the water by vegetation or topography, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. 
b.  Agriculture use standards.

The lot must be combined with the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more parcels of land, each meeting the requirements of this subdivision as much as possible. 
(2)  Additions/expansions to nonconforming structures. 
a.  All additions or expansions to the outside dimensions of an existing nonconforming structure must meet the setback, height, and other requirements of this subdivision. Any deviation from these requirements must be authorized by a variance. 
b.  Deck additions may be allowed without a variance to a structure not meeting the required setback from the ordinary high water level if all of the following criteria and standards are met: 
1.  The structure existed on the date the structure setbacks were established; 
2.  A thorough evaluation of the property and structure reveals no reasonable location for a deck meeting or exceeding the existing ordinary high water level setback of the structure; 
3.  The deck encroachment toward the ordinary high water level does not exceed 15 percent of the existing setback of the structure from the ordinary high water level or does not encroach closer than 30 feet, whichever is more restrictive; and 
4.  The deck is constructed primarily of wood, and is not roofed or screened. 
(3)  Nonconforming sewage treatment systems. 
a.  A sewage treatment system not meeting the requirements of chapter 113, article II must be upgraded, at a minimum, at any time a variance of any type is required for any improvement on, or use of, the property. For the purposes of this provision, a sewage treatment system shall not be considered nonconforming if the only deficiency is the sewage treatment system's improper setback from the ordinary high water level. 
b.  The city has adopted the following by reference: Minn. Rules pts. 7080.0020, 7080.0060, 7080.0065, 7080.0110, 7080.0120, 7080.0125, 7080.0150, 7080.0160, 7080.0170, 7080.0175 7080.0176, being the sections containing the technical standards and criteria contained in the "Individual Sewage Treatment Systems Program." The city currently requires and monitors septic system pumping permits that indicate the status of each system. The city will require upgrading or replacement of any nonconforming system within a reasonable period of time, which will not exceed two years following issuance of written notification from the city to the property owner of said nonconforming system. Sewage systems installed according to all applicable local shoreland management standards adopted under Minn. Stats. §§ 103F.201-103F.221 in effect at the time of installation may be considered as conforming unless they are determined to be failing, except that systems using cesspools, leaching pits, seepage pits, or other deep disposal methods, or systems with less soil treatment area separation above groundwater than required by Minn. Rules ch. 7080 for design of on-site sewage treatment systems, shall be considered nonconforming. 
(Code 1978, § 9.25.06; Ord. No. 04-32, 5-30-2005) 
Sec. 117-227. - Planned unit developments (PUDs). 
(a)  Types of PUDs permissible. Planned unit developments (PUDs) are allowed for new projects on undeveloped land, redevelopment of previously built sites, or conversions of existing buildings and land. The land use districts in which they are an allowable use are identified in the land use district descriptions in this subdivision and the official zoning map. 
(b)  Processing of PUDs. Planned unit developments must be processed as a conditional use, except that an expansion to an existing commercial PUD involving six or less new dwelling units or sites since the adoption date of the ordinance from which this subdivision is derived is permissible as a permitted use provided the total project density does not exceed the allowable densities calculated in the project density evaluation procedures. Approval cannot occur until the environmental review process (EAW/EIS) is complete. 
(c)  Application for a PUD. The applicant for a PUD must submit the following documents prior to final action being taken on the application request: 
(1)  A site plan and/or plat for the project showing locations of property boundaries, surface water features, existing and proposed structures and other facilities, land alterations, sewage treatment and water supply systems (where public systems will not be provided), and topographic contours at ten-foot intervals or less. When a PUD is a combined commercial and residential development, the site plan and/or plat must indicate and distinguish which buildings and portions of the project are residential, commercial, or a combination of the two. 
(2)  A property owners association agreement (for residential PUDs) with mandatory membership, and all in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision. 
(3)  Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements or other instruments that: 
a.  Properly address future vegetative and topographic alterations, construction of additional buildings, beaching of watercraft, and construction of commercial buildings in residential PUDs; and 
b.  Ensure the long-term preservation and maintenance of open space in accordance with the criteria and analysis specified in this subdivision. 
(4)  When necessary, a master plan/drawing describing the project and the floor plan for all commercial structures to be occupied. 
(5)  Those additional documents as requested by the city that are necessary to explain how the PUD will be designed and will function. 
(d)  Site "suitable area" evaluation. Proposed new or expansions to existing planned unit developments must be evaluated using the following procedures and standards to determine the suitable area for the dwelling unit/dwelling site density evaluation. 
(1)  The project parcel must be divided into tiers by locating one or more lines approximately parallel to a line that identifies the ordinary high water level at the following intervals, proceeding landward: 
Shoreland Tier Dimensions Unsewered 
(feet) Sewered 
(feet) General development lakes-first tier 200 200 General development lakes-second and additional tiers 267 200 Recreational development lakes 267 267 Natural environment lakes 400 320 All river classes 300 300  
(2)  The suitable area within each tier is next calculated by excluding from the tier area all wetlands, bluffs, or land below the ordinary high water level of public waters. This suitable area and the proposed project are then subjected to either the residential or commercial planned unit development density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites. 
(e)  Residential and commercial PUD density evaluation. The procedures for determining the base density of a PUD and density increase multipliers are as follows. Allowable densities may be transferred from any tier to any other tier further from the waterbody, but must not be transferred to any other tier closer. 
(1)  Residential PUD base density evaluation. The suitable area within each tier is divided by the single residential lot size standard for lakes or, for rivers, the single residential lot width standard times the tier depth, unless the local unit of government has specified an alternative minimum lot size for rivers which shall then be used to yield a base density of dwelling units or sites for each tier. Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the residential planned unit developments are then compared with the tier, density, suitability analysis, and the design criteria contained herein. 
(2)  Commercial PUD base density evaluation. 
a.  Determine the average inside living area size of dwelling units or sites within each tier, including both existing and proposed units and sites. Computation of inside living area sizes need not include decks, patios, stoops, steps, garages, or porches and basements, unless they are habitable space. 
b.  Select the appropriate floor area ratio from the following table: 
Commercial Planned Unit Development 
Floor Area Ratios*; Public waters classes 
*Average unit 
floor area 
(sq. ft.) Sewered general development lakes; first tier on unsewered general development lakes; tributary river segments Second and additional tiers on unsewered general development lakes; recreational development lakes Natural

*For average unit floor areas less than shown, use the floor area ratios listed for 200 square feet. For areas greater than shown, use the ratios listed for 1,500 square feet. For recreational camping areas, use the ratios listed at 400 square feet. Manufactured home sites in recreational camping areas shall use a ratio equal to the size of the manufactured home, or if unknown, the ratio listed for 1,000 square feet. 
c.  Multiply the suitable area within each tier by the floor area ratio to yield total floor area for each tier allowed to be used for dwelling units or sites. 
d.  Divide the total floor area by tier computed in subsection (e)(2)c of this section by the average inside living area size determined in subsection (e)(2)a of this section. This yields a base number of dwelling units and sites for each tier. 
e.  Proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the commercial planned unit development are then compared with the tier, density and suitability analyses herein and the design criteria. 
(3)  Density increase multipliers. 
a.  Increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities previously determined are allowable if the dimensional standards are met or exceeded and the design criteria are satisfied. The allowable density increases in subsection (e)(3)b of this section will only be allowed if structure setbacks from the ordinary high water level are increased to at least 50 percent greater than the minimum setback, or the impact on the waterbody is reduced an equivalent amount through vegetative management, topography, or additional means acceptable to the local unit of government and the setback is at least 25 percent greater than the minimum setback. 
b.  Allowable dwelling unit or dwelling site density increases for residential or commercial planned unit developments: 
Density Evaluation Tiers Maximum Density Increase 
Within Each Tier 
(percent) First 50 Second 100 Third 200 Fourth 200 Fifth 200  
(4)  Maintenance and design criteria. 
a.  Maintenance and administration requirements. 
1.  Before final approval of a planned unit development, adequate provisions must be developed for preservation and maintenance in perpetuity of open spaces and for the continued existence and functioning of the development. 
2.  Open space preservation. Deed restrictions, covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and permanent means must be provided to ensure long-term preservation and maintenance of open space. The instruments must include all of the following protections: 
(i)  Commercial uses prohibited (for residential PUDs); 
(ii)  Vegetation and topographic alterations other than routine maintenance prohibited; 
(iii)  Construction of additional buildings or storage of vehicles and other materials prohibited; and 
(iv)  Uncontrolled beaching of watercraft prohibited. 
3.  Development organization and functioning. Unless an equally effective alternative community framework is established, when applicable, all residential planned unit developments must use an owners association with the following features: 
(i)  Membership must be mandatory for each dwelling unit or site purchaser and any successive purchasers; 
(ii)  Each member must pay a pro rata share of the association's expenses, and unpaid assessments can become liens on units or sites; 
(iii)  Assessments must be adjustable to accommodate changing conditions; and 
(iv)  The association must be responsible for insurance, taxes, and maintenance of all commonly owned property and facilities. 
b.  Open space requirements. Planned unit developments must contain open space meeting all of the following criteria: 
1.  At least 50 percent of the total project area must be preserved as open space; 
2.  Dwelling units or sites, road rights-of-way, or land covered by road surfaces, parking areas, or structures, except water-oriented accessory structures or facilities, are developed areas and shall not be included in the computation of minimum open space; 
3.  Open space must include areas with physical characteristics unsuitable for development in their natural state, and areas containing significant historic sites or unplatted cemeteries; 
4.  Open space may include outdoor recreational facilities for use by owners of dwelling units or sites, by guests staying in commercial dwelling units or sites, and by the general public; 
5.  Open space may include subsurface sewage treatment systems if the use of the space is restricted to avoid adverse impacts on the systems; 
6.  Open space must not include commercial facilities or uses, but may contain water-oriented accessory structures or facilities; 
7.  The appearance of open space areas, including topography, vegetation, and allowable uses, must be preserved by use of restrictive deed covenants, permanent easements, public dedication and acceptance, or other equally effective and permanent means; and 
8.  The shore impact zone, based on normal structure setbacks, must be included as open space. For residential PUDs, at least 50 percent of the shore impact zone area of existing developments or at least 70 percent of the shore impact zone area of new developments must be preserved in its natural or existing state. For commercial PUDs, at least 50 percent of the shore impact zone must be preserved in its natural state. 
c.  Erosion control and stormwater management. Erosion control and stormwater management plans must be developed and the PUD must: 
1.  Be designed, and the construction managed, to minimize the likelihood of serious erosion occurring either during or after construction. This must be accomplished by limiting the amount and length of time of bare ground exposure. Temporary ground covers, sediment entrapment facilities, vegetated buffer strips, or other appropriate techniques must be used to minimize erosion impacts on surface water features. Erosion control plans approved by a soil and water conservation district may be required if project size and site physical characteristics warrant; and 
2.  Be designed and constructed to effectively manage reasonably expected quantities and qualities of stormwater runoff. Impervious surface coverage within any tier must not exceed 25 percent of the tier area, except that for commercial PUDs 35 percent impervious surface coverage may be allowed in the first tier of general development lakes with an approved stormwater management plan and consistency with this subdivision. 
d.  Centralization and design of facilities. Centralization and design of facilities and structures must be done according to the following standards: 
1.  Planned unit developments must be connected to publicly owned water supply and sewer systems, if available. On-site water supply and sewage treatment systems must be centralized and designed and installed to meet or exceed applicable standards or rules of the state department of health and this subdivision. On-site sewage treatment systems must be located on the most suitable areas of the development, and sufficient lawn area free of limiting factors must be provided for a replacement soil treatment system for each sewage system; 
2.  Dwelling units or sites must be clustered into one or more groups and located on suitable areas of the development. They must be designed and located to meet or exceed the following dimensional standards for the relevant shoreland classification: setback from the ordinary high water level, elevation above the surface water features, and maximum height. Setbacks from the ordinary high water level must be increased in accordance with this subdivision for developments with density increases; 
3.  Shore recreation facilities, including but not limited to swimming areas, docks, and watercraft mooring areas and launching ramps, must be centralized and located in areas suitable for them. Evaluation of suitability must include consideration of land slope, water depth, vegetation, soils, depth to groundwater and bedrock, or other relevant factors. The number of spaces provided for continuous beaching, mooring, or docking of watercraft must not exceed one for each allowable dwelling unit or site in the first tier (notwithstanding existing mooring sites in an existing commercially used harbor). Launching ramp facilities, including a small dock for loading and unloading equipment, may be provided for use by occupants of dwelling units or sites located in other tiers; 
4.  Structures, parking areas, and other facilities must be treated to reduce visibility as viewed from public waters and adjacent shorelands by vegetation, topography, increased setbacks, color, or other means acceptable to the local unit of government, assuming summer, leaf-on conditions. Vegetative and topographic screening must be preserved, if existing, or may be required to be provided; 
5.  Accessory structures and facilities, except water oriented accessory structures, must meet the required principal structure setback and must be centralized; and 
6.  Water-oriented accessory structures and facilities may be allowed if they meet or exceed design standards contained in this subdivision and are centralized. 
(5)  Conversions. Local governments may allow existing resorts or other land uses and facilities to be converted to residential planned unit developments if all of the following standards are met: 
a.  Proposed conversions must be initially evaluated using the same procedures for residential planned unit developments involving all new construction. Inconsistencies between existing features of the development and these standards must be identified. 
b.  Deficiencies involving water supply and sewage treatment, structure color, impervious coverage, open space, and shore recreation facilities must be corrected as part of the conversion or as specified in the conditional use permit. 
c.  Shore and bluff impact zone deficiencies must be evaluated and reasonable improvements made as part of the conversion. These improvements must include, where applicable, the following: 
1.  Removal of extraneous buildings, docks, or other facilities that no longer need to be located in shore or bluff impact zones; 
2.  Remedial measures to correct erosion sites and improve vegetative cover and screening of buildings and other facilities as viewed from the water; and 
3.  If existing dwelling units are located in shore or bluff impact zones, conditions are attached to approvals of conversions that preclude exterior expansions in any dimension or substantial alterations. The conditions must also provide for future relocation of dwelling units, where feasible, to other locations, meeting all setback and elevation requirements when they are rebuilt or replaced. 
d.  Existing dwelling unit or dwelling site densities that exceed standards may be allowed to continue but must not be allowed to be increased, either at the time of conversion or in the future. Efforts must be made during the conversion to limit impacts of high densities by requiring seasonal use, improving vegetative screening, centralizing shore recreation facilities, installing new sewage treatment systems, or other means.

State Law reference- Wetlands, Minn. Stats. § 103G.221 et seq.; local wetland protection and management plans, Minn. Stats. § 103G.2243. 

Sec. 117-286. - Incorporation of state regulations. 
(a)  This section hereby incorporates by reference the Wetlands Conservation Act of 1991 of Minn. Stats. § 103G.221 et seq., hereinafter referred to as the WCA, and any future amendments adopted by the legislature. All wetlands and activities shall comply with those regulations as adopted under the WCA. 
(Ord. No. 16-03, § 2, 5-10-2016) 
Sec. 117-287. - Findings and intent. 
(a)  The city finds that regulating the use of lands surrounding wetlands and stormwater ponds help maintain water quality and the health of these water features. Existing vegetation adjacent to wetlands and stormwater ponds help protect their shorelines from erosion while also filtering out sediment, chemicals and other nutrients before stormwater discharges into these waters. Protecting the existing vegetation adjacent to wetlands and stormwater ponds also helps maintain pollinator friendly habitat. The intent of this subdivision is to establish and maintain a permanent setback from wetlands and stormwater ponds throughout the development, building, and landscaping phases of a project to ensure the land within this setback is left undisturbed in its natural condition. 
(Ord. No. 16-03, § 2, 5-10-2016) 
Sec. 117-288. - Purpose and implementation. 
(a)  Through the adoption and enforcement of this subdivision, the city shall promote the general health, safety, and welfare of its residents by both conserving and protecting water features of the city. The city seeks to accomplish the following purposes: 
(1)  Satisfy all requirements of the WCA of 1991, as amended. 
(2)  Satisfy requirements of the Lower Rum River Water Management Organization (LRRWMO). 
(3)  Balance the need to preserve and protect natural resources and systems with both the rights of private property owners and the need to support the efficient use of developable land within the city. 
(4)  Promote water quality by maintaining the ability to recharge ground water and receive the discharge of ground water, to retain sediment and toxicants and filter and strip nutrients from surface water runoff before it discharges into community lakes and streams, thus avoiding the contamination and eutrophication of these water features. 
(5)  Provide or maintain wildlife and pollinator friendly habitat and thereby support the maintenance of diversity of both plant and animal species within the city. 
(Ord. No. 16-03, § 2, 5-10-2016)

(2)  All fencing barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout the development and/or building construction. The fencing barriers are intended to inform the developer, builder and property owner of the permanent setback requirement and to protect the existing vegetation throughout the development process. 
(3)  All fencing barriers shall not be removed until construction and/or development has been completed. It shall be the responsibility of the builder or property owner to remove all fencing barriers once the lot has been landscaped (sod and/or seed established). 
(d)  Prohibited activities within the setback area include: 
(1)  Structures, except for approved fences, are not permitted within the setback area. No fencing shall be permitted within the wetland boundary.

(1)  The tree protection area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the dripline of the tree or group of trees collectively. 
(2)  Wherein authorized excavations it becomes necessary to expose or cut roots more than one inch in diameter, it shall be the duty of the contractor to protect such root under advice from the city. 
(3)  All open trenching is prohibited. Utility installation within the dripline of protected trees, during construction or thereafter, can only occur using trenchless methods. 
(4)  The mowing, clearing, and grubbing of brush located within or under the dripline of protected trees may be allowed, provided such mowing, clearing, or grubbing is accomplished by hand or by mowers. The use of heavy equipment for this purpose shall not be allowed. 
(f)  Removal threshold. 
(1)  Within residential developments, at least 40 percent of the inches of existing significant tree DBH shall be retained on site. 
(2)  Within business and employment developments, at least 30 percent of the inches of existing significant tree DBH shall be retained on site. 
(g)  Reforestation/restitution requirement. If a development exceeds the removal threshold specified in (f) above, the developer shall either reforest areas within the site, pay restitution, or some combination thereof. 
(1)  For every one significant tree inch that is removed in excess of the removal threshold, the developer shall replant 1.25 inches (diameter) of new trees or provide the city with $125.00 in restitution. 
(2)  Significant trees removed for water quality treatment ponds, public trails and sidewalks, and arterial and collector streets, or that are considered invasive species, are exempt from the removal threshold calculation. 
(h)  Protection from disease and pestilence. All clearing in oak stands shall be performed prior to April 15 or after July 15 of each season. Any development involving oak trees on or adjacent to the development area must submit a plan in conjunction with the preliminary plat that identifies what precautionary steps will be taken to protect the trees from oak wilt. 
(i)  Encroachment. If encroachment into a tree preservation area occurs that causes irreparable damage to a tree(s), the tree preservation plan shall be revised to compensate for the loss. Under no circumstance shall the developer be relieved of responsibility for compliance with the provisions of this division, nor shall planned revision activities prevent the city from instituting action for violation of this division.

DIVISION 6. - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 
Subdivision I. - In General 

Sec. 117-347. - Intent. 
    These performance standards are designed to encourage a high standard of development by providing assurance that neighboring land uses will be compatible. All future development in all districts shall be required to meet these standards. These standards shall also apply to existing development when stated. The zoning administrator shall enforce these standards. 
(Code 1978, § 9.11; Ord. No. 73-05, 5-21-1973) 
Sec. 117-348. - Newly erected buildings; lot grade elevations. 
(a)  Every building erected after the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be located on a lot, as defined herein and in no case shall there be more than one main building on any one lot, except as may otherwise be provided herein. 
(b)  The finished lot grade elevation of all buildings, as measured at the building, shall be a minimum of 18 inches above the centerline grade of the adjacent public roadway. All structures, whether attached to the principal structure or not, and whether open or enclosed, including porches, carports, balconies, or platforms above normal grade level, shall not project into any minimum front, side or rear yard. 
(c)  Any lot of record existing at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived may be used for the erection of a dwelling conforming to the use regulations of the district in which it is located, even though its area is less than the minimum requirements of this chapter. This provision shall not apply to lots with widths below the district minimum, meaning that all lots of record must meet district lot width minimums to qualify. 
(d)  Sanitary sewer and municipal water connections for all structures shall be stubbed in to provide for convenient hook-up to municipal waste water collection system. 
(e)  The owners of a corner lot may elect to access the principal building on either street that the lot abuts. In cases of through lots the city shall determine which street the building fronts and accesses. In cases where one of the streets is a county, state or MSA street, the lot shall access on the other street. Where any such election is manifestly contrary to the established character or welfare of the neighborhood, the permit shall be referred to the board of appeals for approval or disapproval. 
(f)  All buildings hereafter constructed in the city should be sited on their respective lots with respect to future re-subdivision as provided in article III of this chapter regarding subdivisions, as if those future lot lines were recorded at the time the building permit application is made. For the purposes of this division, on-site sewer systems are not considered part of the building. 
(g)  A vision clearance triangle shall be established at each intersection corner in order to provide adequate site distance. The vision triangle shall be formed by creating a third leg that connects the ends of two legs that are in line with the face of the existing curbs. On streets which have a stop condition the length of the leg shall be 25 feet from the nearest face of the curb on the cross street being approached and shall be 50 feet for streets without stop conditions. The vision triangle shall also apply at alleys and at commercial driveways with the leg distance of 25 feet. The vision triangle shall be three dimensional and shall extend from 30 inches to nine feet above the top of curb. Where the wording herein refers to horizontal measurement from the face of curb and no curb exists, the edge of pavement shall be used instead. Where the wording herein refers to vertical measurement from top of curb and no curb exists, the measurement shall begin six inches above the pavement. The vision clearance triangle shall contain no fence, structure, earth bank hedge, planting, wall or other sight obstruction. The following are exempted: utility poles, fire hydrants, traffic signals and signs, trees trimmed to the trunk, and plant species of open growth habit that are not planted in the form of a hedge and which are planted and trimmed as to leave an unobstructed view in all seasons. There shall be no parking allowed along the curbs within the vision triangle. Construction of new buildings or new additions to existing buildings that extend into the vision triangle shall not be permitted. Existing buildings shall not be considered an obstruction under the terms of this division. The city engineer may waive this provision where the natural contour of the ground is such that there can be no cross visibility at the intersection. Landscaping with the vision clearance triangle that is in existence prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived shall be viewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether these landscaping elements are in compliance with this division. The public works committee shall render the final decision on such determinations. 
(h)  Grading.

All exposed ground areas, including boulevards and areas not devoted to off-street parking, driveways, sidewalks and/or trails, patios or other such improvements shall be landscaped with grass, shrubs, trees and/or other ornamental landscape materials within six months of the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Also refer to individual zoning districts for specific planting requirements. 
(1)  Topsoil. In all zoning districts, a minimum of four inches of topsoil, as defined in section 117-1, shall be applied across all exposed ground areas to the edge of improved streets, sidewalks, driveways and other impervious surfaces, excluding natural areas that are left undisturbed, whenever a building permit is issued for the construction of a principal building. 
a.  The depth of topsoil at the time of inspection shall be no less than four inches. 
b.  Alternatives to the import of topsoil, such as compost or other soil amendments known to improve soil water holding capacity may be permitted, but only with the prior approval of the city engineer. 
(2)  Required ground cover. In all zoning districts except R-1, all portions of a site not covered by structures, concrete or asphalt, but excluding natural areas that are left undisturbed, shall be finished with sod and/or plantings, up to the edge of the improved street. Any alternative to the sod requirement shall require city council approval. 
a.  In the R-1 Zoning District, sod is required in all boulevards, excluding those areas devoted to sidewalks, trails and driveways. 
b.  The remainder of a yard may be established with sod, seed, natural ground cover and/or native grasses and wildflowers. Noxious weeds do not constitute allowable ground cover. 
c.  A landscape escrow, in an amount to be determined by the building official, shall be deposited for all required landscaping, including topsoil, sod and trees, which is not established at the time of issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Installation of required landscaping, including topsoil, sod (or seeding where permitted by this Code) and trees, shall be completed within six months of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, weather permitting. The city may draw upon the landscaping escrow to install landscaping if said work is not completed within six months of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.

Sec. 117-350. - Model homes, temporary real estate offices, and construction trailers/field offices. 
    This section allows for the provision of model homes, temporary real estate offices, and temporary construction trailers/field offices in new subdivisions or commercial properties without adversely affecting the character of surrounding residential neighborhoods and properties or creating a general nuisance. As these uses represent a unique temporary commercial use, special consideration must be given to the peculiar problems associated with them and special standards must be applied to ensure reasonable compatibility with their surrounding environment. All model homes, temporary real estate offices and construction trailers/field offices must comply with the following special requirements: 
(1)  All model homes and temporary real estate offices require a building permit. A site plan that indicates where the temporary structure will be located on the site shall accompany the building permit application.

The overall design, drainage, and surfacing of the temporary parking facility shall be subject to the approval of the zoning administrator. 
(5)  The model home or temporary real estate office may be permitted only until all the other lots in the subdivision have active building permits. Construction trailers/field offices may be permitted until all buildings within the project have a certificate of occupancy. 
(6)  The applicant for a model home may be required to submit a cash bond to guarantee the conversion of the model home to living space in a timely manner if alterations to the site have occurred such as the provision of paved parking, removal of lighting, and similar uses. Such conversion includes, but is not limited to, the provision of landscaping, turf restoration and the removal of parking lots, signage and lighting. 
(7)  At no time may a model home, temporary real estate office, or construction trailer/field office be used as a residence. 
(8)  No residential certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a model home until such time as the structure has been fully converted to a residence. Such conversion shall include but not be limited to parking lot restoration and the removal of signage and lighting.

Sec. 117-351. - Home occupations. 
    Home occupations shall be allowed to exist in the residential zoning districts in accordance with certain criteria established to protect the peace, quiet, and domestic tranquility in all residential neighborhoods within the city, and in order to guarantee all residents freedom from excessive noise, excessive traffic, nuisance, fire hazard and other possible effects of said home occupation uses. It is the intent of this section that the property owner shall have a vested interest in the business, as the city does not desire to create business incubators for lease within the residential districts. Applications for a home occupation permit shall be processed administratively by the zoning administrator; or when circumstances necessitate, in accordance with the processing procedure established for conditional use permits in section 117-51. Home occupation permits may be suspended or revoked pursuant to the procedure established in section 117-51. 
(1)  Requirements. Home occupations that operate under the following parameters shall be exempt from a permit. If a home occupation operates beyond the conditions below or if the home occupation creates conditions described in subsection (2), a permit shall be required.

i.  The home occupation shall not generate excessive vehicular traffic (customers, employees, deliveries, etc.) in the residential neighborhood. Excessive vehicular traffic for purposes of this section is defined as in excess of any combination of eight round-trip customer/client visits and/or deliveries per standard eight hour day and no more than one on the premises at any given time. For the purposes of this section, one customer/client visit shall be considered to include any number of persons arriving in a single vehicle. One round-trip visit per eligible employee shall also be allowed and is not counted toward the customer/client visits. An increase at a rate of 25 percent is permitted if the subject property has access from a county, state, or MSA street. 
j.  The home occupation does not serve as headquarters or as a dispatch center where employees come to the site and are then dispatched to other locations. 
k.  The receipt or shipment of deliveries shall be limited to those made by the USPS and/or an express shipping service that is characteristic of service to a residential neighborhood. 
l.  The home occupation shall not constitute a fire hazard to neighboring residences, or a nuisance to neighbors because of excessive traffic, light glare, noise, odors, vibration or other circumstances, as determined by the fire marshal or zoning administrator. 
m.  The home occupation shall not include operations relating to internal combustion engines, body shops, ammunition manufacturing, motor vehicle repairs or sale, or any other objectionable uses as determined by the zoning administrator. 
n.  The home occupation shall not change the fire rating of a structure nor require exterior alterations or modifications that change the residential character or appearance of the dwelling unit or accessory building to a commercial nature. 
(2)  Administrative home occupation permit required. Home occupations that include one or more of the following practices or operational methods shall require a home occupation permit that is subject to the review and approval of the zoning administrator. 
a.  The home occupation employs persons, which includes but is not limited to co-owners, partners, and employees), that do not live in the dwelling unit on the property but conduct work on the property. 
1.  The owner of a home occupation on a parcel less than three acres in size may employ a maximum of one person that does not reside in the dwelling unit on the property but does conduct work on the property. The owner of a home occupation on a parcel three acres or greater in size may employ a maximum of three persons that do not reside in the dwelling unit on the property but do conduct work on the property. 
2.  Off-street parking for the dwelling unit occupants and any nonresident employees is provided in accordance with section 117-355. 
b.  The home occupation involves operating methods that include transactions with the public (customers, clients, consultants, subcontractors, etc.) on the site of the home occupation. The number of persons permitted on the site at any given time shall be limited so as not to create a parking demand in excess of that which can be accommodated on driveway on the site of the home occupation. 
c.  Retail sales are conducted on the site. Retail sales at the site shall be limited to products that are ancillary to the home occupation and shall be displayed or stored indoors. 
(3)  Conditional use. Home occupations that propose to operate beyond the scope of the parameters in subsection (1) and/or (2) of this section shall be processed in accordance with the procedures established for conditional use permits in section 117-51, with the exception of recording the home occupation permit should it be approved by city council. 
(4)  Nuisance prevention. In order to guarantee that a home occupation, once authorized, will not become a nuisance to the neighbors or otherwise violate these guidelines, the city staff or city council may impose reasonable conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of residents of the city. 
(5)  Inspections. There may be one or more inspections each year by the zoning administrator or his designee of any property covered by a home occupation permit. In addition, the zoning administrator and/or his designee, shall have the right at any time, upon reasonable request, 48 hours' notice shall be considered reasonable, to enter and inspect the premises covered by said permit for safety and compliance purposes. 
(6)  Term of home occupation permits. Home occupation permits granted by this section shall be temporary in nature and shall be granted to a designated person who resides in the dwelling unit on the subject property. Permits are not transferable from person to person or from address to address, unless the transfer is in accordance with the provisions of subsection (7) of this section. 
(7)  Death or move of permit holder; suspension or revocation; businesses existing before adoption of article provisions. 
a.  Should a home occupation permit holder die or move to a new location, the existing permit shall be automatically terminated. Except that in the case of death, should a surviving spouse or child, residing at the same address or receiving title to the property desire to continue the home occupation, written notice to that effect shall be given to the zoning administrator and the council may authorize continuation of that permit without further hearing. 
b.  A home occupation permit, once granted, may be suspended or revoked prior to its original revocation date by the council for cause after hearing before the council. Citizen complaints seeking the revocation of such permit shall be filed with the zoning administrator. All such revocation hearings, publication, and notice requirements shall be the same as for conditional use permits in accordance with section 117-51. 
c.  Persons conducting a business from property zoned for residential use on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be required to obtain a home occupation permit as required herein. The business may continue pending final determination of the application. Should the zoning administrator or council deny the application for a home occupation permit the use shall immediately cease at such residential premises.

(2)  All off-street parking spaces shall have access off driveways and not directly off the public street unless otherwise approved by city council. 
(3)  Required parking facilities serving two or more uses may be located on the same lot or in the same structure, provided that the total number of parking spaces furnished shall not be less than the sum of separate requirements for each use. The council may approve the joint use of parking facilities by the following uses or activities under the following conditions: 
a.  For the purposes of this section, the following uses are considered as daytime uses: banks, business offices, or wholesale or similar uses. 
b.  The following are to be considered as nighttime or Sunday uses: auditoriums incidental to a public or parochial school, churches, bowling alleys, dance halls, theaters, retail stores, personal service shops, bars or restaurants. 
c.  Up to 50 percent of the parking facilities required for nighttime uses may be supplied by the off-street parking facilities provided by daytime uses and vice versa. 
d.  Conditions required for joint use: the proposed joint parking space is within 500 feet of the use it will serve; the applicant shall show that there is no substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the two buildings or uses for which joint use of off-street parking facilities is proposed. 
e.  A properly drawn legal instrument executed by the parties concerned for joint use of off-street parking facilities shall be filed with the zoning administrator, which shall run with the land and be recorded with the county recorder's office. 
(b)  Off-street parking spaces required. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the specifications in this Code in any district whenever any new use is established or existing use is enlarged. Screening as described in this section may be required where it is necessary to protect the aesthetic characteristics of residential neighborhoods (one space equals 300 square feet). When application of these regulations results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded. Fractions over one-half shall count as one additional space. 
Use Parking Space Required Bowling alleys Five spaces per lane. Offices One space for each 300 square feet offices (excluding medical/dental of floor space). Clubs, lodginghouses One space for each 100 square feet of floor area. Churches, theaters One space for each three seats auditoriums, mortuaries or for each five feet of pew and other places of length assembly. Convenience store, with and without gas sales One space for each 250 square feet of floor space. Parking at each service pump qualifies as a parking space for calculation purposes. Drive-ins At least 15 spaces for those serving food and refreshments and at least 10 spaces for all others. Hospitals One space for each four beds and an additional space for each employee. Industrial One space for each 1000 square feet of floor space. Office warehouse The minimum number of spaces shall be calculated by using parking space standards for office and industrial uses as applied to the corresponding floor space. Medical/dental clinics Three spaces per doctor/dentist. Overnight lodging facilities One space for each unit and one space for each employee. Outdoor sales and open Merchandise displays in open-sales sales lots and in outdoor sales premises shall have a minimum setback of 20 feet from the front property line and shall provide one parking space for each 800 square feet of merchandise area; except that, for auto sales lots, there shall be one parking space for each 10 autos displayed. Retail shopping One space for each 200 square feet of floor space for retail uses under 20,000 square feet.

Stall Width Stall Depth Aisle Width 90 degree 9 feet 18 feet 24 feet 60 degree 9 feet 17 feet 17 feet 45 degree 9 feet 19 feet 11 feet  
(d)  Surfacing requirements for Highway 10 interim areas. 
(1)  Purpose. The city council desires to acknowledge the impacts of Highway 10 improvements that will convert this corridor to a freeway status while still providing fair and equitable enforcement of City Code standards for those areas not impacted by future Highway 10 improvements. This conversion will eliminate private accesses, require the acquisition of private parcels, and will include the construction of grade-separated interchanges. With that in mind, this section provides an exemption to surfacing standards as directed below to reduce the burden of costly improvements that will be eliminated in the near term. Consistent with guidance provided by Minn. Stats. ch. 462, the city establishes a process for allowing alternative surfacing for parking, maneuvering, storage, and display areas through the issuance of an interim use permit. The city finds that these alternative surfaces are currently acceptable, but will not be acceptable when Highway 10 is converted to freeway status. 
(2)  Area defined. This section shall apply to the following areas only (collectively the "impact area"): 
a.  Property located within the Highway 10 Official Map Area (as on file with the Anoka County Recorder)/H-1 Highway 10 Business District. 
b.  Parcels identified in the preferred alignment for Armstrong Boulevard Interchange as shown on the document titled 'Environmental Assessment: US Highway 10 Interchange with Anoka County State Aid Highway 83 (Armstrong Boulevard)' dated August 2012. 
c.  Parcels identified in the preferred alignment for Ramsey Boulevard Interchange and Sunfish Lake Boulevard Interchange as shown on the official Environmental Assessment. 
(3)  Standards. 
a.  Incorporation of other City Code standards. Notwithstanding other sections of this chapter, these surfacing exemptions shall apply to surfacing requirements for concrete or bituminous with concrete curb and gutter. All other provisions related to off-street parking, outside storage, and outdoor display of goods for sale shall apply. 
b.  Alternative surfaces. In addition to permitted surfacing of the underlying zoning district, parcels located in the impact area may utilize class V gravel, recycled concrete, or recycled bituminous (asphalt), subject to the standards of this section, and requiring the issuance of an interim use permit (IUP). 
c.  Expansion of existing areas only. Alternative surfaces may be considered for parking lot expansion for existing parking lots only. Primary parking for employees and customers must be in accordance with the underlying zoning district. Alternate surfaces may not be used for customer and employee parking. Any alternative surface area may not exceed 150 percent the size of the primary surface area consisting of concrete or bituminous. 
d.  Separation from stormwater ponds. The use of alternative surface materials may present potential degradation of stormwater areas due to sediment deposits. Alternative surfaces must maintain a minimum setback of five feet from the edge of stormwater ponds as directed by the city engineer. 
e.  Setbacks. The edge of the parking/storage area must maintain a minimum setback of 20 feet from rights of way. 
f.  Screening. Alternative surfaces must be completely screened from view at ground level from public rights of way and adjacent properties, consistent with exterior materials standards of the underlying zoning district and/or 100 percent opaque fencing. The city encourages planting of vegetation to enhance screening and improve aesthetics. The city reserves the right to require additional vegetative screening as a reasonable condition of approval if it determines that it is necessary to protect the intent of this section for site specific conditions. 
g.  Acceptable uses . The use of the property must be in accordance with permitted, conditional, and accessory uses of the underlying zoning district. 
h.  Motor vehicles. The storage of motor vehicles and equipment must be in accordance with City Code sections 117-355 and 117-356 (off-street parking). The storage of inoperable vehicles or equipment is not acceptable. 
(4)  Process. Requests for the use of alternative surfaces in the impact area shall be processed in accordance with City Code section 117-52 (interim uses).

No waste products or process residue, including untreated washwater, shall be deposited in any lake, or natural drainage system, except that lakes or ponds wholly contained within the extraction site may be so utilized. 
(10)  Top soil preservation. All top soil shall be retained at the work site until complete rehabilitation of the work site has taken place according to the rehabilitation plan. 
(11)  Designated haul routes shall be maintained by the operator in accordance with state department of transportation's Specification 2051.4 as found in the state department of transportation Standard Specifications for Construction, 1983 Edition. 
(h)  Dangerous operations. The operators shall change, alter or modify immediately any excavation or operation therein deemed by the council to be unsanitary or dangerous or polluted or contrary to the general health and welfare of the community. 
(i)  Designation of haul roads and traffic law compliance. Material of the kinds and for the purposes described herein shall not be hauled from any source until the haul road from that source has been officially designated as a haul road and all materials hauled from the source shall be hauled over that road. 
(1)  The operator shall select a haul road over which it is proposed to haul the materials, as previously described, and notify the city engineer as to the road so selected. Within 15 calendar days after being notified of the haul road selection, the city engineer will, if the road so selected is a practicable route, approve that road as a designated haul road. 
(2)  After a haul road has been officially designated, the operator may select a different road for official designation under the same conditions as previously stated. However, any changes made in haul road designation shall not relieve the operator of their obligation of restoring the previously designated haul road if any of the above-described materials were hauled over that road. 
(3)  While hauling operations are in progress, the operator shall maintain the haul road in a condition satisfactory to the city engineer. This work shall include application of water, bituminous material, or calcium chloride to the road surface as may be necessary to alleviate dust nuisance and eliminate traffic hazards. This work shall also include the removal of spillage of any material on the haul road. 
(4)  When hauling operations over any haul road are completed, the operator shall (at their option): 
a.  Restore that haul road to a condition at least equal to that which existed at the time the hauling operations were started; or 
b.  Compensate the local road authority in an amount satisfactory to that road authority and concurred in by the city engineer for the restoration of that haul road by the city. 
(5)  The fact that other traffic has used the haul road concurrently with the hauling of the above-described materials shall not relieve the operator of their obligation to maintain and restore the haul road as above provided. 
(6)  The city engineer's determination as to the kind and amount of maintenance and restoration work required to restore the haul road to a condition equal to that which existed at the time the hauling operations were started shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
(7)  When hauling over any designated haul road has been completed and the operator has restored that road or has compensated for that restoration as required, the city engineer will accept such restoration or concur in such financial settlement for the restoration of the haul road (as the case may be) in writing, and such acceptance will relieve the operator of any additional obligation in connection with the restoration of that road. 
(8)  If the operator fails or refuses to perform haul road restoration or to make satisfactory financial settlement for such restoration as required within the period specified in a written notice by the city engineer, the city will cause the restoration work to be done and require reimbursement therefor from the operator's surety. 
(9)  Operators shall obey all state, county and municipal road limits and other applicable traffic regulations in hauling to and from the work site. Operators shall also restrict trucks hauling to and from the work site to the use of those public highways designated by the permit. 
(j)  Site restoration. All grading, mining and filling sites shall be restored immediately after operations cease. Restoration shall be complete within 60 days of the cessation of operations. The following standards shall apply to restoration: 
(1)  The peaks and depressions of the work site shall be graded and backfilled to a surface which will result in a gently rolling topography in substantial conformity to the land area immediately surrounding the work site and which will minimize erosion due to rainfall. No finished slope shall exceed 12 percent in grade. 
(2)  Restoration shall begin after the grading, mining and/or filling of 25 percent of the total area to be mined or five acres, whichever is less. Once these areas have been graded, mined or filled, they shall be sloped and seeded as per the restoration plan. 
(3)  Restored areas shall be surfaced with a soil of a quality at least equal to the topsoil of land areas immediately surrounding the work site, and to a depth of at least six inches. The topsoil shall be seeded, sodded, or planted with grasses. Trees and shrubs may also be planted but not as a substitute for grasses. Such planting shall adequately retard soil erosion. 
(4)  The finished grade shall be such that it will not adversely affect the surrounding land or future development of the work site and shall be consistent with the end use plan. 
(5)  Within 30 days after the deposit of approved fill materials, the filled area shall be covered with a minimum of six inches clean fill, and the depth of the fill shall be controlled to blend with the surrounding ground conditions. 
(k)  Existing operations. Existing grading, mining and filling operations shall comply with these provisions within 180 days following the effective date of the ordinance from which this subsection is derived. 
(Code 1978, § 9.11.12; Ord. No. 87-9, 1-11-1988; Ord. No. 97-15, 12-1-1997; Ord. No. 01-15, 7-30-2001; Ord. No. 03-30, 9-15-2003) 
Sec. 117-360. - Adult uses. 
(a)  Purpose. The nature of adult uses is such that they are recognized as having adverse secondary characteristics, particularly when they are accessible to minors and located near residential property or related residential uses such as schools, day care centers, libraries or parks. Furthermore, the concentration of adult uses has an adverse effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas. The nature of adult uses requires that they not be allowed within certain zoning districts, or within minimum distances from each other or residential uses. Special regulation of adult uses is necessary to ensure that the adverse secondary effects would not contribute or enhance criminal activity in the area of such uses nor will it contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding property and lessening of its value. 
(b)  Generally. Adult uses as defined in this chapter shall be subject to the following general provisions: 
(1)  Activities classified as obscene are not permitted and are prohibited. 
(2)  Adult uses, either principal or accessory, shall be prohibited from locating in any building that is also utilized for residential purposes. 
(3)  Adult uses, either principal or accessory, shall be prohibited from locating in any place that is also used to dispense or consume alcoholic beverages. 
(4)  An adult use that does not qualify as an accessory use pursuant to subsection (d)(1) of this section, shall be classified as an adult use - principal. 
(c)  Adult uses - principal. 
(1)  Adult use - principal shall be located at least 1,000 radial feet, as measured in a straight line from the closest point of the property line of the building upon which the adult use - principal is located to the property line of: 
a.  Residentially zoned property; 
b.  A licensed day care center; 
c.  A public or private educational facility classified as an elementary, junior high or senior high; 
d.  A public library; 
e.  A public park; 
f.  Another adult use - principal; 
g.  An on-sale liquor establishment; or 
h.  Any church or church related organization. 
(2)  No adult use - principal shall be located in the same building or upon the same property as another adult use - principal. This limitation does not apply to any business or establishment that contains more than one adult use - principal as of December 16, 1990; any such business or establishment that is required to terminate its location pursuant to this section is not prohibited from operating the same adult uses - principal that were in existence as of December 16, 1990, at any new location in the city where adult uses - principal are otherwise lawful under this Code. 
(3)  Adult use - principal shall adhere to the following signing regulations. 
a.  Sign messages shall be generic in nature and shall only identify the type of business that is being conducted. 
b.  Sign messages shall not contain material classified as advertising. 
c.  Signs shall comply with the requirements of size and number for the district in which they are located. 
(4)  Adult use - principal shall be limited to 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight for its hours of operation. A differing time schedule may be approved by the zoning administrator, subject to council appeal, if it can be satisfactorily demonstrated by the operator to the city that extended operational hours will: 
a.  Not adversely impact or affect uses or activities within 1,000 feet. 
b.  Will not result in increased policing and related service calls. 
c.  Is critical to the operation of the business. 
(d)  Adult uses - accessory. 
(1)  Adult use - accessory shall: 
a.  Comprise no more than ten percent of the floor area of the establishment in which it is located. 
b.  Comprise no more than 20 percent of the gross receipts of the entire business operation. 
c.  Not involve or include any activity except the sale or rental of merchandise. 
(2)  Adult use - accessory shall be restricted from and prohibit access to minors by the physical separation of such items from areas of general public access: 
a.  Movie rentals. Display areas shall be restricted from general view and shall be located within a separate room, the access of which is in clear view and under the control of the persons responsible for the operation. 
b.  Magazines. Publications classified or qualifying as adult uses shall not be physically accessible to minors and shall be covered with a wrapper or other means to prevent display of any material other than the publication title. 
c.  Other use. Adult uses - accessory not specifically cited shall comply with the intent of this section subject to the approval of the zoning administrator. 
(3)  Adult use - accessory shall be prohibited from both internal and external advertising and signing of adult materials and products. 
(e)  Nonconforming adult use - principal or accessory. Adult uses which are classified as legal nonconforming uses may continue in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, except that any such nonconforming use shall be terminated and become illegal on and after January 31, 1992. To the extent possible, the city shall attempt to identify all such uses which become classified as nonconforming under the provisions of this subdivision and shall notify the property owners and operators of such uses in writing of the change in status and the terms and conditions which apply. The owner of any property on which an adult use is located may apply to the council for an extension of the termination date. Any such application shall be in writing and be received by the city no later than December 31, 1991. Failure to submit a timely extension application shall constitute a waiver of the right to request an extension. The council may grant such an extension if upon the council's determination, the applicant demonstrates that the amortization period is an unreasonable burden upon the business and does not allow adequate time to recover a reasonable return upon the business investment. The applicant shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate hardship with the established termination date and also the time required for an extension. In making its decision, the council may consider any factor relevant to the issue, including but not limited to: 
(1)  The degree or magnitude of threat to the public health, safety and general welfare posed by the secondary impacts of the operation. 
(2)  The length of time that the adult use has been operating. 
(3)  The ease by which the property could be converted to a conforming use. 
(4)  The nature and character of the surrounding neighborhood. 
(5)  The value and condition of the improvements on the property. 
(6)  The amount of the applicant's investment in the business. 
(7)  The amount of investment already realized. 
(8)  The cost of relocating the adult use.

(a)  All development disturbing one acre or more must provide water quality treatment and runoff rate control for all stormwater. 
(1)  Water quality treatment. 
a.  Water quality treatment shall consist of a stormwater basin (dead storage) below the normal outlet greater than or equal to the runoff from a two and one-half-inch storm over the entire contributing drainage area, assuming full development. 
1.  The stormwater basin shall have an annual removal efficiency of 60 percent total phosphorous and 90 percent total suspended solids. 
2.  The average depth of a stormwater basin shall be greater than three feet. 
3.  Skimmers shall be incorporated in the design of the outlet. 
b.  Peak flow control shall be provided for the two-, ten- and 100-year storm peak discharges and post development rates shall not exceed pre-development rates. 
c.  Stormwater basins shall be designed using an SCS Type 2 100-year return 24-hour storm, 5.9-inch event. 
(2)  Volume control. 
a.  A volume equal to one inch of runoff from all impervious surfaces shall be infiltrated on site. Infiltration or evaporation from a stormwater basin may not be counted toward this requirement. 
1.  Infiltration basing construction must follow the MN Stormwater Manual Chapter 12-INF, Vol. 2, or future updates. 
b.  Alternatives will be considered where infiltration may not be achieved on site. 
c.  The Lower Rum River Watershed Management Organization (LRRWMO), of which the city is a member, has established a stormwater impact fund for projects that cannot meet the volume reduction requirements. The LRRWMO has also established a volume bank of available runoff retention volume credits. A sequencing process is outlined in the LRRWMO Third Generation Plan for utilizing the volume bank or paying into the stormwater impact fund.

Sec. 117-387. - The stormwater pollution control plan and the grading plan. 
    The stormwater pollution control plan's measures, the limit of disturbed surface and the location of buffer areas shall be marked on the approved grading plan, and identified with flags, stakes, signs, etc., on the development site before work begins. 
(Code 1978, § 9.27.06; Ord. No. 06-32, § 1, 11-28-2006) 
Sec. 117-388. - Inspections of the stormwater pollution control plan measures. 
    At a minimum such inspections shall be done weekly and after every storm event that is large enough to result in runoff from the site by either the city, developer or the developer's designated representative. 
(1)  Maintenance is required as follows: 
a.  When sediment reaches one-third the height of the BMP on perimeter control devices, sediment must be removed within 24 hours. 
b.  If the perimeter control device is not functional it must be repaired or replaced within 24 hours. 
c.  Temporary sediment basins shall be maintained when sediment reaches one-half the outlet height or one-half the basin storage volume. Basin must be drained or sediment removed within 72 hours. 
d.  Construction site vehicle entrance and exit locations sediment must be removed from paved surfaces within three hours of notification by city. 
(Code 1978, § 9.27.07; Ord. No. 06-32, § 1, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 14-09, § 2, 9-23-2014) 
Sec. 117-389. - Minimum requirements of the stormwater pollution control plan. 
    The minimum requirements of the stormwater pollution control plan shall be as follows:

(11)  Training documentation: The knowledgeable person(s) named in the SWPPP shall be trained in accordance with the current general construction stormwater permit requirements. 
(Code 1978, § 9.27.08; Ord. No. 06-32, § 1, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 14-09, § 2, 9-23-2014) 
Sec. 117-390. - General stormwater pollution control plan criteria. 
    The plan shall address the following: 
(1)  Stabilizing all exposed soils and soil stockpiles and the related time frame or schedule. 
(2)  Establishing permanent vegetation and the related time frame or schedule. 
(3)  Preventing sediment damage to adjacent properties and other designated areas such as streams, wetlands, lakes and unique vegetation (e.g., oak groves, rare and endangered species habitats). 
(4)  Scheduling for erosion and sediment control practices. 
(5)  Where permanent and temporary sedimentation basins will be located. 
(6)  Engineering the construction and stabilization of steep slopes. 
(7)  Measures for controlling the quality and quantity of stormwater leaving a site. 
(8)  Stabilizing all waterways and outlets. 
(9)  Protecting storm sewers from the entrance of sediment. 
(10)  Precautions to be taken to contain sediment when working in or crossing water bodies. 
(11)  Restabilizing utility construction areas as soon as possible. 
(12)  Protecting paved roads from sediment and mud brought in from access routes. 
(13)  Disposing of temporary erosion and sediment control measures. 
(14)  How the temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices will be maintained. 
(15)  How collected sediment and floating debris will be disposed of. 
(Code 1978, § 9.27.09; Ord. No. 06-32, § 1, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 14-09, § 2, 9-23-2014) 
Sec. 117-391. - Minimum stormwater pollution control measures and related inspections. 
    These minimum control measures are required where bare soil is exposed. Due to the diversity of individual construction sites, each site will be individually evaluated. Where additional control measures are needed, they will be specified at the discretion of the city engineer. The city will determine what action is necessary to prevent excessive erosion from occurring on the site. 
(1)  All grading plans and building site surveys must be reviewed by the city for effectiveness of erosion control measures in the context of the site topography and drainage. 
(2)  Sediment control measures must be properly installed by the builder before construction activity begins. Such structures may be adjusted during dry weather to accommodate short-term activities, such as those that require the passage of very large vehicles. As soon as this activity is finished or before rainfall, the erosion and sediment control structures must be returned to the configuration specified by the city. A sediment control inspection must then be scheduled, and passed before a footing inspection will be done. 
(3)  Diversion of channeled runoff around disturbed areas, if practical, or the protection of the channel. 
(4)  Easements. If a stormwater management plan involves directing some or all of the site's runoff, the applicant or his designated representative shall obtain from adjacent property owners any necessary easements or other property interests concerning the flowing of such water. 
(5)  The scheduling of the site's activities to lessen their impact on erosion and sediment creation, so as to minimize the amount of exposed soil. 
(6)  Control runoff as follows (Either subsection (6)a and b and (6)a and c of this section): 
a.  Unless precluded by moderate or heavy snow cover (Mulching can take place if a light snow cover is present.), stabilize all exposed inactive disturbed soil areas within 100 feet of any water of the state, or within 100 feet any conveyance (curb, gutter, storm sewer inlet, drainage ditch, etc.) to a water of the state with sod, seed or weed free mulch. This must be done, if the developer has not worked the area for seven days on slopes greater than three feet horizontal to one foot vertical (3:1), 14 days on slopes ranging from 3:1 to 10:1 and 21 days for flatter slopes. 
b.  For disturbed areas greater than five acres construct temporary or permanent sedimentation basins. Sedimentation basins must have a minimum surface area equal to at least one percent of the area draining to basin, and be constructed in accordance with accepted design specifications including access for operations and maintenance. Basin discharge rates must also be controlled to prevent erosion in the discharge channel. The applicant is required to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System/State Disposal System (NPDES/SDS) construction stormwater permit from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for any project that disturbs five acres or more of land. 
c.  For disturbed areas less than five acres sedimentation basins are encouraged, but not required, unless specifically required by the city engineer. The applicant shall install erosion and sediment controls at locations directed by the city. Minimum requirements include silt fences, rock check dams, or other equivalent control measures along slopes. Silt fences are required along channel edges to reduce sediment reaching channel. Silt fences, rock check dams, etc., must be regularly inspected and maintained. 
(7)  Sediment basins related to impervious surface area. Where a project's ultimate development replaces surface vegetation with one or more acres of cumulative impervious surface, and all runoff has not been accounted for in a local unit of government's existing stormwater management plan or practice, the runoff must be discharged to a wet sedimentation basin prior to entering waters of the state. At a minimum the work must conform with the current version of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's publication entitled "Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas," and the current requirements found in the same agency's NPDES/SDS permits for stormwater associated with construction activities. 
(8)  Generally, sufficient silt fence will be required to hold all sheet flow runoff generated at an individual site, until it can either infiltrate or seep through silt fence's pores. 
(9)  Temporary stockpiling of 50 or more cubic yards of excess soil on any lot or other vacant area will not be allowed without issuance of a grading permit for the earth moving activity in question. 
(10)  Concrete truck wash out. The permittee must designate a location for wash out of concrete trucks and equipment. Sites that are one acre or more must provide a station for washing out concrete trucks and equipment. The location of the wash out area or wash out station shall preclude the drainage of concrete and water from the washing activities to a stormwater facility or water resource. 
(11)  Waste and material collection and disposal. All waste and unused building materials (including garbage, debris, cleaning wastes, litter, wastewater or sewage, toxic materials or hazardous materials) shall be properly contained while on site, properly disposed of off-site, and not allowed to be carried by water and/or wind off the site or into a receiving channel or storm sewer system. Waste containers and all construction materials shall not be placed or stored such that they obstruct, encroach upon, or interfere wholly or in part with any public right-of-way, including but not limited to, public roadways, trails, sidewalks, parks or other public properties. 
(12)  For soil stockpiles greater than ten cubic yards the toe of the pile must be more than 25 feet from a road, drainage channel or stormwater inlet. If such stockpiles will be left for more than seven days, they must be stabilized with mulch, vegetation, tarps or other means. If left for less than seven days, erosion from stockpiles must be controlled with silt fences or rock check dams. If for any reason a soil stockpile of any size is located closer than 25 feet from a road, drainage channel or stormwater inlet, and will be left for more than seven days, it must be covered with tarps or controlled in some other manner. 
(13)  All sand, gravel or other mining operations taking place on the development site shall have a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General Stormwater permit for industrial activities and all required state department of natural resources permits. 
(14)  Temporary rock construction entrances are not required in the city. The contractor is required to use a pickup type sweeper on adjacent streets daily during active construction or as directed by the city. 
(15)  Parking is prohibited on all bare lots and all temporary construction entrances, except where street parking is not available. Gravel entrances are to be used for deliveries only as per the development contract. 
(16)  Streets must be cleaned and swept whenever tracking of sediments occurs and before sites are left idle for weekends and holidays. Establishment of a regular sweeping schedule is encouraged. 
(17)  Water (impacted by the construction activity) removed from the site by pumping must be treated by temporary sedimentation basins, geotextile filters, grit chambers, sand filters, up-flow chambers, hydro-cyclones, swirl concentrators or other appropriate controls. Such water shall not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion or flooding of the site, receiving channels, adjacent property or a wetland. 
(18)  All storm drain inlets must be protected during construction until control measures are in place with either silt fence or an equivalent barrier that meets accepted design criteria, standards and specifications as contained in the latest version of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's publication, "Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas." 
(19)  Roof drain leaders. All newly constructed and reconstructed buildings must route roof drain leaders to pervious areas (not natural wetlands) where the runoff can infiltrate. The discharge rate shall be controlled so that no erosion occurs in the pervious areas. 
(20)  Follow-up inspections will be performed by the city on a regular basis and after a 0.5-inch rain event to ensure that erosion and sediment control measures are properly installed and maintained. In all cases the inspectors will attempt to work with the developer and/or builder to maintain proper erosion and sediment control at all sites. 
a.  The city has established a system of notices for enforcing erosion control. 
b.  In the event these notices are ignored, construction stop orders may be issued by the city, until erosion and sediment control measures meet specifications. A second erosion and sediment control/grading inspection must then be scheduled and passed before the final inspection will be done. 
(21)  Removal of more than one acre of topsoil shall not be done, unless written permission is given by the city engineer. Excessive removal of topsoil can cause significant soil erosion problems. 
(22)  Inspection and maintenance. All stormwater pollution control management facilities must be designed to minimize the need of maintenance, to provide easy vehicle and personnel access for maintenance purposes and be structurally sound. These facilities must have a plan of operation and maintenance that ensures continued effective removal of the pollutants carried in stormwater runoff. The city or its designated representative shall inspect all stormwater management facilities during construction, during the first year of operation and at least once every five years thereafter. The city will keep all inspection records on file for a period of six years. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to obtain any necessary easements or other property interests to allow access to the stormwater management facilities for inspection and maintenance purpose. 
(Code 1978, § 9.27.10; Ord. No. 06-32, § 1, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 14-09, § 2, 9-23-2014) 
Sec. 117-392. - Permanent stormwater pollution controls. 
(a)  The applicant shall install, construct, or pay the city fees for all stormwater management facilities necessary to manage increased runoff from development. Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations must be submitted for the pre-development and post-development conditions for the two-, ten-, and 100-year events as well as the ten-day snow melt event. Such calculations shall include: (i) description of the design storm frequency, intensity and duration, (ii) time of concentration, (iii) soil curve numbers or runoff coefficients, (iv) peak runoff rates and total runoff volumes for each watershed area, (v) infiltration rates, where applicable, (vi) culvert capacities, (vii) flow velocities, (viii) data on the increase in rate and volume of runoff for the design storms used, and (ix) documentation of sources for all computation methods and field test results. These predevelopment rates shall be based on the last ten years of how that land was used. Accelerated channel erosion must not occur as a result of the proposed land disturbing or development activity. An applicant may also make an in-kind or a monetary contribution to the development and maintenance of community stormwater management facilities designed to serve multiple land disturbing and development activities undertaken by one or more persons, including the applicant. 
(b)  Sizing of stormwater basins shall be based upon: 
(1)  For basins that are not land locked: Available storage volume shall be based on 100-year return period (7.1 inch Atlas 14, Anoka County), 24-hour duration, SCS Type II storm with average soil moisture conditions (AMC 2) 
(2)  For land locked areas: Available storage volume shall be established by estimating the surface elevation resulting from a 100-year/ten-day runoff or 100-year/ten-day snowmelt, whichever is more restrictive. In the snowmelt scenario, frozen soils shall be assumed (CN=100). The methodology used must conform to current Lower Rum River Watershed Management Organization (LRRWMO) rules. 
(c)  Lowest floor elevation. The lowest floor elevation of all development, including basements, must be at least three feet above the highest anticipated groundwater table, two feet above the designated or designed 100-year flood elevation or one foot above the emergency overflow, whichever is higher. The LRRWMO rules designate a procedure for modifying these requirements. 
(d)  Storm water volume management practices must be utilized on all new development sites. The options are: 
(1)  Infiltrating or retaining the first one inch of precipitation over the impervious surface of the site. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quantity and quality. 
(2)  Retain the post construction runoff volume on the site for the 95th percentile storm. These practices shall prevent the off-site discharge of the precipitation from all rainfall events less than or equal to the 95th percentile rainfall event. Discharge volume reduction can be achieved by engineered infiltration, canopy interception, soil amendments, evaporation, rainfall harvesting, and/or evapotranspiration and any combination of the aforementioned practices. 
(3)  Match the pre-development runoff conditions. Design and construct stormwater management practices that preserve the pre-development runoff conditions following construction. The post-construction rate, volume, and duration of discharges must not exceed the pre-project rates and the pre-project hydrograph for the one- and two-year storms must be replicated through the site design and other appropriate processes. The practices listed above can be used to achieve this goal. Defensible and consistent hydrological assessments and modeling methods must be used and documented. 
Infiltration will not be permitted and alternative practices will be required in the ten-year capture zone of the DWSMA. Soils with infiltration rates of more than 8.3 inches per hour must be amended to reduce the infiltration rate to less than 8.3 inches per hour. Infiltration will also be prohibited in the following areas: 
a.  Where industrial facilities are not authorized to infiltrate industrial stormwater under an NPDES/SDS Industrial Stormwater Permit. 
b.  Where vehicle fueling and maintenance occur. 
c.  With less than three feet of separation distance from the bottom of the infiltration system to the elevation of seasonally saturated soils or the top of bedrock. 
d.  Where high levels of contaminants in soil or groundwater will be mobilized by the infiltrating stormwater. 
(e)  All calculations and information used in determining these peak storm discharge rates shall be submitted along with the stormwater pollution control plan. 
(f)  The applicant shall consider reducing the need for stormwater management facilities by incorporating the use of natural topography and land cover such as natural swales and depressions as they exist before development to the degree that they can accommodate the additional flow of treated (e.g., settled) water without compromising the integrity or quality of the wetland or pond. 
(g)  The following stormwater management practices must be investigated in developing the stormwater management part of the stormwater pollution control plan in the following descending order of preference: 
(1)  Protect and preserve as much natural or vegetated area on the site as possible, minimizing impervious surfaces, and directing runoff to vegetated areas rather than to adjoining streets, storm sewers and ditches; 
(2)  Flow attenuation of treated stormwater by use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions; 
(3)  Stormwater wet detention facilities (including percolation facilities); and 
(4)  A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable minimum control requirements specified in subsection (a) of this section. The applicant shall provide justification for the method selected. 
(h)  The stormwater controls for new development sites shall also provide no net increase in stormwater discharges of total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP). 
(i)  The stormwater controls for redevelopment projects shall achieve a net reduction from pre-project conditions (on an annual average basis) of: 
(1)  Stormwater discharge volume. 
(2)  Stormwater discharges of TSS. 
(3)  Stormwater discharges of TP. 
(j)  The city will evaluate requests for a variance to the volume reduction goals when site conditions preclude infiltration. The developer shall implement to the maximum extent practicable other volume reduction techniques on site. The Lower Rum River Watershed Management Organization has adopted procedures for making a financial contribution when volume reduction goals cannot be met. The variance approval and financial contribution calculations will become part of the permanent project record retained by the city. 
(Code 1978, § 9.27.11; Ord. No. 06-32, § 1, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 13-01, § 2, 2-26-2013; Ord. No. 14-09, § 2, 9-23-14) 
Sec. 117-393. - Design standards. 
    Minimal impact design standards shall be followed to achieve the best stormwater management. The BMPs used should seek to mimic the natural hydrology, utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. The Minnesota Stormwater Manual (Stormwater Steering Committee, MN Pollution Control Agency), the Minnesota Urban Small Sites BMP Manual (Metropolitan Council), Local Road Research Board BMP Maintenance Guide, and Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas (MPCA) are resources that provide guidance in achieving these goals. 
(1)  Implementation. Low impact development or better site design techniques are the preferred methods of achieving stormwater management. Mimicking the natural topography and land cover as they exist in the pre-developed condition to meet the standards and requirements of the city and other regulatory agencies shall be the first consideration. 
(2)  Recommended practices. Practices and methods used to achieve the intent of the above paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
a.  Rain gardens. 
b.  Green roofs. 
c.  Bio-retention practices. 
d.  Pervious pavements or pavers. 
e.  Plots of native vegetation and/or buffers in place of sod. 
f.  Reforestation and revegetation. 
g.  Trees and tree box filters. 
h.  Reduction of impervious area. 
i.  Rain water harvesting. 
(3)  Other practices. Other traditional stormwater BMPs may be approved on a site by site basis to achieve the goals of water quality and quantity, and rate control. These practices shall conform to the standards outlined in the resources referenced above. 
(4)  All stormwater runoff shall be pre-treated prior to discharge to any surface water. 
(5)  Maintenance plan. A plan shall be established to maintain all temporary and permanent BMPs in a working and efficient condition. This may include removal of invasive species, sediment, debris, or any other foreign or obstructive object or condition that prevents the BMPs from performing as designed. 
(6)  Exemption. The mill and overlay or rehabilitation of a public roadway that does not create additional impervious surfaces; and sidewalk or trail projects are exempt from these stormwater requirements. These projects may be subject to other regulations. 
    At a minimum these facilities must conform to the most current technology as reflected in the current version of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's publication, "Protecting Water Quality in Urban Areas" and the current requirements found in the same agency's NPDES permits for stormwater associated with construction activities. 
(Code 1978, § 9.27.12; Ord. No. 06-32, § 1, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 14-09, § 2, 9-23-2014) 
Sec. 117-394. - Minimum protection for natural wetlands. 
(a)  Runoff must not be discharged directly into wetlands without appropriate quality (i.e., treated) and quantity runoff control, depending on the individual wetland's vegetation sensitivity. See the current version of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's publication, "Storm-Water and Wetlands: Planning and Evaluation Guidelines for Addressing Potential Impacts of Urban Storm-Water and Snow-Melt Runoff on Wetlands" for guidance. The minimum level of treatment required for discharge to wetlands is to meet the NURP Guidelines as follows: 
(1)  A permanent pool ("dead storage") volume below the principal spillway (normal outlet) which shall be greater than or equal to the runoff from a 2.5 inch storm over the entire contributing area assuming full development. It shall have an annual removal efficiency of 60 percent total phosphorus and 90 percent total suspended solids. 
(2)  A permanent pool average depth (basin volume/basin area) which shall be more than three feet, with a maximum depth of ten feet. 
(3)  Pond outlets shall have skimmers, submerged outlets or other devices that extend a minimum of six inches below the water surface and minimize velocities of water passing under the skimmer to less than 0.5 feet per second for rainfall events having a 99 percent frequency (one-year storm event). 
(b)  Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially, unless replaced by either restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value. Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland resources or environments with those of at least equal public value. Compensation, including the replacement ratio and quality of replacement should be consistent with the requirements outlined in the rules adopted by the board of water and soil resources to implement the Wetland Conservation Act of 1991 including any and all amendments to it. 
(c)  Work in and around wetlands must be guided by the following principles in descending order of priority: 
(1)  Avoid both the direct and indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish the wetland. 
(2)  Minimize the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland related activity and its implementation. 
(3)  Rectify the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland environment with one of at least equal public value. 
(4)  Reduce or eliminate the adverse impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the activity. 
(Code 1978, § 9.27.13; Ord. No. 06-32, § 1, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 14-09, § 2, 9-23-2014) 
Sec. 117-395. - Impaired waters and total maximum daily loads. 
    If a site drains to a surface water that has been listed as impaired pursuant to section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act more stringent water quality measures will be required. If a total maximum daily load (TMDL) has been written for the impaired water then all best management practices deemed necessary to comply with the requirements of the TMDL must be implemented.

Sec. 117-399. - Rain gardens in road right-of-way. 
    In order to obtain a right-of-way permit, rain gardens constructed in the right-of-way will be required to capture street runoff. The property owner must agree to this condition and accept responsibility for maintenance of the rain garden and associated features. 
(1)  If the homeowner is not agreeable to allowing street runoff into the rain garden they must agree to install features that would direct all driveway runoff to the rain garden and capture 75 percent of front yard and roof runoff. Maintenance of the rain garden and associated features will be the responsibility of the homeowner. 
(2)  Rain gardens proposed for construction in the right-of-way must have plans approved by the city engineering department. These plans will include illustration of area draining to the rain garden; design details to prove proper sizing/capacity to handle the area of drainage; illustrate property boundaries, location of street features, driveway, house and other structures in relation to the rain garden; and include proof of infiltration potential and ability to drawdown with in a 48-hour period. 
(3)  Rain gardens capturing street runoff would require a curb cut to direct flow into the rain garden.

Sec. 117-406. - Financial securities. 
(a)  The applicant shall provide security for the performance of the work described and delineated on the approved grading plan involving the stormwater pollution control plan and any stormwater and pollution control plan related remedial work. The financial security shall be considered part of the Stage 1 improvements for all plats and subdivisions. Financial securities will not be required for permits as noted in section 117-385. Security for permits not meeting these requirements shall be a minimum of the rate established by the city council in the annual schedule of rates, fees and charges and shall be escrowed with the city at the time the building permit is obtained. Requirements for the surety for all applications are outlined below: 
(1)  The city may request a greater financial security, if the city considers that the development site is especially prone to erosion or the resource to be protected is especially valuable. 
(2)  Maintaining the financial security. If at anytime during the course of the work this amount falls below 50 percent of the required deposit, the developer shall make another deposit in the amount necessary to restore the deposit to the required amount. 
(3)  If the developer does not bring the financial security back up to the required amount within seven days after notification by the city that the amount has fallen below 50 percent of the required amount the, city may: 
a.  Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
b.  Revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant for the site in question and any other of the applicant's sites within the city's jurisdiction. 
(4)  Proportional reduction of the financial security. When more than half of the development's maximum exposed soil area achieves final stabilization, the city can reduce the total required amount of the financial security by half, if recommended by the city engineer. 
(5)  Action against the financial security. The city may act against the financial security if any of the conditions listed in subsections (5)a through d of this section exist. The city shall use funds from this security to finance any corrective or remedial work undertaken by the city or a contractor under contract to the city and to reimburse the city for all direct cost incurred in the process of remedial work including, but not limited to, staff time and attorney's fees. 
a.  The developer ceases land disturbing activities and/or filling and abandons the work site prior to completion of the grading plan. 
b.  The developer fails to conform to any city approved grading plan and/or the stormwater pollution control plan as approved by the city. 
c.  The techniques utilized under the stormwater pollution control plan fail within one year of installation. 
d.  The developer fails to reimburse the city for corrective action taken under section 117-403. 
(6)  Returning the financial security. Any unspent amount of the financial security deposited with the city for faithful performance of the stormwater pollution control plan and any stormwater and pollution control plan related remedial work must be released one full year after the completion of the installation of all such measures and the establishment of final stabilization. 
(Ord. No. 14-09, § 2, 9-23-2014) 
Sec. 117-407. - Notification of failure of the stormwater pollution control plan. 
(a)  The city shall notify the developer, when the city is going to act on the financial securities part of this subdivision. 
(1)  Notification by the city. The initial contact will be to a party listed on the application and/or the stormwater pollution control plan. Forty-eight hours after notification by the city or 72 hours after the failure of erosion control measures, whichever is less, the city, at its discretion, may begin corrective work. Such notification should be in writing, but if it is verbal, a written notification should follow as quickly as practical. 
(2)  Erosion off site. If erosion breaches the perimeter of the site, the applicant shall immediately develop a cleanup and restoration plan, obtain the right-of-entry from the adjoining property owner, and implement the cleanup and restoration plan within 48 hours of obtaining the adjoining property owner's permission. In no case, unless written approval is received from the city, shall more than seven calendar days go by without corrective action being taken. If in the discretion of the city, the applicant does not repair the damage caused by the erosion, the city may do the remedial work required and charge the cost to the applicant. 
(3)  Erosion into streets, wetlands or water bodies. If eroded soils (including tracked soils from construction activities) enter or appear likely to enter streets, wetlands, or other water bodies, prevention strategies, cleanup and repair must be immediate. The applicant shall provide all traffic control and flagging required to protect the traveling public during the cleanup operations. 
(4)  Failure to do corrective work. When an applicant fails to conform to any provision of this policy within the time stipulated, the city may take the following actions: 
a.  Withhold the scheduling of inspections and/or the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
b.  Revoke any permit issued by the city to the applicant for the site in question or any other of the applicant's sites within the city's jurisdiction. 
c.  Direct the correction of the deficiency by city forces or by a separate contract. The issuance of a permit constitutes a right-of-entry for the city or its contractor to enter upon the construction site for the purpose of correcting deficiencies in erosion control. 
d.  All costs incurred by the city in correcting stormwater pollution control deficiencies must be reimbursed by the applicant. If payment is not made within 30 days after costs are incurred by the city, payment will be made from the applicant's financial securities as described in section 117-406. 
e.  If there is an insufficient financial amount, in the applicant's financial securities as described in section 117-406, to cover the costs incurred by the city, then the city may assess the remaining amount against the property. As a condition of the permit, the owner shall waive notice of any assessment hearing to be conducted by the city, concur that the benefit to the property exceeds the amount of the proposed assessment, and waive all rights by virtue of Minn. Stats. § 429.081 to challenge the amount or validity of assessment.

Sec. 117-425. - Determination of land classification. 
    The Anoka County Soil Survey, 1977, and supplemental operational soil surveys may be used as a guide to the determination of land classification. The actual classification of land shall be verified by topographic surveys to verify slopes, percolation tests as described in chapter 113, article II, to verify percolation rates and soil borings to verify adequate depths to groundwater. 
(Code 1978, § 9.13.04) 
Sec. 117-426. - Location of and provisions for soil absorption systems. 
(a)  New subdivisions. 
(1)  Sufficient area of Class I land shall be reserved within each newly created lot or parcel of less than ten acres for the construction of an adequately sized soil absorption system and the reconstruction of soil absorption or final disposal unit of that system. The area of Class 1 land required shall be determined on the basis of system design requirements of chapter 113, article II, the percolation rate of soils determined to be Class 1, and the estimated daily volume of sewage based on proposed site development. In no instance shall the reserved area of Class I land be less than that required by law or ordinance. The reserved area of Class I land shall be wholly within the lot or parcel for which it is reserved and shall be so located as to be outside of all areas in which soil absorption systems are not allowed due to setback requirements from future structures, wells, water lines, trees and property lines as set forth in this chapter. No subdivision of land shall be approved unless each lot or parcel created by said subdivision for building purposes meets the requirements for the reservation of Class I land. 
(2)  The subdivision of land into parcels or lots shall not be approved where sufficient areas of Class I land cannot be reserved unless adequate methods are provided for overcoming the deficiency of adequate area for soil absorption. 
(b)  Administration. In conjunction with their respective duties in administrating the subdivision and zoning regulations of this chapter and other related land use and planning regulations, the city's zoning administrator, planning commission and council shall ensure that this chapter is complied with. 
(c)  Lots of record. This chapter is intended to apply to all parcels of land within the city, regardless of whether a parcel was of record before or after the time of enactment of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(d)  Variances. Variances from the strict enforcement of this chapter may be granted in accordance with the procedures and requirements of section 117-51. 
(Code 1978, § 9.13; Ord. No. 73-05, 5-21-1973; Ord. No. 79-3, 2-12-1979) 
Sec. 117-427. - Solid waste. 
(a)  Purpose and policy. It has been determined that improper waste storage, collection, transportation and disposal endanger the public health, safety and welfare, create public nuisances, result in scenic blight and adversely affect land values. Since this type of land use must meet or exceed the rules and standards established by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), those same rules and standards must be met before a conditional use permit may be considered by the council. Additionally, performance standards must be met to ensure that all conditional use permit requests will be reviewed using criteria that will prohibit land uses that endanger the public health, safety and welfare, create public nuisances, result in scenic blight or adversely affect land values, or create land use conflicts due to landfill operations and landfill related activities. 
(b)  Scope. In addition to the criteria outlined in section 117-51, these are rules and standards that regulate the issuance of conditional use permits for storage, collection, transportation, treatment, utilization, processing, transfer, intermediate disposal, and final disposal of solid waste, recyclable materials, or processed waste product by any person and the issuing of conditional use permits for the construction and operation of solid waste disposal sites and facilities for the protection of the environment in keeping with Minn. Stats. chs. 115, 116, 400 and 473. 
(c)  Term of permits. The permit shall be subject to annual review for conformance with this Code and performance of the permit holder. The council may also require a performance bond, cash escrow, letter of credit or other financial assurance from the landowner or operator to guarantee conformance with these regulations. All property owners and residents within 1,000 feet of the site shall be notified of the annual conditional use permit review. 
(d)  Information required. The applicant shall provide to the city three copies of all information submitted to MPCA for preapplication and application requirements for permits outlined in Minn. Rules ch. 7001. The following information shall also be provided by the persons requesting the permit:

(Code 1978, § 9.14; Ord. No. 90-05, 3-27-1990; Ord. No. 03-38, 9-29-2003) 
Sec. 117-428. - Towers. 
(a)  Purpose. In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and business while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community, the council finds that these regulations are necessary in order to: 
(1)  Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication services to the residents and businesses of the city; 
(2)  Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design and siting standards; 
(3)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements; and 
(4)  Maximize the use of existing and approved towers and buildings to accommodate new wireless telecommunication antennas in order to reduce the number of towers needed to serve the community. 
(b)  Towers in residential zoning districts. Construction of towers to support commercial antennas that conform to all applicable provisions of this Code may be allowed only the following locations: 
(1)  Parcels within the Tower Overlay District as shown on the official zoning map. 
(2)  All church, government, school, utility, and institutional sites 
(3)  If the proposed tower is to be located within a residential district, documentation must be included in the application that demonstrates that the tower cannot be reasonably located within a commercial, industrial, or public/quasi-public zoning district. 
(c)  Towers in Town Center and Critical River Overlay Zoning Districts. Construction of towers to support commercial antennas shall not be allowed in Town Center and Critical River Overlay Zoning Districts, except that antennas may be attached to existing structures provided the antenna does not extend more than 20 feet above the highest point of the structure or tower. 
(d)  Towers in the H-1 Highway 10 Business District. Construction of towers to support commercial antennas shall not be allowed in the H-1 Highway 10 Business District. Antennas may not be constructed on existing structures in the H-1 District. 
(e)  Use of city-owned land for wireless telecommunication antennas and towers. 
(1)  Priority of users. 
a.  The city; 
b.  Public safety agencies, including law enforcement, fire, and ambulance services, which are not part of the city and private entities with a public safety agreement with the city; 
c.  Other governmental agencies, for uses which are not related to public safety; and 
d.  Entities providing licensed commercial wireless telecommunication services including cellular, personal communication services (PCS), specialized mobilized radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobilized radio (ESMR), paging, and similar services that are marketed to the general public. 
(2)  Minimum requirements. 
a.  The user must obtain a lease from the city, which shall take the following criteria into consideration: 
1.  The antennas or tower will not interfere with the purpose for which the city owned property is intended; 
2.  The antennas or tower will have no adverse impact on surrounding private property; 
3.  The applicant is willing to obtain adequate liability insurance and commit to a lease agreement which includes equitable compensation for the use of public land and other necessary provisions and safeguards. The fees shall be established by the city council after considering comparable rates in other cities, potential expenses, risks to the city, and other appropriate factors; 
4.  The antennas or tower will not interfere with other users who have a higher priority as discussed in subsection (e)(1) of this section; 
5.  Upon reasonable notice, the antennas or tower may be required to be removed at the user's expense; 
6.  The applicant must reimburse the city for any costs which it incurs because of the presence of the applicant's antennas or towers; and 
b.  The user must obtain all necessary land use approvals, including a conditional use permit from the city. 
(3)  Special requirements. The use of certain city-owned property, such as water tower sites and parks, for wireless telecommunication antennas or towers brings with it special concerns due to the unique nature of these sites. The placement of wireless telecommunication antennas or towers on these special city-owned sites will be allowed only when the following additional requirements are met: 
a.  Water tower sites. The city's water tower represents a large public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak capacity reserves. Protection of the quality of the city's water supply is of prime importance to the city. As access to the city's water storage system increases, so too increases the potential for contamination of the public water supply. For these reasons, the placement of wireless telecommunication antennas or towers on existing or future water tower sites will be allowed only when the city is fully satisfied that the following requirements are met: 
1.  The applicant's access to the facility will not increase the risks of contamination to the city's water supply; 
2.  There is sufficient room on the structure and/or on the grounds to accommodate the applicant's facility; 
3.  The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower maintenance costs to the city; and 
4.  The presence of the facility will not unreasonably interfere with maintaining the water tower. 
b.  Parks. Wireless telecommunication antennas will be considered only in parks on existing structures after the recommendation of the park and recreation commission and approval of the city council. Antennas may extend a maximum on 20 feet above existing structures. In addition, antennas are not permitted in those parks that have been titled to the plat in which they were dedicated or have restrictive covenants prohibiting any use except park and recreation use. 
(4)  Application process. All applicants who wish to locate a wireless telecommunication antenna or tower on city-owned property must submit to the city administrator, or his designee, a completed application and detailed plan that complies with the submittal requirements of the zoning ordinance along with other pertinent information requested by the city. 
(5)  Termination. The city council may terminate any lease if it determines that any one of the following conditions exists: 
a.  A potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use; 
b.  A user's frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users of a higher priority, regardless of whether or not this interference was adequately predicted in the technical analysis; or 
c.  A user violates any of the standards in this policy or the conditions attached to the city's permission. 
Before taking action, the city will provide 30 days' notice to the user of the intended termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for the user to address the city council regarding the proposed action. This procedure need not be followed in emergency situations. 
(6)  Reservation of right. Notwithstanding the above, the city council reserves the right to deny, for any reason, the use of any or all city-owned property by any one or all applicants. 
(7)  Use of revenue. All revenue generated through the lease of city-owned property for wireless telecommunication towers and antennas shall be made payable to the city and transmitted to the city's department of finance. Revenue shall be credited to the specific operating activity using the land upon which the wireless telecommunication towers and antennas are located: 
a.  To the water utility fund when located on water utility property; 
b.  To the park improvement fund if located on park or open space land; 
c.  Any revenues not meeting the above criteria shall be applied as general revenues of the general fund. 
(f)  Collocation requirements. All commercial wireless telecommunication towers erected, constructed, or located within the city shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  A proposal for a new commercial wireless telecommunication service tower shall not be approved unless the city council finds that the telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or building within a one-mile search radius of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following reasons: 
a.  The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost. 
b.  The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at the tower or building as documented by a qualified professional and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost. 
c.  Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function reasonably as documented by a professional engineer. 
d.  In spite of its best efforts, within 60 days, the applicant was unable to obtain approval to collocate on an existing or approved tower or building. 
e.  Other reasons that make it impractical to locate the planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or building. 
(2)  Shared use of existing communications towers shall be preferred to the construction of a new tower. Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication service tower shall be designed structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to accommodate both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two additional users. 
(g)  Tower construction requirements. All towers erected, constructed, or located within the city, and all wiring therefor, shall comply with the requirements set forth in chapter 105. 
(h)  Tower and antenna design requirements. Proposed or modified towers and antennas shall meet the following design requirements:

(Code 1978, § 9.16; Ord. No. 04-35, 10-25-2004) 
Sec. 117-430. - Alternative energy systems. 
(a)  Purpose and intent . The purpose and intent of this section is to establish standards and procedures by which the installation and operation of alternative energy systems shall be governed within the city. The city finds that it is in the public interest to encourage alternative energy systems that have a positive impact on energy production and conservation while not having an adverse impact on the community. 
(b)  Wind energy conversion systems (WECS). The following standards are intended to: 
  Facilitate the provisions for WECS to the residents and businesses of the city; 
  Minimize adverse visual effects of wind towers, turbines, and generators through careful design and site selection standards; 
  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements. 
(1)  Location. WECS units shall be allowed by conditional use if listed as a conditional use in the underlying zoning district. Furthermore, WECS units shall not be allowed in the Critical River, Wild and Scenic River, and Shoreland Overlay Districts, except for micro-scale WECS provided that it does not violate the maximum structure height of the overlay district. 
(2)  Bulk standards. 
a.  General requirements. No part of the WECS, equipment, guyed wires, blades, or braces shall at any time extend across or over any part of the public right-of-way, public street, highway, sidewalk, or recreation trail. 
b.  Setback. All small scale WECS and medium scale WECS units shall maintain a minimum setback of 1.5 times the height of the tower. In addition, WECS units in any R-1, R-2, or R-3 residential district must maintain a minimum setback of 1,000 feet from any principle dwelling unit on adjacent parcels. 
1.  Setbacks shall be measured from the center of the WECS tower to the nearest property line. 
c.  Height. Height for any WECS shall be restricted by the definition of the WECS as listed in City Code section 117-1, definitions. 
1.  The city council may increase the height of a small scale WECS up to an overall height of 100 feet if the applicant is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city council that the surrounding topography, structures, vegetation, and other factors make the height limit for a complying WECS impractical. 
2.  A micro-scale WECS is limited to 25 feet taller than the structure to which it is mounted and can be no taller than the maximum building height of the underlying zoning district. A variance, processed in accordance with section 117-53 (Variance procedures) is required for any micro-scale WECS proposed to be taller than these restrictions. 
d.  Blade clearance. Any WECS blade shall maintain a minimum ground clearance of 30 feet. 
e.  Restricted climbing apparatus. Any WECS tower shall be designed to have removable climbing apparatuses a minimum of 25 feet from the ground. All climbing apparatus within 25 feet of the ground must be removed when not being serviced. 
f.  Site location in residential districts. A WECS may only be located in the rear yard in the R-1, R-2, and R-3 residential districts. 
1.  The city council may approve a WECS in the front yard if the applicant is able to demonstrate setbacks would be unable to be met in the rear yard. 
(3)  Design standards. A proposed or modified WECS shall meet the following minimum design standards. 
a.  Tower design. Any WECS shall be of a monopole design unless the city council determines that an alternative design is preferred in cases where structural or design considerations, neighborhood compatibility, or location availability is better suited with an alternate design. 
b.  Architectural design. Any WECS shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color and design, except in instances where the color is dictated by federal or state authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration. 
1.  Architectural design standards are subject to final city council approval. 
2.  The city council may deny a WECS if it determines the design standards are incompatible with the surrounding area. 
(4)  Use of city owned land for WECS. 
a.  Priority of users. 
1.  City of Ramsey; 
2.  Public safety agencies, including law enforcement, fire, and ambulance services, which are not part of the City of Ramsey and private entities with a public safety agreement with the city; 
3.  Other governmental agencies, for uses which are not related to public safety; and 
4.  Entities providing licensed commercial wireless telecommunication services including cellular, personal communication services (PCS), specialized mobilized radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobilized radio (ESMR), paging, and similar services that are marketed to the general public or wireless telecommunication services. 
5.  Entities providing alternative energy sources including WECS. 
b.  Minimum requirements. 
1.  The user must obtain a lease from the city, which shall take the following criteria into consideration: 
(i)  The WECS will not interfere with the purpose for which the city owned property is intended; 
(ii)  The WECS will have no adverse impact on surrounding private property; 
(iii)  The applicant is willing to obtain adequate liability insurance and commit to a lease agreement which includes equitable compensation for the use of public land and other necessary provisions and safeguards. The fees shall be established by the city council after considering comparable rates in other cities, potential expenses, risks to the city, and other appropriate factors; 
(iv)  The WECS will not interfere with other users who have a higher priority as discussed in subsection 117-430(e)(1); 
(v)  Upon reasonable notice, the WECS may be required to be removed at the user's expense; 
(vi)  The applicant must reimburse the city for any costs which it incurs because of the presence of the applicant's WECS; and 
2.  The user must obtain all necessary land use approvals, including a conditional use permit from the city. 
c.  Special requirements. The use of certain city owned property, such as water tower sites and parks, for a WECS brings with it special concerns due to the unique nature of these sites. The placement of a WECS on these special city owned sites will be allowed only when the following additional requirements are met: 
1.  Water tower sites. The city's water tower represents a large public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak capacity reserves. Protection of the quality of the city's water supply is of prime importance to the city. As access to the city's water storage system increases, so too increases the potential for contamination of the public water supply. For these reasons, the placement of a WECS on existing or future water tower sites will be allowed only when the city is fully satisfied that the following requirements are met: 
(i)  The applicant's access to the facility will not increase the risks of contamination to the city's water supply; 
(ii)  There is sufficient room on the structure and/or on the grounds to accommodate the applicant's facility; 
(iii)  The presence of the facility will not increase the water tower maintenance costs to the city; and 
(iv)  The presence of the facility will not unreasonably interfere with maintaining the water tower. 
2.  Parks. The presence of certain WECS represents a potential conflict with the purpose of some city owned parks. A WECS will be considered only in parks after the recommendation of the park and recreation commission and approval of the city council. 
d.  Application process. All applicants who wish to locate a WECS on any property must submit to the city administrator, or his/her designee, a completed application and detailed plan that complies with the submittal requirements of the zoning ordinance along with other pertinent information requested by the city. 
e.  Termination. The city council may terminate any lease if it determines that any one of the following conditions exist: 
1.  A potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use; 
2.  The WECS unreasonably interferes with other users of a higher priority, including wireless communication, regardless of whether or not this interference was adequately predicted in the technical analysis; or 
3.  A user violates any of the standards in this policy or the conditions attached to the city's permission. 
Before taking action, the city will provide 30 days notice to the user of the intended termination and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity for the user to address the city council regarding the proposed action. This procedure need not be followed in emergency situations. 
f.  Reservation of right. Notwithstanding the above, the city council reserves the right to deny, for any reason, the use of any or all city owned property by any one or all applicants. 
g.  Use of revenue. All revenue generated through the lease of city owned property for a WECS shall be made payable to the City of Ramsey and transmitted to the city's department of finance. 
Revenue shall be credited as follows: 
1.  To the specific operating activity using the land upon which the wireless telecommunication towers and antennas are located: 
(i)  To the water utility fund when located on water utility property; 
(ii)  To the park improvement fund if located on park or open space land; 
(iii)  Any revenues not meeting the above criteria shall be applied as general revenues of the general fund. 
(5)  Co-location requirements. Whenever possible, the city encourages co-location of wireless telecommunication facilities on a WECS in accordance of section 117-428. 
(6)  Tower construction requirements. Any WECS erected, constructed, or located within the city, and all wiring therefore, shall comply with the requirements set forth of chapter 105 of this Code. Towers shall be designed to be properly grounded in the event of a lightning strike. 
(7)  WECS Lighting. Towers shall not be illuminated by artificial means and shall not display strobe lights unless such lighting is specifically required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other federal or state authority for a particular tower, or if required by the city council for safety reasons. When incorporated into the approved design of the tower, light fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots, or similar areas may be attached to the tower. 
(8)  Signs and advertising. The use of any portion of a tower for signs other than warning or equipment information signs is prohibited. 
(9)  Accessory utility buildings. All utility buildings and structures accessory to a WECS shall be architecturally designed to blend in with the surrounding environment and shall meet the minimum setback requirements of the underlying zoning district. Ground mounted equipment shall be screened from view by suitable vegetation, except where a design of non-vegetative screening better reflects and complements the architectural character of the surrounding neighborhood, as determined by the city council. 
(10)  Abandoned or unused WECS or portions of a WECS. Abandoned or unused WECS or portions of a WECS shall be removed as follows: 
a.  All abandoned or unused WECS and associated facilities shall be removed within 12 months of the cessation of operations at the site unless a time extension is approved by the city council. A copy of the relevant portions of a signed lease which requires the applicant to remove the tower and associated facilities upon cessation of operations at the site shall be submitted at the time of application. 
b.  The replacement of portions of a WECS previously removed requires the issuance of a new conditional use permit. 
(11)  Interference with public safety telecommunications. No new or existing WECS with co-location of telecommunications antennas shall interfere with public safety telecommunications, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission. Before the introduction of new service or changes in existing service, telecommunication providers shall notify the city at least ten calendar days in advance of such changes and allow the city to monitor interference levels during the testing process.

b.  Different widths may be required, depending upon anticipated traffic volume, planned functions of street, and character of abutting land use. 
c.  The classification of street and determined right-of-way width shall be determined by the city comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Where horizontal street lines deflect from each other at any point more than ten degrees, said street lines shall be connected by a curve with a radius of not less than 100 feet for minor streets and of such greater radii in the case of other streets as the planning commission may determine. Streets that shall serve as collector and arterial streets shall have a minimum radius of 310 feet. Such street may be reduced to a minimum of 240 feet providing full super elevation is incorporated in the street design. All municipal state aid (MSA) roads shall meet current MSA standards for horizontal alignment that is dependant upon design speed. 
(3)  Street grades shall not exceed seven percent for minor and collector streets and four percent for thoroughfares, and in no case shall they be less than 0.4 percent. Wherever feasible, grades within 30 feet of street intersections shall not exceed three percent and all private driveways providing access to public right-of-way shall approach to grade level. 
(4)  Different connecting street gradients shall be connected with vertical curves. Minimum length, in feet, of said vertical curves shall be 100 feet or 20 times the algebraic difference in the percentage of grade of the two adjacent gradients. 
(5)  Street jogs in minor and service streets shall have a centerline offset of not less than 150 feet. Street jogs in collector streets shall have a centerline offset of not less than 300 feet.

(8)  In those instances where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or planned thoroughfare or a railroad right-of-way, the planning commission may require a service street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way. 
(9)  Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the requirements of this chapter. 
(10)  Private streets shall be permitted in accordance with applicable zoning district. 
(11)  Street rights-of-way shall not be planned so as to cause hardship to owners of adjoining property. 
(12)  The angle formed by the intersection of streets shall not be less than 75 degrees, with 90-degree intersections preferred as measured 100 feet from the intersection. Intersections of more than four corners are prohibited. 
(13)  A tangent of at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced between reverse curves on thoroughfare and collector streets and a tangent of at least 50 feet in length shall be introduced between reverse curves on all other streets, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. 
(14)  Roadways of street intersections shall be rounded by a radius of not less than 20 feet for suburban type streets and 30 feet for rural type streets. Roadways of alley-street intersections shall be rounded by a radius of not less than ten feet.

(g)  Delineation and encumbrance of wetlands on all plats. 
(1)  That the presence of any public or private drainage ditches shall be identified on all plats and encumbered within a 66-foot-wide drainage and utility easement. 
(2)  That the delineation of wetlands and encumbrance of wetlands with public drainage and utility easements shall be required on all plats, except that any lots proposed to be ten acres or more in size that are located in plats that are outside the boundaries of the Metropolitan Urban Service Area shall be exempt from the wetland delineation and encumbrance requirement. This exemption does not supersede the city's authority to require the establishment of drainage easements, if necessary, over the proposed method of conveying and disposing surface water drainage within and beyond the limits of the plat to publicly owned or controlled drainage facilities or storm sewers. This exemption also does not supersede subsection (f) of this section, which establishes that where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway or stream, a drainage easement conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse shall be provided, together with such further width or construction, or both, as shall be adequate for stormwater drainage of the area. 
(h)  Lots. 
(1)  The minimum lot area and dimension shall be as specified in the respective zoning districts of the city. 
(2)  All lots shall have at least the minimum required frontage on a publicly dedicated street. 
(3)  Corner lots shall be platted at least ten feet wider than interior lots. 
(4)  Butt lots shall be platted at least five feet wider than the average width of interior lots in the block. The use of butt lots shall be avoided wherever possible. 
(5)  Lots abutting upon a watercourse, drainageway, or stream shall have such additional depth or width as may be required to protect house sites from flooding. 
(6)  Lots with frontage on two parallel streets shall not be permitted except where lots back on arterial streets or highways. Double frontage lots shall have an additional depth for screen planting along the rear lot line. 
(7)  In those instances where a plat is adjacent to a county road or state highway, no direct vehicular access shall be permitted from individual lots to such highway. The number of access onto MSA roads shall be avoided or minimized. 
(8)  In the subdividing of land, regard shall be shown for all natural features, including tree growth, watercourse, which if preserved will add attractiveness to the area. 
(9)  Lot remnants which are below minimum lot area or dimension must be added to adjacent or surrounding lots rather than to be allowed to remain as an unusable outlot or parcel unless the subdivider can show acceptable plans for the future use of such remnants. 
(10)  Duplex, townhouse, twinhome, and quad dwellings designed for separate ownership of individual dwelling units shall be required to subdivide each unit separately through the city's subdivision ordinance. Dwellings subdivided vertically, or stacked, are exempt from this provision. 
(11)  Buildability requirements. All lots shall have the lowest floor a minimum of three feet above the seasonal high water mark or two feet above the designated or designed 100-year flood elevation, whichever is higher, unless evidence is submitted and certified by a geotechnical engineer that shall be reviewed and certified by an independent geotechnical engineer hired by the city at the expense of the developer and approved by the city council that a separation of less than three feet can be achieved and is warranted. 
a.  Residential lots. Residential lots shall have a lot depth of not less than 100 feet for a continuous width of 60 feet, exclusive of any wetland, wetland setback area, floodway, or steep slopes. 
(i)  Individual sewage treatment systems. 
(1)  All lots proposed for individual sewage treatment systems shall be in accordance with chapter 113, article II. 
(2)  The subdivision shall not be approved until all new lots proposed for an individual sewage disposal system are found suitable for that purpose. 
(3)  All soil tests required herein shall be conducted by a registered engineer, whose expense shall be paid by the subdivider. 
(j)  Park and open space dedication. 
(1)  Purpose. 
a.  The council recognizes it is essential to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city and persons working in the city, that the character and quality of the environment be considered to be of major importance in the planning and development of the city. In this regard, the manner in which land is developed and used is of high priority. The preservation of land for park, playground and public open space purposes as it relates to the use and development of land for residential, commercial/industrial purposes is essential to the maintaining of a healthful and desirable environment for all citizens of the city. The city must not only provide these necessary amenities for our citizens today, but also be insightful to the needs of our future citizens. 
b.  It is recognized by the council that the demand for park, playground and public open space within a municipality is directly related to the density and intensity of development permitted and allowed within any given area. Higher density developments mean greater numbers of people and an increased demand for parks, recreational resources and public open space. To disregard this principle is to inevitably over-tax existing facilities and thus, diminish the quality of the environment for all. 
c.  The city's comprehensive park and open space plan establishes minimum community criteria for meeting the needs of the residents of the city. 
d.  It is the policy of the city that the following standards and guidelines for the dedication of land for park, playground, and public open space purposes (or cash contributions in lieu of such dedication) in the subdividing and developing of land within the city shall be directly related to the density and intensity of each subdivision and development. It is further the policy that it is intended that subdivision dedication shall first be allocated toward deficiencies in the subdivision, neighborhood or specific district park, then to trails linking parks, then community parks, then multijurisdictional park in the city. Finally, that dedication fees recognize the impact upon each of these systems by the subdivision of land. 
(2)  Residential parkland dedication. The amount of land to be dedicated to the city for public park and recreation purposes by a subdivider for residential development shall be based on the gross area of the proposed subdivision, and the net density in accordance with the following chart: 
Dwelling Units 
(net density) Land to Be Dedicated Up to 3.0 units per acre 10% 3.1 - 5.0 units per acre 15% 5.1 + units per acre Add 0.5% for each unit over 5  
(3)  Industrial/commercial parkland dedication. Subdividers of commercial/industrial land shall be required at the time the final plat is approved to dedicate to the city for public park and recreation purposes, an amount of land up to five percent of the gross land area as determined by the council. 
(4)  Planned unit development (PUD). Parkland dedication requirements for PUDs shall provide a minimum of ten percent for public park and recreational uses or cash in lieu of land in addition to those special requirements in section 117-123. 
(5)  Requirements for accepting dedication of land for public park purposes. 
a.  Land proposed to be dedicated for public purposes shall meet the needs of the city. 
b.  Prior to dedication for public purpose, the subdivider shall deliver to the city attorney, an abstract of title or registered property abstract for such dedication. Such title shall vest in the city good and marketable title, free and clear of any mortgages, liens, encumbrances, assessments and taxes. The conveyance documents shall be in such form acceptable to the council. 
c.  The required dedication shall be made at time of final plat approval. 
d.  The removal of trees, topsoil, storage of construction equipment, burying of construction debris, or stockpiling of surplus soils is strictly forbidden without the written approval of the council. 
e.  Grading and utility plans, which may affect or impact the proposed park dedication, shall be reviewed and approved by the city engineer prior to dedication, or at such time as is reasonably determined. 
f.  To be eligible for park dedication credit, any land to be dedicated as a requirement of this section shall be useable, developable land recreation purposes and shall be at a location convenient to the people to be served. For purposes of park land dedication, wetlands are not eligible. 
g.  The subdivider shall provide the city with a reproduction of the certificate of survey that shows all features as accepted on the final grading plans. Such plan shall be received prior to release of maintenance guarantees. 
(6)  Cash payment. 
a.  In lieu of land dedication, the council may require the subdivider to contribute a cash payment. The value of such payment shall be the amount established by a fee schedule passed by ordinance. 
b.  If, at the option of the council it is determined that a cash dedication shall be made, the city shall allocate said cash contribution as follows: 50 percent of the total cash contribution in the respective recreation district fund and 50 percent in the park improvement trust fund. 
(7)  Exemptions from cash payment requirements. In instances where park dedication is required to be satisfied with a cash payment, any existing developed lot within the boundaries of the plat is exempt from any cash payment due on the plat. In the case of administrative subdivisions, the subdivider shall be exempt from complying with any procedural requirements of this section. 
(8)  Combination of land dedication and cash payment. In appropriate subdivisions, a combination of land and cash may be required by the council. In the event a combination of land and cash is required, the amount of land to be dedicated shall be credited against the total park dedication requirement and the remaining cash contribution shall be based on the percent of the remaining unfulfilled park dedication obligation. 
(9)  Scenic and conservation easements. In appropriate subdivisions, as determined by agreement between the council and the subdivider, the subdivider may dedicate to the public a scenic easement in combination with the requirements of subsection (f) of this section or, if the subdivider and council agree, the scenic and conservation easement dedication may be in lieu of up to 25 percent of the requirements in this section. 
(10)  Required improvements. As part of the development agreement, subdividers shall be responsible for making certain improvements to the parkland they dedicate within their development for park, playground and public open space purposes. In cases where the city may require improvements, an escrow shall be required for the amount established in the development agreement: 
a.  Provide finish grading and turf establishment for all park, playground, trail and public open spaces and provide landscape screening in accordance with city policy. Except for natural areas that are left undisturbed and areas improved with buildings or paving, all areas reserved for dedicated parkland shall include at least four inches of topsoil, as defined in section 117-1, or an approved alternative as referenced in section 117-348. 
b.  Establish park boundary corners for the purpose of erecting park limit signs. Monuments of permanent character shall be placed by the subdivider at all angle and curve points on the outside boundaries of all public property. 
c.  The subdivider shall submit a topographical, site, grading and landscape plan prepared by a registered engineer or landscape architect to the city for approval during the preliminary plat process. 
(11)  Park dedication credit. In lieu of a full park dedication or cash contribution, the city may give credit for the following: 
a.  Constructing and paving trails which are identified by the city as accessible bikeway/walkway trails in accordance with city standards concurrently with the roads in their developments (i.e., grading with site grading and paving with street or parking lot paving). Grade and provide appropriate surfacing, as approved by the park and recreation commission, of trails identified by the city as horse or wilderness trails. 
b.  Complete, construct, and pave walkways that may be required as a trail link connector in accordance with city standards. Such walkways may be within or abutting residential street rights-of-way. No park dedication credit will be given for these connecting links or construction thereof. 
c.  Provide sufficient public road access and surfaced parking facility as deemed appropriate by the park and recreation commission after consideration of the recommendation of the city engineer for neighborhood parks and community parks. 
(12)  Agreement as to dedication. Agreements in this section shall be made as part of the development agreement presented for approval along with the final plat. Failure of the council and subdivider to reach agreement regarding the matters in this section above shall constitute denial of the plat. 
(13)  Application to re-subdivision. 
a.  In the event of a re-subdivision of a parcel for which park dedication requirements have previously been met, no additional park dedication requirements shall be imposed as a result of the re-subdivision providing the overall density of development of the parcel remains the same as the density allowed under the zoning in effect at the time of the initial subdivision. 
b.  In the event that park dedication requirements were met through the use of a fee per dwelling unit additional park dedication shall be made for each new buildable lot created under re-subdivision. 
c.  The park dedication fee shall be based on the specified contribution per dwelling unit for residential properties resulting from the re-subdivision. 
(14)  Application to no subdivision. A developer of a commercial, industrial or residential development for which no subdivision of property is required shall comply with the park dedication and trail development fee requirements of this chapter as if a subdivision were required prior to receiving any building permit. 
(k)  Floodplain requirements. 
(1)  Review criteria. No land shall be subdivided which is unsuitable for the reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, water supply or sewage treatment facilities. All lots within the floodplain districts shall contain a building site at or above the regulatory flood protection elevation. All subdivisions shall have water and sewage treatment facilities that comply with the provisions of this section and have road access both to the subdivision and to the individual building sites no lower than two feet below the regulatory flood protection elevation. For all subdivisions in the floodplain, the floodway and flood fringe boundaries, the regulatory flood protection elevation and the required elevation of all access roads shall be clearly labeled on all required subdivision drawings and subdividing documents. 
(2)  Floodway/flood fringe determinations in the general floodplain district. In the general floodplain district, subdividers shall provide the information required in section 117-185(b) to determine the 100-year flood elevation, the floodway and flood fringe district boundaries and the regulatory flood protection elevation for the subdivision site. 
(3)  Removal of special flood hazard area designation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established criteria for removing the special flood hazard area designation for certain structures properly elevated on fill above the 100-year flood elevation. FEMA's requirements incorporate specific fill compaction and side slope protection standards for multi-structure or multilot developments. These standards should be investigated prior to the initiation of site preparation if a change of special flood hazard area designation will be requested.

(2)  Trunk and lateral water mains. Water mains and service connections stubbed in to the property line shall be installed to serve all lots in the subdivision and other such properties served by the subdivision water main when the location of such plat is within an area of the city which is either being assessed for water service or for which such service has been authorized by the council. 
(3)  Storm drainage. A system of drainage shall be provided that will conform and implement the city's comprehensive stormwater plan. 
(4)  Stormwater maintenance. Upon successful establishment of permanent erosion control facilities the subdivider shall safeguard the storm sewer system from excess siltation caused by construction until 90 percent buildout within a subdivision, including the sodding, the subdivider shall clean all storm sewers and shall also remove silt from all ponding areas which received runoff from the development as well as all temporary erosion control devices (i.e., silt fence). 
(5)  Streets. Streets shall be constructed which are graded and paved in accordance with specifications provided by the city. 
(6)  Curb and gutter. Concrete curb and gutter shall be installed in those subdivisions where sanitary sewer and water are required. 
(7)  Street traffic control signals. If deemed necessary by the city engineer and council, the owner or subdivider shall install street traffic control signals. The signalization shall be constructed in conjunction with the street unless the council grants a waiver to delay signalization. In the event such waiver is granted, the owner or subdivider shall deposit with the city a sum of money equivalent to the engineer's estimated cost of the signalization. 
(8)  Lot grading. All lots shall be graded in accordance with the final grading plan. In addition, erosion control measures shall be followed to eliminate erosion. Upon completion of the grading, at least four inches of topsoil, as defined in section 117-1, or an approved alternative as referenced in section 117-348, shall be applied to all exposed ground areas. And said areas shall be landscaped in accordance with the final landscape plan. 
(9)  Trail development. Trail improvements shall be installed as shown on the final plat and/or master trail plan. All accessible bikeway/walkway trailways shall be constructed of a minimum two-inch bituminous mat on a four-inch gravel base. Grades and specifications shall be as approved by the city engineer.

(14)  Boulevard sodding. This item shall be completed just prior to occupancy of the building. This item may be completed sooner provided the subdivider maintains the sod until the dwelling or structure is occupied. Boulevard sod shall be installed over at least four inches of topsoil, as defined in section 117-1, or an approved alternative as referenced in section 117-348. 
(15)  Water shutoff boxes. The water shut-off boxes shall be adjusted at the time the final boulevard grade is established. Water shut-off boxes shall remain visible after the boulevard sod is installed. 
(16)  Easement acquisition. Prior to the time of construction, the owner or subdivider shall obtain all easements required for the project. At the time the project is complete and turned over to the city, all easements not dedicated on the final plat shall be deeded to the city in a separate recordable document. 
(17)  As-built plans. Upon completion of installation of all required improvements, the subdivider shall file with the city copies of plans and specifications showing all improvements as finally constructed and installed in both digital and paper form as required by the city engineer. Such as-built drawings shall be certified to be true and accurate by the registered engineer responsible for the installation of the improvements. 
(18)  Stage I financial surety. All sums deposited with the city in accordance with this section shall be kept in separate funds which funds shall be encumbered and earmarked for the later construction of the particular improvements within the particular subdivision. These funds are deposited into a non-interest-bearing fund.

(3)  Street lights. After consultation with the provider of electrical services, the city engineer shall place within the development agreement, a street light construction plan that will then be constructed as a Stage II improvement, the cost of purchase, installation and three year's operation and maintenance thereof being included within the development agreement as a Stage II improvement. 
(4)  Inspection. The installation of the above improvements shall be under the control and supervision of the city engineer who shall specify the manner in which such installations shall be made. 
(5)  Monuments. No final plat shall be approved by the council unless the owner or subdivider shall have placed and installed survey monuments of a permanent character at all points as shown on the final plat as required by the engineer and county surveyor. All United States, state, county or other official benchmarks, monuments or triangulation stations in or adjacent to the property shall be preserved in precise position. 
(6)  Stage II cash deposit. All sums deposited with the city in accordance with this section shall be kept in separate funds which funds shall be encumbered and earmarked for the later construction of the particular improvements within the particular subdivision; provided, however, that the deposits for Stage II improvements may be merged into a single fund. 
(e)  City participation, residential developments. 
(1)  Certain improvements. The owner or subdivider engaged in the development of lands which are zoned residential may request city participation in the payment of the costs of the installation of improvements listed in subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section. City participation shall be negotiated with the subdivider and established by the city council pursuant to entering into a development agreement. The council shall, on a case-by-case basis, determine infrastructure impact on areas outside the subdivision. City required oversizing of infrastructure beyond the appropriate standard residential or commercial equivalent may be eligible for funding by the city. Source of city funding shall not be a determinate of financial participation. 
(2)  Installation by city. All Stage I improvements shall be planned, designed, inspected and/or approved by the city engineer. The administrative charges of the city in connection with such improvements shall be included in the costs determined in subsection (c) of this section. 
(3)  Minimum escrow requirements for Stage I improvements. 
a.  For city-awarded improvements, the owner or subdivider shall provide a financial surety in a form acceptable to the city in a minimum amount equal to 20 percent of the city engineer's estimated cost of installing the Stage I development improvements described in subsection (c)(2) of this section. 
b.  For non-city-awarded improvements, the owner or subdivider shall provide a financial surety in a form acceptable to the city equal to 125 percent of the total cost of such improvements as estimated by the city engineer, including the billable estimated expense of the city for engineering, legal, fiscal, administrative and other expenses incurred by the city in connection with the making of such improvements. Upon total completion of Stage I improvements (including the removal of temporary erosion control measures), acceptance by the city, supported by appropriate lien waivers, the subdivider may request a release of the financial guarantee, but only if the maintenance guarantee required has been deposited. 
(4)  Development agreement. There shall be a development agreement that shall provide that in the event the required improvements are not completed within the specified timeline, all amounts held in the development agreement may be drawn upon by the city and applied by the city to the cost of completing the required improvements. If the funds available within said escrow are not sufficient to complete the required improvements, the necessary additional cost to the city shall be assessed against the subdivision. Any balance remaining in the escrow fund after such improvements have been made and all expenses therefor have been paid shall be returned to the subdivider. 
(5)  Final escrow requirements for Stage I improvements. The minimum escrow requirements described above are subject to increase based on the subdivider's financial status in relation to the project size. That is, the escrow requirements may vary with each subdivider depending on his creditworthiness. The final escrow amount, above the minimums described above, shall be determined by the council. Each subdivider may be required to submit with his development application current audited financial statements. The city will then review and analyze the financial statements and then issue its opinion as to the financial strength of the subdivider in relation to the proposed project. The report will then be the basis for the city to determine what, if any, additional escrow over and above the minimum described in subsection (e)(3) of this section will be necessary before the project proceeds. The city may require access to the subdivider's records in order to test the accuracy of the subdivider's audited financial statements. 
(6)  Assessment. In the event the subdivider opts for the city to construct the Stage I improvements and upon completion of the city ordered Stage I improvements, the city shall cause to be specially assessed in the manner provided by Minn. Stats. ch. 429, 100 percent of the cost of said improvements. The assessments shall be levied against the benefited lots in the subdivision requiring payment in full over a period of five years, or as determined by the city council, together with interest. At the time of the application for a certificate of occupancy for any structures built on a lot which benefit by the improvements, the owner of the lot shall pay to the city finance department the principal balance of such assessment remaining unpaid, together with accrued interest thereon. The escrow required in subsections (e)(3) and (4) of this section shall not be released even though the original subdivider or owner may have conveyed the subject property. The escrow amount may be reduced on a quarterly basis to an amount equal to the then outstanding balance of special assessments. 
(7)  Stage II improvements escrow. A cash deposit equal to 125 percent of the city engineer's estimated cost of the Stage II improvements shall be deposited with the city finance department. 
(8)  Requirements waived. The council, in its discretion, may waive the foregoing requirements of this section if all of the following conditions are met: 
a.  The owner or subdivider must reside on the property being developed and such property must have been classified for tax purposes as the owner or subdivider's homestead. 
b.  The division of the property must include the entire property, meet the requirements of the zoning code for division of property and such division must be achieved by an approved and recordable plat. 
c.  The individual parcels resulting from such a plat shall be for single-family residential use only and each such parcel shall be of such size, configuration and topographical quality as to be capable of accommodating a single-family residential structure. 
d.  The individual parcels resulting from such a plat shall be no more than five in number, including any parcel retained by the owner or subdivider as his homestead. 
e.  The requirements of this section relating to the subdividing of land shall be applicable to any such division of lands and properties. 
f.  Lands and properties abutting land and property being so divided shall themselves have previously been platted and divided, it being the intent of the council not to waive the requirements of this section with respect to land. 
g.  The estimated market value of each parcel as determined by the assessor following such division of land and property must exceed the amount of special assessments previously levied and allocated to each parcel, including the amount of assessments estimated to be levied again in accordance with this section by reason of such division of land and property. 
(f)  City participation, nonresidential developments. 
(1)  Certain improvements. The owner or subdivider, engaged in the development of lands and properties which are zoned nonresidential may request city participation in the payment of the costs of the improvements as listed in subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section. City participation shall be negotiated with the subdivider and established by the city council pursuant to entering into a development agreement. The council shall, on a case-by-case basis, determine infrastructure impact on areas outside the subdivision. City-required oversizing of infrastructure beyond the appropriate standard residential or commercial equivalent shall be eligible for funding by the city. Source of city funding shall not be a determinate of financial participation. 
(2)  Assessments. The procedure for the installation and assessment of the cost of improvements under this section shall be the same as that provided for improvements in areas zoned for residential classifications pursuant to subsection (d) of this section except that: The financial surety guaranteeing payment of the special assessments for sanitary sewer, stormwater and water system improvements shall obligate the owner or subdivider for the length of the assessment. 
(g)  Subdivider may perform work, election. The owner or subdivider may elect to construct the improvements required by this section at his own expense and without city participation in the expense thereof. In such event, the owner or subdivider may retain an engineer and contractor to plan, design and install such improvements, subject to review and inspection by the city engineer.
