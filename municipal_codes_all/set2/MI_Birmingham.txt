PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Birmingham, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1963 Code, as supplemented through November 11, 1991, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1963 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Allen Z. Paul, Supervising Editor, and Ron McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Judith A. Benn, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

State Law reference- Mandatory that Charter provide for ordinances, MCL 117.3(k), MSA 5.2073(k); general authority relative to adoption of ordinances, Mich. Const. 1963, Art. VII, § 22. 
Section 2. - [Effective date.] 
    Every ordinance shall take effect immediately upon publication unless otherwise provided in this Charter or in the ordinance itself. 
Section 3. - [Publication of ordinances.] 
    It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause every ordinance, except as hereinafter provided, to be published by printing the same in a newspaper circulating within the city. The clerk shall immediately after such publication enter in the "Ordinance Book," under the record of the ordinance, a certificate under his hand stating the time and fact of such publication. Such certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the due publication of the ordinance. 
    The codification of city ordinances need not be published by printing the same in a newspaper circulating within the city. Upon such codification being completed, the city commission shall provide for making copies thereof available for public inspection and for distribution to the public at a reasonable charge therefor. Such printing and making available of the codification shall constitute publication of any such codification, notwithstanding any other provision of this Charter relating to the publication of ordinances. Any such codification may originally include provisions not previously contained in any city ordinance. 
(Amend. of 4-2-62) 
State Law reference- Authority to codify, MCL 117.5b, MSA 5.2084(2). 
Section 4. - [Recording of ordinances.] 
    All ordinances shall be recorded in an indexed book marked "Ordinance Book," and the record of each ordinance shall be authenticated by the signature of the mayor and clerk. Such record and authentication shall be done within one week after the final passage of any ordinance, but failure to so record and authenticate any ordinance shall not invalidate it or suspend its operation. 
Section 5. - [Repealed ordinances.] 
    No repealed ordinance shall be revived unless the whole or so much as is intended to be revived shall be re-enacted. When any section or part of a section of any ordinance is amended, the whole section as amended shall be re-enacted. 
Section 6. - [Penalties for violation.] 
    The commission shall have authority to provide in any ordinance for the punishment of those who violate the same, by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or imprisonment for a period not exceeding ninety days, or both, in the discretion of the court. Such ordinance may further provide that in case any person shall fail to pay any fine so imposed, he may be imprisoned until such fine shall be paid, provided that no person shall be imprisoned for a single violation of any ordinance for a longer period than ninety days. Such imprisonment may be in the city prison, if any, in the county jail of Oakland County, or in any penal institution in the state authorized by law to receive prisoners from the city. 
Editor's note- Notwithstanding the limitations of this section, MCL § 117.3(k) permits the City to adopt an ordinance the violation of which may be punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $500.00, or both, if the violation substantially corresponds to a violation of state law that is a misdemeanor for which the maximum period of imprisonment is 93 days. 
Section 7. - [Statute of limitations.] 
    Prosecution for violation of any ordinance of the city shall be commenced within two years after the commission of the offense; provided that the limitations herein imposed shall only apply to violations penal in their nature, and shall not be construed as a limitation of the city's right to forfeit any franchise, grant or license for violation of the terms and conditions thereof, after said two year period. 
Section 8. - [Recovery of penalty.] 
    Whenever a penalty shall be incurred for the violation of any ordinance, and no provision shall be made for the imprisonment of the offender upon conviction thereof, such penalty may be recovered in an action in assumpsit. And when a corporation shall incur a penalty for the violation of any such ordinance, the same shall be sued for in an action in assumpsit. In either of the cases above mentioned if the court shall find the defendant guilty, he shall render judgment for all or such part of the maximum fine specified in the ordinance as he would impose in a similar case commenced by warrant. Prosecutions for violations of the ordinances of the city may, in all cases except against corporations, be commenced by warrant for the arrest of the offender. Such warrant shall be in the name of the people of the State of Michigan, and shall set forth the substance of the offense complained of, and be substantially in the form and be issued upon complaint made, as provided by law in criminal cases. And the proceedings relating to the arrest and custody of the accused during the pendency of the suit, the pleadings and all proceedings upon the trial of the cause and in procuring the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and in the rendition of judgments and the execution thereof shall, except as otherwise provided by this Charter, be governed by and conform as nearly as may be, to the provisions of law regulating proceedings in criminal causes.

(1)  Option I. Ten years certain and life option thereafter. If a retired member dies before he has been paid 120 monthly retirement allowance payments, the payments shall be continued for the remainder of the period of 120 months to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the board prior to the effective date of his retirement. If there is no such designated beneficiary surviving the retired member, such remaining monthly payments shall be continued and paid to the estate of the survivor of the retired member or his last surviving beneficiary; 
(2)  Option II. Survivor retirement allowance. Upon the death of a retired member, his reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as he shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the board prior to the effective date of his retirement; or 
(3)  Option III. Modified survivor retirement allowance. Upon the death of a retired member, one-half of his reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as he shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the board prior to the effective date of his retirement.

This subsection shall not apply to any member who retired prior to the date of the adoption of this section. 
(c)  If any benefits become payable under section 2-235 on account of the death of a retired member: 
(1)  No retirement allowance shall be paid to his designated survivor beneficiary under Option II or III above, and 
(2)  If his death occurs before he has received in retirement allowance payments an aggregate amount equal to, but not exceeding, his accumulated contributions standing to his credit in the reserve for members' contributions at the time of his retirement, the difference between his accumulated contributions and the aggregate amount of retirement allowance payments received by him shall be paid to his designated beneficiary, if living, otherwise to his estate.

Prior to the effective date of his retirement, a member may revoke his election of Option II and nominate a beneficiary as provided in this subsection. Upon the death of a member, who has an Option II election in force, his beneficiary, if living, shall immediately receive the same retirement allowance which the beneficiary would have been entitled to receive had the member retired the day preceding the date of his death, notwithstanding that he may not have attained his normal retirement age. The Option II shall be applied to a retirement allowance computed according to section 2-225 for a beneficiary of a deceased member. If a member has an Option II election in force at the time of his retirement, his election and nomination of beneficiary shall thereafter continue in force, unless prior to the effective date of his retirement, he elects to receive his retirement allowance as a regular retirement allowance or according to an option provided for in section 2-227. No benefits shall be paid under this subsection on account of the death of a member if any benefits are paid under section 2-235 on account of his death.

If no such designated person survives the retired member or the beneficiary of a deceased member dies prior to the payment to the retired member and beneficiary of an aggregate amount equal to the accumulated contributions standing to the retired member's credit, such difference shall be paid to his estate. No benefits shall be paid under this subsection on account of the death of a retired member if he was receiving a retirement allowance provided in section 2-235. 
(b)  If a member dies when receiving benefits under Option I, II, or III above and there is no designated person surviving the retired member, the board shall pay to his estate the difference, if any, between the retired member's accumulated funds at the time of his retirement, and the total retirement allowance received by the retired member prior to his death.

(1)  For the period from the date of his disability retirement to his attainment of his normal retirement age, if he retired prior to his normal retirement age, he shall receive a duty disability retirement allowance which, when added to his primary disability retirement allowance, will provide a disability retirement allowance equal to 60 percent of his final average compensation; provided, that during the statutory period for payment of his worker's compensation, but in no case beyond his attainment of his normal retirement age, the total of his primary disability retirement allowance, his weekly worker's compensation converted to an annual basis, and his duty disability retirement allowance shall not exceed 70 percent of his final average compensation.

(Ord. No. 1523, § 1.726, 6-8-92; Ord. No. 2076, 1-9-12; Ord. No. 2093-1, 6-25-12) 
Sec. 2-234. - Disability reexamination. 
(a)  At least once each year during the first five years following the retirement of a member with a disability retirement allowance, and at least once in each three-year period thereafter, the board may, and upon the retired member's application shall, require any disability retired member who has not attained his normal retirement age, to undergo a medical examination to be made by or under the direction of the medical director. Should any disability retired member who has not attained his normal retirement age refuse to submit to such medical examination in any such period, the board may suspend payment of his disability retirement allowance until his withdrawal of such refusal. If such refusal continues for one year, all his rights in and to a disability retirement allowance shall be forfeited by him.

In returning the retired member to active service, reasonable latitude shall be allowed the city in placing him in a position commensurate to his type of work and rate of compensation at the time of his retirement. 
(b)  If a disability retired member who has not attained his normal retirement age, is or becomes engaged in an occupation, business or employment, his disability retirement allowance shall not exceed the difference between his final average compensation and his pay or earnings from such occupation, business or employment.

Sec. 2-235. - Duty death benefits. 
    If a member dies as the result of a personal injury or disease arising solely and exclusively out of and in the course of his employment with the city, or a disability retired member, while in receipt of worker's compensation on account of his city employment, dies prior to his normal retirement age as the result of the same injury or disease for which he was retired, and in either case, such death, injury or disease resulting in death, be found by the board to have been the result of his actual performance of duty in the service of the city, the applicable benefits provided in subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section shall be paid, subject to subsection (4) of this section, and subject to the condition that the beneficiaries eligible to retirement allowances apply for and are in receipt of worker's compensation on account of the death of the member or retired member. 
(1)  In the case of the death of a member, the accumulated contributions standing to his credit in the reserve for members' contributions at the time of his death shall be paid in accordance with section 2-236. 
(2)  If the deceased individual was covered by social security: 
a.  The surviving spouse shall receive a retirement allowance equal to the surviving spouse's weekly worker's compensation converted to an annual basis. Such surviving spouse's retirement allowance shall begin upon termination of the statutory period for payment of such worker's compensation and shall continue until death. If such worker's compensation benefits are paid in the form of a lump sum, the statutory period shall be the number of months equal to the amount of the lump sum divided by the monthly payment to which the spouse would be entitled if payment was received in monthly payments. 
b.  His unmarried child or children under age 18 years shall each receive a retirement allowance equal to such child's weekly worker's compensation converted to an annual basis. Such child's retirement allowance shall begin upon termination of the statutory period for payment of such child's worker's compensation and shall continue until his attainment of age 18 years, or death, whichever occurs first. If a surviving spouse's retirement allowance is terminated, each such child's retirement allowance shall be increased by an equal share of such surviving spouse's retirement allowance. 
c.  His parents shall each receive a retirement allowance equal to such parent's weekly worker's compensation converted to an annual basis. Such parent's retirement allowance shall begin upon termination of the statutory period for payment of such parent's worker's compensation and shall continue until his death. 
(3)  If the deceased individual was not covered by social security: 
a.  The surviving spouse shall receive a retirement allowance equal to one-third of his final compensation; provided, that during the statutory period of payment of the surviving spouse's worker's compensation, the surviving spouse's retirement allowance shall be reduced by the amount of such weekly worker's compensation converted to annual basis. Upon death, the retirement allowance shall terminate. 
b.  His unmarried child or children under age 18 years shall each receive a retirement allowance of an equal share of one-fourth of his final compensation. If there is no surviving spouse or if the surviving spouse's retirement allowance is terminated, each such child's retirement allowance shall be an equal share of one-half of such final compensation; provided, that in no case shall any such child's retirement allowance exceed one-fourth of such final compensation. During the statutory period for payment of such child's worker's compensation, his retirement allowance shall be reduced by the amount of his weekly worker's compensation converted to an annual basis. Upon any such child's attainment of age 18 years, or death, whichever occurs first, his retirement allowance shall terminate and there shall be a redistribution by the board to the remaining eligible children of such deceased member or retired member, as the case may be. 
c.  His parents shall each receive a retirement allowance equal to one-sixth of his final compensation; provided, that during the statutory period for payment of such parent's worker's compensation, such retirement allowance shall be reduced by the amount of his worker's compensation converted to an annual basis. Upon a parent's death, his retirement allowance shall terminate.

(b)  Upon the death of a member, his accumulated contributions at the time of his death shall be paid, except as otherwise provided in this division, to such person as he shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the board.

(1)  An additional amount equal to the member's contribution to the City of Birmingham Retiree Health Benefits Plan plus the interest that would have been credited if such contributions had been made to the City of Birmingham Employees Retirement System shall be paid to the member from the reserve for employer contributions. 
(2)  The amount of the member's retirement allowance shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of the total amount paid to the member from the reserve for members' contributions and the reserve for employer contributions. The amount of the reduction shall be determined based on the mortality assumption adopted by the retirement board and the immediate annuity interest rate published by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in effect for the month of retirement.

Every member shall be deemed to agree to the deductions made and provided for herein. 
(d)  In addition to the contribution deducted from the compensations of a member, if a member has withdrawn any funds from the reserve for members' contributions, the member shall redeposit in the reserve for members' contributions, by a single contribution or by an increased rate of contribution as approved by the board, all amounts he may have previously withdrawn from, and not repaid to, the reserve for members' contributions, together with regular interest computed from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment. If such member dies, becomes disabled or retires prior to the full repayment of such funds and interest thereon, the member shall be credited with additional service credit in the same proportion as the partial repayments made to the reserve for members' contributions. If the member terminates employment for any reason other than death, disability or retirement, the member shall not be given credit for service rendered prior to the date he withdrew his accumulated contributions until he repays to the reserve for members' contributions all amounts due the fund by him. 
(e)  Upon retirement of any member, his accumulated contributions shall be transferred from the reserve for members' contributions to the reserve for retirement benefit payments.

Members, upon completing a minimum of five years of service with BERS, will be eligible on or before June 30, 2010 to purchase credit for up to five years of prior municipal service. Municipal service is defined as service with a city, village, township, or county government, including with a public library operated by said entities, a state library or any other library substantially funded with taxpayer funds, within the United States, or U.S. Military service. U.S. Military service is defined as service while on full-time active duty with one or more branches of the United States military from which the employee received an honorable discharge.

4.

5.  No service purchased under this provision for credit under BERS will affect eligibility for any other employment benefit provided by the city. 
6.  No service purchased under this section shall be used to satisfy age and service eligibility requirements for retirement under BERS. 
7.  The funds paid to BERS to buy-back years of service hereunder shall be allocated to the reserve for employer contributions established pursuant to section 2-239. 
8.  A member (or his or her beneficiary in the case of death) who has bought back years of service under this provision and who ceases to be an employee of the city for any reason, may rescind such buy-back and receive a refund of the funds paid to BERS for such buy-back, plus interest accumulated at the same rate and in the same manner as provided in section 2-242. In such event, all years of service credited to such member as a result of such buy-back shall be forfeited.

For purposes of the provisions of this subsection, BERS shall permit direct roll-overs from an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and/or from an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision. Such rollover amount shall be limited to the amount payable by the member for the buy-back and shall be applied against the amount payable by a member to buy-back years of service under this provision. Any such rollovers shall be separately accounted for by BERS, and in the event a member (or his or her beneficiary in the case of death) elects to receive a refund of the buy-back amount pursuant to the provisions of subsection 2-248(c)(8), such rollover amount shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions, be eligible to be treated as a direct rollover to another eligible retirement plan, at the option of the member (or his or her beneficiary in the case of death).

Sec. 2-313. - Exception. 
    This article does not authorize the withholding of information otherwise required by law to be made available to the public or to a party in a contested case under Act No. 306 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1969 (MCL 24.201 et seq., MSA 3.560(101) et seq.), as amended.

Sec. 2-314. - Determination of public interest. 
    The city manager, with the advice and consent of the commission, shall designate an individual as the city's FOIA coordinator. The FOIA coordinator, or his or her designee, shall be responsible for accepting and processing requests for the city's public records under this article and shall determine when the exemption of public records from disclosure under section 2-312 shall be asserted. In making such a determination, the FOIA coordinator, or his or her designee, shall determine that the public interest in nondisclosure outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The determination of nondisclosure by the FOIA coordinator, or his or her designee, is appealable to the city commission, or the requesting person may commence an action in the circuit court to compel the city's disclosure of the public records within 180 days after the FOIA coordinator's, or his or her designee's, determination to deny a request or the city's denial on appeal of the request. If the requesting person seeks an appeal to the city commission, the commission shall consider the appeal at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the commission following submission of the written appeal. If the commission fails to respond to a written appeal or, if the commission upholds all or a portion of the disclosure denial, the requesting person may seek judicial review of the nondisclosure by commencing an action in circuit court.

Sec. 2-315. - Examination of public records. 
(a)  Nonexempt public records may be examined as provided by the act. 
(b)  The city manager is hereby empowered, subject to commission approval, to make reasonable rules necessary to protect the city's public records and to prevent excessive and unreasonable interference with the discharge of city functions by persons examining public records. 
(Code 1963, § 1.404) 
Sec. 2-316. - Copies of public records. 
(a)  Copies of nonexempt public records shall be made available upon request as required by the Act. "Written request" means a writing that asks for information, and includes a writing transmitted by facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic means. 
(b)  The city manager is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of the commission, to establish procedures and guidelines as required by section 4(3) of the Act in establishing fees and charges for providing copies of public records. Copies of nonexempt public records shall be furnished at a charge not to exceed the city's actual out-of-pocket cost based on the hourly wage of the lowest public employee capable of retrieving the information necessary to comply with a request under this article. A search for a public record may be conducted or copies of public records may be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge if the commission determines that a waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because searching for or furnishing copies of the public record can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public. A public body shall utilize the most economical means available for making copies of public records. A fee shall not be charged for the cost of search, examination, review, or the deletion or separation of exempt from nonexempt information as provided in section 2-312 unless failure to charge a fee would result in unreasonable cost to the public body because of the nature of the request in the particular instance, and the public body specifically identifies the nature of these unreasonably high costs. A public body shall establish and publish procedures and guidelines to implement this subsection. 
(c)  The city manager is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of the commission, to establish the subscription price for commission proceedings and for any other public records which are created, issued or disseminated on a regular basis. 
(d)  The city may require at the time the written request is made a good-faith deposit from the person requesting public records or a series of public records, if the fee authorized under this section exceeds $50.00. The deposit shall not exceed one-half of the total fee. A copy of a public record shall be furnished without charge for the first $20.00 of the fee for each request to an individual who submits an affidavit stating that the individual is then receiving public assistance or, if not receiving public assistance, stating facts showing inability to pay the cost because of indigency. 
(e)  An employee of the city who receives a request for a public records shall promptly forward the request to the FOIA coordinator, or his or her designee. 
(f)  The FOIA coordinator shall keep a copy of all written requests for public records on file for not less than one year.

DIVISION 5. - VACANT PROPERTY REGISTRATION AND MAINTENANCE 

Sec. 22-356. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to help protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens by preventing blight, protecting property values and neighborhood integrity, avoiding the creation and maintenance of nuisances and ensuring safe and sanitary maintenance of dwellings, commercial and industrial buildings. 
    Due to a number of reasons including but not limited to mortgage fraud, foreclosures, bankruptcies, etc, many homes and buildings become vacant and unsupervised. This causes properties to become attractive nuisances. Vacant properties have a negative impact on surrounding properties and neighborhoods. Potential buyers are deterred by the presence of nearby vacant abandoned buildings. There is an increased instance of unsecured or open doors and windows, broken water pipes, theft of metals and other materials, overgrowth of grass, weeds, shrubs and bushes, illegal dumping and vermin activity at vacant structures. Such neglect devalues properties and causes deterioration in neighborhoods and commercial areas. Further, it is important for the city to be able to contact owners of vacant properties for fire safety and police purposes. 
    It is the intent of the city, through the adoption of this division requiring the registration and maintenance of vacant and abandoned properties by parties asserting a collateral or other legal or other interest in such properties, to establish a mechanism to protect residential neighborhoods and commercial districts from becoming blighted through the lack of maintenance and to provide for the security of abandoned properties. Nothing in this division shall be construed as waiving, relieving or otherwise excusing an owner of property from compliance with applicable property maintenance rules, regulations, and all other codes and ordinances of the city. Such owner or owners shall at all times remain responsible and liable therefore. 
(Ord. No. 2070, 10-24-11) 
Sec. 22-357. - Scope.

(Ord. No. 2070, 10-24-11) 
Sec. 22-358. - Conflicting provisions.

The city hereby declares that it would have passed this division, and each section, subsection, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses and phrases be declared unconstitutional. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.

(e)  All transmission and distribution structures, lines, poles, conduits, fixtures and equipment erected by a franchisee in the city shall be located so as not to endanger life or property or interfere with the normal use of streets, alleys or other public ways and places, so as to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of the general public and adjoining property owners and so as not to interfere with existing traffic control, street lighting, gas, electric, telephone, water hydrant or other public utility installations and so as to comply with the then current edition of the National Electrical Safety Code, and the Telephone System Practices Governing Joint Attachment Practices and their successor documents, as well as in conformance with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations and/or codes of the federal, state and municipal governments. If the city engineer determines any of such equipment erected by a franchisee violates the provisions outlined in this subsection, he may require a franchisee to alter or remove any or all of the offending equipment. 
(f)  Prior to the commencement of construction, a franchisee shall file with the city maps, plats, and records of the locations and character of all facilities to be constructed, including underground facilities and shall have received prior approval from the city engineer for such construction. A franchisee is required to maintain current and accurate maps, plats and permanent records for public inspection and to file such documents with the city annually. 
(g)  In the case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalks, driveway, lawn or other surfacing, a franchisee shall, at its expense, promptly replace and restore all such surfacing to its original condition. 
(h)  The city may, upon reasonable notice, require a franchisee, at its expense, to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove a franchisee's equipment from a particular area of the city's streets if reasonably necessary by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street construction or vacation, change or establishment of communication lines, tracks, traffic signals, street lighting or by reason of other conditions. Reasonable notice for this provision shall be construed to mean at least ten days, except in the case of emergencies. 
(i)  A franchisee shall have the authority, upon prior approval of the city manager or his designated representative, to trim any trees upon and overhanging the streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the city so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with wires and cables of a franchisee, except that at the option of the city, trimming may be done by it, or under its supervision and direction, at the expense and liability of a franchisee. In trimming any trees, a franchisee shall not go upon private property without the consent of the owner. Any damage caused to the property of building owners or users, or of any other person, by the franchisee's negligence shall be repaired fully and promptly at a franchisee's sole expense.

Such test or tests shall be made and the reports of such tests shall be delivered to the city no later than 14 days after the city commission formally notifies a franchisee. 
h.  The city's rights under subsection (b)(3)g. of this section shall be limited to requiring tests, analysis, and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on such complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as the city has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public substandard cable service. All costs for such tests shall be borne by the franchisee. 
i.  Reports required pursuant to subsection (b)(3)g. of this section shall include information setting forth the nature of the complaint or other evidence which precipitated the special tests; what system component was tested, the equipment used and procedures employed in such testing, the results of the testing and the resolution of the complaint or problem. Any additional information pertinent to the special test or specifically requested by the city shall be reported. 
j.  All performance testing shall be done under the supervision and direction of a qualified engineer, not on the permanent staff of the franchisee. The engineer shall be selected by a franchisee and approved by the city manager or his designated representative, after reviewing the individual's professional qualifications and a statement, provided by the engineer, indicating all associations or relationships of any nature which that individual may currently have or may formerly have had with the franchisee.

The credit specified in this section shall be equal to one-thirtieth of the subscriber's total monthly bill for all services and equipment multiplied by the applicable number of days, but excluding any pay-per-view charges; provided, however, if such monthly bill includes any charge for a pay-per-view program subject to such outage or significant impairment, then the credit shall be increased by the amount of such charge.

Such charges so assessed shall be collected in the same manner as general city taxes. 
(d)  Exceptions to alarm fees. Alarms resulting from alarm system malfunctions, if corrective measures have been instituted within a 96-hour period following the false alarm with notification to the police department, will not constitute a false alarm provided that the alarm user presents documentation of repair service having been performed by the alarm company to remedy a malfunction.

(2)  Within ten days of the date of receipt of the alarm notification form, the alarm user shall return the completed form to the police department. 
(f)  Request for exception. Within ten working days of the receipt of an "alarm notification form," an alarm user wishing to qualify for an exception described in subsection (d) of this section may do so by a written request. The request to the police department shall contain documentation of the circumstances involved. Within ten days of the receipt of the waiver request, the police chief or his designee shall make a determination on the waiver request and shall notify the alarm user of the decision in writing. 
(g)  Excessive alarms. Any alarm system which signals more than three alarms within one consecutive 12-month period shall be deemed to constitute a public nuisance and such alarms in excess of three within such period shall constitute excessive alarms subject to corrective action as set forth in this section. 
(h)  Corrective action. The city manager may institute a corrective action in the event excessive false alarms are signaled by any alarm system. Such corrective action may include one or more of the remedies enumerated in the ordinance, institution of ordinance violation proceedings, imposition and collection of user fees by billing and/or by institution of civil action, and institution of civil proceedings for court ordered abatement of nuisances.

Sec. 74-323. - Transportation by minors; impoundment of vehicle. 
(a)  No person, upon a highway of this city or any place open to the general public or generally accessible to motor vehicles, including areas designated for the parking of vehicles, shall, while under the age of 21 years, knowingly transport or possess, in a motor vehicle alcoholic liquor unless the person is employed by a licensee under Act No. 8 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1933, Extra Session (MCL 436.1 et seq., MSA 18.971 et seq.), as amended, the liquor control commission, or an agent of the liquor control commission and is transporting or having the alcoholic liquor in a motor vehicle under the person's control during regular working hours and in the course of the person's employment. A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor. As part of the sentence, the person may be ordered to perform community service and undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense. This section does not prevent a person less than 21 years of age from knowingly transporting alcoholic liquor in a motor vehicle if a person at least 21 years of age is present inside the motor vehicle and is aware of the presence of alcoholic liquor in the motor vehicle. 
(b)  Within 30 days after the conviction of a person for the violation of subsection (a) of this section, which conviction has become final, complaint may be made by the arresting officer or the officer's superior before the court from which the warrant was issued, which complaint shall be under oath and shall contain a description of the motor vehicle in which alcoholic liquor was possessed or transported by the person less than 21 years of age in committing the offense and praying that the motor vehicle be impounded as provided in this section.

The order to show cause shall have a date and time fixed in the order for a hearing, which date shall not be less than ten days after the issuance of the order and shall be served by delivering a true copy to the owner not less than three full days before the date of hearing or, if the owner cannot be located, by sending a true copy by certified mail to the last known address of the owner. If the owner is a nonresident of the state, service may be made upon the secretary of state as provided in section 403 of Act No. 300 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1949 (MCL 257.403, MSA 9.2103), as amended. 
(c)  If the court determines upon the hearing of the order to show cause, from competent and relevant evidence, that at the time of the commission of the offense the motor vehicle was being driven by the person less than 21 years of age with the express or implied consent or knowledge of the owner, and that the use of the motor vehicle is not needed by the owner in the direct pursuit of the owner's employment or the actual operation of the owner's employment business, the court may authorize the impounding of the vehicle for a period to be determined by the court, of not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days. The court's order authorizing the impounding of the vehicle shall authorize a law enforcement officer to take possession without other process of the motor vehicle wherever located and to store the vehicle in a public or private garage at the expense and risk of the owner of the vehicle. The owner of the vehicle may appeal the order to the circuit court of the county, and the provisions governing the taking of appeals from judgments for damages shall be applicable to the appeal. This section shall not prevent a bona fide lienholder from exercising rights under a lien. 
(d)  No person shall knowingly transfers title to a motor vehicle for the purpose of avoiding this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.

(1)  If the court finds that the person has one such prior conviction, the court shall order the secretary of state to suspend the operator's or chauffeur's license of the person for a period of not less than 90 days and not more than 180 days. The court may order the secretary of state to issue to the person a restricted license after the first 30 days of the period of the suspension in the manner provided for in MCL 257.319(7). In the case of a person who does not possess an operator's or chauffeur's license, the secretary of state shall deny the application for an operator's or chauffeur's license for the applicable suspension period. 
(2)  If the court finds that the person has two or more such prior convictions, the court shall order the secretary of state to suspend the operator's or chauffeur's license of the person for a period of not less than 180 days and not more than one year. The court may order the secretary of state to issue to the person a restricted license after the first 60 days of the period of the suspension in the manner provided for in MCL 257.319(7). In the case of a person who does not possess an operator's or chauffeur's license, the secretary of state shall deny the application for an operator's or chauffeur's license for the applicable suspension period. 
(f)  A law enforcement agency, upon determining that a person less than 18 years of age allegedly violated this section, shall notify the parent or parents, custodian, or guardian of the person as to the nature of the violation if the name of a parent, guardian, or custodian is reasonably ascertainable by the law enforcement agency.

(a)  A minor shall not purchase or attempt to purchase alcoholic liquor, consume or attempt to consume alcoholic liquor, possess or attempt to possess alcoholic liquor, or have any bodily alcohol content, except as provided in this section. A minor who violates this subsection is responsible for a civil infraction or guilty of a misdemeanor as follows: 
(1)  For the first violation, the minor is responsible for a civil infraction and shall be fined not more than $100.00. The court may order a minor under this subdivision to participate in substance use disorder services as defined in Section 6230 of the Public Health Code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the administrator of the office of substance abuse services, and may order the minor to perform community service and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense as described in subsection (e). A minor may be found responsible or admit responsibility only once under this subdivision. 
(2)  If a violation of this subsection occurs after one prior judgment, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor under this subdivision is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 days if the court finds that the minor violated an order of probation, failed to successfully complete any treatment, screening, or community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that conviction or juvenile adjudication, or by a fine of not more than $200.00, or both. The court may order a minor under this subdivision to complete a term of probation, participate in substance use disorder services as defined in Section 6230 of the Public Health Code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the administrator of the office of substance abuse services, to perform community service, and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at his or her own expense as described in subsection (e). 
(3)  If a violation of this subsection occurs after two or more prior judgments, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor.

(b)  An individual who furnishes fraudulent identification to a minor or, notwithstanding subsection (a), a minor who uses fraudulent identification to purchase alcoholic liquor, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $100.00, or both. 
(c)  If an individual who pleads guilty to a misdemeanor violation of subsection (a)(2) or offers a plea of admission in a juvenile delinquency proceeding for a misdemeanor violation of subsection (a)(2), the court, without entering a judgment of guilt in a criminal proceeding or a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the juvenile has committed the offense and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place the individual on probation. The terms and conditions of that probation include, but are not limited to, the sanctions set forth in subsection (a)(3), payment of the costs including minimum state cost as provided for in Section 18m of Chapter XIIA of the Probate Code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.18m, and Section 1j of Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 769.1j, and the costs of probation as prescribed in Section 3 of Chapter XI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 771.3. If a court finds that an individual violated a term or condition of probation or that the individual is utilizing this subsection in another court, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt, or a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense, and proceed as otherwise provided by law. If an individual fulfills the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall discharge the individual and dismiss the proceedings. A discharge and dismissal under this section is without adjudication of guilt or without a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense and is not a conviction or juvenile adjudication for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law on conviction of a crime. An individual may obtain only one discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The court shall maintain a nonpublic record of the matter while proceedings are deferred and the individual is on probation and if there is a discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The secretary of state shall retain a nonpublic record of a plea and of the discharge and dismissal under this subsection. These records shall be furnished to any of the following:

(d)  A misdemeanor violation of subsection (a) successfully deferred, discharged, and dismissed under subsection (c) is considered a prior judgment for the purposes of subsection (a)(3). 
(e)  A court may order an individual found responsible for or convicted of violating subsection (a) to undergo screening and assessment by a person or agency as designated by the department-designated community mental health entity as defined in Section 100a of the Mental Health Code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1100a, to determine whether the individual is likely to benefit from rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug education and alcohol or drug treatment programs. A court may order an individual subject to a misdemeanor conviction or juvenile adjudication of, or placed on probation regarding, a violation of subsection (a) to submit to a random or regular preliminary chemical breath analysis. The parent, guardian, or custodian of a minor who is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6, may request a random or regular preliminary chemical breath analysis as part of the probation. 
(f)  The secretary of state shall suspend the operator's or chauffeur's license of an individual convicted of a second or subsequent violation of subsection (a) or of violating subsection (b) as provided in Section 319 of the Michigan Vehicle Code, 1949 PA 300, MCL 257.319. 
(g)  A peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe a minor has consumed alcoholic liquor or has any bodily alcohol content may request that individual to submit to a preliminary chemical breath analysis. If a minor does not consent to a preliminary chemical breath analysis, the analysis shall not be administered without a court order, but a peace officer may seek to obtain a court order. The results of a preliminary chemical breath analysis or other acceptable blood alcohol test are admissible in a civil infraction proceeding or criminal prosecution to determine if the minor has consumed or possessed alcoholic liquor or had any bodily alcohol content. 
(h)  The city police department, on determining that an individual who is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6, allegedly consumed, possessed, or purchased alcoholic liquor, attempted to consume, possess, or purchase alcoholic liquor, or had any bodily alcohol content in violation of subsection (a) shall notify the parent or parents, custodian, or guardian of the individual as to the nature of the violation if the name of a parent, guardian, or custodian is reasonably ascertainable by the city police department. The city police department shall notify the parent, guardian or custodian not later than 48 hours after the city police department determines that the individual who allegedly violated subsection (a) is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6. The city police department may notify the parent, guardian, or custodian by any means reasonably calculated to give prompt actual notice including, but not limited to, notice in person, by telephone, or by first-class mail. If an individual less than 17 years of age is incarcerated for violating subsection (a), his or her parents or legal guardian shall be notified immediately as provided in this subsection. 
(i)  This section does not prohibit a minor from possessing alcoholic liquor during regular working hours and in the course of his or her employment if employed by a person licensed by this act, by the commission, or by an agent of the commission, if the alcoholic liquor is not possessed for his or her personal consumption.

Sec. 74-337. - Purpose. 
    The city determines that alcohol and controlled substance use by persons less than 21 years of age should be regulated. Unregulated use creates serious social problems, including but not limited to injury and harm to persons and property caused by vehicles operated by persons less than 21 years of age under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances, disturbance of the peace, and other devastating effects upon minors and the public at large. It is further determined that the regulation of house parties, involving alcohol and controlled substance use by persons less than 21 years of age, requires sponsoring persons to assume responsibility. Prohibiting persons less than 21 years of age from attending such parties, will significantly reduce the incidence of problems attributable to alcohol and controlled substance use by persons less than 21 years of age.

(1)  The excess by which any special assessment proves larger than the actual cost of the improvement and expenses incidental thereto may be placed in the general fund of the city if such excess is five percent or less of the assessment. 
(2)  Should the assessment prove larger than necessary by more than five percent, the entire excess shall be refunded on a pro rata basis according to assessments to the owners of the property assessed as shown by the current assessment roll of the city, provided, however, no refunds shall be made of less than $20.00.

b.  No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any outstanding evidence of indebtedness secured in whole or in part by such special assessment. 
(b)  Additional pro rata assessments may be made when any special assessment roll proves insufficient to pay for the actual cost of the improvement for which it was levied and the expenses incident thereto, provided that the additional pro rata assessment shall not exceed 25 percent of the total assessment originally confirmed unless a public hearing before the commission is first held to review and confirm such additional assessment, for which hearing notices shall be published and mailed as provided in the case of review of the original special assessment roll.

(Ord. No. 1637, 3-24-97) 
Sec. 94-14. - Assessment against single lot. 
    When any expense shall be incurred by the city upon or in respect to any separate or single lot or parcel of land which, by the provisions of this chapter, the city commission is authorized to charge and collect as a special assessment, and not being of that class of special assessments required to be made pro rata upon several lots or parcels of land in a special assessment district, an account of the labor, materials, or services for which such expense was incurred and the name and address of the owner or person chargeable therewith, if known, shall be reported to the commission in such manner as it may prescribe. The provisions of this chapter with reference to special assessments generally, and the proceedings necessary before making the improvements, shall not apply to assessments to cover the expense incurred in respect to that class of improvements contemplated in this section. 
(1)  No improvement or expense shall be subject to special assessment under this section unless the owner of or party in interest in the property to be so assessed shall receive ten days' notice by mail of any meeting at which commission action on such an improvement, expense, or special assessment is to be considered, with such notice to be provided in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in this chapter. 
(2)  The commission shall determine what amount or part of every expense is to be assessed and the person, if known, against whom such expense shall be charged, and the lot upon which the same shall be levied as a special assessment; and as often as the commission shall deem it expedient, it shall require all of the several amounts so reported and determined, and the several lots or parcels of land and person chargeable therewith, respectively, to be reported by the treasurer to the manager for assessment. 
(3)  Upon receiving the commission's report, the manager shall make a special assessment roll, and levy as a special assessment upon each lot so reported to him and against the persons chargeable therewith, if known, the whole amount of all the charges so directed to be levied upon each lot or parcel of land respectively, together with a penalty of ten percent, and when completed, the manager shall report the assessment to the commission and thereupon the same proceeding shall be had as provided in this chapter for special assessments in other cases, except the commission may require that the same be paid in one or any other number of installments not to exceed five; provided that the notice of the filing of the special assessment roll in such cases, and of the reviewing of the same, may be given by sending such notice by registered mail to the persons named in such roll at their last known address, instead of giving notice by publication. If such notice is given by publication, the commission may order the cost thereof to be added to the roll and distributed pro rata according to the amount of the special assessments therein. It shall not be necessary to make a separate roll for each lot or parcel of land against which such an assessment may be made, but assessments against several lots or parcels of land may be included in one roll. 
(Ord. No. 1637, 3-24-97; Ord. No. 1962, 4-21-08) 
Sec. 94-15. - Assessments for off-street parking. 
    When the proposed public improvement is a facility to provide public off-street parking, the commission may determine that any lot within the proposed assessment district which is developed to a floor area ratio of less than 1.0 will be additionally benefited if at some time in the future additional floor area is constructed on such property. In such instances, a resolution adopted pursuant to section 94-8 shall direct the manager to prepare the assessment roll by including therein a deferred assessment benefit, to be calculated as follows: 
(1)  The manager shall compute the estimated benefit to the lot to be assessed using the actual square footage of land and building at the time of such assessment, to achieve the primary assessment figure. 
(2)  The manager shall compute for each lot in the district the maximum additional square footage of building which could be added to the property under the current zoning ordinance without providing additional square footage of building which could be added to the property under the current zoning ordinance without providing additional on-site parking. If such property has, at the time of assessment, a floor area ratio of 1.0 or greater, no deferred off-street parking assessment shall be entered against such property. whether the lot or parcel is not being utilized at the time of assessment at the maximum floor area ratio of 1.0, the manager shall compute a deferred off-street parking assessment based on the additional allowable potential building area computed above and shall enter such amount on the roll as the deferred off-street parking assessment on such property. 
(3)  Such deferred off-street parking assessments shall be canceled at the time of development if the building constructed or enlarged is residential in character. Primarily residential buildings shall be defined as any building with two or more stories in which the first floor or any portion thereof is occupied by a commercial or business use and all additional stories are utilized for residential purposes. 
(Ord. No. 1637, 3-24-97; Ord. No. 1962, 4-21-08) 
Sec. 94-16. - Deferred off-street parking assessments. 
(a)  The manager shall enter the amount of any deferred off-street parking assessment upon the roll at the time of its preparation. Such assessment shall not be due as to any lot against which a deferred off-street parking assessment has been made until it shall be developed so as to increase the floor area existing at the time of the assessment by five percent or more or increase the floor area ratio to 1.0. Upon the issuance of a building permit authorizing such an increase in floor area, the city commission shall, by resolution, confirm the making of the deferred off-street parking assessment and it shall be due and payable in full within 30 days.

(b)  Deferred off-street parking assessments may be paid in full at the owner's option, at any time after the roll of primary assessments has been confirmed. A building owner may elect to finance a deferred off-street parking assessment with the primary assessment if such an election is made in writing and filed with the city treasurer within 14 months after confirmation of the primary assessment roll. Interest on a deferred off-street parking assessment shall not start to accrue until 60 days after such deferred off-street parking assessment was confirmed by the commission.

In addition, snow shall be removed from a minimum three-foot area surrounding all fire hydrants to within six inches from the ground or to the surface of the sidewalk if the hydrant is located along a sidewalk. Further, the person to whom a license is issued for a multiple-family dwelling, as defined in chapter 126 of this Code, pursuant to section 22-331 et seq. shall clear all ice and snow from all public sidewalks adjoining the lot and all pedestrian walkways leading from a public sidewalk to an entrance of the multiple-family dwelling within the time required in this section. 
(b)  Snow shall be removed from the front of the building to the street, including from the side of any building to the street for those buildings located on a street corner. Snow removal shall also include those areas around parking meters such that clear and unimpeded access from the parking areas to the sidewalks is maintained. For those properties where the sidewalk abuts the street, snow shall be removed from the entire sidewalk to the street. For those properties where the sidewalk does not directly abut the street because of a grass strip separating the sidewalk from the road, snow removed from the sidewalk may be stored on the grass strip so long as the storage of snow in that location does not violate any other regulation in this Code, including the regulations in 98-66(a) regarding the clearing requirements around fire hydrants. 
(c)  When any snow or ice shall cease to fall or form during the daylight hours, such snow or ice shall be cleared as set forth in this section within 12 hours after such cessation.

(d)  Notwithstanding the above provisions, if the snow and/or ice accumulation shall be such that, in the sole discretion of the director of engineering and public service, or his designee, it becomes necessary to immediately remove the accumulations for the health, safety and/or welfare of the public, the department of public services shall be authorized to deploy city employees and/or contractor to remove the snow as it deems necessary. The expenses of clearing shall be billed to the property owner for the cost thereof at rates established by the city commission and shall become a debt to the city from the owner or occupant of such lot and shall be collected as any other debt of the city. If payment is not received by the city within 60 days after such billing, a special assessment roll shall be created as provided in chapter 94 of this code.

The expenses of clearing shall become a debt to the city from the owner of such lot and shall be collected as any other debt of the city, and shall become a lien upon the property immediately upon the sidewalk being cleared by the city. 
(b)  Payment shall be due to the city within 30 days of the bill being sent to the property owner for the performance of such services. The bill shall notify the property owner of his or her right to dispute all or any part of the bill before a Hearing Officer, as established by section 1-17 of this Code, prior to the due date of the bill. Except as otherwise determined by the hearing officer, if payment is not received by the city within 30 days after such billing, the city treasurer shall add an additional penalty of one percent per month to the delinquent bill. The city treasurer shall annually, on May 1, certify any delinquent billing, or any part thereof, together with all accrued interest and penalty, to the commission; and, it shall be transferred and reassessed, with an additional 15 percent penalty, on the next annual city tax roll. Such charges so assessed shall be collected in the same manner as general city taxes. Any and all subsequent violation(s) of this chapter shall also result in the issuance of a citation to the business establishment in the amount of $100.00. 
(c)  The director of engineering and public service or his designee shall notify the owner of any parcel of land, or the agent of the owner, to keep the property clear of snow as required in section 98-66.

ARTICLE VII. - NEWSRACKS 

Sec. 98-160. - Purpose and intent. 
    The City of Birmingham hereby finds and declares: 
(1)  The city has a substantial interest in promoting the public health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and visitors by ensuring that public streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way are not unreasonably obstructed by newsracks, that newsracks are properly maintained, and that newsracks do not create a visual blight in the city. 
(2)  In recent years, the proliferation of newsracks on city streets, and particularly poorly maintained or abandoned free-standing newsracks, have contributed to the congestion of city sidewalks, impeded the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, interfered with the use of streets, sidewalks and public rights-of-way, presented hazards to persons and property, resulted in visual blight, and hindered the ability of public services such as sidewalk and street cleaning. Certain newsracks have been placed in inappropriate locations, have been abandoned, are poorly maintained, and have been used as trash receptacles causing unsightly and unsanitary clutter and litter. 
(3)  The city has a substantial interest in preserving and protecting its unique visual and aesthetic qualities as identified in the City of Birmingham Master Plan. To that end, and consistent with the Downtown Birmingham 2016 Report, it is in the best interest of the city to take steps to solve and reduce the negative effects of this problem. 
(4)  After conducting an extensive study and inquiry into this problem, it has become clear that an effective way to remedy this problem is to require that all newspapers and other publications desiring to be sold or provided in newspaper racks on city sidewalks or other public property or rights of way be placed in and sold from modular units which are provided by the city at locations commensurate with the locations at which newspapers and other publications are currently being sold or provided. 
(5)  The purpose of this article is to accomplish the following: 
a.  Provide for increased pedestrian and vehicular safety and convenience; 
b.  Ensure that there is no unreasonable interference with the free flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic including ingress into, or egress from, any residence, place of business or public facility, or any legally parked or stopped vehicles; 
c.  Ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and improve passage for persons with disabilities by reducing impediments to passage caused by poorly-located newsracks; 
d.  Provide reasonable access for the safe and efficient use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, police or fire call boxes, sidewalk elevators, delivery areas, loading zones, transit shelters, curb ramps, parking meters, and locations used for public transportation services; 
e.  Reduce visual blight, clutter and litter problems associated with poorly maintained, improperly located or abandoned newsracks; 
f.  Protect the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the city; 
g.  Advance the economic interests of the city's businesses and residents, including the interests of those involved in the publication or distribution of newspapers and news periodicals through newsracks; and 
h.  Prevent newsracks from unduly interfering with city sidewalk and street cleaners as well as other public services. 
(6)  In adopting this article, the city is mindful that regulation of newsracks implicates rights protected by the Constitution of both the United States and the State of Michigan. To that end, this article was drafted and shall be applied and enforced in a manner consistent with these constitutional rights. The content or viewpoint of the material to be distributed through modular newsrack units shall not be considered in administering or enforcing this article. 
(7)  Given the limited space available and the increasing congestion on certain public sidewalks, streets and rights-of-way, the city has a substantial interest in devising a systematic approach to newsrack placement in those locales to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of newspapers. This objective may be achieved by providing modular newsrack units in certain locations in the city. Utilizing newsrack units and prohibiting free-standing newsracks will promote the city's interest in promoting public safety, reducing visual blight and clutter, protecting the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the city, and advancing the economic interests of the city's businesses and residents by improving the appearance of the area and resulting in better use of space and reduced congestion. 
(8)  A reasonable accommodation of these competing interests can be achieved by adoption of this article, which reasonably regulates the placement of newsracks in specified areas.

All meters 11/2 inches or over must have a bypass as required by the superintendent. 
(Code 1963, § 2.40) 
Sec. 114-42. - Meter location. 
(a)  Meters shall be set in accessible locations and in a manner satisfactory to the superintendent. Meters shall be set as close as practicable to the point where the water service pipe enters the building. In no case shall a meter be set where it is liable to injury or where it cannot readily be reached by the meter reader. The portion of the water service pipe between its entrance into the building and the meter shall be installed and maintained in a manner to make it accessible for inspection by the city at any time. 
(b)  A meter shall be placed in a pit rather than in the building being served when the superintendent determines that placement of the meter within a building would work an unusual hardship on the property owner or on the department. The superintendent may require that a meter be placed in a pit: 
(1)  Where the distance from the water main to the building is more than 200 feet; or 
(2)  Where the superintendent determines that due to the nature of the installation there is a greater than normal potential for control problems or leaks developing in the service pipe. 
(c)  Placement of a meter in a pit shall be done in accordance with the requirements of the superintendent and at the sole expense of the owner. 
(Code 1963, § 2.41)

Sec. 114-53. - Construction service; deposit. 
    At the time application is made for a service connection to a building under construction, the applicant shall deposit with the city treasurer the sum set forth in the schedule of fees, charges, bonds and insurance to guarantee maintenance during the construction period of the water stop box, which sum shall be retained by the city until final inspection of the premises by the plumbing inspector, and until the plumbing inspector shall determine that the stop box has been properly maintained and set to finish grade. If the plumbing inspector shall determine that the stop box does not pass inspection, the city shall correct the same and apply the full deposit for the services so rendered. 
(Code 1963, § 2.56; Ord. No. 1507, § 2.56, 11-25-91; Ord. No. 2010, 2-8-10) 
Sec. 114-54. - Multiple service. 
    A single water service shall not serve several premises under separate ownerships unless the owners of such premises, by common agreement or otherwise, make arrangements for installations, metering, billing and discontinuance of service to such premises which are satisfactory to the superintendent of the water department. A building under one ownership consisting of several premises may be served by one or more water services and meters, but in no case shall the number of water services and meters exceed the number of premises. Two or more adjacent buildings under common ownership may have a separate water service and meter for each principal building. When more than one meter is served by one water service, all meters served by the service must operate from a manifold type arrangement. Failure of one unit in the manifold arrangement to pay for water received will result in a discontinuance of water to that meter. In multiple installations, no totalizing meter will be installed or read by the department. In addition to each water service allowed under this section, one separate fire line service is allowed. Where multiple premises are consolidated to result in less premises and more than one water service to a premises, such additional services may continue to be used with the approval of the superintendent. In cases where it is impractical to provide water service in accordance with the requirements of this article, the superintendent may authorize one or more additional water service connections for a premises. Cross connections between water service pipes are prohibited. 
(Code 1963, § 2.57) 
Sec. 114-55. - Converted multiple premises. 
    Where a building originally built as a single building or premises and fitted with one service pipe shall thereafter be subdivided and such subdivision shall be separately owned, the separate divisions so made must be connected to the main by separate service pipes, or otherwise modified to meet the requirements of section 114-54, within 30 days after such division. 
(Code 1963, § 2.58) 
Sec. 114-56. - Disconnection of water services. 
    All water service pipes, which are not to be used as a result of conversion of multiple premises, building changes, service replacement, or for any other reasons shall be disconnected at the main. The owner shall obtain a permit from the city and shall pay for the disconnection charge set forth in the schedule of fees, charges, bonds and insurance for every service pipe disconnected. Application for the permit shall be made within 30 days after the discontinuation of use of the service. A water service pipe which serves a building or portion of a building which is to be removed, and which meets City Code requirements for a new service pipe may be reused for a new building with the approval of the superintendent. No charge will be made by the city for a water service pipe to be reused in a new building. No charge will be made for a meter reused in a new building provided a building permit is applied for no more than one year following the removal of the building or portion of building; and further provided the meter is the same size as the one removed. A disconnection permit will not be required and there will be no disconnection charge in conjunction with a water service replacement, if the service location is unchanged at the property line, or the water department determines it is practical to connect the replacement service to the main at the location where the old service is to be discontinued. 
(Code 1963, § 2.59; Ord. No. 2010, 2-8-10) 
Sec. 114-57. - Meter removal, replacement, special service. 
(a)  A charge as set forth in the schedule of fees, charges, bonds and insurance shall be made by the department for customer requested removal and replacement of any water meter, except there will be no charge for removing and replacing a water meter that is removed and tested in accordance with section 114-45, where on such test the meter is found to register over three percent more water than actually passes through it. 
(b)  A charge as set forth in the schedule of fees, charges, bonds and insurance shall be made by this department for customer requested service performed at times other than within the normal seasonal working hours of the department, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. 
(c)  Such service work shall include shutting off water, turning on water and repairing or replacing damaged meters.

Sec. 114-58. - Backyard water main abandonment. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is the protection of health, safety and public welfare by authorizing the city's director of engineering department to develop a written procedure and take the necessary actions to abandon any water mains currently located in the rear yard and require the affected residents to connect to the water main system either currently existing, or that which will be constructed, in the city street. The city has determined that the rear yard water mains should be abandoned and no longer used for several reasons including, but not limited to, that said water mains are nearing or have exceeded the end of their service life; are increasingly in need of repairs as they age; subject to corrosion; pipe failure causing damage to private rear yard improvements such as trees, landscaping and garages that are located over or near the water main; corrective action when repairing/replacing water mains causing damage to same. In addition, existing rear yard water mains are typically smaller than current standards require. Existing mains typically have reduced flow due to internal sedimentation and tuberculin buildup on the inside pipe walls. Fire hydrants are not accessible or effective if located in the rear yard. 
(b)  Procedure to be developed. The city engineering department shall develop a procedure for the abandonment of the rear yard water mains and set forth the requirements for disconnecting from the rear yard water mains and for connection to the water main located, or to be located, in the city street. Said procedure shall include the procedure, requirements and timing of disconnection and connection. 
(c)  Procedure approval. The procedure developed, or any amendment thereto, shall not become effective until approved by the city commission. The approved procedure and all subsequent amendments approved by the city commission shall be incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the approved procedure and any amendments thereto, shall be sent to all properties currently serviced by a rear yard water main. A copy of the approved procedure shall also be available for review at the city's engineering department during normal business hours. 
(d)  Connection and disconnection required. The owners of all houses, buildings or properties currently serviced by a rear yard water main are hereby required, at the owner's own expense, to arrange for and complete the connection to the water stop box provided by the city at or near the front of the property and disconnect from the rear yard main as required and within the time frames set forth in the approved procedure, including obtaining the necessary permits, paying the appropriate fees and obtaining city inspections and approvals for said work as set forth in the city's ordinances. 
(e)  Penalty for non-compliance. 
(1)  Any person who fails to disconnect and connect as set forth in this section and the approved procedure shall be considered in violation of this ordinance and shall be subject to a fine of no less than $100.00 per offense. 
(2)  Each day that a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a separate offense. The rights and remedies set forth for violations of this section are cumulative and in addition to any other remedies provided by law.

Sec. 114-75. - Boiler connections. 
    No steam engine boilers shall be directly connected to the water service pipe. The owner shall provide a tank of sufficient capacity to afford a supply for at least ten hours, into which the service pipe shall discharge. 
(Code 1963, § 2.65) 
Sec. 114-76. - Water use reduction emergency. 
    No person shall make any outdoor use from the public water supply except in response to a fire emergency in any area designated within the city during a water use reduction emergency. The owner of the property on which the water meter being utilized for such outdoor use is located or any person in control of such property shall be responsible for any violation of this section. 
(1)  Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this section: 
a.  SOCWA means the Southeastern Oakland County Water Authority. 
b.  Water use reduction emergency means a situation where SOCWA determines the water usage from the water distribution system is of such volume that, unless restricted, the public health, safety and general welfare are likely to be endangered. 
(2)  Declaration. Whenever SOCWA determines that the public health, safety and welfare are endangered based on: 
a.  A prolonged drought or other period of system-wide heavy demand that results in supply facilities, including system pump stations and reservoirs, being operated at their optimum capacity with no apparent means immediately available to adequately maintain flows and residual pressures throughout the system, or 
b.  Any emergency condition which may adversely affect operating flows and residual pressures in any substantial portion of the system for any appreciable length of time, SOCWA shall put into effect a water use reduction emergency for all or any part or parts of the city by declaring it in a manner prescribed in this section. 
(3)  Duration.

(Code 1963, § 2.140) 
Sec. 114-171. - Required lateral replacement. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is the protection of the health, safety and public welfare by requiring the replacement of lateral sewer lines when necessary and to bring them up to current standards when the city street over which the public sewer is located is open for repairs or reconstruction and access to the public sewer and lateral sewer lines are the most accessible for replacements. This is to avoid unnecessarily re-opening the city street in the future to repair lateral sewer lines and reconnect them to the public sewer so that the integrity of the newly constructed street can be maintained. Some of the existing lateral sewer lines are very old and are past, or approaching, the end of their service life, are made of materials no longer deemed suitable for use by the city engineering department, or are constructed in such a fashion that makes it difficult or impossible to reconnect the lateral sewer line to the public sewer. 
(b)  Meanings of words. For purposes of this section, "public sewer line" shall mean the main sewer line located in the road right-of-way; "lateral sewer line" shall mean the portion of the pipe going from the public sewer line to the property line and connecting to the building sewer line; "building sewer line" shall mean the sewer line connecting from the lateral sewer line at the property line to the building located on personal property. 
(c)  Procedure to be developed. The city engineering department shall develop a procedure titled "Procedure for Sewer Lateral Replacement", hereinafter referred to as the "PSLR," for replacement of the lateral sewer lines in accordance with this section when a city street is going to be open for repairs or reconstruction. Said procedures shall include the requirements and timing of said replacement. 
(d)  Procedure approval. The PSLR, or any amendment thereto, shall not become effective until approved by the city commission. The PSLR and all subsequent amendments approved by the city commission shall be incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the PSLR and any amendments thereto shall be sent to all properties in advance of the road opening affecting that property owner. A copy of the PSLR shall also be available for review at the city clerk's office and the city engineering department during normal business hours. 
(e)  Required replacement. At the time that the city street is opened to perform repairs or reconstruction which warrant addressing the replacement of lateral sewer lines, the city's engineering department shall utilize the evaluation criteria set forth in the PSLR to review and consider the condition of the lateral sewer line and the connected building sewer line, for the purposes of determining the integrity of said lines to allow a successful reconnection to the public sewer line during reconstruction. 
(1)  If the city engineering department has determined that the lateral sewer line meets the criteria for replacement set forth in the PSLR, the lateral sewer line will be replaced as a part of the street reconstruction project. The cost of the sewer lateral line replacement will be at homeowner expense. The cost may be eligible for inclusion in a special assessment district if one is established for this purpose. If the lateral sewer line and building sewer line do not meet the criteria in the PSLR for replacement, and otherwise appears to conform to the city engineering department standards at the time of the street repair and its service life appears to warrant its continued use, the existing lines connecting the house to the pubic sewer line may be utilized and maintained. A determination that no replacement is required by the city at the time shall not serve or constitute as any warranty or representation as to the condition of the pipe or its continued suitability, and the property owner may nevertheless opt to replace the lateral sewer line and/or building sewer line and reconnect to the public sewer line, the cost of which shall be borne by the property owner. 
(2)  If the lateral sewer line is not currently approved material, does not conform to the city engineering department standards at the time of the street repair, is in poor condition and/or has a service life warranting replacement in the opinion of the city engineering department, the lateral sewer line shall be replaced and connected to the building sewer line. The cost to replace the lateral sewer line and connect it to the building sewer line shall be specially assessed to the individual property owners. 
(3)  Should a replacement of the lateral sewer line be required, the individual property owner may opt to replace the building sewer line during the construction period and make arrangements to have the property owner's private contractor at the property owner's expense, make the replacement and connection from the house to the lateral sewer line at the property line using the current conforming material and methods. A time frame will be provided by the engineering department to allow the private property owner contractor to perform the work. 
(4)  All work done on private property, which shall include repairs to or replacement of the building sewer line and the required connections, shall be made at the property owner's own expense by way of private contractor and not eligible to be included in a special assessment district. All costs associated with work done on the road, public sewer line, and the lateral sewer line shall be eligible to be included in the special assessment district. Building sewer work performed by the owner's contractor must be completed during a designated period of time while the city's contractor is working or may need to be performed subsequent to the completion of the road as designated by the engineering department. 
(5)  All designated single lots with existing structures, designated double lots with an existing structure and a single lateral sewer line, will come under the criteria for replacement set forth in this section. Designated double lots, as determined by the engineering department, with a structure situated on one lot, will come under the criteria for replacement set forth in this section for the lateral sewer line serving the structure on the double lot and shall have a lateral sewer line installed and capped at the property line serving the vacant second lot. A vacant single lot, shall have a lateral sewer line installed and capped at the property line serving the vacant lot. The cost of the installation of lateral sewer lines on lots under this section shall be specially assessed to the individual property owners.

All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with 40 C.F.R. part 136. 
a.  The limitation for total PCB is non-detect. Total PCB shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 608, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or more samples indicate detectable levels of total PCB, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this section, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the total PCB concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with subsection 114-207(d). 
b.  The limitation of mercury (Hg) is non-detect. Mercury (Hg) shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 245.1, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/1, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or more samples indicate detectable levels of Mercury, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For the purposes of this section, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the mercury concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with subsection 114-207(d). 
All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance 40 CFR Part 136. 
(3)  Compliance period. Within 30 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derives, the department shall notify all industrial user's operating under an effective wastewater discharge permit of the requirement to submit a compliance report within 180 days after the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derives. The compliance report shall demonstrate the user's compliance or non-compliance with these limitations, and, in the event of non-compliance, include the submission of a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with the stated limitation. In no event shall a compliance schedule exceed 18 months from the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derives. An industrial user who does not demonstrate compliance may petition the department for a second extension as part of an administrative consent order. The department shall include appropriate monitoring, reporting, and penalties into an administrative consent order that relates to a second extension, and shall enter into such an agreement only upon a good-faith showing by the industrial user of the actions taken to achieve compliance with this provision. 
(c)  National categorical pretreatment standards. All users shall comply with the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards and requirements promulgated pursuant to the act as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Subchapter N, Effluent Guidelines and Standards, which are hereby incorporated by reference and with all other applicable standards and requirements, provided, that where a more stringent standard or requirement is applicable pursuant to state law or regulation, or to this division, then the more stringent standard or requirement shall be controlling. Affected dischargers shall comply with applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. part 403 and as established by the department. The national categorical pretreatment standards which have been promulgated as of the effective date of this section are delineated in appendix A. 
(1)  Intake water adjustment. Industrial users seeking adjustment of national categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in their intake water must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. § 403.15. Upon notification of approval by the department, the adjustment shall be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are not effective until incorporated into an industrial user's permit. 
(2)  Modification of national categorical pretreatment standards. The department may apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or to the state department of environmental quality, whichever is appropriate, for authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and procedures in 40 C.F.R § 403.7. Such authorization may be granted only when the POTW treatment plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for which a removal credit is being sought, provided, that any limitation of such pollutant(s) in the NPDES permit neither are being exceeded nor pose the prospect of being exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted. Where such authorization is given to the department, any industrial user desiring to obtain such credit shall make an application to the department, consistent with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. § 403.7 and of this division. Any credits which may be granted under this section may be subject to modification or revocation as specified in 40 C.F.R. § 403.7, or as determined by the department. A requisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the industrial user pay a surcharge based upon the amounts of such pollutants removed by the POTW, such surcharge being based upon fees or rates which the board may establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits shall reflect, or be modified to reflect, any credit granted pursuant to this section. 
(3)  New sources. Industrial users who meet the new sources criteria shall install, maintain in operating condition, and 'start-up' all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not to exceed 90 days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
(4)  Concentration and mass limits. When limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the department may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in accordance with sections 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(c)(4) and shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. §1317(d) and of this division. Industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(5)  Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pretreatment standards-baseline report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under section 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit to the department a report containing the information listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(1-7). Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to the director or regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40 C.F.R § 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to resubmit this information. At least 90 days before commencement of any discharge, each new source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the department a report which contains the information listed in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b)(1-5). In such report, new sources shall include information concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the information requested in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b,)(4) and (5). 
(d)  Dilution prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use of process water, or in any way dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation or requirement imposed by the city, the City of Detroit or by the state. 
(e)  Hauled in wastewater. Any waste material or wastewater which is hauled into or within the service region for discharge to the POTW is subject to the requirements of this division including, but not limited to, permits, inspection, monitoring and enforcement. Unloading liquid or solid waste from hauling vehicles, directly or indirectly, into the POTW, with or without the benefit of pretreatment, is prohibited unless the person proposing to unload such waste has applied for and received a permit from the department for unloading such waste in accordance with the board's rules pertaining thereto. The discharger shall be subject to applicable terms and conditions, surcharges, fees or rates as established by the board. Hauled in wastewater shall only be discharged at points designated by the POTW after authorization or approval issued pursuant to the general permit requirements specified in section 114-202. The department may establish specific limitations for sludge from municipally owned or operated POTW treatment plants which are different than the specific limitations in this division. 
(f)  Centralized waste treatment. It is unlawful for a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility to discharge any industrial waste or wastewater into the POTW without a wastewater discharge permit from the department. Any authorization granted, or permit issued, by the department to a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall specify the type of wastewater for which treatment is provided, and discharge approval is sought, from the POTW. Unless such industrial waste or wastewater is determined by the department to require further authorization, a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility that has submitted an application to, and received previous approval from, the department to discharge wastewater is not required to obtain further authorization from the department before discharging such wastewater. 
    An industrial user, that provides centralized waste treatment services and files an application for the treatment and discharge of such types of wastewater to the POTW, shall provide the following minimum information in support thereof: 
(1)  The general nature, source and process(es) generating the type of wastewater. Any wastewater, which is generated from those processes and is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards as delineated in appendix A, shall be so designated; 
(2)  The identity of the toxic pollutants known or suspected to be present in the wastewater; 
(3)  At least one sample report showing the results of an analysis for the EPA priority pollutants for each type of wastewater for which application is made in subsection (f)(1); 
(4)  A statement, that is certified by a professional engineer, which addresses the treatability and compatibility of the wastewater, received or collected by the facility's treatment process(es); 
(5)  The identity of the materials and/or pollutants whose transport or treatment are regulated by the EPA, by the state, or by any other governmental agency. Upon request, the centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall provide a copy of its permit and/or license to the department; and 
(6)  Other information requested by the department including, but not limited to, information required by subsections 114-202(c)(1)-(18), or by rules adopted by the board. 
    The discharge from a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility will be deemed approved for those specific types of wastewater delineated in a permit and, upon issuance of such permit in accordance with the procedures contained in section 114-202, will be deemed approved for discharge into the POTW. The centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall comply with all applicable provisions contained in section 114-202 regarding permits. In furtherance of its obligations as control authority, the department may include in the permit a requirement to report at selected intervals the information mandated in subsections (1) through (6). 
    All users granted a permit under this section shall maintain records which, at a minimum, identify the source, volume, character, and constituents of the wastewater accepted for treatment and disposal. These records may be reviewed at any time by the department. 
(g)  Groundwater discharges. Unless authorization has been granted by the department, the discharge of any groundwater into the POTW is prohibited. 
    The department may authorize the discharge of groundwater resulting from maintenance and related activities of gas, steam, or electrical utilities through the use of general permits. Subject to appropriate reporting requirements, the general permit shall authorize discharge in accordance with the terms of the permit. Utilities shall comply with this provision within 180 days after its enactment. 
    If a person, who proposes to discharge groundwater resulting from purge, response activity, or UST projects, has applied for and received a permit from the department, the department may authorize the discharge of such wastewater. Permits shall be issued in accordance with the procedures contained in section 114-202, or in accordance with any rules adopted by the board. 
(h)  City right of revision. The City of Detroit and the City of Birmingham reserve the right to establish rules or regulations adopted by the board, additional or more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW. Ninety days after adoption by the board, industrial users shall comply with such rules and regulations. 
(i)  Accidental discharges. 
(1)  Each industrial user, which does not currently have an approved spill prevention plan or slug control plan, shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division, and all significant industrial users shall submit to the department detailed plans which show facilities and operating procedures to be implemented to provide protection against such accidental discharges. Facilities and measures to prevent and abate accidental discharges shall be implemented, provided, and maintained at the owner's or industrial user's cost or expense. Unless the significant industrial user has an approved spill prevention or slug control plan, all existing significant industrial users shall complete and submit such a plan within 60 days of the effective date of this division. New significant industrial users shall submit such a plan prior to the time they commence discharging. 
For purposes of this section, the information provided shall include the approximate average and maximum quantities of such prohibited materials or substances kept on the premises in the form of raw materials, chemicals and/or waste therefrom and the containment capacity for each. Only substances that are in a form which could readily be carried into the POTW and constitute a concentration of five percent or greater in the raw material, chemical solution or waste material, are required to be reported. Volumes of less than 55 gallons, or the equivalent thereof, need not be reported unless lesser quantities could cause pass through or cause interference with the POTW. 
The industrial user shall promptly notify the department of any significant changes or modifications to the plan including, but not limited to, a change in the contact person, or substance inventory. 
(2)  At least once every two years, the department shall evaluate whether a significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges, as defined by 40 C.F.R. § 403.8(f)(2)(v). Unless otherwise provided, all significant users shall complete, implement, and submit such a plan within 30 days of notification by the department. 
(j)  Notification requirements. Unless a different notice is provided by this division or applicable law, within one hour of becoming aware of a discharge into the POTW which exceeds or does not conform with federal, state or city laws, rules, regulations or permit requirements, or which could cause problems to the POTW, or which has the potential to cause the industrial user to implement its plan prepared in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, the industrial user shall telephone the department at its control center and notify the department of the discharge. The notification shall include the name of the caller, the location and time of discharge, the type of wastewater, the estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited pollutants and estimated volume, and the measures taken, or being taken, to abate the discharge into the POTW. Within five calendar days after the discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences and when required by the department, the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit may be modified to include additional measures to prevent such future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, cost of treatment, loss, damages or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other environmental impairment or any other damage to person or property. 
(k)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board, or other prominent place, advising employees whom to contact in the department in the event of an actual or excessive or prohibited discharge. 
(l)  Recovery of costs. Any user discharging in violation of any of the provisions of this division, which produces a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the department's POTW, or causes the department to violate its NPDES permit, shall be liable to the department for any expense, loss, damage, penalty or fine incurred by the department because of said violation or discharge. Prior to assessing such costs, the department shall notify the user of its determination that the user's discharge was the proximate cause of such damage, obstruction, impairment, or violation of the city's NPDES permit and the department's intent to assess such costs to the user. Any such notice shall include written documentation which substantiates the determination of proximate cause and a breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this division. Such charge shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any penalties or remedies provided under this division, or this Code, or other statutes and regulations, or at law or in equity. 
(m)  Hazardous waste notification. All industrial users, who discharge into the city collection system, shall notify the department in writing of any discharge of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R.

(5)  Restrict, interfere, tamper with, or render inaccurate any of the department's monitoring devices including, but not limited to, samplers; 
(6)  Fail to comply with any condition or requirement of the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit; 
(7)  Fail to comply with any limitation, prohibition, or requirement of this division including any rule, regulation, or order issued hereunder. Industrial users acting in full compliance with wastewater discharge permits issued prior to the effective date of this division shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this division, and such permits shall remain in effect and be enforceable under this division until a superseding permit is effective. Industrial users shall comply with applicable national categorical pretreatment standards and requirements on the date specified in the federal regulations, regardless of compliance schedules. 
(b)  Upsets. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with national categorical pretreatment standards where the requirements of subsection (1) are met. 
(1)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  At the time, the facility was being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
c.  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the department, orally or in writing, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset and where this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
1.  A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(2)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof; 
(3)  The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with this division upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(c)  Bypass. Bypasses are prohibited unless the bypass does not cause a violation of pretreatment standards or requirements, but only if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2). 
(1)  Notice of anticipated bypass. Industrial users anticipating a bypass shall submit notice to the department at least ten days in advance. 
(2)  Notice of unanticipated bypass. An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes or should have become aware of the bypass. A written submission shall be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes or should have become aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
(3)  Prohibition of bypass and enforcement. Bypass is prohibited, and the department may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user properly notified the department as described in subsection (c)(2). 
(4)  Bypass approval. Where it meets all conditions in subsection (c)(3), the department may approve an anticipated bypass. 
(d)  [When measurement exceeds daily maximum non-detect limit.] Where one or more of the measurements taken for any pollutant defined in subsection 114-200(b) during a six-month period exceed by any magnitude the daily maximum non-detect limit for the same parameter, the industrial user may develop and implement pollution prevention initiatives, or a bmp, as part of its response. The department may, as part of an administrative order, also require development of a BMP as a part of the department's enforcement response. Upon approval of the department, these pollution prevention initiative, or BMPs shall be made an enforceable part of the wastewater discharge permit. Industrial users shall provide, at six-month intervals, analytical results and certifications in support of its implementation of an approved pollution prevention initiative or BMPs. Upon demonstration of compliance, the industrial user may request to be relieved of this implementation requirement. 
(e)  Emergency suspensions and orders. The department may order suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit where, in the opinion of the department, such suspension is necessary to stop any actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, interferes or may interfere with the POTW, or causes or may cause the City of Detroit to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Any person notified of a suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event the department provides informal notification under this section, written confirmation and an order shall be provided within 24 hours. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with any suspension or revocation order, the department shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection or services, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or danger to any individual or the environment. In the event such steps are taken, the director shall notify the industrial user within 24 hours in writing of such action and order, and the specific recourse available. In any event, the department shall provide the industrial user with an opportunity for a hearing before the director, or his designated representative, within ten days of such action. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement to the department within 15 days of the occurrence describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. Upon proof of elimination of the noncomplying discharge, the department shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the sewer or wastewater treatment service. 
(f)  Notice of violation. Except in the case of an actual or threatened discharge as specified in subsection (e), whenever the department has reason to believe that any industrial user has violated or is violating this division, the department shall serve a written notice stating the nature of the violation upon such industrial user. Where applicable, the department shall pursue appropriate escalating enforcement action as defined within its approved enforcement response plan. The failure of the department to issue a notice of violation shall not preclude the department from escalating its enforcement response. 
(g)  Administrative actions. Whenever the department has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, or a pretreatment standard or requirement or any prohibition of this division, the department, may initiate appropriate administrative enforcement action, except in the case of emergency or flagrant violation, in order to compel the industrial user to eliminate or to remedy such violation as soon as possible. 
(1)  a.  Conferences. The department may order any person, who violates this division, to attend a conference wherein the department may endeavor to cause the user to eliminate or remedy the violation by establishing an enforceable compliance schedule. The notice of violation shall be served at least ten days before the scheduled conference and shall set forth the date, time, and place thereof. The conference shall be conducted by a representative of the department. The industrial user shall present a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with this division. Nothing contained herein shall require the department to accept or agree to any proposed plan or schedule, or to prevent the department from proceeding with a show cause hearing as set forth in subsection (2). If the attendees agree upon a compliance schedule, the user and the department's duly authorized representative may enter, by consent, into a compliance agreement or an administrative order setting forth the terms of such agreement. An industrial user must exhibit good faith and expeditious efforts to comply with this division and any procedures, requirements, and agreements hereunder. 
b.  Compliance schedules. The user and the department may agree upon a schedule which sets forth the terms and conditions, and time periods or schedules for completion of actions to remedy or to eliminate the causes of violation. These schedules may be developed as part of a compliance agreement or an administrative consent order. Schedules developed under this subsection shall adhere to the following conditions: 
1.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of upgraded or additional pretreatment facilities, or to the implementation of additional operation and maintenance procedures required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment requirements and standards including, but not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, and completing construction; 
2.  No single increment referred to in subsection 1. of shall exceed nine months; 
3.  Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the department including, at a minimum, whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason(s) for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule; and 
4.  Any deviations from the compliance schedule may result in the industrial user being found in violation of this division.

DIVISION 4. - STORMWATER RUNOFF 

Sec. 114-271. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to regulate the rate of stormwater runoff flow from land within the city in order to protect the public health and minimize the problems resulting from an overloading of the city sewer system. 
(Code 1963, § 2.155) 
Sec. 114-272. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Affected area means that area of land, as determined by the city engineer, which will be affected by proposed construction in such a manner as to increase the rate of stormwater runoff therefrom, when that area is tributary to the city's sewer system. 
    Construction means any activity which will change the rate of stormwater runoff from any affected area, such as the construction or alteration of buildings, and the construction or alteration of surface improvements, such as parking lots. 
(Code 1963, § 2.156) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 114-273. - Permit required. 
    No person shall commence or carry on any construction on any affected area within the city without complying with the provisions of this division and obtaining a stormwater runoff permit from the city engineer, except that this division shall not be applicable to and no permit shall be required for any one of the following: 
(1)  Construction of single-family dwellings together with permitted accessory buildings and other appurtenant improvements; 
(2)  Where the affected area is 3,500 square feet or less; 
(3)  Interior alterations or construction; 
(4)  Alterations to the facade or exterior of a building, landscaping, and other surface improvements that the city engineer determines will not materially affect the rate of stormwater runoff from the affected area; or 
(5)  Construction with a portion of the city which the city commission has, by resolution, designated as exempt from the provisions of this division because the existing capacity of sewers located therein is such that the limitations of this division are not required for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Code 1963, § 2.157) 
Sec. 114-274. - Maximum permitted runoff rate. 
(a)  Construction shall not be permitted in an affected area where the stormwater runoff rate resulting from a ten-year storm will exceed: 
(1)  One cubic foot per second (cfs) per acre, or 
(2)  0.20 cubic feet per second (cfs), whichever is greater. 
(b)  Any affected area where the estimated stormwater runoff will exceed the foregoing maximum permitted amounts must provide stormwater control and retention facilities on or within the affected area. Such facilities shall be so designed, constructed and maintained so that the stormwater runoff originating from the affected area which results from a ten-year storm does not exceed the maximum permitted runoff rate. Such stormwater control facilities shall be constructed in accordance with and in compliance with such standards and regulations as may be established by the city engineer, and approved by the city commission. 
(Code 1963, § 2.158) 
Sec. 114-275. - Application for permit. 
    Permits required pursuant to this division shall be applied for on forms provided by the city engineer and shall be accompanied by such information as he may require, and the applicant shall pay such fee as may be required for the securing of such permit as required by the schedule of fees, charges, bonds and insurance. No permit shall be issued by the city engineer unless he first determines that the proposed construction will not result in stormwater runoff from the affected area in violation of this division.

ARTICLE VI. - STORM WATER UTILITY FEE 

Sec. 114-400. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Combined sewer system: Public sewers, drains, ditches, roads and retention ponds used for collecting and transporting storm water and non-storm water in the city. 
    Director: The city engineer or such other person as the city manager may designate. 
    Equivalent storm water unit (ESWU): A subunit of measurement which relates the volume of storm water discharged from a lot based on the amount of total and impervious lot area, compared to the standard unit. The formula for an equivalent storm water unit (ESWU) is as follows: 
1 ESWU = (0.15 (TAs - IAs) + (0.90 (IAs)) 
where, 
TAs = total area of standard unit; 
IAs = impervious area of standard unit; 
0.15 = runoff coefficient for pervious area; ;b2; 0.90 = runoff coefficient for impervious area. 
    One ESWU in the city is equal to the average runoff potential of the standard unit. 
    Impervious lot area: Impervious area means a surface area that is resistant to permeation by surface water. 
    Industrial sites Those sites that contain industrial activities which require wastewater discharge permits as set forth in section 114-202 of this Code. 
    Nonstorm water: All flows to the combined sewer system not defined as storm water in section 114-199, or as determined by the director. 
    Pervious lot area: All land area that is not impervious. Pervious lot area equals the total lot area, minus the impervious lot area. Pervious lot area has a runoff coefficient equal to 0.15. 
    Runoff potential: The runoff potential from a property is based on hydrologic principles for calculating runoff that use both the impervious surface area and the pervious surface area. Runoff potential is measured in square feet using the following formula: 
Runoff Potential = 0.15x [Total Area - Impervious Area] + 0.9 x [Impervious Area] 
    Separated storm water sewer system: Public sewers, drains, channels, ditches, roads and retention ponds used for collecting and transporting storm water in the city. 
    Standard unit: Single-family residential parcel in the city within a lot size between 1.126 and 0.250 acres. 
    Storm water: Storm water runoff, snow melt runoff and surface runoff and drainage. 
    Storm water utility fee: The fee imposed for the use of that portion of the combined system that transports storm water, based on the number of ESWU's for a lot or parcel of land determined as provided in section 114-402. 
    Storm water sewer system: That portion of the combined sewer system and separated storm water sewer system that is attributable to the transportation and treatment of storm water. 
    User: An owner of property which directly or indirectly contributes to the combined sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 2204, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 114-401. - Storm water utility fees. 
(a)  All users shall pay a storm water utility fee proportional to the volume of storm water which is projected to discharge into the combined sewer system and storm water sewer system from their property. 
(b)  The city commission shall, by resolution, set storm water utility fees at a rate which will recover from each user its share of the costs of the storm water sewer system attributable to the discharge of storm water from the users' property to the storm water system. The city shall use the revenues of the storm water utility fees to pay the costs of the water treatment operation and maintenance of the storm water sewer system, and for necessary improvements and additions to the storm water sewer system. 
(c)  The city may also collect from users fees imposed to pay the implementation and operation of any of the following: 
(1)  Monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures; 
(2)  Reviewing discharge procedures and construction; 
(3)  Discharge permit applications; or 
(4)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to operate the storm water sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 2204, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 114-402. - Calculation of fees and appeals. 
(a)  Single-family residential ESWU. All single-family residential properties in each of the lot-size categories are assigned the same ESWU for that category. The ESWU values for the single-family residential categories are summarized in the fee schedule. 
Property Type SFR Class Single-Family Residential, 0.125 acres or less Class A Single-Family Residential, 0.126 acres to 0.250 acres Class B Single-Family Residential, 0.251 acres to 0.500 acres Class C Single-Family Residential, 0.501 acres to 0.750 acres Class D Single-Family Residential, 0.751 acres to 1.000 acres Class E Single Family Residential, 1.001 acres or larger Class F  
(b)  Non-single family ESWU. The storm water utility fee for non-single family lots shall equal the number of ESWU's for a given lot, multiplied by the annual rate established by the city commission per ESWU per year. The formula for determining the number of ESWU's per non-single family lot shall be calculated from the amount of pervious and impervious lot area as follows: 
Number of ESWU's = 0.15 (TA - IA) + 0.90 (IA) 
Average runoff potential of the standard unit/ESWU 
where, 
TA = total area of each lot (reported in square feet); 
IA = impervious area of each lot (reported in square feet). 
(c)  Any non-single-family residential property owner liable for a storm water utility fee may appeal the determination that the property utilizes the storm water system or the amount of a storm water utility fee, including a determination on a reduction in or the elimination of the fee under subsections (a) and (b). An appeal may be based on the quantity of storm water runoff generated, the reductions established, the reductions allocated, or any other matter relating to the determination of the storm water utility fee. 
(d)  A single-family residential property owner may appeal the determination that the property utilizes the storm water system, however, such an appeal shall be limited to the following reasons: 
(1)  The size of the lot has been miscalculated, or 
(2)  All or part of the storm water runoff drains to an open drainage course, such as a river, lake or creek, which affects the quantity of the storm water runoff generated that gets into the storm water sewer system. 
(e)  An appeal under subsection (c) shall be heard by a storm water utility appeals board appointed by the local unit of government. The appeals board shall consist of three members, two of whom shall be licensed professional engineers not employed by the local unit of government. 
(f)  An appeal of a storm water utility fee shall not be brought more than one year after the fee was billed. 
(g)  To prevail in an appeal of a storm water utility fee, the appellant shall demonstrate in accordance with the requirements of the plan for a non-single-family residential property that the use of the system by the property is less than the amount used by the local unit of government in the calculation of that property's storm water utility fee, or for all properties the classification of the property type is in error, or there was a mathematical error in the calculation of the fee. 
(h)  The sole remedy for a property owner who prevails in an appeal of a storm water utility fee is a prospective correct recalculation of the storm water utility fee. 
(i)  If in an appeal of a storm water utility fee the appeals board finds that the requirements of subsection (g) have not been met, that finding is conclusive until the property is modified to either increase or decrease the utilization of the system. The property owner remains eligible for reduction or elimination of fees under the storm water utility ordinance. 
(j)  A property owner making an appeal shall provide the appeals board with information necessary to make a determination. 
(k)  A person aggrieved by a decision of the appeals board on an appeal under this section may appeal to the circuit court in which the property is located. An appeal to the circuit court must be filed within 30 days of the appeals board's decision. 
(Ord. No. 2204, 12-5-16; Ord. No. 2248, 9-11-17) 
Sec. 114-403. - Credits. 
(a)  The purpose of this section is to provide for each property owner's control over contributions of storm flows to the storm water utility system and the related storm water utility fees and to advance protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(b)  The city shall offer credits on an annual basis that will enable any property owner, through voluntary action, to reduce the storm water utility fees calculated for that property owner's property and will provide a meaningful reduction in the cost of service to the storm water system, or that shall be reasonably related to a benefit to the storm water system. 
(1)  Credits will only be applied if requirements outlined in this chapter and other applicable sections of the City Code are met, including, but not limited to: completion of ongoing maintenance, guaranteed right-of-entry for inspections, and submittal of annual self-certification reports. 
(2)  Credits will be defined as either set fee reduction or percent (%) reductions applied as a credit adjustment to the fee calculation equation. 
(3)  Credits are additive to each credit category. 
(4)  As long as the storm water facilities or management practices are functioning as approved, the credit reduction will be applied to the fee. If the approved practice is not functioning as approved or is terminated, the credit reduction will be cancelled and the fee will return to the baseline calculation. Once the credit reduction has been cancelled, a customer may not reapply for credit for a period of 12 months and only then if the deficiency has been corrected, as determined by city inspection. 
(5)  Credits will be applied to the next complete billing cycle after the application has been approved. 
(c)  The director shall define a method for applying and granting credits on an annual basis, as well as criteria for determining the credits a property owner may receive. The director may, by regulation, establish credits for one or more of the following: 
(1)  Installation and maintenance of rain barrels, rain gardens, bioswales, cisterns, dry wells, infiltration trenches, porous pavement or pavers, or disconnecting footing drains; 
(2)  Installation and maintenance of a storm water control facility, or other water quantity controls; and 
(3)  Other actions of the property owner that, in the judgment of the director, result in a measurable reduction in storm water runoff. 
(Ord. No. 2204, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 114-404. - Billing. 
    The billing for the storm water utility may be combined with the billing for other utility services. Final determinations on measurements per ESWU will be determined by the director. 
(Ord. No. 2204, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 114-405. - Collection. 
    Unpaid storm water utility fees shall constitute a lien against the property affected. Fees which have remained unpaid for a period of six months prior to April 30 may be certified to the city treasurer who shall place the fees on the next tax roll of the city. In the alternative, the city commission may direct the city attorney to take appropriate legal action to collect unpaid fees.

Sec. 127-11. - Design review standards and guidelines. 
(a)  In reviewing plans, the commission shall follow the U.S. secretary of the interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings as set forth in 36 C.F.R. part 67. Design review standards and guidelines that address special design characteristics of historic districts administered by the commission may be followed if they are equivalent in guidance to the secretary of interior's standards and guidelines and are established or approved by the state historic preservation office of the Michigan Historical Center. 
    The U. S. secretary of the interior standards for rehabilitation are as follows: 
(1)  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(2)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
(4)  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(5)  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
(6)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
(7)  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(8)  Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(9)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(b)  In reviewing plans, the commission shall also consider all of the following: 
(1)  The historic or architectural value and significance of the resource and its relationship to the historic value of the surrounding area. 
(2)  The relationship of any architectural features of the resource to the rest of the resource and to the surrounding area. 
(3)  The general compatibility of the design, arrangement, texture, and materials proposed to be used. 
(4)  Other factors, such as aesthetic value, that the commission finds relevant. 
(5)  Whether the applicant has certified in the application that the property where work will be undertaken has, or will have before the proposed project completion date, a fire alarm system or a smoke alarm complying with the requirements of the Stille-DeRossett-Hale single state construction code act, 1972 PA 230, MCL 125.1501 to 125.1531. 
(c)  The commission shall have the responsibility to review proposed projects on all properties within a designated historic district (both historic and non-historic resources).

Additional stories shall be stepped back at a 45-degree angle from the top story allowed by right without the height
bonus.
1. A multi-level parking structure that offers parking available to the public at the rate of one parking space available
to the public for every 300 square feet of building floor area allowed in the additional stories. Where additional
building height is proposed without additional stories, then the parking shall be based upon the building floor area in
the top floor. The applicant may provide payment-in-lieu to the City for construction of parking in a public parking
deck at an offsite location. Parking rates will be calculated as follows:
a. The rate of $27,500 per space to match the current cost per above-ground structured parking space in 2018.
b. Starting July 1st, 2019, the rate of payment per parking space shall be increased by 3 percent each year.
2. Dedication of an improved public plaza with an area that is at least equal to 25% of the additional floor area of
building area allowed in the additional stories. Where additional building height is proposed without additional
stories, then public plaza space shall be based upon 25% of the building floor area on the top floor. The location
and design of the plaza shall be approved by the Planning Board and shall be in accordance with the Triangle
District Urban Design Plan.
3. A mixed use building that provides residential dwelling units above first-floor commercial where a mini- mum of
50% of the buildings floor area is residential.

the United States Green Building Council.
5. Transfer of development rights for additional floor area that zoning would permit on a site containing an historic
building or resource designated under Section 127 of the Birmingham Code. The development rights shall be
dedicated through recording a conservation easement on the designated historic resource, which shall be reviewed
and approved by the Historic District Commission.
F. MU3, MU5 and MU7 Front Yard Building Setback Exceptions: In the MU3, MU5 and MU7 Districts, 75% of the length of
the ground level street-facing façade of the building must be built within 5 feet of the front lot line. The precise setback
between 0 and 5 feet shall be consistent with the front building line along the block, or as determined by the Planning
Board where a clear setback doesnt exist. The Planning Board many grant exceptions to allow a greater amount of the
building to be setback when the front yard area, or forecourt, is used for one or more purposes listed below.
1. Widening the sidewalk along the frontage of the building.
2. Providing a public gathering area or plaza that offers seating, landscape enhancements, public information
and displays, fountains, or other pedestrian amenities.
3. Providing outdoor seating for the proposed use.
G. Parking: Parking lots shall meet the following requirements:
1. Parking lots (not located in the road right-of-way) are permitted only in side and rear yards as follows:

no more than 25% of the total sites frontage or 60 feet, whichever is less, shall be occupied by parking
lot.
b. For a corner lot, the cumulative total of both frontages occupied by parking shall be no more than 25% or 60
feet, whichever is less, and the building shall be located at the corner of the lot adjacent to the intersection.
2/6/2020 Zoning Ordinance - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/birmingham-mi/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-317 83/211
c. For a double frontage lot or a lot that has frontage on 3 streets, the cumulative total of all frontages occupied
by parking shall be no more than 35% of the total sites frontage or 60 feet, whichever is less.
2. Where an off-street parking lot is visible from a street, it shall be screened by a 3 foot tall screenwall located
between the parking lot and the sidewalk, meeting the requirements of Section 4.50. Where a parking lot is
adjacent to a single-family residential district, a 6 foot tall brick screenwall meeting the requirements of Section 4.50
shall be provided between the parking lot and the residential use.
3. Along Woodward Avenue, a single row of parking shall be permitted along the entire front of the building, which
may be located within the road right-of-way. The parking may be angled or parallel with a one-way circulation aisle
only. There shall be a minimum 7-foot wide sidewalk between the parking and the building.
4. Parking structures shall only be permitted where there is usable building space for a portion of the ground level
along the street frontage. Where a parking structure is provided or parking is located on the ground level below the
building, usable building space to a depth of at least 20 feet shall be provided in front of the parking for the
minimum required building length. For a multi-level parking structure, the Planning Board may allow the parking
structure above the first floor of the building to occupy the frontage; provided the façade of the parking structure is
integrally designed with the architecture of the overall building, utilizes the same building materials and has wall
openings that provide proportions, and rhythm that are compatible with building upper story fenestration.

online.encodeplus.com/regs/birmingham-mi/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-317 84/211
5. Each use shall provide the parking required by the off street parking space requirements, except as provided for in
this Section. Off street parking shall be provided for within 300 feet of the building being served.
6. On-street parking shall be allowed on all street frontages, where permitted by the Traffic and Safety Board. Onstreet
parking located along a lots frontage may be credited towards meeting the parking requirements for that
use, provided the streetscape is improved to meet the requirements of Section 3.12.
7. Because the Triangle Overlay District is intended to encourage pedestrian/transit friendly design and compact
mixed-use development that requires less reliance on automobiles, the parking required by Section 4.43 may be
reduced or waived by the Planning Board as follows:
a. Providing shared parking whereby the Planning Board may reduce the total parking required by multiple uses
by up to 50% under Section 4.42(G)(4).
b. By payment of a special assessment levied against the entire building site where the special assessment district
has been created for purposes of constructing a municipal parking facility under Section 4.42(G)(5).
8. Driveway access to off-street parking lots shall be located to provide safe separation from street intersections.
Driveways shall be aligned with driveways on the opposite side of the street or offset to avoid turning movement
conflicts.

4.01 How to Use this Article
Article 4 contains development standards which are arranged by category. There are two ways to determine which
development standards apply to a specific zoning district. They are:
A. Refer to the two-page layouts in Article 2 for a specific zoning district. In the Additional Development Standards that
Apply box for that specific Zoning District are listed four-digit codes that determine which development standards
apply. Only the four-digit codes noted in the Additional Development Standards that Apply section apply to that Zoning
District.
[As an example, on page 2-5in Section 2.04, the four digit code AS-01 can be found under the Additional
Development Standards that Apply section in the Single-Family Residential (R1A) District. Therefore, the
Development Standards in the section labeled AS-01 (on page 04-3in Section 4.02) would apply to the Single-
Family Residential (R1A) District.]
B. Refer to the icons used at the top of each development standard section in Article 4. Each development standard section
begins with a four-digit code and introductory sentence followed by icons with zoning district abbreviations (i.e. for
the Parking District or for the Multiple-Family Residential District). These district icons note that the development
standard written in that section applies to that district.
[As an example, on page 04-3in Section 4.02, the R1A icon can be found under the AS-01 development standard
section. Therefore the language in the AS-01 section would apply to the R1A District.]

2/6/2020 Zoning Ordinance - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/birmingham-mi/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-317 98/211
1. The floodplain shall overlay existing zoning districts delineated on the zoning map. The boundaries of the floodplain
shall coincide with the boundaries of the areas indicated as within the limits of the 100-year flood in the report
entitled "Oakland County Flood Insurance Study" dated September 29, 2006, with accompanying flood insurance
rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps, including Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) (FIRMS) panel numbers
of 26125C0517F, 0529F, 0536F, 0537F, 0538F, and 0541F and dated September 29, 2006. A regulatory floodway
shall be designated within the floodplain. The boundaries of the regulatory floodway shall coincide with the floodway
boundaries indicated on the flood boundary and floodway map. The study and accompanying maps are adopted by
reference, and declared to be a part of this article.
2. The exact location of the limits of the floodplain and the floodway shall be determined by the City Engineer.
C. General Regulations:
1. There shall be no new construction, alterations or additions, or substantial improvements to existing buildings, or
changes in existing topographical features within the floodplain except as hereinafter provided:
a. All new construction and substantial improvements within a floodplain shall:
i. Be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
ii. Be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; and
iii. Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
b. All new and replacement water supply systems shall minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
c. All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems and discharges from systems into floodwaters. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
d. All public utilities and facilities shall be designed, constructed and located to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
e. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
f. Land shall not be divided in a manner creating parcels or lots which cannot be used in conformance with the
requirements of this section.
g. Any altered or relocated watercourse shall maintain its flood carrying capacity even if not subject to state or
federal regulations.
h. Available flood hazard data from federal, state or other sources shall be reasonably utilized in meeting the standards of
this section. Data furnished by the Office of Federal Insurance and Hazard Mitigation shall take precedence over data
from other sources.
2. Where buildings or structures are permitted on the floodplain or on any land immediately adjoining the floodplain by
other sections of this Code, the elevation of the lowest floor shall be determined by the use to be made thereof in
accordance with the following:
a. The elevation of the lowest floor designed or intended for human habitation in residential buildings, and except as
hereinafter provided in this section, the elevation of the lowest floor designed or intended for retail, office, or other
commercial uses in a commercial building shall be at least 2 feet above the elevation of the base flood level.
b. The elevation of a basement floor or other floor not designed or intended for human habitation in a residential
building, and except as provided in this section, the elevation of a basement floor used for storage, mechanical
equipment, and similar uses in a commercial building shall be no lower than the elevation of the base flood level.
c. Floors of parking lot attendants booths, mechanical equipment buildings, garages, parking areas, carports and
similar accessory buildings may be below the elevation of the base flood level.
d. The elevation of the lowest floor, or basement, in a commercial building may be below the elevation required under
this section, provided that the portion of the building below such elevation, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied, and that
the floodproofing methods employed are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and
uplift forces and other factors associated with a base flood in the location of the structure.
D. Floodway Protection Standards:
1. New construction, alterations or additions, substantial improvements and all other development, including fill, shall
be prohibited within the floodplain, except where it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not harmfully increase the
water surface elevation of a base flood. In determining whether a harmful increase will occur, compliance with Act
No. 245 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1929 (MCL
2/6/2020 Zoning Ordinance - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/birmingham-mi/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-317 99/211
323.1 et seq., MSA 3.521 et seq.), as amended by Act No. 167 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1968 shall be
required, provided that the allowable increase shall not exceed 1 foot. The provisions of this section shall not
apply within the regulatory floodway. The provisions of subsection (b) of this section shall be applied to land
situated within the regulatory floodway.
2. All development occurring within the regulatory floodway shall comply with the following standards: encroachments,
including fill, new construction, alterations or additions, substantial improvements and other development shall be
prohibited. Exception to this prohibition shall only be made upon certification by a registered professional engineer
or the department of natural resources that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development will not harmfully increase the water surface elevation of a base
flood. In determining whether a harmful increase will occur, compliance with MCL 323.1 et seq., MSA 3.521 et seq.,
as amended by MCL 323.2a et seq., MSA 3.522 (1) et seq., shall be required, providing that the allowable increase,
including that increase used as the engineering design standard for delineating the floodway, shall not exceed 1
foot.
E. Disclaimer of Liability: The degree of flood protection required by the Zoning Ordinance is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based upon engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. Approval of the use of land under the Zoning Ordinance shall not be considered a guarantee or
warranty of safety from flood damage. The Zoning Ordinance does not imply that areas outside the floodplain will be
free from flood damage. The Zoning Ordinance does not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or
employees thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on the Zoning Ordinance or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.

Lighting Standards (LT)
Contents:
4.21 LT-01
4.22 LT-02
4.23 LT-03
4.21 LT-01
This Lighting Standards section applies to the following districts:
2/6/2020 Zoning Ordinance - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/birmingham-mi/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-317 104/211
A. Intent and Purpose: The purpose of this section is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public by encouraging
lighting practices and systems that will minimize glare and light trespass while recognizing the need for buildings and
sites to be illuminated for safety, security, visibility, and enhancement. This section provides standards for various
lighting forms and situations to improve visibility and curtail the degradation of the nighttime visual environment.
B. Applicability: Recommended Practices of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) will be used as
a guideline for all site lighting decisions of the City of Birmingham. Birmingham ordinances will supersede IESNA when
there is a conflict.
For the purposes of this ordinance, lighting levels within the City of Birmingham will be determined by using Zone
E4 foot-candle levels and practices defined by the IESNA1 as areas of high ambient brightness, normally urban
areas having both residential and commercial use and experiencing high levels of nighttime activity.
The standards in this section shall apply to all outdoor luminaries installed on private property. This ordinance does
not apply to interior lighting. Light emitted outdoors from any structure will be subject to control by this section if it
is determined that it creates a light nuisance or disability glare as defined by section 9.02 of this ordinance.
Properties regulated by Special Land Use Permits, or SLUPs, located in single-family residential zones must comply
with all regulations set forth in this ordinance.
C. Submittal Requirements: The following information must be included for all site plan and/or design review submissions
that involve new construction or new lighting that may significantly alter the light distribution or illuminance on a site, as
deemed necessary by the Planning Division, Planning Board, Design Review Board or Historic District Commission;
1. Location of all outdoor lighting fixtures, including but not limited to freestanding pole fixtures, building- mounted
and canopy mounted luminaries on the site plan and building elevations.
2. Manufacturers specification sheets and details for the type of luminaire(s) being proposed including but not limited
to the proposed lamping and lumens, distribution type and optical control methods.
3. Photometric grid overlaid on the proposed site plan indicating the light intensity throughout the site (in maintained
foot-candles). Calculations must be shown for maintained output at ground level and shown at 5 spacing to 5
beyond all property lines.
4. Any other information deemed necessary by the Building Official or Planning Director in accordance with the intent
and purpose of this section.
D. General Standards:
1. Unless specifically permitted within this ordinance, all luminaries shall be full cutoff or cutoff, as defined in Section
9.02, and positioned in a manner that does not unreasonably invade abutting or adjacent properties. Exception to
cutoff luminaries can be made at the discretion of the Planning Board, Historic District Commission, or Design
Review Board under any of the following conditions:
a. The distribution of upward light is controlled by means of refractors or shielding to the effect that it be used
solely for the purpose of decorative enhancement of the luminaire itself and does not expel undue ambient light
into the nighttime environment.
b. The luminaire is neither obtrusive nor distracting, nor will it create a traffic hazard or otherwise adversely
impact public safety, with appropriate methods used to eliminate undesirable glare and/or reflections.
c. The luminaire is consistent with the intent of the Master Plan, Urban Design Plan(s), Triangle district plan, Rail
District plan and/or Downtown Birmingham 2016 Report, as applicable.
d. The scale, color, design or material of the luminaire will enhance the site on which it is located, as well as be
compatible with the surrounding buildings or neighborhood.
e. Lighting designed for architectural enhancement of building features (i.e. architectural enhancement lighting).
Appropriate methods shall be used to minimize reflection and glare.
f. The site lighting meets all requirements set forth in this ordinance including, but not limited to, light trespass
and nuisance violations.
2. All exterior lighting shall be designed in a consistent and coordinated manner for the entire site.
3. All luminaries shall use light distribution patterns or positioning that directs light away from adjacent or abutting
property when appropriate.2
4. All exterior lighting not deemed necessary for security purposes or architectural enhancement must be turned off
during non-business hours and shall be controlled by means of a photocell control, timer, or other acceptable means
of control.
E. Illuminance Levels:
2/6/2020 Zoning Ordinance - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/birmingham-mi/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-317 105/211
1. The intensity of light on a site shall not exceed six-tenths (0.6) maintained foot-candles at any property line that
abuts a single-family residential zoned property or one and one half (1.5) maintained foot-candles at any property
line for any other zoned property. The light intensity shall be measured at 6 above ground level on a vertical
plane.3
2. The intensity of light on a site which provides a front setback of less than 5 shall be measured from 5 beyond the
front property line.
3. The lighting under vehicular canopies shall have a maximum point of illuminance of ten (10) maintained footcandles4
measured on a horizontal plane at ground level. Lighting under vehicular canopies shall be designed in
accordance with one or more of the following practices:
a. Recessed luminaire(s) incorporation of a lens that is either recessed or flush with the bottom surface of the
vehicular canopy.
b. Surface mounted fixture incorporating a flat lens that provides full cutoff light distribution.
c. Other methods approved by the Planning Board, Historic District Commission or Design Review Board.
F. Parking Facilities:
1. The maximum height for pole mounted luminaries, including a base or pedestal and pole, measured from ground
level to the highest point on the luminaries shall be 13 for parking lots adjacent to residential properties. All other
parking lot locations are limited to 16 in height.
2. Parking facility circulation areas shall have a minimum illumination level of two tenths (0.2) foot-candles measured
at ground level on a horizontal plane with the exception of areas described in Section 4.21(F)(4).5
3. The distribution of light emitted from parking lot luminaries shall be such that the variation of foot-candle
illumination levels in the circulation areas will be no greater than a 20:1 maximum to minimum ratio of variation.6
4. Foot-candle levels of a circulation area within 5 ft. of an adjacent property line may be exempt from the variation
ratio provided that the foot-candle levels in that area are between 0.0 and 0.6 foot candles.
5. All luminaries of a parking facility will use light distribution patterns and/or shielding that directs light away from
adjacent or abutting property.7
6. All luminaries will be full cut-off or cut-off, as defined in section 9.02, unless deemed beneficial for aesthetic or
safety purposes in accordance with Section 4.21(D)(1) of this ordinance.
7. Parking facilities that directly abut one another may be allowed to share lighting equipment at the discretion of the
Planning Division, provided that all requirements of this ordinance are met. If shared lighting is implemented at the
abutting property lines of two parking lots, that property line may be exempt from light trespass levels of Section
4.21(E)(1) of this ordinance.
8. Security Lighting:
1. Luminaries deemed security lighting, as defined in Section 9.02, may be lit continuously between sunset and
sunrise. All other outdoor lighting shall be turned off during non-business hours. Areas deemed appropriate for
security lighting shall include, but not be limited to, sidewalks, pedestrian passages, entrances to buildings,
parking structures, alleyways, and bike paths.
2. When designing security lighting emphasis should be placed on incorporating vertical illuminance as defined in
Section 9.02. In order to avoid high brightness contrast situations and to increase recognition distances,
lighting of surrounding vertical surfaces (trees, walls, building features, or area surrounding features) is
encouraged. This lighting will define the space and depth of the environment and help minimize dark areas and
shadows, thus increasing safety and security.8
3. Areas approved for security lighting require a minimum of one half (0.5) maintained foot-candles of
illumination, at ground level, on a horizontal plane.9
4. Security lighting shall have a maximum variation ratio of 15:1.10
5. All security lighting shall comply with light trespass standards set forth in this ordinance.
9. Prohibited Outdoor Lighting: Flashing, chasing, moving or intermittent type lighting which is visible to the human
eye. However, fading is permitted at intervals greater than 120 seconds. This standard also applies to interior
lighting seen from the exterior of the building.
10. Exemptions: The following are exempt from the lighting requirements of this section, provided they are not deemed
a light nuisance:
1. Lighting for Private Swimming Pools.
2. Lighting for holiday decorations.
3. Lighting for approved Special Events.

determined by the HDC, DRB or Planning Division, located within the boundaries of any historic district as
defined in Section 127-25 of the Birmingham City Code.
11. Lighting Nuisance Violations: Any luminaries erected, constructed, enlarged, altered, replaced, moved, improved, or
converted contrary to the provisions of this section shall be unlawful and declared a light nuisance as determined by
the Building Official, and is subject to abatement in accordance with IESNA recommendations in the manner
provided by law.
12. Grandfathering of Nonconforming Luminaries: Any luminaries existing at the time of the enactment of this
ordinance, or any amendment thereto, that does not conform to the requirements of the district in which it is
located may be continued or maintained subject to the following provisions, provided that they do not cause a
nuisance as stated in Section 4.22 of this ordinance.
1. If a nonconforming luminaire is destroyed, it shall be repaired, reconstructed or replaced, in conformity with all
the provisions of this ordinance, and the remnants of the former luminaire shall be removed from the property.

the land titles for all affected properties. If a shared parking arrangement is subsequently terminated, or if the
uses change, Planning Board approval shall be automatically revoked and each use shall be required to comply
with the requirements of this section.

This Screening Standards section applies to the following districts:
The following screening standards apply:
A. Purpose: The purpose of this section is to require a barrier, capable of containing noise, vehicular lights, visual disarray,
debris and other factors detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the community, be- tween an open parking
station, outdoor storage, dumpsters and adjacent properties. Flexibility in the materials, size, height and placement of
walls is permitted in order to allow architectural harmony and usable open space and to accomplish a unified design.
B. Screenwall Descriptions: Screenwall as required by this section shall mean:
1. When required along a street line, alley, passage or mixed passage, a masonry wall with an exterior face of brick,
precast aggregate panels, sculptured block, stone, architecturally treated concrete or other materials acceptable to
the Planning Board which are demonstrated to be durable, easily maintained, and provide a similar permanent visual
barrier.
2. When required, a screenwall of capped masonry.
3. Screenwalls shall be so constructed that the lower 32 inches in height, as measured from the finished parking lot
surface, or ground surface on the outside of the screenwall, whichever is higher, shall be solid. Openings above 32
inches may be permitted provided the intent of the Zoning Ordinance is maintained and further provided the
openings are not larger than 64 square inches and do not exceed 33% of the surface of the screenwall.
4. Where a screenwall is adjacent to a vehicular or pedestrian accessway, the screenwall shall be so de- signed and
constructed as to not constitute a hazard to vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
5. Screenwalls along a street shall be so designed as to not form a continuous barrier. Depending upon the length,
location and ground contour, a break in the screenwall is required every 50 to 100 feet. Such break shall be a
minimum of 10 feet long. A screening wall of a material permitted under Section 4.54(C)(1) shall be constructed for
the full length of the required break and shall be located a minimum of 2 feet to either the front of or the rear of the

business or industrial district, the screenwall shall be placed along the setback line; however, upon review of
the Site Plan, the Planning Board may approve an alternate location for the screenwall in order to maximize the
screening effect of the parking facility, or may modify the screenwall requirement by approving an evergreen
screen in its place.
4. Along the front, side or rear of any parking facility underneath a building which is visible to the general public in a
manner which screens the parking from public view.
5. Adjacent to ground-mounted mechanical or electrical equipment which is visible to the public in a manner which
obscures the receptacle and equipment from public view.

to be boundary lines for the purpose of determining setbacks. The setbacks from all lot lines forming the
boundary of the cluster development shall meet the following minimum requirements:
a. Setbacks from lot lines abutting a street. Where there are 2 or more existing single-family residential
dwellings outside the cluster development on the same side of the street, and within 300 feet of the lot
boundaries, the setback of all buildings abutting the street shall be no less than the average distance

2/6/2020 Zoning Ordinance - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/birmingham-mi/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-317 158/211
The city has recognized that because of their nature, uses defined as regulated uses, have objectionable operational
characteristics, especially when concentrated in small areas. Recognizing that regulated uses may have a harmful effect on
adjacent areas, special regulation of these uses is necessary to prevent crime, protect the citys retail trade, maintain
property values, and generally protect and preserve the quality of the citys neighborhoods and business districts.
7.20 Regulated Uses: Application
Applications for approval of a regulated use must be submitted to the City Commission for review. A Special Land Use
Permit is also required for the operation of a regulated use and the City Commission shall refer the Site Plan and the
design to the Planning Board for its review and recommendation. After receiving the recommendation, the City
Commission shall review the Site Plan and design of the building(s) and/or use(s) proposed in conjunction with the
regulated use application. City Commission approval must be granted prior to the issuance of a regulated use license
(refer to Section 26-461 of the Birmingham City Code).
7.21 Regulated Uses: Requirements
A. The City Commission shall approve a request for a regulated use if it determines that all of the following standards are
met:
1. The use will be compatible with adjacent uses of land, considering the proximity of dwellings, religious institutions,
schools, public structures, and other places of public gatherings.
2. The use will not adversely impact the capabilities of public services and facilities including sewers, water, schools,
transportation, and the ability of the City to supply such services.
3. The use will not adversely impact any cultural or historic landmarks.
4. The use is in compliance with all other requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
5. The use is in compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations.

to approve such a request for a regulated use.
(Ord. No. 2296, 10/08/2018)
Effective on: 12/23/2018
7.22 Regulated Uses: Approval
A. The City Commission may impose conditions upon its approval of a regulated use to ensure the regulated use will be
compatible with adjacent uses of land and to promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner.
B. Once the City Commission approves a regulated use, no change or alteration of the use may be made nor may any
addition, alteration, or improvement which affects the nature of the use or surrounding properties be made to the
building, or on the parcel of land on which the building is located, unless a new application has been filed with the city
and the City Commission has approved the application. Existing businesses may continue to operate during the
application process.
7.23 Regulated Uses: Appeal
A Special Land Use Permit is also required for a regulated use, and the City Commission shall refer the application to the
Planning Board for review, and the application must be considered by the City Commission with the recommendation of
the Planning Board for such use. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the City Commission may appeal to a court of
competent jurisdiction.
7.24 Site Plan Review: Purpose
The purpose of Site Plan Review is to provide flexibility in the placement and interrelationship of buildings and uses within
each site subject to plan approval, and to provide for the implementation of design concepts while at the same time
maintain the overall intensity of land use, density of population, and amounts of light, air, access and landscaped open
space as required in the Zoning Ordinance. The objectives of Site Plan Review are to:
A. Encourage originality, flexibility and innovation in site planning and development, including the architecture, landscaping
and graphic design in the development;
B. Discourage monotonous, drab, unsightly, dreary and inharmonious developments, and poor quality;
C. Conserve the citys natural beauty and visual character and charm by ensuring that structures, signs and other
improvements are properly related to their sites, and to surrounding sites and structures, with due regard to the
2/6/2020 Zoning Ordinance - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/birmingham-mi/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-317 159/211
aesthetic qualities of the natural terrain and landscaping, and that proper attention is given to exterior appearance of
structures, signs and other improvements;

Board for preliminary Site Plan Review in the case of non-historic new construction, or final Site Plan Review, for nonhistoric
properties, in the case of minor additions or alterations as determined by the City Planner.
B. Preliminary Site Plan Review is designed to give the developer a tentative approval prior to development of construction
plans. Preliminary review may not be required for additions or alterations to existing buildings, which in the judgement
of the City Planner are considered to be minor in nature. After final site plans are completed, the petitioner shall submit
them to the Planning Board for final Site Plan Review of non-historic properties. The Planning Board and the Historic
District Commission shall jointly review the final Site Plan for historic properties.
C. Final Site Plan Review must be applied for within six months of the granting of preliminary Site Plan approval. All
provisions of applicable ordinances must be met, and any special conditions or requirements imposed by the appropriate
reviewing body and in granting preliminary approval must be incorporated into the plans. Final Site Plan approval for
both new construction and additions shall be given only after all phases of the plan have been approved by the
appropriate reviewing body. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to advise the Planning Department of any
changes to a Site Plan which has received final Site Plan and Design Review approval, and for requesting the necessary
approval from the planning division and/ or Planning Board for such changes.

1. Public right-of-way. Any use in the public right-of-way must maintain an unobstructed sidewalk width of at least 60
inches. Upon review by the Building Official and the Fire Marshal, the sidewalk width may be reduced to a minimum
of 36 inches, provided that 60 inch wide passing intervals, 60 inches in length are accommodated every 200 feet.

certified that such use will result in no additional, undue on-site or off-site threat to public safety. No temporary use
shall be operated except in accordance with such restrictions and conditions as said departments may require in
connection with a temporary use permit.
3. Traffic. No temporary use permit shall be issued if additional vehicular traffic reasonably expected to be generated
by such temporary use would have undue detrimental effects on surrounding streets and uses. Undue detrimental
effects may include the following:
a. Activity from the temporary use that unreasonably restricts vehicular and /or pedestrian traffic in the area.
2/6/2020 Zoning Ordinance - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/birmingham-mi/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-317 165/211
b. Activity from the temporary use that generates considerably more noise and vibration than would be expected
in the area.
4. Conflicts with other temporary uses. No temporary use permit shall be issued if such use would conflict with another
previously authorized temporary use permit.
5. Sign limitations. Except as otherwise expressly authorized by subsection 86-28(5) or subsection 86-29(12) of the
Birmingham City Code, signs shall be located only on the same property as the temporary use and meet the

It shall be unlawful to change the type of use of land, or to change the type of use or type of occupancy of any building,
or to extend any use on any lot until the Building Official has issued for such intended use a Zoning Ordinance Compliance
Permit or Certificate of Occupancy and use as provided for in Chapter 22 of the Birmingham City Code.
7.42 Zoning Ordinance Compliance Permit: Application
A. In all cases where a certificate of occupancy and use is not required, application for a Zoning Ordinance Compliance
Permit shall be made, except for signs which are regulated by Chapter 86 of the Birmingham City Code. This application
shall be made in writing to the Building Official on forms provided for that purpose. A record of all such applications
shall be kept on file by the Building Official.
B. The Building Official shall require every application for a Zoning Ordinance Compliance Permit shall be accompanied by a
written statement and plans or plats showing the following in sufficient detail to enable the Building Official to ascertain
whether the proposed work or use is in conformance with the Zoning Ordinance:
1. The actual shape, location and dimensions of the lot.
2. The existing and intended use of the lot and of all buildings or structures upon the lot.
3. Such other information which may be essential for determining whether the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance are
being observed.
C. The Building Official may accept a preliminary application and a lesser number of submitted documents than those listed
above in situations where a basic clarification is desired ahead of proceeding with further technical work. If such
preliminary application is denied in writing by the Building Official, the applicant may appeal such action to the Board of
Zoning Appeals. However, the Building Official shall not refuse to issue a permit when the conditions imposed are
complied to by the applicant despite violations of contracts, such as covenants or private agreements, which may be
obtained upon the granting of such permit.

modify the boundary of the floodplain or the floodway only upon receipt of an official letter of map amendment
issued by the Office of Federal Insurance and Hazard Mitigation.
3. Variances.
a. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and grant or deny requests for variances from the strict application of
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in
carrying out the strict letter of such chapter. In granting a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach
such conditions as it may deem reasonably necessary to promote the spirit and intent of the Zoning Ordinance.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant any variance unless it first determines that:
i. Because of special conditions applicable to the property in question, the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance, if strictly applied, unreasonably prevent the property owner from using the property for a
permitted purpose;
ii. Literal enforcement of the chapter will result in unnecessary hardship;
iii. The granting of the variance will not be contrary to the spirit and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance nor
contrary to the public health, safety and welfare; and
iv. The granting of the variance will result in substantial justice to the property owner, the owners of property
in the area and the general public.
b. Variances from the provisions of Section 4.13, Floodplain Regulations, shall only be granted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals upon a determination of compliance with the general standards for variances contained in the
2/6/2020 Zoning Ordinance - Document Viewer
online.encodeplus.com/regs/birmingham-mi/doc-viewer.aspx#secid-317 167/211
Zoning Ordinance and in accordance with the following:
i. The variance granted will not result in flood heights in excess of those permitted by the Zoning Ordinance,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
ii. The variance granted shall be the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief to the
applicant.
iii. Variances may be granted for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the Michigan Historic Markers listing of historic sites, or any other
state register of historic places without meeting the requirements of this section.
c. Sign Variance Procedure. Any person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the City Planner or Design Review
Board may have the sign reviewed by the Board of Zoning Appeals. A variance may be granted by the Board of
Zoning Appeals only in cases involving practical difficulties when the evidence in the official record of the appeal
supports all the following affirmative findings:
i. That the alleged practical difficulties are peculiar to the property of the person requesting the variance by
reasons of the physical and/or dimensional constraints of the building and/or site, and result from
conditions which do not exist generally throughout the City;
ii. That the granting of the requested variance would not be materially detrimental to the property owners in
the immediate vicinity;
iii. That the granting of the variance would not be contrary to the general objectives of this Chapter and is in
keeping with the spirit and intent of this ordinance; and
iv. That granting the variance will result in substantial justice being done, considering the public benefits
intended to be secured by this Chapter, the individual hardships that will be suffered by a failure of the
Board of Zoning Appeals to grant a variance, and the rights of others whose property would be affected by
the allowance of the variance.
v. In granting a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions as it may deem reasonably
necessary to promote the spirit and intent of the Zoning Ordinance and the conditions specified in the sign
ordinance, Chapter 86, Article 02, Section 2.06.
G. Miscellaneous:

erection or alteration is commenced and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.
2. No order of the Board of Zoning Appeals permitting a use of a building or premises shall be valid for a period longer
than one year unless such use is established within such period; provided, however, that if the use of such permit is
dependent upon the erection or alteration of a building, such order shall continue in full force and effect if a building
permit for such use, erection or alteration is obtained within such period and such erections or alterations are
commenced and proceed to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.

The City Planner will review all sign or broadcast media device permit applications to verify compliance with
this Chapter and to determine the necessity of review.

broadcast media device permit from the City Planner. The signs that do not require a permit include:
1. Memorial signs or tablets, names of buildings and date of construction when cut into any masonry surface
or when constructed of metal.
2. Self-service gasoline station signs as regulated in Chapter 54 of this Birmingham City Code, which
include safety or warning signs.

or nonadvertising signs as may be approved by the City Planner.

5. Professional nameplate signs.

11. Temporary signs for private residence.
12. Temporary signs advertising residential property.
13. Temporary signs advertising lots and/or buildings in one subdivision.
B. Maintenance. The maintenance and/or repair of a properly licensed sign shall not require a sign permit, unless
changing the advertising material and/or copy.
C. Application. Applications for sign or broadcast media device permits shall be made upon forms provided by
the Community Development Department.
D. Procedure. When the applicant applies for a sign or broadcast media device permit, such plans, specifications,
and other data relating to the proposed sign, or broadcast media device or other supporting structure,
shall be reviewed by the City Planner, and, if necessary, shall be forwarded to the Historic District Commission,
Design Review Board or Planning Board for review, see Section 2.02 Sign Review. All plans
shall address the removal of all previously installed signage, or broadcast media device as well as repairs to
mounting surfaces impacted by previous mountings. If it appears that the proposed sign and/or broadcast
media device is in compliance with all plans approved by the appropriate body, and all requirements of this
Chapter, then a sign or broadcast media device permit shall be issued by the City Planner.
E. Fees. Every applicant shall pay to the Treasurer of the City a fee for each sign or broadcast media device
permit according to Appendix A of the Birmingham City Code before being granted a permit. In the event
a sign or broadcast media device is erected prior to receiving the permit, the sign permit fee shall be double
that indicated in the schedule.
F. Duration. All rights and privileges acquired under the provisions of this Chapter or any amendments thereto,
are mere licenses and may be revoked upon the violation of any of the conditions contained herein. If the

2.02 Sign Review
A. Approval Required.
1. The Historic District Commission, Design Review Board, or Planning Board shall review all plans for
the construction or alteration of a sign that the City Planner determines will substantially alter the exterior
appearance of a structure. Signs that do not require a permit, do not require review.
2. The City Commission shall hear and deny, approve, or approve with conditions, those signs for special
land uses, after receiving the recommendation of the Planning Board.
B. Restrictions.
1. The Historic District Commission, Design Review Board or Planning Board may impose restrictions on
the size, placement and appearance of signs in addition to those requirements set forth by this ordinance.
2. The Historic District Commission, Design Review Board or Planning Board shall not allow the alteration
or construction of any sign which would violate the requirements of this ordinance.
C. Requirements. Sign review approval shall be granted only upon determining the following:
1. The scale, color, texture and materials of the sign being used will identify the business succinctly, and
will enhance the building on which it is located, as well as the immediate neighborhood.
2. The scale, color, texture and materials of the sign will be compatible with the style, color, texture and
materials of the building on which it is located, as well as neighboring buildings.
3. The appearance of the building exterior with the signage will preserve or enhance, and not adversely
impact, the property values in the immediate neighborhood.
4. The sign is neither confusing nor distracting, nor will it create a traffic hazard or otherwise adversely
impact public safety.
5. The sign is consistent with the intent of the Master Plan, Urban Design Plan(s), and/or Downtown Birmingham
2016 Report, as applicable.
6. The sign otherwise meets all requirements of this Chapter.
2.03 Computation
The following principles shall control the computation of the sign area and sign height:
A. Individual Signs.
1. The area of a sign face (one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square or rectangle that
will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with
any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate
the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, except that lowercase letters with ascenders
and descenders that extend beyond the limits of the sign height by a maximum of 12 inches, will
not be calculated into the total sign area.

2. The area of the sign face shall not include any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall
when such fence or wall is clearly incidental to the display itself.
3. The Historic District Commission, Design Review Board or Planning Board may, upon sign review, allow
a logo or other design element to be calculated separately from the rest of the sign, provided that the
Historic District Commission, Design Review Board or Planning Board finds the logo or emblem to be
an integral part of the sign, and the sign complies with the intent of this Chapter.

B. Multifaced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the
area of all sign faces.
C. Height. The height of a sign shall be computed at the distance from the base of the sign at grade to the top
of the highest attached component of the sign. Grade shall be considered to be a reference plane representing
the average of finished ground levels adjoining the building at all exterior walls. When a finished ground
level slopes away from the exterior walls, the reference plane shall be established by the lowest points within
the area between the building and the lot line or, when the lot line is more than 5 feet from the building,
between the building and a point 5 feet from the building.

permits are required by this ordinance shall obtain a sign erectors license from the building official to
conduct such operations.
2. Sign erectors licenses are not required for the installation of sign with a total surface area of less than 10
square feet.
3. The sign erectors license shall expire annually.
4. All persons erecting an electrical sign shall be required to obtain an electrical specialty license under
Chapter 22 (Community Development Regulations) in addition these requirements.
B. Revoking of Licenses. The building official shall revoke the license of any sign erector who does not comply
with the requirements of this ordinance.
C. Fees. Every applicant before being granted a sign erectors license shall pay to the City Treasurers Department
the fees as specified in Appendix A of the Birmingham City Code.
2.05 Violations and Removal of Signs and Broadcast Media Devices
A. Public Right-of-Way. The owner of any sign that has been removed from the right-of-way in violation of
this Chapter shall pay to the City the sum of $25.00 before recovering such sign. If any sign is not claimed
within 30 days, it may be destroyed.
B. Safety Regulations. Any sign or broadcast media device found by the Community Development Department
to be in an unsafe condition must be repaired or removed by the owner within 24 hours after receipt of notice
to do so from the Community Development Department.
C. Removal of Signs and Broadcast Media Devices. Any sign or broadcast media device now or hereafter
existing, which at the time of construction advertised a business being conducted or a product being sold
or produced on the premises on which the sign or broadcast media device is located, but no longer does so
shall be taken down and removed by the owner, agent or person having the beneficial use of the building
or structure or premises upon which such sign or broadcast media device shall be found within 30 days of
conclusion of occupancy or use. All supporting structures shall also be removed and mounting surfaces shall
be repaired and restored.
2.06 Variances
A. Procedure. Any person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the City Planner may have the sign reviewed
by the Board of Zoning Appeals. A variance may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals only in cases
involving practical difficulties when the evidence in the official record of the appeal supports all the following
affirmative findings:
1. That the alleged practical difficulties are peculiar to the property of the person requesting the variance by
reasons of the physical and/or dimensional constraints of the building and/or site, and result from conditions
which do not exist generally throughout the City;
2. That the granting of the requested variance would not be materially detrimental to the property owners in
the immediate vicinity;
3. That the granting of the variance would not be contrary to the general objectives of this Chapter and is in
keeping with the spirit and intent of this ordinance; and
4. That granting the variance will result in substantial justice being done, considering the public benefits
intended to be secured by this Chapter, the individual hardships that will be suffered by a failure of the
Board of Zoning Appeals to grant a variance, and the rights of others whose property would be affected
by the allowance of the variance.
B. Fees. Fees for sign variances are specified in Appendix A of the Birmingham City Code.

A. Nonconforming Signs.
1. Subject to the provisions of this section, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective
date of this Chapter may be continued.
2. A nonconforming sign shall not be moved, replaced, enlarged or altered, except to bring the sign into
complete conformity with this Chapter. The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed only by
the person who operated the business being advertised on the signage on the premises on February 1,
2005, or related person, provided that the business being advertised on the signage on February 1, 2005,
continues in operation, so long as this does not create any new nonconformities and sign review approval
is received.
3. No illumination shall be added to a nonconforming sign.
4. A nonconforming sign shall not be reestablished after the activity, business or usage to which it relates
has been discontinued. A nonconforming sign shall not be maintained or displayed by anyone other than

person, and provided that the business being advertised on the signage on February 1, 2005, continues in
operation.

person who owned the premises on the date of adoption of this section.
6. If a nonconforming sign is destroyed, it shall not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed or replaced, except
in conformity with all the provisions of this chapter, and the remnants of the former sign structure shall
be removed from the property. For purposes of this section, a nonconforming sign is destroyed if
damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former condition or replacing it with an
equivalent sign equals or exceeds 50% of the replacement value of the sign so damaged, including labor.
Subject to the other provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may be repaired so long as the cost
of such work does not exceed 50% of the replacement cost of the sign within any 12-month period.
7. Effective January 1, 2013, portable signs will no longer be allowed in the MX, Mixed-Use District.
B. Signs on Nonconforming Uses.
1. Subject to the provisions of this section, existing signs on legally nonconforming uses, as defined in the

and shall meet the requirements of Section 2.07(A): Nonconforming Signs.
2. New signs for legally nonconforming uses must meet the requirements for the zoning district in which
the legally nonconforming use is located.
