PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Charter Township of Grand Blanc, Genesee County, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the Township Board. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Senior Code Attorney, and Shelly Hayes, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Cathy Lane, Township Clerk, Mr. David Lattie, Township Attorney, and Mr. Michael Deem, Planner, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Township readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Township's affairs.

ARTICLE V. - SEVERE WEATHER PROTECTION SHELTERS 

Sec. 6-106. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Dwelling means a structure or portion thereof, which is used exclusively for human habitation. 
    Dwelling, single-family , means a building designed exclusively for one-family residential use. 
    Modular house means a house constructed of modular units that have been built elsewhere and which are brought to the site, in whole or in parts, and installed on a permanent foundation. 
(Ord. No. 03-05, § III, 1-8-2004) 
Sec. 6-107. - Purpose. 
    The United States has been divided into four zones that geographically reflect the number and strength of extreme windstorms. The county is located near the border of Wind Zones III and IV, which are indicative of an area which experience design wind speeds (three-second gusts) in excess of 200 miles per hour. State construction codes consider the effects of code-approved design winds. A tornado can cause winds much greater than those on which the state construction code requirements are based. Having a house built to code does not mean that a house can withstand wind from any event, no matter how extreme. The county emergency management has reported that the county has the distinction of having more tornadoes than any other county in the state. Federal Emergency Management Agency Guidelines indicate the county is in a high risk wind zone area and that a shelter is the preferred method of protection from high winds. The purpose of this article is to establish standards for the installation of such shelters for new single-family residential dwelling unit construction. 
(Ord. No. 03-05, § II, 1-8-2004)

(Ord. No. 03-05, § IV, 1-8-2004) 
Sec. 6-109. - Construction standards. 
    All single-family residential dwelling units shall be attached to a permanent foundation. Severe weather protection shelter installation shall be in accordance with the in-residence shelter specifications contained in the Federal Emergency Management Agency report; Taking Shelter From the Storm: Building a Safe Room Inside Your House, Second Edition, August 1999, as may be amended. However, the shelter location shall be limited to the basement and be directly beneath the dwelling, or house.

Secs. 14-54-14-79. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - REGULATIONS 

Sec. 14-80. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Clearcutting means the indiscriminate removal of trees from a parcel of land in the township. 
    Commercial nursery or tree farm means a licensed plant or tree nursery that plants and grows trees for sale to the general public. 
    Coniferous trees means trees that are typically evergreen and bear cones. 
    Deciduous trees means trees, including ornamental and canopy, which shed their leaves. 
    Diameter at breast height (dbh) means the diameter of a tree, in inches, measured at 41/2 feet above the ground. 
    Historic tree means a tree which has been designated by the planning commission to be of notable historic interest to the township because of its age, type, size, or historic association. 
    Indiscriminate removal means the removal of trees in any fashion not consistent with nominal activity or an approved tree management plan. 
    Nominal activity means the removal of up to four regulated trees per acre, and no greater than 20 percent of the total number of trees on a lot, unit or parcel of land of one acre or larger within a 24-month period. Removal of an historic or specimen tree shall not constitute nominal activity and shall be subject to the regulations defined herein. 
    Nuisance tree means a tree that is diseased or infected by parasites and where an outbreak of infestation has caused the state to issue a quarantine or ban the transportation of such species. 
    Regulated development means all commercial, institutional, office, industrial or multiple-family development or redevelopment, and all new single-family residential development or improvements to an existing residence on a lot, unit or parcel of land of one acre or larger. 
    Regulated trees means all specimen trees and all historic trees, all deciduous trees having six inches or greater dbh and conifers greater than 20 feet in height on a lot, unit or parcel of land of one acre or larger. 
    Removable tree means those trees designated by resolution of the township board as being appropriate for removal due to their characteristics. Such trees shall be listed by common and botanical name. Such list shall be maintained by the township clerk and shall initially include the following tree species: 
Common Name Botanical Name Autumn Olive Elaeagnus umbellata Common Buckthom Rhamnus cathartica Glossy Buckthom Rhamnus frangula Lombardy Popular Populus nigra (var. italica) Russian Olive Elaeagnus angustifolia Siberian (Chinese) Elm Ulmus pumila Tree of Heaven Ailanthus altissima White Mulberry Morus alba  
    Silviculture means a land use, the primary purpose of which is to derive income from growing plants and trees including, but not limited to, fruit, nut, paper, wood product or timber production. 
    Specimen tree means a tree which has been designated by the planning commission because of its high value as a representative tree of a particular type or species, due to its size, age, or other prominent botanical characteristics.

    Traditional management means a forest management system that originated in Western Europe approximately 5,000 years ago. It was part of the effort to establish early agriculture, including crops, and animal husbandry. Traditional management systems are typically biodiverse in both plants and animals. Examples include coppice, stories, coppice-with-standards, shreds, pollards, boundary banks, and layered hedges: 
(1)  Coppice occurs when trees have been cut down and new growth originates from multiple shoots. A storier is a pared down coppice shoot assemblage. 
(2)  Coppice-with-standards includes coppice and other taller trees grown from seeds. 
(3)  Shreds are trees with their lower branches removed and harvested. 
(4)  Pollards are aboveground coppice, where a tree's upper branches are cut to generate more shoots. 
(5)  Boundary banks are constructed boundaries between properties or roads and layered hedges occur at boundary banks, and they are characterized by cut branches laid horizontally to help contain livestock. 
All of these examples currently exist in the township. 
    Tree harvesting means the removal of trees from a parcel of land in accordance with an approved tree management plan, for purposes of woodlot improvement. 
    Tree management plan means the tree survey and additional information prepared by a state registered forester, certified arborist, state registered landscape architect, forester or similar agent from the state department of agriculture (MDA), state department of natural resources and environment (MDNRE) or the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in accordance with section 14-89 required for the proposed removal of trees in excess of nominal activity. 
(Ord. of 2-10-2005, § 2302) 
Sec. 14-81. - Findings. 
    The township finds that protection of natural resources is a matter of paramount public concern as provided by article IV, section 52 of the Constitution of the state and the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, Public Act No. 451 of 1994 (MCL 324.101 et seq.). Continued growth, new development, and redevelopment in the township, and increased demand on natural resources have the effect of encroaching upon, despoiling, or eliminating many of the trees and other forms of vegetation, natural resources, and processes associated with wooded areas. If preserved and maintained in an undisturbed and natural condition, these resources constitute important physical, aesthetic, recreational, and economic assets to existing and future residents of the township. Specifically, the township finds that: 
(1)  Trees and woodland growth protects public health through the absorption of air pollutants and contamination, through the reduction of excessive noise and mental and physical damage related to noise pollution, and through its cooling effect in the summer months; 
(2)  Trees and woodlands provide for public safety through the prevention of erosion, siltation, and flooding; 
(3)  Trees and woodland growth are an essential component of the general welfare of the township by maintaining play areas for children and natural beauty, recreation and irreplaceable heritage for existing and future residents; and 
(4)  The protection of such natural resources is a matter of paramount public concern in the interest of health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the township. 
(Ord. of 2-10-2005, § 2300) 
Sec. 14-82. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  The intent and purpose of this division is to: 
(1)  Promote feasible and prudent alternatives to the destruction and removal of trees consistent with promotion of the public health, safety and welfare in light of the paramount public concern for the protection of natural resources from impairment or destruction; 
(2)  Provide for the protection and preservation of trees in order to minimize destruction and disturbance to them, the wildlife habitat that they provide, and other consequential effects on other natural resources; and 
(3)  Protect and preserve trees for their economic support of local property values, natural beauty, wilderness character, and ecological significance. 
(b)  The intent of this division is not to be excessively restrictive or prohibitive, but to provide for the submission and evaluation of feasible and prudent alternatives to the destruction and removal of trees in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth herein prior to such action being taken. 
(Ord. of 2-10-2005, § 2301) 
Sec. 14-83. - Applicability. 
(a)  The provisions of this division shall apply to all regulated development as defined herein. The provisions of this division shall also apply to all property in the township regarding clearcutting, indiscriminate removal, tree harvesting and removal of historic or specimen trees. The requirement for a tree management plan may be waived by the planning director: 
(1)  As part of the permit process for acreage parcels (five acres or more) where the applicant proposes solely to clear trees for the purpose of establishing a pedestrian or equestrian trail or similar activity even though the number of trees to be removed shall exceed the nominal development threshold; or 
(2)  When the subject site or affected portion of the property is enrolled in a conservation, management or habitat restoration program administered by the USDA, MDA or MDNRE, or similar program administered by the federal government, state government or nonprofit organization. 
(b)  The applicant shall provide the planning director with a sketch plan showing the area where: 
(1)  The tree removal is proposed; 
(2)  An estimate of the number, size and species of trees to be removed; and 
(3)  Documentation supporting maintenance of the trail or enrollment of the property in the management program. 
(Ord. of 2-10-2005, § 2303) 
Sec. 14-84. - Requirements established. 
    Regulated trees are an important resource in the township, as demonstrated in section 14-81. The following standards shall govern the removal of regulated trees within the township: 
(1)  For all regulated development, no person shall remove, cause to be removed, transplant, or destroy any regulated tree without first obtaining approval from the township planning director or designee. Removal in excess of nominal activity shall require an approved tree removal permit and plan in accordance with section 14-89. The tree management plan shall demonstrate that removal activities are designed so as to promote and maintain the health and viability of the remaining trees. The tree management plan shall include the means by which cut trees shall be removed from the property without damaging remaining trees. 
(2)  Regulated development that proposes the removal of trees in excess of nominal activity shall require the replacement of trees on the site of the principal building, within an adjacent public right-of-way, in a boulevard island, or on a portion of the subject property permanently reserved as open space. For every tree regulated under this section that is removed, an equivalent number of replacement trees shall be planted (see section 14-91). 
(3)  Except for the area within the right-of-way of an existing public street or an easement for public utilities, all regulated development shall leave standing and undamaged a minimum of 80 percent of the total number of trees having six inches or greater dbh and 80 percent of all conifers greater than 20 feet in height. 
(4)  Regulated development that proposes the removal of trees in excess of 20 percent shall be considered threshold tree removal. A request for approval of threshold tree removal shall place the burden of proof on the applicant to show that no feasible and prudent alternative location for structures and improvements exists without causing undue hardship upon the applicant. Threshold tree removal requests may be considered in accordance with the provisions of section 14-89. 
(5)  All removal of regulated trees, including tree harvesting, that does not constitute nominal activity shall require a tree removal permit. 
(Ord. of 2-10-2005, § 2304) 
Sec. 14-85. - Exemptions. 
    The following activities are allowed as exemptions from the requirements of this division: 
(1)  The removal of dead or damaged trees where the death or damage resulted from an accident or nonhuman cause. 
(2)  The trimming, maintenance, or care of trees in accordance with standard forestry and horticultural practices and techniques as established by the American Association of Nurserymen or an equivalent organization promulgating standards for care and improvement of trees. 
(3)  Silviculture, commercial nurseries, and tree farms. 
(4)  The removal or destruction of trees damaged by tornado, windstorm, flood, freeze, fire, dangerous insect infestation, disease, or manmade or natural disaster, in order to prevent injury or damage to persons or property. 
(5)  The removal, transplanting or destruction of trees in order to perform maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads, public utilities, structures and facilities used in the service of the public, provided that such roads, public utilities, structures and facilities are not materially changed or enlarged. 
(6)  Nominal activity, as defined in section 14-80, is exempt from requirements for tree preservation and/or replacement. 
(7)  The area encompassed by the right-of-way of an existing public street or an easement for public utilities is exempt from requirements for tree preservation and/or replacement. 
(Ord. of 2-10-2005, § 2305) 
Sec. 14-86. - Historic or specimen tree designation. 
    Any resident or property owner in the township may nominate a tree for historic tree or specimen tree designation by the planning commission, based upon its age, type, size, historical or cultural association. The nomination shall be made on a form provided by the planning commission. If the nomination is made by a person who is not the owner of the property on which the tree is located, the owner shall be notified in writing, by regular U.S. mail, at least 15 days in advance of the date, time, and place that the planning commission will consider the designation. The notice shall advise the owner that designation will make it unlawful to damage, destroy, or remove the tree. A permit shall be required for the removal of a designated historic or specimen tree that is deemed to be unhealthy. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof to show that the health and condition of the tree warrants its removal. 
(Ord. of 2-10-2005, § 2306)

b.  The location and dimensions of all setbacks and existing or proposed easements. 
c.  The identity of the location and type of all regulated trees. Where replacement is required by this division, the total number of replacement trees and caliper inches shall be indicated as well as the number of regulated trees to be removed. 
d.  The tree management plan shall also identify whether there is evidence of traditional management, a forest management system that originated approximately 5,000 years ago. Reasonable efforts shall be made to preserve and protect traditional management systems. 
e.  An identification number shall be assigned to all existing trees including those proposed to remain, to be relocated or to be removed. 
f.  If replacement of trees is required, the location and method by which trees will be replaced, including the caliper size, type and species of replacement trees. 
g.  If existing trees are to be relocated, the proposed location for such trees, together with a statement setting forth how such trees are to be removed, protected and/or stored during land clearance, development and construction and how they are to be maintained after construction. 
h.  The provisions for protecting trees on site and on adjoining properties during construction and preservation of trees in connection with grading and drainage shall be provided. All trees to be retained shall be protected from heavy equipment, material storage, and other construction activities. The plan shall demonstrate that removal activities are designed so as to promote and maintain the health and viability of the remaining trees. The provisions shall address how existing trees that are not to be relocated are to be protected during land clearance, development, construction and on a permanent basis, including proposed use of tree wells, protective barriers, tunneling or retaining walls. 
i.  Other information and detail regarding vegetation as may be requested by the township. 
j.  All information and details shall be provided by a registered landscape architect, certified arborist or registered forester and may be supplemented by material from a registered land surveyor or registered engineer. All drawings and plans must contain the seal and/or signature of the design professional. 
(3)  The threshold tree removal request for the approval of a plan that retains less than 80 percent of the regulated trees on a development site. The applicant shall include evidence that no feasible and prudent alternative location for structures and improvements exists without causing undue hardship upon the applicant. Documentation including alternative plan layouts, financial feasibility analyses, and other supporting documentation may be required with the request. 
(4)  The review fees as established by the township. 
(5)  In lieu of a tree removal application, a property owner/developer may submit an affidavit that no regulated trees, as defined by this division, exist on the site. The affidavit shall be signed by the applicant, property owner and a registered land surveyor, registered engineer, registered landscape architect, registered architect, certified arborist or registered forester who has inspected the site. 
(Ord. of 2-10-2005, § 2308) 
Sec. 14-89. - Permit application review, decision and appeal procedure. 
    The following procedures shall apply to all tree removal permit applications: 
(1)  Tree removal permits require that formal application be made to the township. All tree removal permit applications will be reviewed and approved or denied by the planning director or designee. In the case of a proposed development or redevelopment plan requiring approval by a body other than the planning director, the approving body of the development plan (e.g., site plan, condominium plan or plat) shall also be the approving body of the tree removal permit application. The planning director may enlist the assistance of an outside woodlands expert to perform the reviews of tree removal permit applications. Fees for consultants shall be passed on to the applicant in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by resolution of the township board. 
(2)  Appeals from determination of a tree removal permit shall be to the township board upon written request. 
(3)  An appeal may be requested by an applicant, by an aggrieved third party or by an official charged with the administration of the tree removal permit on behalf of the township. 
(Ord. of 2-10-2005, § 2309) 
Sec. 14-90. - Permit conditions. 
    Regulated trees are an important resource in the township, as demonstrated in section 14-80, and removal of regulated trees for the sole purpose of maximizing the applicant's return on investment shall not be deemed appropriate. Rather, the township shall seek to balance the goal of protection of important natural features with the desire of the applicant for a reasonable development plan. The following standards shall govern the granting or denial of a tree removal permit: 
(1)  The application is complete and meets the submittal requirements of section 14-89. 
(2)  Diversity of tree species shall be maintained when essential to preserving a woodland area. 
(3)  Where the proposed activity consists of land clearing, the land clearing shall be limited to designated existing road rights-of-way, drainage and utility areas, and areas necessary for the construction of buildings, structures or other improvements. 
(4)  Where the proposed activity involves residential development, the residential structures shall, to the extent feasible, be designed and located to incorporate the existing natural features of a site. 
(5)  The proposed activity shall include necessary provisions for tree relocation or replacement as may be required by section 14-91. 
(6)  The proposed activity shall comply with all applicable statutes and ordinances. 
(7)  The preservation and conservation of trees shall have priority over development when there are feasible and prudent location alternatives on the site for proposed buildings, structures or other improvements. 
(8)  Where feasible, the integrity of traditional management areas, woodland areas or groupings of trees shall be maintained irrespective of whether such woodlands cross property lines. 
(9)  In addition to the standards provided here within, the request for a permit for threshold tree removal must contain adequate information to demonstrate that no feasible and prudent alternative location of structures and improvements exists without causing undue hardship on the applicant. 
(Ord. of 2-10-2005, § 2310) 
Sec. 14-91. - Tree replacement standards. 
    Replacement of trees shall occur on the site of the principal building, within adjacent public right-of-way or on property permanently reserved as open space as provided below. Removal of trees must be in accordance with an approved tree management plan. 
(1)  All replacement trees shall have a three-inch caliper or greater; provided, however, that trees less than three-inch caliper and greater than 11/2-inch caliper may be permitted, if they are planted in greater numbers, per the chart below. For conifers, the minimum height shall be six feet. Tree replacement shall be at the following ratio: 
Removed Tree Size Required Replacement Trees 
per Tree Removed* Conifers 
(height in feet) Deciduous 
((dbh**) in inches) 20 to 25 6 = 8 1 26 or larger > 8 = 15 2 ;gt; 15 3  
*If deciduous trees less than three-inch caliper are considered as replacement trees, there shall be two trees planted for every one replacement tree required. 
**See definition of diameter at breast height. 
(2)  All replacement trees shall satisfy American Association of Nurseryman standards. 
(3)  The location of replacement trees shall be subject to the approval of the township and shall provide the optimum enhancement, preservation and protection of woodland areas. Where the approving body determines that it is not feasible or desirable to relocate or replace trees on site, relocation or replacement may be made at another location in the township, which may include publicly owned property. 
(Ord. of 2-10-2005, § 2311) 
Sec. 14-92. - Enforcement and penalties. 
    Tree removal permits shall be the responsibility and duty of the building official to enforce. Penalties for violation of this division shall be every person who violates, disobeys or omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any provision of this division or any permit, license or exception granted hereunder, or any lawful order of the township issued pursuant to this division and such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The owner of record or tenant of any building, structure, premises or part thereof, and any architect, design professional, builder, contractor, agent or person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense. The imposition of any fine, jail sentence or both, shall not exempt the violator from compliance with the provisions of this division.

DIVISION 3. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 18-87. - Traffic ways; streets and roads. 
(a)  Generally. The standards set forth in this division shall be the minimum standards for streets, roads and intersections. Any higher standards adopted by the county road commission shall prevail. Streets shall be dedicated to public use and shall be eligible for acceptance for maintenance by the road commission. 
(b)  Location. 
(1)  Street location and arrangements. When a major street plan has been adopted, subdivision streets shall be required to conform to the plan. 
(2)  Local or minor streets. Such streets shall be arranged as to discourage their use by through traffic. 
(3)  Street continuation and extension. The arrangement of streets may be required to provide for the continuation of existing streets from adjoining areas into new subdivisions by the planning commission, the township board, and the county road commission, where such extensions are deemed desirable, and where such extension is not precluded by topographic or other existing conditions. 
(4)  Stub streets. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets in new subdivisions may be required to be extended to the boundary line of the tract to make provisions for the future projections of streets into adjacent areas. 
(5)  Relation to topography. Streets shall be arranged in proper relation to topography so as to result in usable lots, safe streets, and reasonable gradients both for the streets and for driveways intersecting therewith. 
(6)  External access. The street layout plan shall provide more than one point of external access to the subdivision. A boulevard street entrance shall not be considered as providing multiple points of access. Multiple access points shall be as remote from one another as is feasible. The requirement for secondary access may be satisfied by access to an adjacent subdivision. Secondary access shall not be required under the following circumstances: 
a.  When each lot in the subdivision is no farther than 800 feet in street length from the point of external access to the subdivision. 
b.  When the property has limited frontage along external arterials, or topographic conditions on the external arterials reduce sight line distances, so that a secondary access point cannot be established which will provide safe ingress and egress. In such cases, the township shall permit the use of an 18-foot-wide emergency access road to be dedicated to the township in an easement. Said road shall be of all-weather construction, designed to support vehicles of 25 tons, and paved with asphalt or concrete. To discourage nonemergency vehicles, emergency access only shall be separated from other roadways by mountable curbs where appropriate, and shall utilize entrance radii designed to permit emergency vehicles while discouraging nonemergency traffic. 
c.  When a stub street is provided to adjacent property at a location feasible and practical for the development of a future connecting street. Where feasible, the township shall require access roads for emergency use until such time as the adjacent property is developed so as to provide secondary access. Emergency access roads shall be of all-weather construction designed to support vehicles of 25 tons and paved with asphalt or concrete. To discourage nonemergency vehicles, emergency access roads shall be designated by signage as for emergency access only, shall be separated from other roadways by mountable curbs where appropriate, and shall utilize entrance radii designed to permit emergency vehicles while discouraging nonemergency traffic. 
(7)  Marginal access streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an arterial street, the township may require: 
a.  Marginal access streets approximately parallel to and on each side of the right-of-way. 
b.  A landscaped greenbelt 20 feet wide or other such treatment as it deems necessary for the adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
c.  A marginal access street will require a minimum of 95 feet from the centerline of the adjacent road to the nearest property line. A minimum of 24 feet of driving surface is recommended; where there is curb and gutter, 27 feet should be required from back of curb to back of curb. 
d.  Building setbacks shall be measured from the road right-of-way or easement for private roads. 
(8)  Acceleration/deceleration lanes. Where entrances to a plat are from an arterial street, the township may require that an acceleration/deceleration lane be provided outside of the arterial street right-of-way, in the event such a right-of-way is determined insufficient for future purposes. 
(9)  Maximum cul-de-sac lengths. Maximum cul-de-sac lengths in districts with a minimum lot size of one acre or greater shall be 1,500 feet. For all other development the maximum cul-de-sac length shall be no greater than seven times the average lot width along the cul-de-sac roadway. Special consideration shall be given by the approving body to permit longer cul-de-sacs under certain topographic conditions or other unusual situations where there are practical difficulties consistent with the findings required by subsections 18-25(a)(1) through (4). Cul-de-sacs shall terminate with an adequate turn-around with a minimum radius of 45 feet for the right-of-way measured to the edge of the pavement if there is no curb or to the face of the curb if provided. Right-of-way radius shall be a minimum of 60 feet. Cul-de-sac islands are encouraged where feasible. A minimum curb radius of 55 feet is required where a cul-de-sac island is proposed. Such designs shall also require a right-of-way radius of 70 feet. 
(10)  Private streets. Private streets and roads shall be prohibited. 
(11)  Half streets. Half streets shall generally be prohibited except where unusual circumstances make it essential to the reasonable development of a tract in conformance with these regulations and where satisfactory assurance for dedication of the remaining part of the street is provided. Whenever a tract to be subdivided borders on an existing half or partial street the other part of the street shall be dedicated within such tract, according to the requirements of the county road commission. 
(c)  Specifications. 
(1)  Street rights-of-way roadway and pavement widths. Minimum right-of-way for local streets shall be 66 feet. Minimum pavement width shall be 30 feet (back-to-back of the curb).

(3)  Street alignment. 
a.  Horizontal alignment. The minimum centerline radius within a subdivision shall be 200 feet for a local street and 300 feet for a collector street. For aesthetic reasons, the horizontal deflection angle should be sufficiently great - or the selected curve sufficiently long - to avoid the appearance of a kink. Also, intervening tangents between consecutive curves should be sufficiently long to avoid a "broken-back" appearance. Collectors or arterials expected to be posted with a speed limit of 35 miles per hour or greater shall be designed according to the latest standards of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), and may require superelevation. 
b.  Sight distance to meet standards. Sight distance shall meet the standards of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Refer to the township subdivision design standards guidebook as a reference for these standards. 
c.  Minimum radii. The minimum radii on platted street intersections shall be as follows:

3.  Residential area streets. 30 feet to the back of curb. 
4.  Commercial and industrial platted streets. As approved by the township engineer. 
d.  Minimum straightaway. All newly platted streets which intersect with existing roads, or with proposed platted streets will do so at 90-degree angles with a minimum straightaway of 150 feet, as measured from centerline of the existing highway. The grade in the 150-foot straightaway shall not exceed 3.0 percent. The maximum number of intersecting streets shall be two. 
e.  Horizontal curve or curvilinear streets. Each horizontal curve on curvilinear streets shall have a minimum 230-foot centerline radius, as measured from centerline, as approved by the township engineer. Curves or other features principally to obtain a particular lot size, shape, appearance or scenic attraction not in keeping with good engineering design will not be permitted. 
f.  Configuration of T intersections. Street intersections shall be coordinated with lot configurations so that headlights from vehicles stopping at a T intersection will not project directly into the windows of living areas of a single-family home. 
(d)  Street names. 
(1)  Street names shall not duplicate any existing street name in the township or neighboring municipalities except where a new street is a continuation of an existing street. 
(2)  Street names that may be spelled differently but sound the same shall be avoided. 
(3)  Duplications can be avoided by checking new street names with the township's master listing and the county road commission. 
(4)  Generally, no street should change direction by more than 90 degrees without a change in street name. 
(Ord. No. 07-01, § 4.1, 2-8-2007) 
Sec. 18-88. - Intersections. 
(a)  Angle of intersection. Streets shall intersect at 90 degrees or closer, thereto and in no case at less than 80 degrees.

(c)  Number of streets. No more than two streets shall cross at any one intersection. 
(d)  T intersections. T-type intersections shall be used where practical. 
(e)  Centerline offsets. Slight jogs at intersections shall be avoided. Where such jogs are unavoidable, street centerlines shall be offset by a distance of 125 feet 250 feet or more is desirable. 
(f)  Vertical alignment of intersection. A nearly flat grade with appropriate drainage slopes is desirable within intersections. This flat section shall be carried back 50 feet to 100 feet each way from the intersection. An allowance of two percent maximum intersection grade in rolling and four percent in hilly terrain will be permitted. 
(Ord. No. 07-01, § 4.2, 2-8-2007) 
Sec. 18-89. - Nonmotorized sidewalks and pathways. 
(a)  Sidewalks are five-foot wide concrete surfaces intended primarily for pedestrian traffic. Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete along both sides of all local and collector streets shown on the plat or plan. Provided, however, that sidewalks will not be required along industrial service drives, service drives, and will only be required along one side of marginal access streets. Sidewalks, where required, shall be five feet wide and shall be placed one foot off property lines within the road right-of-way. In residential districts where the minimum lot size is one acre or greater, sidewalks shall be provided either: 
(1)  Along both sides of all local and collector streets shown on the plat or plan; or 
(2)  Along a system of pathways (paved or unpaved) that meander through permanent open space that in the opinion of the approving body provides equivalent pedestrian circulation. Unpaved surfaces shall be stable, with a suitable base approved by the township engineer. 
(b)  Pathways are ten-foot-wide paved surfaces that are intended for both pedestrian and bicycle use. 
(c)  Sidewalks shall be required where necessary along retention ponds, outlots, and open space areas to provide continuity with sidewalks installed in other adjoining developments where deemed necessary by the township board. 
(d)  The design and construction of sidewalks and pathways shall be in conformity with the township's design and construction standards and the township's transportation plan. Sidewalks shall be constructed on a lot-by-lot basis and shall be completed before the occupancy of the structure or the commencement of any use on a lot. Pathways and sidewalks along external arterial and collector roads shall be constructed prior to occupancy of the first lot in the subdivision. 
(e)  When a plat is adjacent to property owned by a school district, the plat shall include at least one sidewalk to provide access to such adjacent property. In addition, such sidewalks may be required where adjacent property is utilized or planned to be utilized for a church, park or other community facility, or within the plat where the length of a block exceeds 1,000 feet. 
(f)  An easement at least 14 feet wide shall be maintained for a separate sidewalk or pathway that is not within a road right-of-way or easement. 
(g)  The surface of a separate sidewalk or pathway shall be designed and constructed to meet the township's design and construction standards. 
(h)  Sidewalks and pathways, or portions thereof, otherwise required may be eliminated or modified where the township board determines, upon planning commission recommendation that installation would have an adverse impact on a sensitive natural area or is not practical due to extreme topographic or site features. In such instances, the township board may require alternative methods of providing public walkways. 
(Ord. No. 07-01, § 4.3, 2-8-2007) 
Sec. 18-90. - Easements. 
(a)  Generally. All underground public utility installations, including lines for street lighting systems, which traverse privately owned property shall be protected by easements granted by the proprietor and approved by the public utility.

(Ord. No. 07-01, § 4.5, 2-8-2007) 
Sec. 18-92. - Lots. 
(a)  Conform to zoning. The lot width, depth, and area shall not be less than the particular district requirements of the township zoning ordinance except where outlots are provided for some permitted purpose. 
(b)  Lot lines. Side lots lines shall generally be perpendicular to the right-of-way lines or radial to curved streets. All side and rear lot lines should be straight lines unless natural features or street curvature so prevent. Variations in these provisions may be made when in the opinion of the planning commission; such variations would result in a better arrangement of lots. 
(c)  Width related to length. Narrow deep lots shall be avoided. The depth of a lot generally shall not exceed 21/2 times the width as measured at the building line for platted subdivisions or four times the width for unplatted lands. 
(d)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall have extra width to permit appropriate front yard building setbacks from both streets. Lots abutting a pedestrian mid-block crosswalk, pathway, or other right-of-way shall be treated as corner lots. 
(e)  Uninhabitable area. Lands subject to flooding or otherwise deemed by the planning commission to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential purposes, or for uses that may in the judgment of the planning commission increase the danger to health, life, or property, or increase the flood hazard. Such land within a subdivision shall be set aside for other uses, such as parks, open space, detention or reserve strips and contained within a conservation easement. 
(f)  Through and back-up lots. Whenever lots back onto arterials, major collectors or freeways, a 20-foot-wide nonaccess greenbelt and easement shall be provided in addition to any utility easement. The greenbelt shall be landscaped in accordance with the type B buffer specifications as provided in article 25 of the township's zoning ordinance. Lots extending through a block and having frontage on two local streets shall be prohibited. 
(g)  Lot frontage. All lots shall front upon and have access to a publicly dedicated street in accordance with the frontage and lot width requirements of the township zoning ordinance. Variances may be permitted for approved planned unit developments, residential open space and open space preservation option projects. 
(h)  Future arrangements. Where parcels of land are subdivided into unusually large lots (such as when large lots are required for septic tank operations), the parcels shall be divided, where feasible, so as to allow for resubdividing into smaller parcels in a logical fashion. Lot arrangements shall allow for the ultimate extension of adjacent streets through the middle of wide blocks. Whenever such future resubdividing or lot splitting is contemplated the plan for such shall be approved by the planning commission, or its designee prior to the taking of such actions. 
(i)  Lot division. The division of a lot in a recorded plat is prohibited, unless approved following application to the township. The application shall be filed with the township's zoning administrator and shall state the reasons for proposed division.

Sec. 24-20. - Findings; purpose. 
    Recognizing that the state legislature has passed part 115 of Public Act No. 451 of 1994 (MCL 324.11501 et seq.), and that a county solid waste management plan has been adopted, and that additional consistent legislation is necessary on the township level in relation to the operation of landfills and solid waste haulers, the township board finds that the filling of land with waste materials may result in the emission of noise, dirt, dust and odors and that such operation results in permanent changes in the topographical and geological characteristics of the land and can create severe health hazards for township citizens. The township board further recognizes that additional health hazards can be created from shifting earth, standing water, groundwater and surface water degradation, and other like considerations. In recognition of the fact that to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of township citizens, to preserve the township's resources and to prevent nuisances, it is hereby deemed necessary that such landfill operations and solid waste haulers be subject to additional township regulation, and that standards be established wherein procedures for licensing landfill operators and solid waste haulers be adopted.

The request shall be delivered to the township clerk within the time set in subsection (a) of this section to debate the violation.

1.0 Purpose and Introduction
1.1 SHORT TITLE
This Ordinance shall be known as the "Charter
Township of Grand Blanc Zoning Ordinance" and
may hereinafter be referred to as "this Ordinance."
1.2 PURPOSE
This Zoning Ordinance is based on the Charter
Township of Grand Blanc Master Plan, the Hill Road
Corridor Plan and design standards, amendments
to those plans and similar plans adopted by the
Planning Commission addressing future
development patterns and development goals. This
Ordinance is intended to implement the Master
Plan through regulations on use of land, buildings
and structures to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare and to accomplish the
objectives listed below.
1. Establish zoning districts and uniform
regulations applicable to each district
governing the use of the land, and dimensions
for building and site development with such
minimum regulations as are deemed necessary
to carry out the provisions of this Ordinance.
2. Accommodate and promote land uses which
are compatible with the Township's character
and conserve the property values and long
term stability of residential neighborhoods,
commercial districts, industrial areas and
special districts.
3. Encourage use of the land and natural
resources in accordance with their character
and capability, thus preserving the sensitive
and important environmental features in the
Township, such as wetlands, lakes, prime
farmland, Centennial Farms, topography, open
space, mature vegetation and wildlife habitat.
This Ordinance acknowledges the importance
of these features on the long term economic
climate of all uses in the Township and the
overall quality of life for Township residents.
4. Limit or prohibit improper use of land.
5. Reduce hazards to life and property,
particularly for development in the 100 year
floodplain.
6. Promote safe conditions for motorists,
pedestrians and bicyclists through
maintenance of an acceptable level of service
along streets and at driveways within the
Township. This includes assurance that
property owners have reasonable, though not
always direct, access to property.
7. Facilitate adequate and cost effective
infrastructure systems, and protect the
substantial public investment in those systems,
including: transportation, sewage disposal, safe
and adequate water supply, education and
recreational facilities.
8. Establish controls over potential land use
conflicts and uses which may need special
regulation as special land uses to be
compatible with surrounding development
patterns and zoning.
9. Promote the gradual elimination of uses,
buildings and structures which do not conform
with the regulations and standards of this
Ordinance.
10. Provide for administration of this Ordinance,
including resolution of any conflicts with other
ordinances, collection of fees, procedures for
petitions, hearings and appeals; and to provide
for any other matters authorized by the
Michigan Zoning Enabling Act.
11. Balance the Township's right to compatible and
quality development with the property owners'
right to a reasonable rate of return on
investment.
1.3 CONFLICTING REGULATIONS
1. Where any provision of this Ordinance imposes
either greater or lesser restrictions, limitations,
conditions, standards or requirements upon the
use of buildings, structures or land; the height
of buildings or structures; lot coverage; lot
areas; yards, wetlands, woodlands or other
open spaces; or any other use or activity which
is regulated by this Ordinance, the provision or
standard which is more restrictive or limiting
shall govern.
2. Except as otherwise be provided in this
Ordinance, every building and structure
erected; every use of any lot, building or
structure established; every structural
alteration or relocation of an existing building or
structure and every enlargement of, or addition
to, an existing use, building or structure
occurring after the effective date of this Section
shall be subject to all regulations of this
Ordinance which are applicable in the zoning
district in which such use, building or structure
is located.
3. No setback area or lot existing at the time of
adoption of this Ordinance shall be reduced in
dimensions or area below the minimum
requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots

created after the effective date of this
Ordinance shall meet at least the minimum
requirements established herein.
4. This Ordinance shall not abrogate or annul any
easement, bylaw, master deed, deed
restriction, covenant or private agreement,
except that the regulations or provisions of this
Ordinance shall govern if determined by the
Zoning Board of Appeals to be more restrictive
or impose a higher standard.
5. The regulations herein established shall be the
minimum regulations for promoting and
protecting the public health, safety and general
welfare. Any conflicting laws of a more
restrictive nature shall supersede the
appropriate provisions of this Ordinance.
6. Uses, buildings and structures that were
nonconforming under the previous zoning
ordinance gain no new rights through the
adoption of the standards of this Ordinance
unless they become conforming or more
conforming by the regulations of this
Ordinance.
1.4 VALIDITY AND SEVERABILITY CLAUSE
This Ordinance and the various components,
articles, sections, sub-sections, sentences and
phrases are hereby declared to be severable. If any
court of competent jurisdiction shall declare any
part of this Ordinance to be unconstitutional or
invalid, such ruling shall not affect any other
provisions of this Ordinance not specifically
included in said ruling. Further, if any court of
competent jurisdiction shall declare
unconstitutional or invalid the application of any
provision of this Ordinance to a particular parcel,
lot, use, building or structure, such ruling shall not
affect the application of said provision to any other
parcel, lot, use, building or structure not specifically
included in said ruling.
1.5 EFFECT ON PROJECTS WHERE
SIGNIFICANT CONSTRUCTION HAS
BEGUN, AND SITE PLANS OR PLANNED
UNIT DEVELOPMENTS APPROVED PRIOR
TO EFFECTIVE DATE
1. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to
require any change in the plans, construction or
designated use of any building upon which
significant construction was begun prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance, provided
significant construction has lawfully begun, is
being diligently carried on and shall be
completed within one (1) year of the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance. This provision
shall also apply to amendments to this
Ordinance. The Zoning Board of Appeals may
permit an extension of this time period for up to
one (1) year, when requested by the applicant
in writing, before the approval expires.
2. If a lot has an approved site plan within twelve
(12) months prior to the effective date of this
Ordinance, such site plan shall remain valid if
construction is begun within one (1) year and
completed within two (2) years of the effective
date of this Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning
Board of Appeals may permit an extension of
this time period for up to one (1) year, when
requested by the applicant in writing, before
the approval expires. Mobile home or
manufactured home parks shall have five years
to commence construction from the date the
Michigan Department of Commerce issues a
construction permit, with extensions approved
by the Department of Commerce.
3. A Planned Unit Development (PUD) approved
under the previous Zoning Ordinance shall
remain valid if construction is begun within one
(1) year of its final PUD approval and work is
being diligently carried on, provided that if the
approved conceptual plan is altered
significantly, as defined in the Planned Unit
Development regulations of this Ordinance, or
if significant construction is ceased for more
than six (6) months, the regulations and
standards of this Ordinance shall apply.
4. If the special conditions of this Section are not
met, the standards and provisions of this
Ordinance shall govern.
1.6 VESTED RIGHT
Nothing in this Ordinance shall be interpreted or
construed to provide any permanent vested rights
in the continuation of any particular use, district,
zoning classification or any permissible activities
therein, other than noted in Section 1.6. Such
uses, structures, and activities are hereby declared
to be subject to subsequent amendment, change or
modification as may be necessary for the
preservation or protection of public health, safety
and welfare.
1.7 VOTING PLACE
The provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be
construed to interfere with the temporary use of any
property as a voting place in connection with a
Township, school or other public election.

1.8 PROHIBITED USES
Basis. Certain uses may not be appropriate within
the Township of Grand Blanc given the existing
development pattern, environmental condition and
overall character in the community. In accordance
with the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, a Zoning
Ordinance or zoning decision can totally prohibit the
establishment of a requested land use within a
township if there is not an appropriate location
within the community or the use is unlawful, even if
there is a demonstrated need for that land use
either in the township or surrounding area. In
determining there is no appropriate location for the
use within the township, the Planning Commission
shall consider the following:
1. The land area required by the proposed use;
2. Existing environmental conditions and potential
environmental hazards;
3. The potential impact on surrounding properties
in terms of traffic, noise, lighting, property
valuation and views;
4. Demand and capacity of utilities and municipal
services to support the proposed use; and,
5. A finding that there is an alternative land use
that will provide the property owner with a
reasonable rate of return on investment.

iii. If a commercial component is part of a
residential development proposed on
residentially-zoned property, excluding
accessory retail as discussed under Section
3.1.19.C.ii.a, then the minimum site size shall
be forty (40) acres.
iv. The site may have significant natural or historic
features which will be preserved through
development under the PUD overlay standards,
as determined by the Township Board, following
review and recommendation by the Planning
Commission; or the PUD will provide a
complementary mixture of uses, a variety of
housing types or a design that preserves
common open space, not possible under the
requirements of the underlying zoning district.
v. The planned unit development will result in a
Recognizable and Substantial Benefit to the
ultimate users of the project and to the
community, as demonstrated by the applicant,
where such benefit would otherwise be
unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved.
vi. In relation to development permitted by the
underlying zoning, the proposed type and
density of use(s) shall not result in an
unreasonable increase in traffic or the use of
public services, facilities and utilities unless the
Applicant proposes to construct adequate
public improvements to mitigate the impact of
additional demand on public facilities. In
addition, the PUD shall not place an
unreasonable burden upon the subject and/or
surrounding land and/or property owners and
occupants.
vii. In relation to development permitted by the
underlying zoning, the proposed development
shall not result in an unreasonable negative
impact upon surrounding properties.
viii. For a PUD with a mixture of uses, the project
shall be designed to achieve a synergistic
relationship between the uses. The various
uses shall be integrated with pedestrian and
vehicular access systems and open spaces. For
all PUD projects, site design elements should
be developed in a consistent manner
throughout the entire site (e.g. landscaping,
signs, lighting, etc.).
ix. The proposed development shall not have an
adverse impact upon the Townships Master
Plan and shall be consistent with the Master
Plans spirit and intent, as well as the spirit and
intent of the Townships Zoning Ordinance.
A. INTENT
The purpose of this Section is to permit coordinated
development on appropriate sites with unique
conditions such as, but not limited to: significant
natural features the property owner and Township
wish to preserve; land that exhibits development
constraints; or the opportunity to mix compatible
uses or residential types, or cluster residential units
to preserve common open space and natural
features. PUD can also be a tool to allow the
creative development of land to promote economic
development in accordance with the Township
Master Plan.
The PUD overlay standards are provided as a
design option to permit flexibility in the regulation of
land development; to encourage innovation in land
use, form of ownership and variety in design, layout,
and type of structures constructed; to preserve
significant natural features and open space; to
promote efficient provision of public services and
utilities; to minimize adverse traffic impacts; to
provide adequate housing and employment; to
encourage development of recreational amenities;
ensure compatibility of design between neighboring
properties; and to encourage the use and
improvement of existing sites when the uniform
regulations contained in other zoning districts alone
do not provide adequate protection and safeguards
for the site or its surrounding areas.
The PUD overlay standards shall not be used as a
technique to circumvent the intent of the Zoning
Ordinance or to avoid imposition of specific Zoning
Ordinance standards. Modifications and departures
from generally applicable requirements or the
underlying zoning code may be made to provide the
applicant and Township with flexibility in design on
the basis of the total PUD plan approved by the
Township.
B. QUALIFYING CONDITIONS
Planned unit developments may be allowed as an
overlay of any zoning classification upon
determination that all of the following criteria are
met:
i. The planned unit development site shall be
under the control of one owner or group of
owners and shall be capable of being planned
and developed as one integral unit.
ii. The site size is a minimum of five (5) acres of
contiguous land. A smaller area of property
contiguous to an approved PUD may be
reviewed for addition to that PUD under the
major amendment provisions of this chapter.

however, that the total gross floor area
devoted to retail and restaurant uses shall
not exceed 30,000 square feet.
b. Underlying zoning is office or commercial.
The Township Board may permit
residential, office and commercial uses,
and other uses permitted in the underlying
zoning district, upon finding that the
organization of uses meets the intent and
other PUD design standards.
c. Underlying zoning is research and
development or industrial. Underlying
zoning is research and development or
industrial. The Township Board may permit
office, commercial, light industrial, and
research and development uses, and other
uses permitted in the underlying zoning
district upon finding that the organization
of uses meets the intent and other PUD
design standards. Extended stay hotels
and short term corporate housing facilities
may also be permitted to serve office,
research and industrial uses. Attached
single family and/or multiple family
residential uses may be permitted when
comprehensively designed and integrated
into a mixed use PUD that is predominantly
non-residential in nature.
d. Underlying zoning contains multiple
districts. If the property includes a
combination of underlying zoning districts
the resulting development mix shall be
based upon the acreage zoned for each
district.
e. Any PUD proposing a mixture of residential
and non-residential uses may develop
mixed-use buildings where residential is
located above non-residential uses. This
provision will be subject to approval by the
Planning Commission subject to the
adequacy of building, site, access, and
parking design.
iii. Residential Density. PUD density shall be
regulated as follows:
a. Underlying zoning is residential. The
number of dwelling units permitted shall be
based on the underlying zoning district. The
definition for density in Article 2 describes
how to calculate maximum density. The
Planning Commission may increase the
overall density by up to twenty percent
(20%) upon a determination that
significant natural features would be
C. PROJECT DESIGN STANDARDS
Any planned unit development shall comply with the
following project design standards:
i. Location. A planned unit development may be
approved in any location in the Township,
subject to qualifying conditions and standards
for review and approval as provided for herein.
ii. Uses Permitted. The flexibility of the PUD
provides opportunities to develop projects with
either a single type of land use or a variety of
land uses combined to form a unified
development based on the underlying zoning.
The predominant use within any PUD project
shall be those permitted by the underlying
zoning. The Township Board, following review
and a recommendation by the Planning
Commission, shall determine predominance of
use after taking into account the following
considerations: amount of traffic generated;
hours of operation or use; noise, odors, and
overall impact on adjoining uses; land area
allocated to each use; and, building area
allocated to each use. Uses not permitted by
the underlying zoning shall not be part of the
first phase.
a. Underlying zoning is residential. Single-
Family, TwoFamily, Multiple-Family
dwellings, other uses permitted in the
underlying zoning district, and accessory
uses customarily permitted in residential
districts. For residential PUDs less than
forty (40) acres, non-residential uses shall
not be permitted except for the following:
1) limited retail and personal service uses
for the exclusive use of the residents of the
PUD may be permitted upon the Township
Board finding, after review and
recommendation by the Planning
Commission, that the use is clearly
accessory and that no advertising or
marketing to patrons outside the PUD shall
be permitted and 2) non-residential uses
listed in the underlying residential district
may be permitted upon review in the
context of the PUD site and impact on the
surrounding area. The applicant shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Township Board that this Section has been
met. Residentially-zoned PUDs of forty (40)
acres or more may be permitted to
incorporate non-residential development
dedicated to neighborhood office or
neighborhood retail uses on up to five (5)
percent of the developed acreage provided,

preserved that would otherwise be lost if
the site were developed under a more
traditional subdivision plan, and that
township services can accommodate the
increased density. The applicant shall
submit a conventional conceptual plan
(parallel plan) that illustrates that the
number of units the applicant is proposing
in the PUD is consistent with the standards
in this Ordinance. The Planning
Commission and Township Board may also
utilize appropriate criteria and guidelines to
determine whether a density bonus should
be allowed and the percentage of the
density bonus.
b. Underlying zoning is nonresidential. The
density established by the Planning
Commission and Township Board shall be
consistent with the Master Plan and the
standards in this Ordinance, based upon a
determination that such density will not
adversely affect water and sewer services,
storm water drainage, road capacity, traffic,
parks and recreation, fire and police
services, schools, character of the area,
and any planned public and private
improvements in this area. The density for
any proposed residential uses in a
nonresidential district shall be determined
by the Planning Commission and Township
Board, but in no case shall residential
density exceed the density permitted in
Article 3 for High Density Residential for the
area designated for residential or in the
case of mixed-use (residential and nonresidential)
buildings for the portion of the
site designed for mixed-use buildings.
iv. Buffering between uses. The placement of PUD
residential uses adjacent to single or multifamily
residential districts sharing a common
boundary is encouraged. At their discretion,
the Planning Commission may specifically
approve a non-residential or mixed-use
structure located adjacent to a residential
district. Parking, loading, and vehicular traffic
ways, shall be separated and buffered from
residential units within the PUD and other
residential districts adjacent to the PUD project
in a manner consistent with good site design
and planning principles as specified in Section
5.15 and as otherwise determined by the
Township, provided it is recognized that this
provision may have limited application to multiuse
buildings. When non-residential uses
adjoin residentially zoned property outside of
the PUD, noise reduction and screening
methods including landscape berms or
decorative walls shall be required at the
discretion of the Planning Commission and
Township Board.
v. Open Space. The PUD development shall
incorporate fifteen (15) percent of the total site
as open space for the sole benefit, use and
enjoyment of present and future occupants of
the PUD. Required open space areas shall be
contiguous to the maximum extent practical. If
natural features are present on the site, such
open space must include those natural
features. Required open space shall be
permanently set aside through covenant, deed
restriction, or similar legal instrument
acceptable to the Township. If agreed to by the
Township Board, the open space may be
conveyed to the Township for the use of the
general public. Such open space shall not
include required yards or buffers, parking
areas, drives, rights-of-way, utility or road
easements, storm water detention ponds, and
structures. At least thirty (30) percent of the
open space required by this Section shall be
upland, non-wetland areas.
vi. Natural Features. The development shall be
designed to promote preservation of natural
resources and natural features, taking into
consideration the local, state and national
concern for the protection and preservation of
natural resources and natural features. Design
guidelines to be considered are as follows:
a. Wherever possible natural drainage shall
be retained and improved if necessary.
b. Natural site amenities and sensitive
environmental features shall be preserved
to the maximum extent feasible.
c. The location of existing trees and unique
vegetation should be considered in the
selection of building location, utility
placement, circulation patterns and paved
areas.
d. Floodplain areas shall be preserved as
permanent open space.
e. The natural topography of the site shall be
considered in the design of the project.
Major grade changes should be avoided
and protective measures shall be taken to
protect steep slopes and prevent
unnecessary soil erosion.

roadway, drainage and utility design;
underground installation of utilities; insulating
the pedestrian circulation system from
vehicular thoroughfares and ways; connecting
internal pedestrian circulation systems with
external paths, whether existing or proposed;
achievement of an integrated development with
respect to signage, lighting, landscaping and
building materials; and noise reduction and
visual screening mechanisms, particularly in
cases where nonresidential uses adjoin off-site
residentially-zoned property.
Consistent with the PUD concept, and toward
encouraging flexibility and creativity in
development, departures from compliance with
the standards provided for in this ordinance,
may be granted at the discretion of the
Township Board as part of the PUD approval
process. Such departures may be authorized
on the condition that there are features or
planning mechanisms deemed adequate by the
Township Board designed into the project for
the purpose of achieving the objectives
intended to be accomplished with respect to
each of the regulations from which a departure
is sought. In all events, however, the required
perimeter setbacks adjacent to residential
zoning outside the PUD boundaries may not be
modified from those established within this
Section. Any deviations from ordinance
standards will require the Applicant to provide
substitute safeguards for each regulation for
which there is noncompliance, in whole or in
part, in the development plan.
D. PUD APPLICATION AND REVIEW PROCESS
All PUD applications shall follow a three-step review
process including Pre-application Conference,
Conceptual PUD Site Plan review and approval, and
Final PUD Site Plan review and approval. If a
rezoning of the subject site is required, the
applicant may seek a rezoning concurrent with and
contingent upon the application for Conceptual PUD
Site Plan approval. Prior to the preparation of the
PUD application, the developer shall participate in a
Pre-application Conference. After the Preapplication
Conference, the applicant shall submit a
formal request for PUD approval along with a
Conceptual PUD Site Plan for review by the Planning
Commission. The Conceptual PUD Site Plan and
the adoption of the PUD Overlay zoning district shall
require the approval of the Township Board after
the Planning Commission public hearing and
vii. Dimensional Standards. The setbacks and
other dimensional standards for various uses
shall be based on the following:
a. Single family residential uses shall comply
with the yard (setback), height and
minimum floor area regulations applicable
to the R-3 district, provided that the zero
lot line, average lot size or open space
options may be utilized (see Sections
3.6.2Z or 3.6.2.AA) .
b. Multiple family uses shall comply with the
regulations applicable to the Medium
Density Multiple Family District, provided
the High Density Multiple Family District
regulations may be used where the
underlying zoning is for High Density
Multiple Family and, in the case of nonresidentially
zoned land, where the density
proposed would only be permitted in a High
Density Multiple Family District.
c. Office, commercial, industrial, and mixed
uses shall comply with the zoning
regulations for the least intensive zoning
district which permits the use.
viii. Building Appearance Standards. The PUD
review process shall place significant emphasis
on the quality of architecture design and
exterior building materials. PUD projects shall
demonstrate adherence to high standards of
design. Building materials such as brick and
stone are strongly encouraged. The use of
materials such as standard (smooth faced)
concrete masonry units (CMUs) or cinder block
as an exterior building material is prohibited.
Variations in roof-lines and articulation of walls
and building elevations are strongly
encouraged. When big box retail, large office
buildings, large industrial buildings and similar
structures are proposed, large blank walls
without articulation shall not be permitted.
Notwithstanding any other provisions in this
ordinance, the Planning Director, the Planning
Commission, the Site Plan Review Committee,
and the Township Board will apply quality
design standards on a case by case basis,
whether or not such design standards are
specifically enumerated in an ordinance,
guideline or otherwise.
ix. Additional Considerations. The Planning
Commission and Township Board shall take
into account the following considerations, as
the same may be relevant to a particular
project: perimeter setback and berming;

recommendation. The Final PUD Site Plan shall be
reviewed and approved by the Township Board.
i. Pre-application Conference. Prior to formal
submission of an application for planned unit
development approval, the applicant shall meet
with the Supervisor, Planning Director, Building
Official, Director of Public Works, Fire Chief,
Police Chief, and other Township personnel and
consultants as deemed appropriate. The
purpose of such a conference is to provide
information and guidance that will assist the
applicant in preparation of the application and
conceptual plan. No formal action shall be
taken at a pre-application conference.
The applicant shall present at such a
conference or conferences, at minimum, a
sketch plan of the proposed planned unit
development; a legal description of the property
in question; the total number of acres in the
project; a statement of the approximate
number of residential units and the
approximate regulations to be sought; the
number of acres to be preserved as open or
recreational space; and, the natural features to
be preserved in general.
ii. Conceptual PUD Application. The applicant
shall prepare and submit to the Township a
request for PUD approval with a Conceptual
PUD Site Plan meeting the submittal
requirements of Section 3.1.19.E and fifteen
(15) copies of an Impact Assessment
developed in accordance with Section 6.5. The
Conceptual PUD Site Plan shall illustrate uses
within each component, road layout, parking
area and open space. A Traffic Impact Study
conforming to Section 6.6 shall be submitted
with the Conceptual PUD Site Plan application.
iii. Planning Commission Review and Public
Hearing. The Planning Commission shall review
the Conceptual PUD Site Plan and the Impact
Assessment. The Planning Commission shall
set a date for a public hearing after the
requirements of Section 3.1.19.D.ii have been
met. Notice of the public hearing shall be given
by one (1) publication in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Township, and by mail
or personal delivery to the owners of property
for which approval is being considered, to all
persons whom real property is assessed within
300 feet of the subject property, and to the
occupants of all structures within 300 feet of
the subject property regardless of whether the
property or occupant is located within Grand
Blanc Township. The notice shall be given not
less than fifteen (15) days before the public
hearing date, in accordance with Section 103
of the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, P.A. 110
of 2006, as amended, (M.C.L. 125.3101 et
seq.). The notice shall specify that the
Township is considering both an amendment to
the Zoning Map (to add the PUD designation for
the subject site) and the Conceptual PUD Site
Plan. The notice shall also describe the nature
of the request, indicate the property that is
subject of the request including a listing of all
existing street addresses within the subject
property, state when and where the request will
be considered, and indicate when and where
written comments will be received concerning
the request. The Planning Commission shall
conduct the public hearing, and submit a
written recommendation on the requested PUD
overlay zoning to the Township Board based on
the review standards of Section 3.1.19.F.
iv. Township Board Review. The Township Board
shall review the requested PUD overlay zoning
and the Conceptual PUD Site Plan and either
approve, deny or approve with a list of
conditions made part of the approval. The
Township Board may require a resubmittal of
the Conceptual PUD Site Plan reflecting the
conditions for approval by the Site Plan Review
Committee or Planning Commission prior to
submittal of a PUD Final Site Plan.
v. Final PUD Site Plan. The Final PUD Site Plan
shall first be submitted to the Planning
Commission for review and recommendation.
Township Board approval of the Conceptual
PUD Site Plan shall confer upon the property
owner the right to submit a final PUD site plan
for the review and approval of the Township
Board in accordance with Section 3.1.19.G for
a period not to exceed two (2) years from date
of approval. For individual phases of a PUD,
Final Site Plans shall be approved by the
Planning Commission. If application for Final
PUD Site Plan approval is not requested within
this time period, the approval shall expire and
resubmittal of the Conceptual PUD application
shall be required. The Township Board may
extend the Conceptual PUD approval period up
to an additional two (2) years, if requested in
writing by the applicant prior to the expiration
date.

Townships final site plan standards for the first
building or project phase. Each detailed site
plan shall then be reviewed according to the
procedures and standards of Section 6.2, Site
Plan Review, or the Township Subdivision
Regulations for any platted portion of the PUD.
The final PUD site plan shall be reviewed by the
Township Board according to the procedures
outlined in Section 6.2, Site Plan Review. The
Final PUD Site Plan for individual phases shall
be approved by the Planning Commission. The
design and proposed uses shall be consistent
with the approved conceptual plan. The
Township Board may require an updated
version of the impact assessment for an
individual phase if the proposed use or layout
has changed from the approved concept plan.
iv. For any condominium section of a PUD, the
applicant shall provide a copy of the Master
Deed and Condominium Association Bylaws for
approval by the Township Board. The

on use of common areas or open space
accessory structures such as swimming pools,
decks, playground equipment and buildings. A
plan shall be provided indicating the limits of
such accessory structures within a defined
envelope.
H. SCHEDULE OF CONSTRUCTION
i. To ensure that planned unit developments are
constructed in an orderly manner and further,
to ensure that the planned unit development
approach is not used as a means of
circumventing restrictions on the location or
quantity of certain types of land use, nonresidential
structures and uses not otherwise
permitted in an underlying residential district
shall not be constructed until at least twentyfive
(25) percent of the residential buildings
have commenced construction. To qualify,
residential structures must have valid building
permits. For non-residentially zoned property,
not more than twenty-five (25) percent of the
site shall be developed for uses not otherwise
permitted in the underlying district until an
equal percentage of the site has been
developed for permitted uses in the underlying
district. For purposes of carrying out this
provision, the percentage shall be
approximations as determined by the Township
Board, following review and a recommendation
by the Planning Commission, based on the floor
streets, and other elements shall be designed
to discourage through traffic, while promoting
safe and efficient traffic operations within the
site and at its access points.
ix. The planned unit development will result in a
recognizable and substantial benefit to the
ultimate users of the project and to the
community, as demonstrated by the applicant,
where such benefit would otherwise be
unfeasible or unlikely to be achieved.
G. FINAL PUD SITE PLAN SUBMITTAL

Board.
ii. Final site plan approval of a PUD, PUD phase or
a building within a PUD shall be effective for a
period of three (3) years. Further submittals
under the PUD procedures shall be accepted
for review upon a showing of substantial
progress in development of previously
approved phases, or upon a showing of good
cause for not having made such progress.
iii. In the development of a PUD, the percentage of
one-family dwelling units under construction, or
lots sold, shall be at least in the same
proportion to the percentage of multiple family
dwelling units under construction at any one
time, provided that this Section shall be applied
only if one-family dwelling units comprise
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the total
housing stock proposed for the PUD.
I. APPEALS AND VIOLATIONS
i. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the
authority to hear and decide appeal requests by
individual property owners for dimensional,
bulk, & height variances from the Grand Blanc
Township Zoning Ordinance. However, the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall not have the
authority to reverse an order or decision of the
Township Board, change conditions imposed by
the Township Board or make interpretations
related to the PUD site plan or Development
Agreement.
ii. A violation of the PUD plan shall be considered
a violation of this Ordinance.
J. AMENDMENTS AND DEVIATIONS FROM
APPROVED FINAL PUD SITE PLAN
i. Deviations from the approved Final PUD Site
Plan may occur only when an applicant or
property owner who was granted Final PUD Site
Plan approval notifies the Planning Director of
the proposed amendment to such approved
site plan in writing, accompanied by a site plan
illustrating the proposed change. The result
shall be received prior to initiation of any
construction in conflict with the approved Final
PUD Site Plan.
ii. Procedure: Within fourteen (14) days of receipt
of a request to amend the Final PUD Site Plan,
the Planning Director shall determine whether
the change is major, warranting review by the
Township Board, or (minor), allowing
administrative approval, as noted below.
iii. Minor changes: The Planning Director may
approve the proposed revision upon finding the
change would not alter the basic design nor any
condition imposed upon the original plan
approval by the Township Board. The Planning
Director shall inform the Planning Commission
and Township Board of such approval in writing.
The Planning Director shall consider the
following when determining a change to be
minor:
a. For residential buildings, the size of
structures may be reduced; or increased by
five percent (5%), provided the overall
density of units does not increase and the
minimum square footage requirements are
met.
b. Gross floor area of non-residential
buildings may be decreased or increased
by up to five percent (5%) or 10,000
square feet, whichever is smaller.

there is a request to expand the land area
included within the PUD, submittal of an
amended application for review and approval
by the Township Board is required. If the
Township Board determines that the proposed
modifications to the Final PUD Site Plan
significantly alter the intent of the Conceptual
PUD Site Plan or significantly modify the on-site
or off-site impacts of the Plan, a revised
conceptual PUD Site Plan shall be submitted
according to the procedures outlined in this
Section, including a new public hearing and
review and recommendation by the Planning
Commission prior to Township Board action. If
the PUD is being expanded in size, the
previously submitted impact assessment and
traffic study shall be updated to reflect new
conditions and the expected impacts
associated with the subject area.
K. DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT
i. Upon obtaining approval of a Conceptual PUD
Site Plan, the applicant and Township Board
shall enter into a Development Agreement that
describes the terms and conditions of the
approval and the rights and obligations of each
party. The Development Agreement may be
approved by the Township Board immediately
following approval of the Conceptual PUD Site
Plan or it may be placed on an subsequent
agenda of the Township Board. The applicant
shall reimburse the Township for all fees for
Township legal counsel and consultant
participation in the development agreement.
ii. The approved Development Agreement shall be
recorded with the Genesee County Register of
Deeds.
iii. In the event that the Conceptual PUD Site Plan
requires a major amendment, the Development
Agreement shall be amended to reflect the
approved changes and recorded as provided in
Section 3.1.19.K.ii above. Action to amend a
Development Agreement requires approval by
the Township Board.

permitting modifications to dimensional
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance;
viii. Facilitating the construction and maintenance
of streets, utilities, and public services in a
more economical and efficient manner;
ix. Ensuring compatibility of design and use
between neighboring properties and a generally
consistent density with that permitted in the
underlying zoning district; and,
x. Encouraging a less sprawling form of
development, thus permanently preserving
open space as undeveloped land.
These overlay development regulations are
intended to provide flexibility in certain Zoning
Ordinance requirements to preserve natural
features and open space which might be lost
through more traditional subdivision
development in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Single
Family Residential Districts or in other
residential zoning districts in which the
Planning Commission determines open space
conservation is a primary consideration. These
standards are not intended as a device for
ignoring or circumventing the Zoning or
Subdivision Regulations of the Township, the
standards set forth therein, nor the planning
concepts upon which the Zoning Ordinance has
been based. These standards are intended to
result in a specific development substantially
consistent with Zoning Ordinance standards,
yet allow for modifications from the general
standards to insure appropriate and consistent
decision making.
B. ESTABLISHMENT OF OVERLAY
The ROS development option is established as an
overlay with the underlying zoning remaining in
place, and shall be available by right for
condominium developments, platted subdivisions,
and land divisions in all single-family residential
districts, or in other residential zoning districts in
which the Planning Commission determines open
space conservation is a primary consideration.
Development permitted under this Section shall be
considered as the preferred option to the
development otherwise permitted in the applicable
zoning districts, and shall be mutually agreeable to
both the applicant / developer and the Township.
Any person with a legal interest in an eligible parcel
or lot may apply for the ROS development option by
filing the completed applications as outlined in
Section 3.1.20.H. The Planning Commission shall
have the power to approve an ROS development.
A. INTENT
The purpose of the Residential Open Space
Development Option is to maintain the rural,
natural and scenic qualities of the Township.
Toward this end, all residential open space
developments shall be designed to promote the
preservation and protection of natural features,
significant wildlife habitats, sensitive environments
and scenic vistas. The provisions set forth in this
Section encourage innovative and livable
residential neighborhoods through permanent
preservation of open space.
Increasing suburban development of rural areas
has produced a need for more environmentally
sensitive and cost efficient residential
development. The Residential Open Space
Development Option meets this need as dwelling
units are grouped or clustered onto part of the
parcel so the remaining area can be permanently
preserved as open space.
The intent of this Section is to offer an alternative to
traditional residential developments and
subdivisions that results in an enhanced living
environment through the permanent preservation
of open and rural landscapes through the use of
planned unit development legislation, as authorized
by Section 503 of the Michigan Zoning Enabling
Act, P.A. 110 of 2006, as amended, (M.C.L.
125.3101 et seq.) for the purpose of:
i. Encouraging the use of land in accordance with
the Townships character;
ii. Providing more environmentally sensitive
residential developments by assuring the
permanent preservation of open space,
woodlands, wetlands, natural topography and
other natural resources;
iii. Preserving the rural landscape and protecting
environmentally sensitive lands from the
disruptive effects of traditional subdivision
development;
iv. Providing open spaces and/or recreational
facilities within a reasonable distance of all
residents of open space communities;
v. Encouraging the provision of open space of a
reasonable size to provide a more efficient and
aesthetic use of such open space;
vi. Help promote long term preservation of
wetlands by promoting ownership by an
association rather than individual lot owner;
vii. Allowing innovation and greater flexibility in the
design of residential developments by

of the area of wetlands protected by Michigan
Public Act 451 of 1994, as amended, and one
hundred percent (100%) of the area of water
bodies and inundated lands (lakes, ponds,
streams, drains) and lands within a 100-year
floodplain.
vii. Secondary Conservation Area. Natural or
cultural features including, but not limited to,
wetlands outside of primary conservation
areas, mature woodlands, individual trees over
eight (8) inch diameter (measured at breast
height), natural drainage ways, rolling
topography and slopes exceeding ten percent
(10%) grade, aquifer recharge areas, wildlife
habitat areas, historic sites, prime farmland,
and/or scenic views or vistas from public rightsof-
way designated for conservation. Secondary
conservation areas shall be guided by the maps
and policies of the natural features, open
space or recreation elements of the Township
Master Plan.
D. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
In selecting the Open Space Overlay Option, the
applicant must present a proposal for residential
development that meets each of the following:
i. Recognizable Benefits. An open space
community shall result in a recognizable and
substantial benefit, both to the residents of the
property and to the overall quality of life in the
Township. The benefits can be provided
through site design elements in excess of the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. Such
elements may include the following:
preservation of primary and secondary
conservation areas; preservation of open space
along major thoroughfares; buffering
developments from lakes, rivers, streams and
wetlands; high quality architectural design;
extensive landscaping; transition areas from
adjacent residential land uses; unique site
design features; and unified access. This
benefit should accrue, in spite of any
foreseeable detriments of the proposed
development.
ii. Open Space. To be eligible for Open Space
Overlay Option, the proposed development
shall comply with either Option A or Option B of
this Sub-Section:
a. Option A. The Open Space Preservation
Areas contain one hundred percent (100%)
C. DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of the ROS District, the terms
enumerated in this Section shall be defined as
follows:
i. Adjusted Parcel Acreage. Net parcel area after
the acreage of all primary conservation areas,
all proposed public rights-of-way, all areas
within overhead utility line easements, and all
proposed storm water management ponds on
the parcel have been deducted from the gross
parcel acreage.
ii. Density. See Section 2.2.91.
iii. Gross Parcel Acreage. The total horizontal area
within the lot lines of the lot excluding existing
rights-of-way and access easements.
iv. Open Space Preservation Area. Any
undeveloped land area within the boundaries
of the parcel within an open space residential
development, which is designed and intended
to permanently conserve environmental
features for the common use or enjoyment of
the residents of the development or the public
or dedicated to an agricultural use. Such open
space may contain accessory structures and
improvements appropriate for recreational
purposes, as provided by ordinance, such as
recreational trails, picnic areas, childrens play
area, greenways or linear parks. The following
are not considered open space by this
definition: golf courses, the area of any street
right-of-way proposed to be dedicated to the
public, access easements for private roads or
underground or overhead utilities, the required
setbacks surrounding an existing residential
structure that is located on an individual lot or
condominium site, limited common areas, and
parking and loading areas.
v. Open Space Community or ROS Development.
A predominately residential development in
which dwelling units are placed together into
one or more groups or clusters within a defined
project area, where the dwelling units are
separated from adjacent properties or other
groups or clusters of dwellings by substantial
open space that is perpetually protected from
development, whereby the preservation of
primary and secondary conservation areas is
emphasized as the basis for grouping or
clustering dwelling units.
vi. Primary Conservation Area. Sensitive
environmental features, land or lands that are
deducted from the gross parcel acreage to
produce the adjusted parcel acreage. Lands to

of all Primary Conservation Areas and a
minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the gross
parcel acreage.
b. Option B. The Open Space Preservation
Areas contain one hundred percent (100%)
of all Primary Conservation Areas and a
minimum of thirty percent (30%) of the
adjusted parcel acreage.
iii. Unified Control. The proposed development
shall be under single ownership or control, such
that there is a single person or entity having
proprietary responsibility for the full completion
of the project. The applicant shall provide
sufficient documentation of ownership or
control in the form of agreements, contracts,
covenants, and/or deed restrictions that
indicate that the development will be
completed in its entirety as proposed.
iv. Protection from Development in Perpetuity.
The applicant shall guarantee to the
satisfaction of the Township and the Planning
Commission that all Open Space Preservation
Areas will remain perpetually in an
undeveloped state, as required in Section
3.1.20.G.viii). Further subdivision of open
space lands, or their use for other than
recreation, conservation or agriculture shall be
prohibited.
v. Cohesive Neighborhood. The proposed
development shall be designed to create a
cohesive neighborhood through common open
space areas for passive and/or active
recreation and resident interaction. All open
space areas shall be equally available to all
residents of the residential open space
development.
vi. Density Impact. The proposed type and density
of use shall not result in an unreasonable
increase in the need for or impact upon public
services, facilities, roads, and utilities in
relation to the use or uses otherwise permitted
by this Zoning Ordinance, and shall not place
an unreasonable impact upon the subject site
and surrounding land, surrounding property
owners and occupants, and/or the natural
environment.
vii. Township Master Plan. The proposed
development shall be consistent with and
further the implementation of the Grand Blanc
Charter Township Master Plan (Public Act 168
of 1959, as amended), and any subsequent
amendments thereto.
viii. Compliance with Applicable Regulations. The
proposed open space community shall comply
with all applicable Federal, State, and local
regulations.
E. REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY
To encourage flexibility and creativity consistent
with the open space community concept, the
Planning Commission may grant specific departures
from the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance for
minimum yard setbacks, lot size, and bulk
standards as a part of the approval process,
provided that such modification results in enhanced
buffering from adjacent land uses or public rightsof-
ways, or further preservation of natural features.
Any regulatory modification shall be approved
through a finding by the Planning Commission that
the deviation shall result in a higher quality of
development than would be possible using
conventional zoning standards. Regulatory
modifications are not subject to variance approval
of the Zoning Board of Appeals. No part of an open
space community plan may be appealed to the
Zoning Board of Appeals. Any deviation of an
approved plan shall require approval from the
Planning and Zoning Department or the Planning
Commission, as specified in Section 3.1.20.J. This
provision shall not preclude an individual lot or
dwelling unit owner from seeking a variance
following final approval of the open space
community, provided such variance does not
involve alterations to open space areas as shown
on the approved open space community site plan.
F. DENSITY BONUS
The Planning Commission may allow an exemplary
residential open space development to include an
optional density bonus. In order to qualify for an
optional density bonus, the applicant must
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission, that the proposed project exceeds the
minimum standards for residential open space
development eligibility under this Section.
Density Bonus. A variable density bonus of up to
twenty percent (20%) may be allowed at the
discretion of the Planning Commission, based upon
a finding that the open space community includes
all of the following:
i. The residential open space development is a
minimum of five (5) gross acres of contiguous
land. The Planning Commission may also
consider a density bonus for residential open
space developments smaller than five (5)

Plan Review procedures in Section 6.2 and must
comply with the following project design standards:
i. Project Design Objectives. The open space
community shall be designed to accomplish the
following objectives:
a. Protect, preserve, and maintain primary
and secondary conservation areas from
clearing, grading, filling, or construction
except where planned for essential
services or recreation amenities.
b. Create sufficient buffer areas to minimize

g. Design individual lots, buildings, roadways
and open space areas to minimize the
alteration of environmental site features.
h. Minimize the impact of traffic generated by
the proposed development on surrounding
uses by providing adequate number of
access points, and by properly designing
access points relative to the surrounding
road network.
i. Protect the rural roadside character by
establishing buffer zones along scenic
corridors and improve public safety and
vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding

Space Preservation Areas shall meet the
following standards to the greatest extent
feasible:
a. The open space is provided along the
public street right-of-way to provide
additional buffering from the traffic and
enhance views from the roadway provided
the open space along such right-of-way
shall generally have a depth of at least fifty
(50) feet. The open space along a right-ofway
shall be either preserved in a natural
wooded condition, landscaped, or a
combination of preserved and newly
planted landscaping. The open space shall
have a minimum of one (1) evergreen tree
and one (1) canopy tree for each forty (40)
linear feet of road frontage. Such plantings
shall be planted in staggered rows or
clustered into groupings to provide a
natural appearance. Preservation of
existing trees may be credited, according to
the standards in Section 5.10.8 of the
Grand Blanc Charter Township Zoning
Ordinance, towards meeting the
requirement for number of trees listed in
this Sub-Section;
b. The open space provides an ecological link

is determined by the Township Building
Official to be a public nuisance, with the
assessment of costs upon the property
owners.
ix. Access. Direct access onto a public road shall
be required to a residential open space
development. The nearest edge of any
entrance or exit drive shall be located no closer
than two hundred (200) feet from any existing
street or road intersection (as measured from
the nearest intersection right-of-way line). Open
space communities shall also meet or exceed
the access standards contained in this Zoning
Ordinance or other ordinances of the Township.
x. Internal Roads. Internal roads within an open
space community shall generally be public
roads. Roads shall comply with Genesee

If significant natural features would be
preserved by a reduction in road width,
the Planning Commission may reduce
the required pavement width of private
roads to a minimum of twenty-two (22)
feet within an easement of at least fifty
(50) feet.
b. Required Landscaping. Both sides of all
internal roads shall be landscaped with

provided per dwelling. For sections of road
that do not abut lots or condominium sites,
one (1) canopy tree shall be provided on
each side for every fifty (50) linear feet of
road. Existing trees to be preserved within
five (5) feet of the road right-of-way or
easement may be credited towards
meeting this requirement.
xi. Lot and Dwelling Location. Dwelling units shall
be carefully located and designed in
accordance with the Grand Blanc Charter
Township Master Plan in order to avoid
conflicts with neighboring land uses. Dwelling
placement shall be planned to screen homes
from off-site vantage points, located away from
primary and secondary conservation areas or
sites suitable for open space, and upwind from

b. Dwellings located within open fields or
pastures should be sited on the least
important agricultural soils, or in locations
at the far edge of a field, as seen from
existing public road rights-of-way. Other
considerations may include proposed
visual buffering, such as native trees or
wild flowers, from public road rights-of-way.
xiii. Compatibility with Adjacent Uses. The setbacks,
density, height, traffic, parking, circulation,
landscaping, views and other design features
shall be compatible with the character of the
site and surrounding properties. The proposed
location of accessory uses or structures that
are of a significantly different scale or character
than the abutting residential districts, such as
access drives, parking areas, solid waste pickup
points, swimming pools, tennis courts and
facilities of a similar nature, shall not be
located near the boundary of the development
or so as to negatively impact the residential use
of adjacent lands and the general planning
area as indicated by the Grand Blanc Charter
Township Master Plan.
xiv. Pedestrian Circulation. The residential open
space development plan shall provide safe and
convenient pedestrian access to all open space
areas from the following: all residential areas
including lots not adjoining open space areas;
connections between open space areas; public

pathways on adjoining parcels; and
connections between appropriate on-site and
off-site uses. (Conserved farmland may be
exempted from this requirement to protect
crops from damage.) Accessibility shall meet
barrier-free standards.
Trails within the residential open space
development may be constructed of gravel,
wood chips or other similar material, provided
they meet applicable barrier-free standards,
however the Planning Commission may require
construction of eight (8) foot wide paved bicycle
paths through portions of the development or
along the any public right-of-way abutting the
open space community. The Planning
Commission may require the construction of
sidewalks for open space communities on both
sides on the road. Sidewalks shall only be
required on one (1) side of single loaded roads.

Township, Genesee County and the larger region. Together with the adjacent Technology Village Center
(TVC), the TVP district provides a unique area for a mix of employment, housing, and commerce that taps
into existing technology, medical, and manufacturing businesses, as well as local institutions of higher
learning.
The TVP district shall support its workforce through access to open space and amenities that encourage
walking, biking, and transit, as it becomes available. The district will feature a multi-use pathway system
that connects uses within the TVP district, the adjacent TVC district, and other destinations in Grand
Blanc Township, the City of Grand Blanc, and the region.
To create a sense of place that attracts young adults educated in knowledge economy and high tech
jobs, high-quality architectural design and natural materials that visually and physically connect to the
natural environment are intended. Landscaping elements should be integrated into site design to
provide walkable connectivity with the adjoining TVC district. High-quality site design and improvements
will integrate energy efficient and environmentally sound (green) principles and practices. Development
within this district shall include the following additional components:
a. Research Park Uses. The district will provide an open, campus-like setting for medical,
manufacturing, business, and scientific research and development. It will be an incubator for hightech
and medical businesses, and educational institutions. Production will be limited to research,
development or evaluation of the merits of products, plans, or designs. The district is intended to
accommodate research facilities, pilot plants, prototype production and other manufacturing
operations that require the continual or recurrent application of research knowledge and activity as
an integral part of the manufacturing process. The district will also accommodate a broad range of
compatible business uses that can appropriately share infrastructure, parking, and other amenities
with technology and research campus developments.
b. Housing. This district will contain high-quality, unique housing in the form of townhomes or other
attached or clustered single-family residential units. Live-work units are also encouraged. A variety of
housing sizes to accommodate residents of all ages and abilities are desired, from one-bedroom
units in the central portion of the district to larger 2-3 bedroom units at the edges.
c. Transportation. This district will include a transportation network that supports motorized and nonmotorized
travel in and around the Tech Village Park, between the TVP district and the TVC district,
and to the surrounding township; accommodations will be made for electric vehicles, autonomous
vehicles, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and integration with mass transit.
d. Parking. Compact development where parking is shared between uses is envisioned, minimizing the
amount of land devoted to pavement. Bicycle parking should also be accommodated in safe,
convenient, and accessible areas. Car and bicycle sharing are also encouraged. Electric vehicle
charging stations are encouraged.
e. Placemaking. The TVP district will be unique due to its integration with the natural environment.
Building design and materials will be harmonious with the woodlands, wetlands, and topography
found in this area. Pathways, boardwalks, and overlooks will provide opportunities for the workforce
and visitors to appreciate nature. The public realm will be framed not only by buildings, streets, and
sidewalks, but also by the surrounding environment. The resulting spaces will be safe, comfortable
and attractive to pedestrians. Civic spaces such as concert lawns, pavilions, or parks may also be
incorporated into the district.
f. Sustainability. As in the adjacent TVC district, development in the TVP district will rely on mitigating
stormwater runoff through bioretention systems such as rain gardens and bioswales, and alleviating
concentration of runoff through the use of permeable pavement. Landscaping with native plants,

green roofs, living walls, and the incorporation of alternative energy systems, such as solar
collectors or geothermal heat pumps into building and site designs, will reinforce the unique
natural character of this district. Pursuit of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
certification for individual buildings, and potentially of LEED-ND (LEED-Neighborhood Development)
certification for coordinated development, is strongly encouraged.
g. Technology. Given the name of the district, technology is expected to be both visible as well as
invisible and should be incorporated into all aspects of building and site design; educational,
experiential, and experimental activities relating to technology are encouraged. The Grand Blanc
Township Technology Village Master Plan/Framework Study (December 2016) shall be a guiding
document for development in this district.
ii. Development Agreement. A Planned Unit Development (PUD) is strongly encouraged for development
within this district, following the process outlined in Section 3.1.19. If that process is not utilized, a
development agreement shall be provided and is subject to approval by the Township Board as part of
the site plan.
iii. Regulating Plan. There will be two types of roads in the TVP district: A primary street that functions as
the main street and secondary roads that support internal circulation, based on the Grand Blanc
Township Technology Village Illustrative Plan dated November 2016.

A. INTENT
TVC Tech Village Center District 3.21
i. Intent. The Technology Village Center (TVC) District is established in accordance with the 2012 Grand
Blanc Township Master Plan and is intended to be a vibrant pedestrian-oriented district in a traditional
downtown form that creates a unique identity for Grand Blanc Township. The TVC district will support
development in the adjacent Tech Village Park (TVP) District by providing housing, shopping, dining, and
entertainment opportunities for those who live and work in the TVP district as well as those living and
working elsewhere in the region. The TVC district shall accommodate a mixture of complementary land
uses, including public/civic uses that connect with each other, with adjacent development in the TVP
district, and surrounding uses in the township. Development in this area will reflect the townships
natural setting through sustainable development techniques. Components of the district include:
a. Commercial, restaurant, and entertainment uses. This district will include high-quality working,
dining, shopping, and entertainment opportunities in a traditional town center development pattern,
focused along an internal primary roadway. Commercial uses in this area could include general and
specialty retail and personal services that serve district and nearby residents as well as destination
uses that draw visitors from the region. Restaurants and entertainment uses with outdoor patios
and open spaces will contribute to a vibrant, dynamic atmosphere.
b. Housing. This district will contain high-quality, unique housing, with an emphasis on types currently
undersupplied in the township and surrounding region. Residential uses may be located above
commercial uses, while some ground floor residential uses such as row houses are also appropriate
away from the principal street. Live-work units are also encouraged. A variety of housing sizes to
accommodate residents of all ages and abilities are desired, from one-bedroom units to larger 2-3
bedroom units.
c. Transportation. This district will include a transportation network that supports motorized and nonmotorized
travel in and around the village, between the village and the adjacent Tech Village Park
district, and to the surrounding township; accommodations for electric vehicles, autonomous
vehicles, bicycle facilities, and integration with mass transit will be provided.
d. Parking. On-street parking will be provided within the TVC district. Compact development where offstreet
parking is shared between uses is envisioned, minimizing the amount of land devoted to
surface parking. Generally, off-street parking will be provided behind buildings that front on the
primary roadway. Bicycle parking should also be accommodated in safe, convenient, and accessible
areas. Electric vehicle charging stations are encouraged.
e. Placemaking. The public realm will be framed by buildings, streets, and sidewalks that are safe,
comfortable and attractive to pedestrians, as well as civic spaces such as pocket parks and plazas
that support a variety of social interactions, from impromptu gatherings to community events. It is
envisioned that a village green or square will be created within a typical block facing the primary
street.
f. Sustainability. As in the adjacent TVP district, development in the TVC will rely on mitigating
stormwater runoff through bioretention systems such as rain gardens and bioswales, and alleviating
concentration of runoff through the use of permeable pavement. Landscaping with native plants,
green roofs, living walls, and the incorporation of alternative energy systems, such as solar collectors
or geothermal heat pumps into building and site designs, will reinforce the unique natural character
of this district. Pursuit of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for
individual buildings, and potentially of LEED-ND (LEED-Neighborhood Development) certification for
coordinated development, is strongly encouraged.
g. Technology. Opportunities for technology are encouraged and should be incorporated into all
aspects of building and site design.

h. Master Plan. The Grand Blanc Township Technology Village Master Plan/Framework Study
(December 2016) shall be a guiding document for development in this district.
ii. Development Agreement. A Planned Unit Development (PUD) is strongly encouraged for development
within this district, following the process outlined in Section 3.1.19. If that process is not utilized, a
development agreement shall be provided and shall be subject to approval by the Township Board as
part of the site plan.
iii. Regulating Plan. There will be two types of roads in the TVC District: A primary street that functions as
the main street and other roads that support the grid network, based on the Grand Blanc Township
Technology Village Illustrative Plan dated November 2016.

G. NON-MOTORIZED CIRCULATION
i. Intent. A variety of transportation modes will be available in the TVC district, but this district is intended
to be a model for non-motorized transportation in the Township. Walking and bicycling within the
district is expected and encouraged, as are non-motorized connections to other districts.
ii. Sidewalks and pathways within the right-of-way. Pathways within the right-of-way shall meet the
standards outlined in Section 3.1.22.L.
iii. Pathways not adjacent to roadways. Pathways not adjacent to roadways shall conform to the following
standards:
a. The minimum width of the pathway shall be ten feet.
b. The pathway shall be part of an easement granting public access to the pathway and extending
five feet on each side of the pathway.
b. No greater than ten percent of any façade shall be comprised of concrete masonry units. This limit
shall not apply to half-high integrally colored units that resemble brick, and similar units, as
determined by the Planning Commission.
c. No greater than five percent of any façade shall be comprised of EIFS or similar exterior insulation
paneling. In no case shall EIFS be used on the ground floor façade of any building.
d. All buildings fronting on the primary street or a secondary street within 300 feet of the primary
street shall have a public entrance oriented toward the street. These buildings may also have
public entrances oriented toward other streets or rear yard parking lots.
e. Where buildings front directly on the sidewalk, recessed entrances from three to ten feet deep are
encouraged and shall count toward the minimum percentage of building form along the build-toline
in Section 3.1.22.D.ii.
f. Ground-floor facades of buildings fronting on the primary street or a secondary street within 300
feet of the primary street shall have a minimum of 60% glazing between two and eight feet above
grade. Upper floors are required to maintain 30% glazing on their street-facing facades. Window
glazing shall be clear with a visible light transmittance of not less than 65% (0.65) on ground
floors, and 45% (0.45) on upper floors, per glass manufacturer specifications.
g. Buildings shall be vertically and horizontally articulated so as to avoid large, flat expanses of wall
and reflect the division of space within. The top of a building shall be distinguished by a cornice or
noticeable roof edge. Flat roofs shall be enclosed with parapets.
i. Equipment: Rooftop mechanical and other equipment shall be positioned and screened to
minimize views from adjacent properties and obscure views from the public rights-of-way.
ii. Accessibility: Roofs may be accessible and may be used as balconies or terraces. Vegetated
(green) roofs are encouraged to cool buildings and limit stormwater runoff.
h. Adjacent or proximal buildings (such as those next to, or across the street from, a given building)
shall not be architecturally identical.
i. Accessory structures shall be architecturally compatible with the principal structure.
j. Green roofs, green walls, and other features that manage stormwater are encouraged.
k. Projections from Buildings. Projections from building façades such as awnings, canopies, and
balconies may extend up to four feet into the right-of-way. All such projections shall have a
minimum clearance of eight feet from grade.
l. Corner Buildings. Buildings located at a street corner shall have appropriate architectural features
and details that accentuate its prominent corner location. The Planning Commission may permit
special architectural corner features to exceed the maximum building height by up to ten (10) feet.
m. The development of buildings that meet the requirements for LEED and, where applicable, Green
Garage certification by the United States Green Building Council is strongly encouraged. Any
applicant seeking to develop a large portion of the district in a single project is strongly
encouraged to design around LEED-ND principles.

3.2 DISTRICT INTENTS
1. RE Rural Estates Residential District. The RE
Single Family Residential District is intended to
promote the development of low density large
lot residential development in order to promote
the preservation of existing natural features to
maintain the Townships Rural Character. The
intent of this District is to:
A. Provide an environment of predominantly
low-density, one-family detached dwellings
along with other residentially related
facilities which serve the residents of the
district;
B. Provide for low density single family
development in selected areas of the
Township to promote the preservation of
existing natural features and maintain the
Townships rural character.
C. Encourage the use of flexible residential
development options to promote the
preservation of environmental features and
open space.
2. R-1 through R-4 Residential Districts. The R-1
through R-4 Single Family Residential Districts
are designed to be the most restrictive of the
Residential Districts. The intent of these
Districts is to:
A. Provide an environment of predominantly
low-density, one-family detached dwellings
along with other residentially related
facilities which serve the residents of the
district;
B. Encourage the preservation, rehabilitation
and construction of single family dwellings;
C. Discourage the continuance of existing
nonconforming uses, buildings and
structures which detract from the long term
viability of residential properties;
D. Discourage land uses which may generate
excessive traffic, noise, odors or other
disruptive impacts in a residential area;
E. Accommodate small scale facilities for
child and adult care where such uses
would be compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood, but to avoid an excessive
concentration of such facilities which could
be disruptive;
F. Prohibit any land use which would
substantially interfere with the
development, utilization or continuation of
single family dwellings in the District; and,
G. Accommodate smaller existing lots and
homes in the more mature platted sections
of the township as conforming situations.
Additional R-4 areas should be avoided
unless there is a finding that such lot sizes
are compatible with adjacent lots and such
density of development can be
accommodated by public utilities, streets,
and services.
3. Multiple Family Residential Districts.
A. Description. The Multiple Family
Residential Districts in Grand Blanc Charter
Township include:
i. Low Density Multiple Family
Residential (LDM). Generally duplexes,
low-rise clustered or attached single
family units on a minimum site size of
two (2) acres at a maximum density of
4 units per acre.
ii. Medium Density Multiple Family
Residential (MDM). Generally attached
mid-rise dwelling units with a minimum
site size of five (5) acres at a maximum
density of 10 units per acre.
iii. High Density Residential (HDM). Larger
scale attached dwelling units such as
apartment buildings with a minimum
site size of ten (10) acres and up to 20
units per acre.
Note: Calculations of density per acre shall
exclude any public rights-of-way, overhead
utility line easements, areas within the 100
year floodplain and open bodies of water;
up to fifty percent (50%) of the acreage
determined to be within state regulated
wetlands may be calculated towards
maximum density. Actual density shall also
be determined based on ability to meet all
setback and spacing requirements listed in
the Schedule of Regulations, and road
design standards.
B. Intent. The Multiple Family Residential
Districts are designed to provide sites for
moderate to high density multiple dwelling
structures at appropriate locations in terms
of land suitability, infrastructure capacity
and potential impacts on adjacent land
uses, as noted in the Township Master
Plan. The Low Density Multiple Family is
intended for attached single family units
generally consistent with nearby single
family homes. The Medium Density
Multiple Family Residential District
includes a variety of dwellings considered
appropriate as a transitional use between
single family residential districts and more
intense office, commercial or industrial

uses. The ordinance standards for those
two districts are intended to help ensure
uses complement the scale and
appearance of nearby single family homes.
The High Density Multiple Family
Residential District is intended for large
scale buildings, such as apartments and
high rise complexes. High density uses may
be appropriate adjacent to high traffic
generators, commonly found abutting
arterial roadways or expressways.
The standards herein are intended to
promote a variety of housing types. In
particular, special standards are provided
for elderly housing, in recognition of the
need for such facilities and their relatively
low impacts on traffic and infrastructure in
comparison with other types of multiple
family uses at a similar density. The
standards are further intended to ensure
ample open space to complement such
uses and the overall character of the
township.
4. Mobile Home / Manufactured Housing Park
District. The intent of the Manufactured
Housing Park District is to provide an
affordable housing alternative where
appropriate and consistent with the general
character of the Township. The standards of
this district are intended to be consistent with
the standards for other types of housing at
similar densities. In addition to the standards of
this Ordinance, all manufactured housing park
developments shall comply with Act No. 96 of
Public Acts of the State of Michigan of 1987 as
amended. However, some standards of this
Ordinance are more stringent than the typical
standards promoted by the Michigan Mobile
Home Commission. These more stringent
standards reflect the nature of Grand Blanc
Charter Township in contrast with some other
areas of Michigan where the universal rules of
the Mobile Home Commission may be
appropriate. These standards encourage
development which complements and protects
the investment on adjacent properties, and
promotes preservation of important natural
features.
5. Office Service District. The Office Service
District (OS) is designed to develop high quality
commercial areas devoted primarily to office
uses with a limited number of related uses. The
Office Service Districts are intended to serve as
transitional areas between residential areas
and commercial districts and to provide low
intensity uses along lots with frontage along
high traffic volume arterial roadways abutting
residential neighborhoods.
The uses permitted within this district are
intended to operate primarily during daylight
hours, creating less intrusive impact than other
types of offices and commercial uses which
tend to disrupt residential areas. The list of
uses permitted and other standards of this
section are established to protect the
investment of nearby homeowners and other
offices in the district by limiting outdoor
activities and incompatible land uses. Uses
which have potential to be intrusive in some OS
locations are treated as special land uses to
allow the Planning Commission to evaluate if a
specific location is appropriate.
6. Professional Office District. The Professional
Office (PO) Districts are intended to
accommodate large office buildings, restricted
retail, research and educational facilities which
serve large numbers of people. A major
purpose of this district is to provide attractive
settings to create office campus environments
which are attractive and typically visible from
freeways or arterial roadways. Areas zoned
Professional Office District are intended to be
predominantly office in nature, but allow
related commercial and service uses to serve
office employees and visitors.
7. Health Care District. The Health Care District
(HCD) is established to accommodate and
direct the development of hospitals to serve as
the nucleus of a health care campus. The uses
permitted within this district are intended to
provide a convenient and efficient health care
delivery system for the region. In addition to
hospitals, the Health Care District permits
development of closely related services such as
medical offices, housing for the elderly and
special needs groups; and health care
professionals; and limited retail and various
types of health care related services. The
Health Care District designations allow
development on these related uses in a
coordinated fashion within a single zoning
district.
One goal of this district is to minimize traffic
and other impacts by coordinating
development of these related uses though
campus master planning. This district requires
an impact study to assist the Township in
evaluating the appropriateness of the zoning
and conceptual design. Commercial outdoor
display or sales or storage and open air
business activities shall be specifically
prohibited. A maximum of twenty-five percent

(25%) of the site (defined as the contiguous
area zoned health care district under one
ownership) may be developed with the uses
listed below, prior to initiation of construction
of a hospital. The hospital and all the uses
shall be under control of one organization. All
construction shall be in accordance with the
approved Campus Master Plan.
8. Neighborhood Commercial District. The
Neighborhood Commercial District (NC) is
established to accommodate retail business
and services to meet the day-to-day
convenience shopping and service needs
primarily for nearby residential neighborhoods.
These districts are located to concentrate such
uses as recommended in the Township Master
Plan. The purpose of these carefully located
districts is to prevent excessive commercial
strip developments which may deteriorate
traffic operations and safety, create
unattractive roadway corridors and eventually
lead to blight.
The Township's ordinances, particularly
regarding setbacks, parking, signs, lighting,
dumpster enclosure and landscaping, are
intended to help ensure that Neighborhood
Commercial Uses remain compatible with the
predominant residential character of the
surrounding neighborhoods and the township
overall. Some uses which typically serve the
surrounding neighborhood may be more
intrusive to adjacent districts. These uses are
treated as Special Land Uses to allow the
Planning Commission to determine appropriate
locations within these districts.
9. General Commercial District. The General
Commercial District is established to
accommodate those retail businesses and
services which are intended to serve the
requirements of the Grand Blanc Community
and bypass traffic through the area. The large
size and variety of permitted commercial uses
typically generates significant volumes of
vehicular and pedestrian traffic. General
Commercial uses require a relatively large area
devoted to off-street parking and loading, and
generally tend to create problems of
congestion, noise and impairment of aesthetic
values. Thus, these districts are generally
located along expressway interchanges and
Regional Arterial roadways. One purpose of
these districts is to direct all intensive
commercial uses to these concentrated areas
rather than allowing inefficient scattering of
such development.
The Township's ordinances, particularly
regarding setbacks, parking, signs, lighting,
landscaping and driveway spacing
standards, are intended to help ensure long
term viability of the major commercial areas
in the Township. Uses which may generate
significant impacts on adjacent uses or
infrastructure are treated as Special Land
Uses to allow the Planning Commission to
determine appropriate locations within these
districts.
10. Research and Development. The Research and
Development Districts (RD), as herein
established, are intended to provide for a
community of research and related facilities
while specifically excluding incongruous uses.
The uses permitted within this district are
distinct from other industrial districts since the
uses are generally lower intensity with minimal
impacts outside of the principal buildings. The
RD Districts are also intended to permit uses
which manufacture, process, package,
assemble or treat finished or semifinished
products from materials prepared outside RD
Districts. Accessory uses which complement
and support the principal uses and are
intended for use by employees and visitors of
the principal uses are allowed when meeting
the standards of this district.
The standards of this District, particularly
setbacks and landscaping standards, are
designed to promote compatibility between the
research operations and the character of
surrounding uses. The intentional prohibition of
outdoor storage and prohibition of raw
materials processing for finished products or
for shipment in bulk form to be used in an
industrial operation at another location is
intended to help meet this goal.
11. Light Industrial District. The I-1 Industrial
Districts are designed so as to primarily
accommodate industrial parks wholesale
activities, warehouses, and industrial
operations whose external physical effects are
restricted to the area of the district and in no
manner detrimentally affect any of the
surrounding districts. The I-1 District is so
structured as to permit, along with any
specified uses, the manufacturing,
compounding, processing, packaging, assembly
and/or treatment of finished or semifinished
products from previously prepared material. It
is further intended that the processing of raw
material for shipment in bulk form, to be used
in an industrial operation at another location,
not be permitted. The general goals of this use

district include, among others, the following
specific purposes:
A. To provide sufficient space, in appropriate
locations, to meet the needs of the
Municipality's expected future economy for
all types of manufacturing and related
uses;
B. To protect abutting Residential Districts by
separating them from manufacturing
activities, and by prohibiting the use of
such industrial areas for new residential
development;
C. To promote manufacturing development
which is free from danger of fire,
explosions, toxic and noxious matter,
radiation, and other hazards, and from
offensive noise, vibration, smoke, odor and
other objectionable influences; and,
D. To protect the most desirable use of land in
accordance with a well considered plan. To
protect the character and established
pattern of adjacent development, and in
each area to conserve the value of land
and buildings and other structures, and to
protect the Municipality's tax revenue.
12. General Industrial District. The General
Industrial Districts (I-2) are designed primarily
for manufacturing, assembling, and fabrication
activities including large scale or specialized
industrial operations, whose external physical
effects will be felt to some degree by
surrounding districts. The I-2 District is so
structured as to permit the manufacturing,
processing, and compounding of semifinished
or finished products from raw materials as well
as from previously prepared materials.
13. Vehicular Parking District. The P-1 Vehicular
Parking District is intended for areas solely
used for off-street parking of private passenger
vehicles as a use incidental to a principal use.
This district will generally be provided by
petition or request to serve a use district which
has developed without adequate off-street
parking facilities. The P-1, Vehicular Parking
district is intended to accommodate the
operational needs of the Township's business
community while minimizing negative impacts
on surrounding uses.
3.3 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
The boundaries of these districts are hereby
established as shown on the Charter Township of
Grand Blanc Zoning Districts Map, which
accompanies this Ordinance, and with all notations,
references, and other information shown thereon.
The map shall be as much a part of this Ordinance
as if fully described herein.
3.4 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES INTERPRETED
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the
boundaries of the various districts as shown on the
Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
1. Boundaries indicated as approximately
following Township limits shall be construed as
following Township limits.
2. Boundaries indicated as approximately
following the center lines of streets, highways
or alleys shall be construed to follow such
center lines.
3. Boundaries indicated as approximately
following railroad lines shall be construed to be
the midway between the main tracks.

bodies of water shall be construed to follow
such center lines.
7. Where physical or natural features existing on
the ground are at variance with those shown on
the official Zoning Map, or in other
circumstances not covered by Sub-Sections 1
through 6 above, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall interpret the district boundaries.
3.5 ZONING OF VACATED AREAS
Whenever any street, alley or other public way
within the Township of Grand Blanc shall be
vacated, such street, alley, or other public way or
portion thereof, shall automatically be classified in

3.6 NOTES TO DISTRICT STANDARDS
1. Applicability. The notes contained in Section
3.6.2 are additions, exceptions, and
clarifications to the district standards contained
in Section 3.1. The applicability of individual
notes to each district is provided in the table on
page 66.
2. Notes to District Standards (See Chart).
A. Corner lots and double frontage lots are
considered to have two front yards, both of
which must meet minimum lot width
requirements. Front setback requirements
shall be maintained along all street
frontages.
B. Certain types of housing for the elderly
generate much lower traffic volumes and
other impacts than commonly associated
with traditional multiple-family
developments. Thus, allowable density for
housing for the elderly shall be determined
by the maximum units per acre permitted
within the particular district, calculated
using the following:
i Senior apartments: 1 unit = 1 unit of
multiple-family
ii Congregate or interim care housing: 1
unit = 2 units of multiple-family
iii Dependent housing facilities: 1 unit =
3 units of multiple-family
C. Lot depth shall be no greater than four (4)
times the width.
D. The following kinds of structural
appurtenances may be permitted to exceed
the height limitations for authorized use,
upon approval of the Planning Commission:
i. Schools, churches and other similar
institutional buildings may be erected
to a height not exceeding sixty (60)
feet provided the front, side and rear
yards shall not be less than the height
of the building wall abutting on such
yard.
ii. Chimneys, church spires, cupolas,
domes, towers, flag poles, penthouses,
water tanks, radio or television
antennae, monuments may be erected
to a height not exceeding sixty (60)
feet unless approved by the Zoning
Board of Appeals. Cellular phone
antennae may be erected to a height
not exceeding 120 feet unless
approved by the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
iii. Silos and other farm features shall be
limited to fifteen (15) feet above the
stated height limit in the zoning
district.
iv. Any mechanical equipment located on
the roof of any building shall not
exceed a height of ten (10) feet above
the surrounding roof surface, and shall
occupy no more than fifteen percent
(15%) of the total roof area.
v. Structural extensions appropriate to
the building design, such as cornices,
shall be limited to five feet above the
stated height limit.
E. Where maximum height is described in
both height and stories, the maximum
height shall be whichever is less.
F. Walkout basements are not counted in
story calculations.
G. Where the building is connected to building
on an adjoining lot by an approved fire
wall, the required side yard on the common
side may be reduced to zero (0) feet.
H. Setbacks for television and cellular phone
antennae shall be equal to half the height
of the structure. In addition, the Township
shall be provided sufficient evidence to
assure that adjacent uses and structures
are not threatened due to a collapse of the
structure for any reason.
I. On a corner lot abutting a residential
district the minimum side yard setback
shall be twenty (20) feet. Where the lot
abuts a residential district or residential
(i.e. local) street, the minimum setback
shall be ten (10) feet. No side yard
setback is required on a side continuous
with another building and meeting all
building and fire codes, but in all cases
where there is a door, window or other
opening, the minimum setback shall be at
least ten (10) feet.
J. Detention ponds shall be prohibited in the
front yard, unless the Township Engineer
determined there is no reasonable
alternative due to existing topography and
natural drainage problems.
K. Exceptions to Front and Side Yard
Setbacks. Where fifty (50) percent or more
of the aggregate street frontage between
two (2) successive intersecting streets is
occupied by buildings of the type and use
permitted in the district before the effective
date of this Ordinance or any amendments

thereto, with a front yard setback less than
required by this Ordinance, the minimum
front yard for new buildings shall be the
average setback distance of existing
buildings located within two hundred (200)
feet on either side of a given lot. However,
the depth of the front yard resulting there
from shall not be less than one-half (1/2)
of the dimensions required in the Zoning
District.
L. Except for necessary drives, walks and
approved signs, the required front yard
shall not be used for loading, storage or
accessory structures.
M. For buildings with multiple dwelling units, a
20 foot landscaped setback from all roads,
drives and parking areas shall be provided.
N. For all uses permitted other than singlefamily
residential, the front and rear yard
setback shall be fifty (50) feet or the height
of the building whichever is greater,
provided no building shall be setback less
than the established setback of existing
homes.
O. Projections into Yards. Certain architectural
features such as cornices, eaves, gutters,
chimneys, fire escapes, outside stairways,
balconies of open construction and similar
features may project into a required side
yard not more than two (2) inches for each
one (1) foot of width of such side yard and
may project up to a maximum of three (3)
feet into the required front and side yards
and five (5) feet into the required rear yard.
Canopies or awnings installed on the
facade of a building shall not be considered
as extending into the setback area
provided the canopy or awning extends no
more than three (3) feet from the buildings
and is retractable or can be readily
disassembled without visible damage to
the building facade or canopy. A open
unenclosed and uncovered porch or paved
terrace but not including fixed canopies
may project into a front yard for up to ten
(10) feet.
P. If the lot is in a single-family zoning district
and abuts an arterial road, the minimum
building setback along the arterial shall be
seventy-five (75) feet from the right-of-way
or one hundred twenty-five (125) feet from
the center line, whichever is greater.
Q. A minimum wetland setback buffer zone is
required around certain wetland and
bodies of water as described in Section
5.13.2, unless a greater distance is
required by the MDEQ under Part 303,
Wetland Protection of the Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection
Act ( Act 451, Public Acts of 1994 as
amended).
R. Mechanical equipment such as blowers,
ventilating fans and air conditioning units,
shall be placed no closer than three (3)
feet to any lot line in commercial districts
(OS, PO, HCD, NC, GC) and no closer than
twelve (12) feet to any lot line in residential
districts (R-1 to R-4, RE, LDM, MDM, HDM,
MHP). Mechanical equipment in industrial
districts shall comply with all yard setbacks
(I-1, I-2, RD).
S. The required side parking lot setback may
be reduced by the Planning Commission
where adjacent parking lots abut the
subject site or shared access or parking is,
provided there are no fences erected
between the parking lots and the
landscaping otherwise required is
relocated to other locations on site.
T. Unless otherwise stated within the
requirements of the individual Zoning
District, all parking lots shall have a twenty
(20) foot setback when abutting a
residential district, and ten (10) feet when
abutting a non-residential district. All
parking lots shall be screened according to
the standards specified in Section 5.10.4.
U. Any required open space shall be provided
throughout the site, not just at the rear end
of the site.
V. Tri-levels shall be computed using the total
square footage of the two uppermost
levels. Bi-levels shall be computed using
the total square footage of that floor at or
above the approximate grade of the
address street. The total square footage
so computed for the tri-levels and bi-levels
shall be equal to at least the minimum
square foot requirements for one floor
residence in their respective districts.
W. In 1 1/2 story and 2 story dwellings, the
required square footage of the upper level
in each zoning district shall be reduced one
square foot for each square foot that the
lower level exceeds the minimum allowable
area, provided that in no case shall the
square footage of the upper level be less
than 200 square feet. Also, in no case
shall 1 1/2 story or 2 story dwelling units
have less total square footage than the
combined square footage as it relates to 1

1/2 story or 2 story dwellings in the
schedule above.
X. Maximum length of a multiple family
building shall be 180 feet, except for
housing for the elderly. For senior
apartments, congregate or interim care
housing, and dependent housing facilities,
the maximum length of a building wing
shall be 180 feet.
Y. In the calculation of areas required to
maintain specific densities, open space
requirements and similar needs, no lot or
parcel or portion of same shall be used
more than once in such calculation, nor
shall adjacent outlets or other open space
be used in lieu of space contained within
the stated boundaries of the subject lot or
parcel. In calculating density for residential
developments, fifty percent (50%) of state
or federally regulated wetlands area shall
be included in computing gross density (eg.
100 acres of wetland equals 50 acres for
computing maximum density); provided the
maximum density is still determined by
compliance with all required setbacks,
parking, open space and other site
requirements. Lakes, ponds, overhead
utility easements, public street right-ofways
and private road easements are
excluded from area calculations for
buildable lot area.
Z. Zero Lot Line. The zero lot line option may
be used for single family detached units,
including subdivisions, (that is zero side
yard setback for one side of the unit)
subject to the following conditions:
i. The property shall include a minimum
of two (2) acres;
ii. A site plan shall be submitted, subject
to review and approval of the Planning
Commission;
iii. The entire property shall be currently
served by public water and sanitary
sewer, or the applicant will provide
water and sewer;
iv. The density shall not exceed the
maximum permitted within the zoning
district;
v. Setbacks for lots or sites along the
property line of the project (i.e. outer
edge) shall be at least equal to the
setback required in the zoning district;
vi. The minimum space between units
shall be the required total of two side
yards for the zoning district; and,
vii. A minimum five percent (5%) of the
overall property shall be preserved as
common open space (as defined in
Article 2), with maintenance provided
through an association master deed or
similar document approved by the
Township Attorney. The applicant may
reduce the required lot area and
dimensions by up to ten percent (10%)
if at least ten percent (10%) of the
total site area is devoted to common
open space. At least fifty percent
(50%) of the open space shall be
recreational space of a useable size,
as determined by the Planning
Commission, not including state or
federally regulated wetlands, 100 year
floodplains or detention basins. The
Planning Commission may specify a
percentage of the open space be
devoted to active recreational use,
depending upon the expected
population.
AA. Averaged Lot Sizes or Open Space
Subdivision. The purpose of this Section is
to permit the subdivider or developer to
vary lot sizes and lot widths to allow
development on sites with unique
conditions. This option shall be permitted
only if it is acceptable to the Planning
Commission. Averaged lot sizes of an open
space subdivision shall permit the
subdivider or developer to vary lot sizes
and lot widths to at least average minimum
lot size per unit required for Single Family
Residential Districts (R-1, R-2 and R-3 only)
as described in Section 3.1, subject to the
following conditions:
i. In meeting the average minimum lot
size, the subdivision shall be so
designed as not to create lots of
widths less than one hundred (100)
feet in the R-1 District, ninety (90) feet
in the R-2 District and seventy (70)
feet in the R-3 District. The required lot
area can be reduced by up to ten
percent (10%) below the required area
in the district;
ii. The maximum overall density shall be
the same as if the project were
developed with full size lots. A
calculation of actual permitted density
depends on site configuration and
street/lot layout; the following can be
used as a guide.
a. R-1: 1.7 dwelling units per acre
(total site including roads)

Charter Township of Grand Blanc
©clearzoning
b. R-2: 2.2 dwelling units per acre
(total site including roads)
c. R-3: 2.7 dwelling units per acre
(total site including roads)
iii. For averaging lot sizes or use of the
open space subdivision option,
calculations shall be provided for all
lots to indicate the average lot meets
the required area and width standards
of the zoning district;
iv. The technique of averaging minimum
lot size or use of the open space
subdivision option shall be acceptable
only in those instances where the
entire preliminary plat, which has
received the approval of the township,
is carried through a final plat and is
then recorded in its totality. Recording
of portions of a preliminary plat shall
not be acceptable under this option;
and,
v. All computations showing actual lot
areas and the average area shall be
indicated on the print of the
preliminary plat.
vi. Average Lot Sizes. In addition to the
items listed above, in meeting the
average minimum lot size, for each lot
size and/or lot width that is less than
that required in the district, the lot size
and/or lot width must be increased on
other lots, resulting in an averaged lot
size that complies with the zoning
district regulations.
vii. Open Space Subdivision. In addition to
the items listed above, the acreage not
developed through use of this
alternative shall be maintained as
open space through a conservation
easement or other agreement
approved by the Township Attorney
and recorded with the Genesee County
Register of Deeds. Provisions for
maintenance of the common areas
shall be provided. Under this
provision, for each square foot of
reduction in lot area below the
minimum requirements in the district,
at least equal amounts of land shall be
dedicated to the common use of the
lot owners of the subdivision in a
manner approved by the Township.
The total amount of open space used
for calculations shall be at least four
(4) acres in size, but no open space
shall be less than two (2) acres in size,
and no more than fifty percent (50%)
of the open space can be regulated
wetlands or steep slope areas
unsuitable for recreation. In addition,

4.11 ADULT REGULATED USES?
1. Intent: In the development and execution of
these zoning regulations, it is recognized there
are some uses that, because of their very
nature, are recognized as having serious
objectionable operational characteristics,
particularly when several of them are
concentrated under certain circumstances,
thereby causing a deleterious effect upon the
adjacent areas. The proximity of adult uses to
certain uses considered particularly susceptible
to the negative impacts or the concentration of
adult uses tends to erode the quality of life,
adversely affect property values, disrupt
business investment, encourage residents and
businesses to move or avoid the community,
increase crime and contribute a blighting affect
on the surrounding area. This Sub-Section
describes the uses regulated and the specific
standards needed to insure that the adverse
effects of these uses will not contribute to the
deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood,
to prevent undesirable concentration of these
uses and to require sufficient spacing from
uses considered most susceptible to negative
impacts.
2. Uses Regulated: The following uses are
regulated by this Sub-Section.
A. Adult Book or Supply Store
B. Adult Model Studio
C. Adult Motion Picture Arcade
D. Adult Motion Picture Theater or Adult Live
Stage Performing Theater
E. Adult Outdoor Motion Picture Theater
F. Adult Physical Cultural Establishment

building. All postcombustion ash must be disposed
at an approved waste disposal site. Disposal of
postcombustion ash on-site is expressly prohibited.
1. Stack heights: Stack heights shall be elevated
to a height necessary to insure that emissions
from the stack do not result in excessive
concentrations of any air pollutant in the
immediate vicinity of the source as a result of
atmospheric downwash, eddies and wakes
which may be created by the source itself or
nearby structures. If the necessary height
exceeds the maximum height allowed for the
zoning district, the Planning Commission may
allow a taller stack after a public hearing, as
part of Special Use Permit. The setbacks for
such stack from all abutting streets or adjacent
parcels, shall be a distance equal to the height

4.65 SIMILAR USES
In recognition that every potential use cannot be
addressed in this zoning ordinance, each
nonresidential district list of special land uses
includes the phrase "uses of the same nature or
class as uses listed in this district as either a
Principal Use Permitted or a Special Land Use, but
not listed elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance, as
determined by the Planning Commission based on
the standards of Section 4.66". The Planning
Commission shall make a determination of "Uses of
the same nature and class..." at a public hearing
according to the following standards:
1. A finding that the proposed use is not listed as
a principal use permitted or special land use in
any zoning district.
2. If the use is not addressed in this Ordinance,
the Planning Commission shall select the use
listed in this Ordinance which most closely
resembles the proposed use, using criteria
such as potential impact on property values,
traffic generated, aesthetics, noise, vibration,
dust, smoke, odor, glare and other
objectionable impacts on public health, safety
and welfare. The Planning Commission may
determine that there is no similar use and that
the use should be prohibited according to the
standards of "Prohibited Uses." (See Article 1).
3. Once a similar use is determined, the proposed
use shall comply with any special conditions or
special land use standards that apply to the
similar use.
4. The Planning Commission or applicant shall
have the option to request an amendment to
the zoning ordinance to specifically address the
use in question, rather than treating the
proposed use as a similar use.
5. The determination as to whether a proposed
use is similar in nature and class to other
principal uses permitted or special land uses
within a district should be considered as an
expansion of the use regulations, not a
variance applying to a particular situation. Any
use determined by the Planning Commission to
be a "use of the same nature or class as uses
listed" shall thereafter be included in the
enumeration of the uses.
4.66 SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING STANDARDS
Single family dwellings, whether mobile homes,
manufactured homes, modular homes or site
("stick") built homes, located outside a mobile home
park shall conform to the standards of this Section
in addition to the Township Building Code. The
standards herein are intended to prevent "grossly
dissimilar" dwellings which would adversely affect
the value of dwellings in the surrounding area,
adversely affect the desirability of an area to
existing or prospective homeowners, impair the
stability of the environment, prevent the most
appropriate use of real estate and lessen the
opportunity to realize the development pattern
envisioned in the Grand Blanc Community Master

relief which, in this context, shall mean
a demonstration that enforcement of
the five (5) year prohibition would
unreasonably discriminate among
providers of functionally equivalent
wireless communication services, or
that such enforcement would have the
effect of prohibiting the provision of
personal wireless communication
service.
v. Offer of Colocation Required. An
application for a new wireless
communication support structure shall
include a letter from the applicant to
all potential users offering an
opportunity for colocation. The list of

newly commenced.
6. Review Process for Wireless Facilities Requiring
Special Land Use Approval
A. After an application for a special approval is
filed with the Township, the Township shall
determine whether the application is
administratively complete, pursuant to the
requirements under Section 4.75.5 above.
The application shall be considered to be
administratively complete when the
Township makes that determination or 14
business days after the Township receives
the application, whichever is first.
B. If the Township finds the application is not
administratively complete, it shall notify the
applicant of the specific items needed to
make the application administratively
complete. The 14 business day time period
provided above will be stopped until the
applicant provides all the required
information, including payment of review
fees, which shall not exceed the Townships
actual cost of review or $1,000, whichever
is less.
C. The Township shall approve or deny the
application not more than 60 days (90 days
for a new wireless support structure) after
the application is considered to be
administratively complete. If the Township
fails to take action after the specified
review period, the application shall be
considered approved, and the approving
body shall be considered to have made any
determination required for approval.
D. Standards for approval. Such wireless
communications equipment shall meet all
the requirements of applicable codes,
state, and federal laws.
4.76 WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM,
PRIVATE
In all zoning districts, private wind energy
conversion systems for the purpose of providing
electricity to a residence, farm, business, institution,
and/or industrial facility on the same site may be
permitted as an accessory use to a principal
permitted use, and only when meeting the
standards of this Section. Upon review of the
application for a Building Permit, the Building
Department shall grant approval if it is found that
the plans comply in all respects with this Section
and the Township Building Code. If the proposed
height of the wind energy device exceeds 100 feet,
it shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission as
a Special Land Use.
All private wind energy conversion systems shall be
subject to the following conditions:
1. Private wind energy conversion systems shall
be permissible as an accessory use to the
principal building and/or permitted use in all
zoning districts.
2. Each individual system shall have a rated
capacity of less than 100 kW and be designed
to serve the needs of an individual residential
unit, farm, business, or industrial use.
3. The following area, height, number, and
approval standards shall apply:
A. Single-family zoning districts - For parcels of
five (5) acres or less there shall be no more
than one (1) individual ground-mounted
wind energy system. For parcels greater
than five (5) acres, there may be up to one
(1) additional ground-mounted system
permitted on any individual property
provided it clearly serves as an accessory
use and all other requirements contained
within this Section have been met. In lieu
of a ground-mounted device, one buildingmounted
wind energy device shall be
permitted per residential unit provided that
the unit does not exceed twenty (20) feet in
height from the highest portion of the roof.
For parcels greater than one (1) acre, there
may be up to one (1) additional buildingmounted
system permitted on an accessory
structure so long as all other requirements
contained within this Section have been
met. Building mounted units exceeding
twenty (20) feet in height may be permitted
by the Planning Commission as a special
land use.
B. All other zoning districts  One groundmounted
wind energy system may be
permitted for each principal structure.

residential use or outdoor use where people
would likely congregate (park, outdoor seating
area, etc.) within the standard setback area
(110% of height) and 2) a report or letter from a
registered engineer or manufacturer of certified
wind energy equipment is provided that states
that the device is designed to collapse so that
the structure would not likely fall beyond the
proposed setback distance from the nearest
property line. All ground-mounted systems are
permitted only in a rear or side yard.
6. Individual systems may be freestanding and
mounted on a monopole or lattice structure or
building-mounted (with or without monopole).
The use of guy wires or similar forms of
secondary support, shall be prohibited.
Support systems, such as monopoles and
lattice structures, shall be constructed of a
material, painted, or otherwise treated so as to
be non-reflective and in a non-obtrusive color
(typically matte white or light gray).
7. System height (from the ground to the tip of the
system its highest point) shall not exceed 100
feet. The Planning Commission may permit
systems in excess of 100 feet as a special land
use. When such system is building-mounted,
the height limit shall be no more than twenty
(20) feet above the highest point of the roof.
The Planning Commission may permit systems
to exceed this height as a special land use.
Roof-top systems shall be exempt from rooftop
mechanical screening requirements.
8. All exposed moving components of a system
must maintain a minimum ground clearance of
twenty (20) feet.
9. The setback of any system from any existing or
planned overhead public utility lines shall be at
least equal to 110% of the height of the entire
system at its highest point. It shall be the
applicants responsibility to note the location of
utility poles and/or overhead lines on a
dimensioned drawing as required in this
Section.
10. Systems shall not generate more than 5 dB
above the ambient noise level as measured at
all property lines.
11. Systems shall not be illuminated. No exterior
light be mounted to or atop any portion of the
structure unless required per Section 4.76.N of
this Section.
12. Wind energy conversion systems must be
approved/certified by the American Wind
Energy Association (AWEA), the Small Wind
Certification Council, and/or the U.S.
Additional ground-mounted systems may
be permitted for accessory structures as a
special land use. In lieu of a groundmounted
device, building mounted wind
energy devices may be permitted provided
that a unit(s) does not exceed twenty (20)
feet in height from the highest portion of
the roof. If more than one building
mounted unit is proposed on a single
building, all units shall be of a similar
design and appearance so that they
appear to be functioning as a coordinated
system. Building mounted units exceeding
twenty (20) feet in height may be permitted
by the Planning Commission as a special
land use.
4. Special Land Use Standards - Whenever 1) a
ground-mounted system is proposed to exceed
one hundred feet in height, 2) a building
mounted system is proposed to exceed twenty
feet in height, and/or 3) ground-mounted
systems are requested for accessory structures
in other than single-family districts, the use and
structures shall be subject to Special Land Use
standards in accordance with the following:
A. A wind analysis from an established wind
energy company or qualified professional,
as determined by the Planning
Commission, shall be submitted
demonstrating that the additional height is
necessary to achieve reasonable wind
energy production in comparison with a
system meeting standard height
requirements (for special land use
requests that exceed the base height
permitted in this ordinance).
B. The location and design of the system shall
be reviewed in relation to a) compatibility
with surrounding land uses and
neighborhood character and b) consistency
in appearance with other wind energy
systems existing or proposed on the
subject property. Issues such as
aesthetics, screening, noise, impact on the
unique community character of the area,
and other health, safety, and welfare
issues shall be considered.
5. The setback of a ground-mounted system
including ancillary components from all
property lines shall be at least equal to 110%
of the height of the entire system at its highest
point, or the minimum building setback for the
respective zoning district, whichever is greater.
In non-residential districts, this setback
requirement may be reduced to fifty (50) feet
provided that 1) there is no residential district,

5.0 Site Standards
5.1 ACCESS MANAGEMENT (DRIVEWAY)
STANDARDS
1. Intent: Access management is the systematic
design and control of land access along arterial
and collector roads, aimed at reducing
driveway-related conflicts, crashes, and
congestion while maintaining safe and
reasonable access to adjoining properties. In
its review and approval of land development
plans, Grand Blanc Charter Township has a key
role to play in implementing effective access
management. The Township, unlike the
operative road agency (or agencies), is in a
position to directly coordinate the internal
layout of a site with the location and design of
its access drives. The effective exercise of this
capability enhances public health, safety, and
welfare. The intent of this Section is to
establish access management standards to be
followed in developing or rehabilitating sites
within the Township.
2. Applicability: The standards within this Section
apply:
A. Along all highways, roads, and streets
within the Township classified as Collectors
and above on the current Township
Thoroughfare Plan.
B. Unless a requirement of the Genesee
County Road Commission, Michigan
Department of Transportation (MDOT), or
an approved Grand Blanc Township
corridor plan is more stringent.
C. To all driveways except those serving one
or two dwelling units or an essential public
service use, building, or structure.
3. General Principles.
A. Access management along public roads
should provide reasonable access to all
land parcels having frontage on those
roads, while also enhancing the safety and
efficiency of the through traffic flow.
Reasonable access is not necessarily the
same as direct access.
B. Direct access drives should generally be
minimized in number and maximized in
separation. The number of driveways
permitted for a site shall be the minimum
number necessary to provide safe and
efficient access for regular traffic and
emergency vehicles, based on traffic
engineering and fire department reviews,
as well as a traffic impact study (if
submitted according to Section 6.6).
C. Driveway location must provide adequate
sight distance and reasonable approach
grades, and should generally not result in a
return (or radius) encroaching on the
frontage of a neighboring parcel. Such
encroachment will be permitted only with
the written consent of the neighboring
property owner, or when found by the
Township, Road Commission, or MDOT to
be necessary to preserve traffic safety.
D. The minimum desirable same-side spacing
between a driveway and an intersection
may be greater than the minimum spacing
between driveways (but should never be
less), depending on traffic conditions (e.g.,
backups from a signal) as well as
designated lane use(s). Driveways should
generally not be permitted on the approach
to an intersection, opposite or only a short
distance upstream of a dedicated left-turn
lane for the intersection.
E. On roads lacking a raised (non-traversable)
median, left-turn conflicts should be
avoided by either aligning or sufficiently
offsetting driveways on opposite sides of
the road. The minimum opposite-side
driveway spacing is generally more critical
when the direction of offset will result in
interlocking entering left turns, and this
direction of offset may have to be larger for
higher-volume driveways.
F. Site plans should incorporate, where
feasible and appropriate, cross-access with
neighboring sites via connected parking
aisles or frontage roads, shared side
service drives and/or site access drives,
and rear service drives connecting to side
roads. Any such cross-access should be
supported by general-purpose
(unrestricted) easements, as well as
agreements regarding maintenance
responsibilities.
G. Driveway location, insufficient driveway
spacing, and/or site-specific traffic
conditions may warrant the posting of a
driveway as one-way or the prohibition of
certain vehicle turns entering or exiting a
site. Warranted turn restrictions should
generally rely on unique (e.g., channelized)
driveway design and not standard
regulatory signs alone.

4. Minimum Driveway Spacing.
A. Same Side of Road: For sites with
insufficient frontage to meet the following
minimum driveway spacing standards, a
waiver will be considered by the Planning
Commission only after the Applicant has
demonstrated that both alternative access
(per Section 5.1.3.F) and access restriction
(per Section 5.1.3.G) have been seriously
considered and incorporated in the site
plan where feasible.
1 If unposted, assume 25 mph in
commercial or residential area and 55
mph in rural area, unless safe operation
indicates lower speed.
B. Opposite Side of Road: In order to avoid
traffic conflicts created by left-turn
interlock, driveways proposed on the
opposite side of the road from an existing
or approved driveway must meet the
minimum center-to-center driveway
spacing standards illustrated below.
Driveways expected to serve a relatively
high volume of entering left turns, or an
unusually high number of entering large
vehicles, may require a greater oppositeside
spacing, as determined by the
Planning Commission.
C. Relative to Intersections: Per Section
5.1.3.D, the minimum distance between a
proposed driveway and the nearest
intersection shall not be less than the
minimum driveway-to-driveway spacing
specified in Section 5.1.4.A. Also, a
proposed driveway on the approach to an
intersection shall not be opposite a
dedicated left-turn lane for the
intersection, or within 100 ft upstream of
that lane. Possible waivers by the Planning
Commission must be supported by a traffic
impact study.
5. Design of Site Access Drives.
A. Coordination of Divided and Undivided
Driveways: To minimize turning conflicts,
boulevard-style access drives (or local
streets) shall generally not be approved
opposite undivided access drives, or vice
versa. If cause has been shown for a
Planning Commission waiver of this
requirement, interlocking entering left
turns must be minimized by aligning the
entering side of the divided drive with the
undivided drive.
B. Accommodation of Opposing Boulevard
Drives: A proposed boulevard-style access
drive (or local street) shall not be permitted
opposite an existing or previously approved
boulevard without special design treatment
or signalization to minimize left-turn
conflicts, approved by the applicable road
agency and well as the Planning
Commission. Special design treatment
may consist of opposing left-turn pockets in
the boulevard medians, adversely offset no
more than 4 ft, or tapered boulevard
islands supplemented by pavement
striping designed to directly align oppositedirection
left-turn vehicles. At intersections
planned for immediate signalization,

special design treatment will not be required if a traffic impact study shows that the intersection will
operate satisfactorily for the indefinite future with split phasing of the minor approaches (where each
minor approach moves on its own protected green phase).
C. Access Improvements: The potential need on an abutting (main) road for a passing or center leftturn
lane, or a right-turn deceleration lane and/or taper, shall be evaluated by applying MDOT
warrants to the driveway and main road traffic volumes forecasted to exist at build-out of the subject
development. Where special treatment of entering left turns is warranted, the choice between a
passing lane and a center left-turn lane shall consider the proximity of other nearby turning locations,
the roads anticipated ultimate cross-section, and prevailing traffic volumes and speeds. If a
warranted acceleration or deceleration taper would end within 100 ft of an existing or proposed
taper, the two driveway returns shall be connected with a continuous auxiliary lane for right turns
only. At a minimum, submitted traffic impact studies shall evaluate turn lane and taper warrants,
and then recommend specific lane types, lane lengths, and taper lengths (accounting for traffic
volumes and speeds as well as left-turn storage requirements). The Township and/or Road
Commission or MDOT will determine appropriate access improvements, giving due consideration to
traffic impact study recommendations.
D. Angle of Intersection: Driveway centerlines shall generally intersect the cross road at 90 degrees. If
the applicant shows cause for using a smaller intersecting angle, or the Township, Road Commission,
or MDOT so-request, angles as small as 75 degrees may be permitted on undivided driveways. On
driveways channelized to restrict certain turning movements, turning roadways serving exiting traffic
may intersect the cross road at angles as small as 45 degrees if controlled by at least one stop sign.
E. Number of Exiting Lanes: Driveways serving traffic exiting a site may have more than one exiting
lane if the applicant shows cause or the Township, Road Commission, or MDOT so-request. Two
exiting lanes should be considered when the volumes of exiting and cross traffic are such that exiting
right turns would otherwise be significantly and unnecessarily delayed by longer-delayed exiting left
turns. The left of two exiting lanes may be designated for through as well as left-turn movements if
the former is possible and exiting left turns are expected to be significantly fewer than exiting right
turns.
F. Traffic Control Devices: Pavement markings and traffic control signs used at and along site access
drives shall comply with the latest edition of the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
G. Design of Two-Way Undivided Driveways: Driveway design should be such that larger entering
vehicles do not force smaller vehicles to back up or otherwise maneuver out of the way. The
following dimensions shall be used unless the applicant shows cause for not doing so, or the
Township, Road Commission, or MDOT requests otherwise. Narrower throat widths generally require
larger radii.

H. Design of Conventional One-Way Driveways: The following dimensions shall be used unless the
applicant shows cause for not doing so, or the Township, Road Commission, or MDOT requests
otherwise. Narrower throat widths generally require larger return radii.
1 Use 25 ft if two exiting lanes, regardless of design vehicle.
I. Design of Channelized One-Way Driveways: These standards apply to driveways using one or two
turning roadways, separated by a triangular island, to deter entering and/or exiting left turns. The
following dimensions shall be used unless the applicant shows cause for not doing so, or the
Township, Road Commission, or MDOT requests otherwise. A comprehensive signing plan is required
along with the proposed driveway design, including standard STOP, TURN RIGHT ONLY, No Left Turn,
and DO NOT ENTER signs, as applicable.
1 Where space precludes a 75-ft radius, a smaller radius (not less than 50 ft) may be permitted by
Planning Commission.
J. Design of Boulevard-Style Driveways: The following dimensions for a standard boulevard-style

6. Design of Between-Site Service Drives.
A. Location and Alignment: A between-site
service drive shall generally parallel a sites
front, rear, or side property line. A service
drive may straddle a side or rear property
line to facilitate the most effective shared
use of the drive, the sharing of
construction and maintenance costs
between involved property owners, and the
minimization of impervious surfaces in a
developing area. In determining the most
appropriate alignment for a service drive,
the Planning Commission shall consider
the setbacks of existing and/or proposed
buildings, the safety and efficiency of
traffic access and circulation, and the
existence of any previously approved plans
(such as the Hill Road Corridor Plan).
B. Drive Width and Construction: All service
drives shall be paved to Township
standards. Unless waived by the Planning
Commission, straight-faced (vertical) curbs
shall be used, and drive widths shall be 21
ft if posted for one-way operation or 25 ft if
two-way traffic is allowed (both widths
back-of-curb to back-of-curb). In the event
mountable curbing is permitted, drive width
shall be increased by 1 ft for each such
curb, to maintain the same effective driving
width (20 ft or 24 ft, respectively).
C. Access Easement: All service drives shall
lie within (or generally coincide with)
easements ensuring cross-access rights for
the general public (consistent with State
law prohibiting travel across private
property to avoid traffic control devices).
Easements shall follow the intended
driving path where the direction of travel
through the site changes, including inside
curves sized to an appropriate design
vehicle, and should generally be wide
enough to contain all driveway elements
requiring maintenance (e.g., curbing and
any abutting sidewalks). In no case shall
such an easement be less than 20 ft wide
for one-way operation or 24 ft wide if twoway
traffic is allowed. All cross-access
easements shall be supported by a written
agreement between the involved property
owners that clearly assigns responsibilities
for construction and long-term
maintenance.
D. Parking: Between-site service drives are
intended to primarily serve site access and
circulation needs, not parking needs. Such
drives shall not serve as maneuvering
areas for either parallel or angled parking
spaces without a waiver by the Planning
Commission. In the event an applicant
wishes to permanently designate parallel
parking spaces along a service drive, the
necessary waiver shall be accompanied by
a drive width 8 ft wider than the minimum
specified in Section 5.1.6.B. Where the
Planning Commission believes that
informal parallel parking may occur along
standard service drive widths in the
absence of a design waiver, it may require
the posting of No Parking signs.
Alternatively, temporary parking in such
cases may be permitted by the Planning
Commission where a continuous service
drive would not yet exist and such parking
would not interfere with safe traffic
circulation or fire equipment access. Such
temporary parking spaces can not be used
to meet any of the sites minimum parking
requirement (per Section 6.3).
E. Access Points: Connections between
service drives and abutting public roads
shall meet the driveway spacing standards
of Section 5.1.4. To minimize possible
turning conflicts along service drives,
internal connections between the service
drive and the site shall either be directly
aligned with, or offset at least 75 ft from,
each of the service drives public-road
access points. Service drives paralleling
public roads shall generally be separated
from those roads by at least 40 ft to permit
adequate turning radii on both the external
and internal sides of the intervening
landscape strip; where this is infeasible,
the landscape strip shall be bulbed to
facilitate the introduction of adequate radii.
F. Temporary Access: The Planning
Commission may approve temporary
access points where a continuous service
drive is not yet available and a
performance bond or escrow is created to
assure the elimination of temporary access
when the service drive is continued.
G. Elevation: The site plan shall indicate the
proposed elevation(s) of the service drive
at the property line(s), and the Building
Department shall maintain a record of all
such elevations so that grades can be
coordinated as the drive is extended siteby-
site.
H. Landscaping: The greenbelt between a
service drive and an abutting public road
right-of-way shall be landscaped as

specified in Section 5.10.3 of the
Townships Landscaping Standards. Such
landscaping shall not interfere with
driveway or intersection clear-vision
requirements.
7. Modification of Standards for Special
Situations.
During site plan review, the Planning Commission
shall have the authority to modify the standards of
this Section as indicated above, if one or more of
the following conditions are met:
1. Application of the standards would prevent
reasonable access to the site (bearing in mind
that reasonable access is not necessarily direct
access).
2. In preparing the site plan, the applicant has
made a good-faith effort to both avoid driveway
spacing deficiencies, and mitigate the traffic
operational and safety disadvantages of any
unavoidable remaining deficiencies.
3. A traffic impact study has been prepared (per
Section 6.6), and it shows cause for a design
waiver and recommends access-related road
improvements that the applicant is willing to
fund.
4. The proposed land use involves the redesign of
an existing development or a new use which
will generate less traffic than the existing use.
5. The Genesee County Road Commission or
Michigan Department of Transportation
expresses a preference for the site access plan
as proposed by the applicant.
5.2 ACCESSORY STRUCTURES
1. Maximum number: There shall be a maximum
of one (1) detached accessory building on all
lots with the following exceptions:
A. Two (2) detached accessory buildings may
be erected on any lot less than two (2)
acres in size. The total area of the two
accessory buildings must comply with the
maximum coverage and size requirement
in Section 5.2.4.
B. On lots over two (2) acres in size,
additional accessory buildings may be
permitted provided the total area of all
accessory buildings complies with the
maximum coverage and size requirement
specified in Section 5.2.4.
2. Restrictions on placement: Accessory buildings
shall not be erected in any right-of-way, access
easement, required front yard or required side
yard; except accessory buildings are permitted
in the front yard on lots of at least five (5) acres
when the front setback is equal to the setbacks
of established buildings on adjoining lots or are
setback at least two hundred (200) feet if the
lots are generally undeveloped, as determined
by the Planning and Zoning Department. In the
case of attached residential dwelling
complexes, detached parking garages or
carports may be permitted in the non-required
front yard provided the Planning Commission
approves the site plan, landscaping, elevation
drawings and construction materials. In
reviewing such structures, the Planning
Commission shall consider the impact of
headlights and views from nearby public streets
and adjacent properties.
3. Required setbacks
A. Attached structures: Where the accessory
building or structure is structurally
attached to a principal building, it shall be
subject to all setback and height standards
for the principal buildings in the district in
which they are located, and, when located
in a single family zoning district, the
appearance standards of Section 4.66.6.B,
except for the following:
i. Unenclosed decks located a maximum
of three feet above ground level may
be located at least three feet from side
lot lines and may encroach 15 ft into
the required rear yard.
ii. Projections into yards as noted in the
Schedule of Regulations,
iii. Side-loaded garages where the garage
door faces the side lot line shall have a
side-yard setback of twenty (20) feet.
B. Detached structures:
i. Detached accessory buildings in a
single-family residential district shall
be at least ten (10) feet from any
principal building or other accessory
building and at least three (3) feet
from any side or rear lot line.
ii. Detached accessory buildings in nonsingle
family residential districts shall
meet the setbacks for principal
buildings listed in Article 3, except that
the Planning Commission may allow
detached accessory buildings, upon
consideration of the size of the
proposed building and proposed and
adjacent uses, to be located within
twenty (20) feet of the rear lot line.

Section 5.13).
4. Maximum coverage and size in residential
districts: The combined square footage of all
accessory buildings and structures, excluding
swimming pools, shall occupy a maximum of
twenty-five percent (25%) of a required rear
yard (as defined by minimum setbacks). In
addition, the cumulative square footage of all
attached and detached accessory buildings on
a single family residential lot (R-1 through R-4
or RE) shall be as follows:
A. On lots up to two (2) acres in size, the
cumulative square footage shall not
exceed the square footage of the
residential floor area of the ground floor of
the principal building, as defined in Section
2.2; and,
B. On lots over two (2) acres in size, the
cumulative square footage of all attached
and detached accessory building(s) shall
not exceed two (2) times the square
footage of the residential floor area of the
principal building, as defined in Section
2.2. The Zoning Board of Appeals may
grant an exception to the maximum size
standard for accessory buildings related to
farming or the raising of livestock in
consideration of the size of the property,
conformance with other standards, and the
character of adjacent uses.
5. Maximum height: The maximum building height
of any detached accessory building or structure
in any Single Family (R-1 through R-4), RE,
Rural Estates, Multiple Family or Manufactured
Housing District shall be fourteen (14) feet,
measured from the average height between the
eaves and the ridge; except that the maximum
height of any detached accessory building or
structure utilized in a permitted farming
operation shall be twenty (20) feet. (See Article
2 for the calculation of building height.) The
maximum accessory building or structure
height in nonresidential districts shall be based
on the maximum height for principal buildings
listed in the Schedule of Regulations.
6. Drainage: The placement and design of any
accessory building or structure shall not have
an impact on storm water runoff. The Planning
and Zoning or Building Departments may

structure up to two hundred (200) square
feet in a residentially zoned area.
B. Any accessory building or structure up to
one hundred (100) square feet in a
commercial or industrial zoned area.
8. Floor Systems: All detached accessory
structures must have an improved floor system
unless the structure is located on a parcel over
ten (10) acres and is used for the raising of
animals.
9. Manufactured Home Sites: See standards in
3.7 for accessory buildings, structures and
uses.
5.3 ACCESSORY STRUCTURES: FENCES
Fences are permitted subject to the following
regulations.
1. Permits. The erection, construction or alteration

5.9 FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
1. Intent. The standards of this Section are
intended to significantly reduce hazards to
persons and damage to property as a result of
flood conditions in Grand Blanc Charter
Township, and to comply with the provisions
and requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program, as constituted in accord
with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968,
and subsequent enactments and the rules and
regulations promulgated in furtherance of this
program by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, as published in the
Federal Register.
In addition, the objectives of this Section
include:
A. Protection of human life, health and
property from the dangerous and damaging
effects of flood conditions;
B. Minimization of public expenditures for
flood control projects, rescue and relief
efforts in the aftermath of flooding, repair
of flood damaged public facilities and
utilities, and the redevelopment of flood
damaged homes, neighborhoods,
commercial and industrial areas;
C. Prevention of private and public economic
loss and social disruption as a result of
flood conditions;
D. Promotion of the goals and objectives of
the Master Plan;
E. Maintenance of stable development
patterns not subject to the blighting
influence of flood damage;
F. Help ensure public access to information
indicating the location of land areas
subject to periodic flooding; and,
G. Preserve the ability of floodplains to carry
and discharge a base flood.
2. Delineation of the Floodplain Area.
A. The floodplain development standards of
this Section shall overlay existing zoning
districts delineated on the official Zoning
Map of the Charter Township of Grand
Blanc. The boundaries of the flood hazard
area overlay zone shall coincide with the
boundaries of the areas (i.e. the
elevations) indicated within the limits of
the 100-year flood boundary, which are
termed "Special Flood Hazard Areas
(SFHA's)," in the report entitled "The Flood
Insurance Study Grand Blanc Township,
Genesee County, Michigan" with
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRM maps). The Study and
accompanying maps and amendments are
adopted by reference, appended and
declared to be a part of this Section.
B. If the SFHA designation is in dispute, or
determined to be incorrect, the procedures
for Flood Insurance Map amendment in
Section 5.9.8 shall apply.
C. In addition to other requirements of this
Section applicable to development in the
underlying zoning districts, compliance with
the requirements of this Section shall be
necessary for all development occurring
within the special flood hazard area overlay
zone. Conflicts between the requirements
of this Section and other requirements of
this Section or any other ordinance shall be
resolved in favor of this Section, except
where the conflicting requirement is more
stringent and would further the objectives
of this Section to a greater extent than the
requirements of this Section. In such
cases, the more stringent requirement
shall be applied.
3. Restriction on Uses and Principal Buildings
within the Floodplain. All site plans and
subdivision plats shall be reviewed to
determine their impact upon the 100-year
floodplain and floodway. Building construction
within the floodway shall be prohibited.
Development of lands which contain floodplain
areas must be designed to minimize building
construction within the SFHA.
A. The following uses shall be permitted
within the boundary of the 100-year floodplain:
i. Grading and agriculture, pastureland
and animal grazing.
ii. Harvesting of a native or wild crop
permitted by law such as wild rice,
marsh hay, berries and seeds.
iii. Harvesting of trees.
iv. Public and private parks, picnic Areas,
playgrounds, playfields, athletic fields,
golf courses, par three golf courses,
golf driving ranges, bridle paths, nature
paths, and trails.
v. Wildlife preserves.
vi. Fishing, trapping, and hunting in
compliance with current laws and
regulations.

vii. Hunting and conservation clubs,
noncommercial archery, rifle and
shooting ranges.
viii. Swimming beaches, fishing and
boating docks in accord with the
provisions of the Inland Lakes and
Streams Act of 1972, as amended.
ix. Required open space or lot area for
uses landward of the floodplain but
within the same lot.
A MDNR permit may be needed for these
activities if the area is also within a
regulated wetland.
B. The following additional uses shall be
permitted when the applicant
demonstrates there is no feasible
alternative, which would provide a
reasonable rate of return on investment in
the land. Such documentation may include
engineering and appraisal analysis.
i. Historic sites, structures, markers and
trails.
ii. Sand and gravel extraction.
iii. Principal residential buildings when
the lowest floor is constructed at least
three (3) feet above the 100-year
floodplain elevation. Expansions, additions,
or improvements to existing
residential buildings shall also be
elevated a minimum of three (3) feet
above the floodplain elevation.
iv. Principal nonresidential buildings when
the lowest floor is constructed at least
three (3) feet above the floodplain
elevation or otherwise floodproofed.
Expansion, addition, or improvements
to existing buildings shall also be elevated
a minimum of three (3) feet
above the floodplain elevation or
otherwise floodproofed.
4. Accessory Buildings, Structures and Uses.
Within the floodplain boundary, accessory

5.10 LANDSCAPE STANDARDS
1. Intent. The intent of this Section is to promote
the public health, safety and welfare by
establishing minimum standards for the design,
installation and maintenance of landscaping in
parking lots, as buffer zones between uses,
along roadways and adjacent to the building.
Landscaping is viewed as a critical element
contributing to the aesthetics, development
quality, stability of property values and the
overall character of the township. The
standards of this Section shall apply to all
projects subject to site plan review.
The standards of this Section are intended to
help achieve a number of aesthetic, functional
and environmental objectives, such as to:
A. Promote implementation of the Township
Master Plan and Corridor Studies;
B. Provide incentives to preserve quality
mature trees rather than planting new but
smaller trees;
C. Screen headlights to reduce glare and
accident potential;
D. Integrate various elements of a site;
E. Blend inharmonious land uses;
F. Screen or filter views between
incompatible land uses;
G. Help define and separate or unify, as
appropriate, various site elements;
H. Control soil erosion by slowing the effects
of erosive winds or water;
I. Moderate harsh or unpleasant sounds;
J. Remove air pollutants;
K. Control glare and reflection;
L. Slow the effects of erosion and stormwater
runoff to help prevent flooding;

M. Assist in directing safe and efficient traffic
flow at driveways and within parking lots;
N. Insure adequate sight distance;
O. Insure sufficient access to fire hydrants;
P. Distinguish and separate vehicular and
pedestrian circulation;
Q. Block, divert or channel winds;
R. Moderate the effects of climate and to
create a more desirable microclimate; and,
S. Provide reasonable standards to gradually
bring into compliance developed sites
which existed prior to the adoption of these
standards in relation to the extent of
improvements, expansion or change in
use.
The landscape standards of this Section are
considered the minimum necessary to achieve
the objectives noted above. In several
instances, the standards are intentionally
flexible to encourage flexibility and creative
design. Applicants are encouraged to provide
additional landscaping to improve the function,
appearance and value of their property.
2. Types of Landscaping Standards. This Section
provides minimum standards for four elements
of a site:
A. Greenbelts. Minimal greenbelts along and
within public street rights-of-way and within
required parking lot setbacks in all multiple
family, office, commercial and industrial
districts.
B. Buffer Zones. Required landscaping, walls
and screening between various zoning
districts.
C. Parking Lot Trees. The minimum number of
trees within parking lots of various sizes in
various zoning districts.
D. General Site Landscaping. Standards for
placement of landscaping within cul-desacs,
boulevard medians and to accent
buildings.
3. Required Greenbelts Along and Within Rights-of
-Way
A greenbelt shall be planted along the right-ofway
of any public street. If planting in the rightof-
way is not permitted by the road agency with
jurisdiction in the right-of-way, or is not
acceptable to a utility company, the greenbelt
plantings shall be within the required parking
lot setback. The Planning Commission may
allow such planting to be placed anywhere
within the front yard if there is no front yard
parking. The greenbelt shall meet the following
standards:
A. The greenbelt shall include only living
materials and planting beds, except for
approved sidewalks, bikepaths, signs,
driveways and essential services.
B. The greenbelt shall include one (1) canopy
tree per thirty (30) linear feet of the
frontage including any openings for
driveways, sidewalks or easements. The
number of trees required shall be rounded
upward at fifteen (15) foot increments (eg.
45 feet of frontage equals 3 required
trees).
C. The Planning Commission may approve
substitution of evergreen trees for up to
fifty percent (50%) of the required
greenbelt trees upon determining
evergreens would be consistent with the
existing character of the area.
D. Greenbelt trees should be arranged to
simulate a natural setting such as massing
or staggered rows, except where a more
formal arrangement is determined to be
more consistent with the character of an
area.
E. Landscaping materials and arrangement
shall ensure adequate sight visibility for
motorists, adequate clearance for
pedestrians and vehicles, and accessibility
to fire hydrants.
F. If there is parking in the front yard, the
Planning Commission may require a three
(3) to four (4) foot high undulating berm
within the greenbelt to help screen the
parking lot. The berm shall be designed to
the standards of Section 5.10.4.C.
Commercial signs shall not be placed on
top of the berm unless the berm is
continuous along the frontage greenbelt.

8. Incentives to Preserve Existing Trees. The
standards below are intended to encourage the
preservation of quality and mature trees by
providing credits toward the required trees for
greenbelts, buffer zones and within parking
lots.
A. Trees intended to be preserved shall be
indicated with a special symbol on the site
plan and be protected during construction
through use of a fence around the drip line.
B. As noted in Section 6.2, Site Plan Review,
all trees over eight (8) inches caliper shall
be identified on the site plan distinguishing
those to be preserved and those to be
removed.
C. To obtain credit the preserved trees shall
be of a high quality and at least two and
one half inches (2 ½") caliper. Trees to be
preserved shall be counted for credit only if
they are located on the developed portion
of the site as determined by the Planning
Commission.
D. The credit for preserved trees shall be:
*Caliper is the diameter measured at a
height of four and one-half (4.5) feet above
the natural grade. (Diameter at Breast
Height, D.B.H.)
E. To protect and encourage the continued
health of the preserved trees, the ground
area within the dripline of the trees shall be
maintained in vegetative landscape
material or pervious surface cover. The
township may allow sidewalks, bikepaths,
vehicular lanes and parking within the
dripline upon determining the setback from
the trunk is suitable to reasonably ensure
protection of the tree and the public.
Storage of soils or other materials during or
after construction within the dripline is
prohibited.
F. If trees are lost within 2 years after
construction the property owner shall
replace with trees required before credit
was allowed.
G. In no case shall the minimum number of
required trees be reduced by less than
50% through the use of existing tree
credits.
9. Exception from Standards for Special
Situations. The Planning Commission or Site
Plan Review Committee, during site plan
review, may determine existing landscaping or
screening intended to be preserved would
provide adequate landscaping and screening.
The Planning Commission may also determine
that dimensional conditions unique to the
parcel would prevent development of required
buffer zones, off-street parking area
landscaping, greenbelts or required buffer
zones. If such determination is made, the
Planning Commission may grant an exception
from the landscaping provisions of this Section
in consideration of, but not limited to, the
following:
A. Types and distance to adjacent land uses;
B. Future land use designation in the
Township Master Plan;
C. Existing natural vegetation is adequate
year-round to provide intended screening;
D. There is an abrupt grade change which
precludes the need for buffering;
E. There is an existing wetland or floodplain
which will be preserved and provides
effective screening;
F. The building placement lessens the need
for buffering;
G. Building heights and views lessen the need
for landscaping;
H. Required landscaping would infringe on
adequate sight distances for motorists;

I. The applicant proposes fewer plant
materials than required, but the overall
caliper proposed is greater than required
(i.e. fewer, but larger, trees)
J. Required landscaping would impose
greater drainage impacts on adjacent
lands than an alternative design proposed
by the applicant.
10. Minimum Standards for Installation, Irrigation
and Maintenance.
A. Time of planting. Parking lot trees, required
greenbelts, or plantings shall be planted
within six (6) months from the date of
completion of the building or improvement.
A Final Certificate of Occupancy shall be
withheld until planting has been installed
and approved. A Temporary Certificate of
Occupancy shall be issued in the interim.
B. Projects in phases. For projects developed
in phases, the landscape may be
constructed in phases. The Building
Department shall determine the extent and
timing of landscaping within each phase
based on the necessity to buffer the
proposed development from adjacent uses,
anticipated commencement on
subsequent phases, building heights and
physical characteristics of the site such as
topography or existing vegetation.
C. Material removal. Tree stakes, guy wires
and tree wrap are to be removed after one
year.
D. Irrigation. All landscaped areas shall be
provided with a readily available and
acceptable water supply, or with at least
one (1) outlet located within one hundred
(100) feet of all planted material to be
maintained.
E. Maintenance. Landscaped areas and plant
materials required by this Ordinance shall
be kept free from refuse and debris. Plant
materials, including lawn, shall be
maintained in a healthy growing condition,
neat and orderly in appearance. If any
plant material required by this Ordinance
dies or becomes diseased, they shall be
replaced within thirty (30) days of written
notice from the Township or within an
extended time period as specified in said
notice.
11. Standards for Compliance for Pre-Existing Sites.
In any case where the building and/or parking
area is being increased by at least twenty five
percent (25%) over the originally approved site
plan or the use is being changed to a more
intense use, as determined by the Planning
Commission, the site shall be brought into full
compliance with the landscape standards
herein. In instances where the increase in
building and/or parking area is less than twenty
-five percent (25%) over the original site plan,
the extent of new landscaping shall be equal to
four percent (4%) of compliance for every one
percent (1%) of increase in building or parking
footprint (for example, a building or parking
area increase of ten percent (10%) requires a
forty percent (40%) compliance with the
landscape standards.
5.11 NATURAL FEATURES PROTECTION:
GRADING, REMOVAL AND FILLING OF
LAND
Any grading which changes site elevation by more
than three (3) feet or the use of land for the

Zoning Department and Building Department.
If the approved site plan for the site showed
only one principal building on a single lot, the
approved site plan may be used as the grading
plan. In all other cases, a separate grading
plan shall be filed for each principal building,
lot or unit site for site condominium projects.
The grading plan shall contain the following:
A. Name, address, and telephone number of
applicant.
B. Name, address, and telephone number of
professional surveyor.
C. North arrow, date, and scale.
D. A scale of 1 inch = 30, 40, or 50 feet if the

5.13 NATURAL FEATURES PROTECTION:
WETLANDS AND BODIES OF WATER
1. The Charter Township of Grand Blanc intends
to promote compliance with Part 303, Wetland
Protection of the Natural Resources and
Environmental Protection Act ( Act 451, Public
Acts of 1994 as amended) through
coordination with the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) wetland
protection program. The following standards
exceed the MDEQ regulations by requiring a
buffer zone adjacent to MDEQ regulated
wetlands, lakes, and streams. This Section
also encourages the placement of buildings to
protect non MDEQ regulated wetlands and
other bodies of water between two acres and
five acres in size. There shall be maintained in
all districts a wetland and watercourse setback,
as provided herein, unless and to the extent, it
is determined to be in the public interest not to
maintain such a setback. The intent of this
provision is to regulate property within such
setback in order to:
A. Prevent physical harm, impairment or
destruction of or to such wetlands and
watercourses. It has been determined that,
in the absence of such a minimum
setback, intrusions in or on to such areas
would occur, resulting in harm, impairment
or destruction of the same contrary to the
public health, safety and general welfare.
B. Protect unique wildlife habitat and habitat
transition, including, without limitation,
feeding, nesting, resting and traveling
areas for aquatic and terrestrial numerous
animals.
C. Protection of surface water run-off and
water quality for the purpose of preventing
pollution, and assistance in beneficial
ground water recharge for drinking,
irrigation and other purposes.
D. Provide water storage area during storm
events.
E. Preserve aesthetic views and areas for the
human enjoyment of natural resources.
F. Preserve unique, rare, threatened and
endangered species habitat, including
upland species.
G. Reduce the need for on-site and off-site
storm water storage capacity based upon
the availability of a greater area of
absorption and a smaller impervious area.
H. Stabilize and protect soil resources,
including the prevention of erosion and
prohibition of the loss due to moving water
resulting in destruction of upland,
structures and infrastructure on the
upland, and prevention of the alteration of
the course of moving waters.
I. Promote the goals of the Grand Blanc
Township Master Plan.
J. This regulation is based on the police
power, for the protection of the public
health, safety and welfare, including the
authority granted in PA 207of 1921, as
amended.
2. For purposes of this regulation the terms
"wetland" or "watercourse" shall be defined as
set forth in Article 2, Section 2.2.279, of the
Grand Blanc Charter Township Zoning
Ordinance. The following regulations apply to
activity within wetlands:
A. Residential Use Buffer. All buildings,
structures, parking lots, and building
envelopes shall provide a minimum twentyfive
(25) foot wide setback buffer from a
wetland or other body of water regulated by
the MDEQ. The required setback shall be
ten-(10) feet for a residential deck or patio
or detached accessory buildings.
B. Non-residential Use Buffer. All buildings,
structures, parking lots, and building
envelopes on a lot or a condominium site
shall provide a minimum ten (10) foot wide
setback buffer from a wetland or other
body of water regulated by the MDEQ.
C. The required buffer zone shall be
measured from the boundary of a wetland,
or from the ordinary highwater mark of a
watercourse.
D. Landscaping, trails and passive
recreational areas may be allowed in the
setback (golf ball retrieval shall be by
hand).
E. Any site grading, preparation, or storage of
materials within the wetland protection
buffer area shall require approval of the
approving body in accordance with Sub-
Section 5.13.3.
F. Any disturbance of soils, removal of
landmark trees or stumps, grading,
alteration of water flowing into or from an
MDEQ regulated wetland, or any prohibited
activity as listed in Part 303, Wetland
Protection of the Natural Resources and
Environmental Protection Act ( Act 451,
Public Acts of 1994 as amended), without
a permit from the MDEQ, may result in a

stop work order issues by the Township
and /or require restoration of the wetland
in accordance with MDEQ standards.
G. Applicants are encouraged to make use of
sensitive site design techniques to
preserve non-MDEQ regulated wetlands
that exceed two (2) acres in size,
particularly those with standing water or
important wildlife habitats.
H. Where storm water is planned to drain into
a wetland, an erosion/sedimentation
control facility shall be used to control
sediment loading in the wetland.
Maintenance of these materials shall be
addressed in a deed or as a condition of
site plan approval.
I. Land divisions, plats or condominium
subdivisions shall not be approved in a
manner creating parcels or lots that cannot
be used in conformance with the
requirements of this Section or the MDEQ
regulations.
3. The established wetland or watercourse
setback may be reduced only to the extent
determined to be in the public interest by the
body undertaking review of the permit, plan or
plat application. In determining whether
proposed activities are in the public interest,
the benefit which would reasonably be
expected to accrue from the proposal shall be
balanced against the reasonably foreseeable
detriments of the construction or other activity,
taking into consideration the local, state, and
national concern for the protection and
preservation of the natural feature in question.
If, as a result of such a balancing, there
remains a debatable question whether the
proposal is clearly in the public interest,
authorization for the construction or other
activity within the setback shall not be granted.
The following general criteria shall be applied in
undertaking this balancing test:
A. The relative extent of the public and private
need for the proposed activity.
B. The availability of feasible and prudent
alternative locations and methods to
accomplish the expected benefits from the
activity.
C. The extent and permanence of the
beneficial or detrimental effects that the
proposed activity may have on the public
and private use to which the area is suited,
including the benefits the wetland or
watercourse setback provides.
D. The probable impact of the proposed
construction or other activity in relation to
the cumulative effect created by other
existing and anticipated activities in the
wetland or watercourse to be protected.
E. The probable impact on recognized
historic, cultural, scenic, ecological, or
recreational values, and on fish, wildlife
and the public health.
F. The size and quantity of the wetland or
watercourse setback being considered.
G. The amount and quantity of the remaining
wetland or watercourse setback.
H. Proximity of the proposed construction
and/or operation in relation to the wetland
or watercourse, taking into consideration
the degree of slope, soil type and the
nature of the wetland or watercourse to be
protected.
I. Economic value, both public and private, of
the proposed construction and/or
operation, and economic value, both public
and private, if the proposed construction
and/or operation were not permitted.
J. The necessity for the proposed
construction and/or operation.
4. Wetland Buffer Signs. At least one wetland
buffer sign shall be posted along the wetland
buffer of each lot or parcel that abuts a
wetland. If the lot or parcel exceeds 150 feet
in width, one additional sign shall be posted for
each additional 100 feet of lot width. Signs
shall be six (6) inches tall by eight (8) inches
wide and mounted on steel or treated 4 X 4
posts. Signs shall be placed four (4) feet above
the ground and shall face away from the
wetland. Posts must be set in concrete a
minimum of 2 feet into the ground. The signs
shall read Wetland Buffer Boundary in ¾ inch
high letters. The words Charter Township of
Grand Blanc shall be below in 1/3 high
letters. The sign background shall be cream or
tan and the lettering shall be black.
5. If and to the extent the Township is prohibited
by law from regulating the proposed activity in
or on the respective wetland or watercourse,
regulation under this Section shall be
exempted.

5.14 NATURAL FEATURES PROTECTION:
WOODLANDS
The standards of this Section are intended to
promote the preservation of important woodlands
and large mature trees which contribute to the
character, welfare and quality of life in Grand Blanc
Township. These standards are intended to prevent
the unnecessary removal of woodlands prior to,
during and following construction on a site. The
standards of this Section, in conjunction with the
standards for site plan review, are mechanisms to
promote goals of the Grand Blanc Community
Master Plan.
1. Any property owner or his representative
proposing to clear more than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the trees of eight (8) inch
caliper or greater on a site shall first notify the
Township of the intent of such clearing and/or
earth change and submit a proposed sketch
plan describing the sites features for review
and approval by the Planning Commission.
2. This Section shall not prevent tree clearing for
approved building envelopes, swimming pools,
decks, essential services, utility lines or
construction drives; nor shall this ordinance
prohibit site alterations for farming purposes.
The Planning Commission may grant an
exception from the caliper standard for select
clearing of lower quality species including box
elders, elms, poplars, willows and cottonwoods.
5.15 PARKING AND LOADING-UNLOADING
STANDARDS
1. Intent. The purpose of this Section is to ensure
sufficient automobile off-street parking space
with adequate access to all spaces at the time
of erection, enlargement or change in use, of
any principal building or structure. Off-street
parking and loading areas are to be designed,
maintained and operated in a manner that will
ensure their efficient use, promote public
safety, improve aesthetics and, where
appropriate, protect surrounding uses from
undesirable impacts. The number of off-street
parking spaces, in conjunction with all land or
building uses shall be provided, prior to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, as
hereinafter prescribed.
2. General Requirements.
A. Setbacks. Off-street parking spaces may be
located within a non-required side or rear
yard and within the rear yard setback
unless otherwise provided in this
Ordinance. Off-street parking shall not be
permitted within a front yard or a side yard
setback unless otherwise provided in this
Ordinance.
B. Perimeter Landscaping. Green belts along
the street frontage and buffer zones along
lot lines may also be required (see Sections
5.10.3 and 5.10.4. A minimum four (4)
foot high wall is required where the parking
lot abuts a residential district.
C. Internal landscaping. Parking lot trees shall
be provided in accordance with the
standards of Section 5.10.5. Islands within
the parking lot shall be designed to the
standards listed in that Section.
D. Location. Parking spaces shall be provided
either on the same lot or within lots under
the same ownership within three-hundred
(300) feet of the building it is intended to
serve, measured from the nearest public
building entrance to the nearest parking
space of the off-street parking lot.
Ownership shall be shown on all lots or
parcels intended or used as parking by the
applicant.
E. Parking for single family residential uses.
For single family detached units on
individual lots, off-street parking spaces
shall consist of a parking strip, driveway,
garage, or combination thereof, and shall
be located on the premises they are
intended to serve.
F. Parking for other uses. Parking areas other
than for single family detached homes or
duplexes on individual lots shall be
approved as part of a site plan. Minor
changes to the parking layout, as
determined by the Building Department,
shall require submittal of a parking plan
which indicates property lines, existing and
proposed ground elevations at two (2) foot
contour intervals, the number of spaces,
calculations for meeting the minimum
space requirements of this Section,
dimensions of aisles, driveways and typical
parking stalls, location of curbs and curb
blocks, location and size of signs, existing
and proposed landscaping, existing and
proposed lighting and drainage facilities.
G. Limits on excessive parking. In order to
minimize excessive areas of pavement
which depreciate aesthetic standards and
contribute to high rates of stormwater
runoff, exceeding the minimum parking
space requirements by greater than twenty-

percent (20%) shall not be allowed, except
as approved by the planning Commission.
In granting such additional space, the
planning Commission shall determine that
such parking will be required, based on
documented evidence, to accommodate
the use on a typical day.
H. Shared parking. Where two or more uses
are present on the premises, parking
requirements shall be calculated for each
use individually. However, two (2) or more
buildings or uses may collectively provide
the required off-street parking, in which
case the required number of parking
spaces for the uses calculated individually
may be reduced by up to twenty percent
(20%) if a signed agreement is provided by
the property owners, and the Planning
Commission determines that the peak
usage will occur at different periods of the
day.
I. Limits on changes. Any area once
designated as required off-street parking
shall not be changed to any other use
unless and until equal facilities meeting
the standards of this Section are provided
elsewhere, or the parking requirements of
the site change. Off-street parking existing
at the effective date of this Ordinance, in
connection with the operation of an
existing building or use shall not be
reduced to an amount less than
hereinafter required for a similar new
building or new use.
J. Limits on storage. The use of required
parking areas for material storage, refuse
storage stations/dumpsters, storage or
display of vehicles and/or merchandise, or
for vehicle or machinery repair or
maintenance is expressly prohibited. The
use of semi-trailers for storage purposes
on the premises for five (5) or more
consecutive days is prohibited.
K. Parking lot deferment. Where the property
owner can demonstrate or the Planning
Commission finds that the required
amount of parking is excessive, the
Planning Commission may approve a
smaller parking area, provided that area of
sufficient size to meet the parking space
requirements of this Section is retained as
open space, and the owner agrees to
construct the additional parking at the
direction of the Planning Commission
based on observed usage within six (6)
months of being informed of such request
in writing by the Building Department. A
written legal agreement, which has been
approved by the Township Attorney, to
construct the deferred parking shall be
provided by the applicant. The Building
Department may require posting of a

3. Parking Units of Measurement.
A. Where floor area is the unit for determining the required number of off-street parking and loading
spaces, said unit shall mean the gross floor area (GFA), unless otherwise noted.
Where the floor area measurement is specified as gross leasable floor area (GLA) or usable area,
parking requirements shall apply to all internal building areas excluding the floor area used for
storage, mechanical equipment rooms, heating/cooling systems and similar uses, and other areas
nor intended for use by the general public. Where these areas are yet undefined, leasable floor area
shall be considered to be eighty five percent (85%) of the gross floor area.
B. In calculating bench seating for places of assembly, each twenty-four (24) inches of benches, pews
or other such seating, shall be counted as one seat.
C. Where the number of spaces required is based on the number of employees, calculations shall be
based upon the maximum number of employees likely to be on the premises during the peak shift.
D. When units or measurements determining the number of required parking spaces result in the
requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half (½) shall be disregarded
and fractions over one-half (½) shall require one (1) parking space.
E. For uses not specifically listed below, the required parking shall be in accordance with that of a
similar use as determined by the Building Department or the Site Plan Committee based on
documentation regarding the specific parking needs of the use. A factor of 1.5 x the average rate
listed in the Institute of Transportation Engineers Parking Generation Manual may be used. The
Planning Commission may adjust the parking requirement based on the anticipated volume of
parking demand.
F. Each required drive-through waiting or stacking space shall be twenty(20) feet long and nine (9) feet
wide.
4. Parking Space Numerical Requirements. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall be
determined by the type of use in accordance with the following schedule.

5. Design Standards
A. All private road easements shall be a
minimum of sixty-six (66) feet in width,
except where an access easement of
record of less width existed prior to January
1, 1987. The easement shall be shown on
the land division records as a perpetual
easement for roadway purposes leading to
a public street.
B. Maximum gradient shall be six (6) percent,
or a six (6) foot rise in one hundred (100)
feet of horizontal distance. Minimum
gradient shall be 0.4%. Vertical curves
shall be used at all changes in grade.
Gradient shall not exceed three (3) percent
within 50 feet of any intersection of the
private road with any other road.
C. Minimum horizontal curve radius shall be
one hundred seventy-five (175) feet except
a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet
may be used where the road serves less
than five (5) homes or where natural
features would be preserved that would be
lost if a wider radii were required.
D. The intersection of public and private roads
shall be as near perpendicular (ninety (90)
degrees) as practical, but in no case will be
less than seventy five (75) degrees. A clear
vision zone shall be provided, as described
in Section 5.7, Clear Vision Zones.

G. An adequate sub-grade shall be prepared
by removing topsoil, muck or other surface
material to a suitable sub-surface
condition. The width of the stable subsurface
condition shall be a minimum
cross-section of the thirty (30) feet
including appropriate swaled ditching in
the event drainage to a public drainage
system is not available; otherwise a storm
sewer is required. When a storm sewer
system is included, the cross-section for
sub-surface preparation need not exceed
the width required for a sealed surface and
drainage appurtenances.
H. The cross-section width of the impervious
surface area, base materials, and curb or
open ditch design shall be in accordance
with the township standards and
specifications.
I. Maximum length of a private road that

access. The Planning Commission may
increase this requirement up to one
hundred (100) units upon a finding that
there is no reasonable access alternative
and the Fire Department approves the
design. Any further increase in the number
of units shall require a variance from the
Zoning Board of Appeals.
K. The improved surface of the private road
shall be setback a minimum of fifteen (15)
feet from any adjoining lot or parcel which
does not derive access from the easement
or private road.
L. Minimum tangent distance (straight-away)
between two curves shall be fifty (50) feet.
M. Private road design plans shall document
that minimum stopping and intersection
sight distances meet the design criteria
outlined in the most recent edition of the
American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Manual
"A Policy on Geometric Design for Highways
and Streets."
N. All signs within the private road or access
easement shall be identified on the site
plan and be in accordance with the
Michigan Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices, unless the Planning Commission
approves another type of design for
consistency with the character of the
development. Street signs shall be
provided at all intersections (see Section
5.17.5). These signs shall contrast in terms

driveways or be offset at least one-hundred
-fifty (150) feet measured centerline to
centerline. If a private road is to intersect
with an arterial roadway there shall be a
minimum offset of two-hundred-fifty (250)
feet.
R. All road design features and geometrics
shall meet the standards and construction
specifications of the Genesee County Road
Commission, unless otherwise specified
herein. A developer of a private road as
herein defined is advised to use the
Commission's standards in the event it is
intended to request the Road Commission
to assume responsibility for said road, or
there is reasonable likelihood that the
private road could become a public street
in the future.
6. Required Road Name. All names shall be
approved by the Township Supervisor with
consultation by the County Road Commission.
Road names shall not be permitted which
might cause confusion with names of existing
roads in or near Grand Blanc Township. Roads
that will be continuations of existing roads shall
be called by the same names of such existing
road. There shall be provided road signs at
every road intersection meeting the
specifications of the Genesee County Road
Commission and as approved by the Township
Board. All cost of such signs shall be borne by
the developer or property owner(s) of the lots to
be served by the private road.
7. Construction Permits. Construction permits
shall be obtained from the Genesee County
Road Commission before entrances are
constructed into County road right-of-way.
Private roads constructed under the provisions
of this Ordinance shall not require the
Township or the Genesee County Road
Commission to accept said area for
maintenance at any future date. The Township
reserves the right to require construction to
higher standards where warranted by special
topographic or geographic conditions.
8. Road Commission Required Prior to Building
Permit Issuance. No building permit shall be
issued by the Township fronting on any private
road until said roadway is improved to the
specifications contained in this Ordinance. The
Township shall inspect and approve the private
road improvements prior to issuing any building
permits along said road. The Township Board
shall establish a fee to cover the cost of such
inspections, said fee to be paid by the
developer.
9. Variances. An appeal may be taken to the
Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Grand Blanc Township
Zoning Ordinance.

10. Existing Nonconforming Private Roads and
Access Easements. It is recognized that there
exist private roads, service roads and access
easements which were lawful prior to the
adoption of this Section which are inconsistent
with the standards herein. Such roads are
declared by this Section to be legal
nonconforming roads or easements. The intent
of this Section is to permit legal nonconforming
roads and easements to continue and undergo
routine maintenance for safety purposes, as
determined by the Building Department. This
Section is also intended to allow new
construction to occur on existing lots which
front along such a road on the adoption date of
this Section, if the roads are reasonably
capable of providing sufficient access for the
uses permitted in the zoning district and for
provision of emergency service vehicles.
However, this Section is also intended to
discourage the extension of nonconforming
roads or increase the number of lots or building
sites served by such a road, except in platted
subdivisions, divisions of land or site
condominium projects existing on the adoption
date of this Section, unless provisions are
made to upgrade such road to comply with the
standards herein. Any reconstruction, widening
or extension of a non-conforming private road
or access easement shall be in conformity with
this Section.
For purposes of determining whether a lot
along a private road or access easement
qualifies as an "existing lot" as used in this
Section, at least one of the following conditions
must have existed at the time this Section was
adopted.
A. The lot consists of a "condominium unit" for
which a master deed had been recorded
with the Genesee County Register of Deeds
in accordance with the requirements of the
Michigan Condominium Act and other
applicable laws and ordinances.
B. The lot consists of a parcel that was
described by metes and bounds as
recorded by a deed or as a land contract,
and registered with the Genesee County
Register of Deeds.
C. The lot had been assigned a unique parcel
number by the Genesee County Register of
Deeds and was individually assessed and
taxed on that basis.
5.18 ROOF-TOP APPURTENANCES
The following restrictions shall apply to all buildings
and structures other than for single-family
residences:
1. All roof top climate control equipment, elevator
towers, transformer units and satellite dish
antenna and similar items shall be screened
from view so as not to be visible from any
street, road or adjacent property. Material used
to screen rooftop appurtenances shall be
compatible with the overall design of the
building to which it is attached. The planning
commission may provide a waiver of this
requirement as to satellite dishes where the
requirement prevents the reception of satellite
delivered signals or imposes costs on the user
of such dish antenna that are excessive in light
of the purchase and installation cost of the
equipment. All wall mounted utility meters and
utility outlets shall be enclosed and integrated
into the design and color of the building,
subject to safety and access requirements of
respective utility companies.
2. Roof top appurtenances, including mechanical
and electrical equipment, shall not exceed the
maximum permitted building height limits,
unless the following conditions are met. For
every one (1) foot that a roof top appurtenance
exceeds the maximum district building height, it
shall be setback five (5) feet from any and all
building faces. No roof top appurtenance shall
exceed five (5) feet above the maximum district
building height. In all instances, roof top
appurtenances shall be screened and shall not
be visible from any street, road or adjacent
property per Section 5.18.1.
5.19 SIGN ORDINANCE
1. Intent. These regulations establish rules and
standards for the construction, location,
maintenance and removal of privately-owned
signs. Directional, emergency, or traffic-related
signs owned by township, county, state or
federal government agencies are not regulated
by this chapter. The execution of these
regulations recognizes that the purpose of this
chapter is to protect the dual interest of the
public health, safety and welfare and to ensure
the maintenance of an attractive physical
environment while satisfying the needs of sign
users for adequate identification,
communication, and advertising. In order that
such purposes can be achieved, the following
objectives shall be applied for this chapter and
any future additions, deletions and
amendments:

A. General. Ensure that signs are located,
designed, constructed, installed and
maintained in a way that protects life,
health, morals, property and the public
welfare;
B. Public Safety. Protect public safety by
prohibiting signs that are structurally
unsafe or poorly maintained; that cause
unsafe traffic conditions through
distraction of motorists, confusion with
traffic signs, or hindrance of vision; and
that impede safe movement of pedestrians
or safe ingress and egress from buildings
or sites;
C. Protect Aesthetic Quality of Districts and
Neighborhoods. Prevent blight and protect
aesthetic qualities by preventing visual
clutter and protecting views; preventing
intrusion of commercial messages into non
-commercial areas; and eliminating signs
and sign structures on unused commercial
properties. Also, to avoid glare, light
trespass, and skyglow through selection of
fixture type and location, lighting
technology, and control of light levels;
D. Free Speech. Ensure that the
constitutionally guaranteed right of free
speech is protected and to allow signs as a
means of communication;
E. Reduce Conflict. Reduce conflict among
signs and light and between public and
private information systems;
F. Business Identification. Allow for adequate
and effective signage for business
identification and other commercial
speech, non-commercial speech, and
dissemination of public information,
including but not limited to, public safety
information and notification as may be
required by law;
G. Foster Economic Development. Ensure
that signs are located in a manner that
does not cause visual clutter, blight, and
distraction, but rather promotes
identification and communication
necessary for sustaining and expanding
economic development in the Township;
and,
H. Recognize Unique Areas. Acknowledge the
unique character of certain districts, and
establish special time, place and manner
regulations that reflect the unique
aesthetic, historical, and/or cultural
characteristics of these areas.

(s) upon determining that a complete site plan
is not required for review of the project for
compliance with this ordinance, or such a
requirement would be unreasonable. A
statement explaining the waiver shall be
provided to the Planning Commission. In
particular, the comprehensive list of submittal
items may not be required under the following
circumstances:
A. The project involves a minor revision or
improvement to an existing site, such as a

terms of parking, traffic generation,
drainage, utility needs, noise, aesthetics
and other external impacts. The Planning
and Zoning Department will notify the Site
Plan Review Committee of any requests for
waivers pursuant to this Section.
9. Standards for Reviewing Site Plans. The
standards for a Site Plan Review shall be the
conditions imposed pursuant to this Zoning
Ordinance, the Township Building Code, the
Sign Ordinance, the Township Subdivision
Ordinance, Planning Commission's regulations,
other Township Ordinances, County
Regulations and Federal and State statutes.
A. Building relationships. Buildings and
structures will meet or exceed setback
standards, height and other dimensional
standards, and be placed to preserve
environmentally sensitive areas. Maximum
building and lot coverage (impervious
surface ratios) are consistent with the
standards listed in Article 3. Any accessory
buildings or structures (garages, decks,
fences, etc.), except those in an approved
mobile home /manufactured housing park,
will meet the standards of Sections 4.2,
4.57, 4.71, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5.
B. Impact on surrounding land uses and
zoning. The proposed site plan will be
harmonious with, and not harmful,
injurious, or unreasonably objectionable to,
existing and planned future uses in the
immediate area. The proposed
development will be coordinated with
improvements serving the subject property
and with the other developments in the
vicinity. Buffers required in Sections 5.10.3
and 5.10.4 are provided.
C. Views and building elevations. Placement
and height of buildings, structures and
parking shall preserve existing views of
lakes, woodlands and other significant
visual resources to the greatest extent
reasonable. Proposed architecture shall
complement the character of the
surrounding area.
D. Preservation of wetlands. Regulated and
non-regulated wetlands, and organic soils
are preserved or modified in an acceptable
manner. A wetland setback from the
boundary of any wetland regulated by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality will
be provided, in accordance with Section
5.13.
E. Floodplain Standards. Any uses proposed
in a 100 year floodplain will meet the
standards of Section 5.9.
F. Stormwater management and soil erosion
control. The development will not
substantially reduce the natural retention
storage capacity of any watercourse,
thereby increasing potential for flooding.
Provisions have been made to
accommodate stormwater, which
complements the natural drainage
patterns and wetlands, prevents erosion
and the formation of dust. On-site storage
or sedimentation ponds may be required to
reduce or filter stormwater runoff.
Stormwater runoff on paved areas will be
collected at intervals, but will not obstruct
the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic,
create standing water or cause
unnecessary erosion of soil or other
material. The development shall meet the
requirements of Chapter 14, Articles II and
III of the Grand Blanc Charter Township
Code.
G. Preservation of topography. The site plan
and impact assessment demonstrate
judicious effort to preserve the integrity of
the land, existing topography and natural
drainage patterns. Grading or filling will not
destroy the character of the property or the
surrounding area and will not adversely
affect the adjacent or neighboring
properties.

10. Validity of Approved Final Site Plan.
A. Approval of the final site plan is valid for a
period of twelve (12) months; however,
approval of a site plan for a mobile home/
manufactured housing park is valid for five
(5) years. If actual physical construction of
a substantial nature of the improvements
included in the approved site plan has not
commenced and proceeded meaningfully
toward completion during that period, and
if a written request for extension of the
approval has not been submitted by the
applicant, the approval of the preliminary
or final site plan shall be deemed null and
void.
B. Upon written application, filed prior to the
termination of the twelve (12) month
review period, the Planning Commission
may authorize a single extension of the
time limit for approval of a final site plan
for a further period of not more than one
(1) year. Such extension shall only be
granted based on written evidence from
the applicant that construction of the
project has been delayed by factors beyond
the reasonable control of the applicant and
that construction of the project is likely to
proceed within the extension period.
11. Fees and Costs.
A. The Township may establish site plan
review fees to be paid by the applicant to
the Planning and Zoning Department.
B. Bonding Requirements. The Planning
Commission or Township Board may
require the deposit of a performance bond
in the form and amount of cash, certified
check, irrevocable letter of credit, or surety
bond determined by the Planning and
Zoning Department, to assure the timely,
qualitative and quantitative completion of
any public improvements shown on the site
plan, particularly when they are to be
performed by a date certain. The Planning
and Zoning Department shall make rebates
against such bond, in appropriate
amounts, as specified stages of
development are completed.
Any rebates shall be subject to the
withholding of ten percent (10%) of the
amounts by the Township. Such ten
percent (10%) retainage shall be released
by the Planning and Zoning Department
upon the applicants final satisfactory
completion of all bonded conditions.
Failure of the applicant to complete the
stated improvements by the relevant date
(s) certain shall require the forfeit of surety
up to the amount determined by the
Planning and Zoning Department as
necessary for the Township to complete
the required improvements. Upon the
applicants completing the required
conditions of approval and paying for such
required improvements, and the Township
being reimbursed for all such costs, if there
are any remaining funds, or credit, in the
performance bond, said remaining surety/
bond/funds/etc. shall be remitted to the
applicant.
12. Deviations from Approved Site Plan. For all
major or minor site plan amendments, any
homeowners or condominium association
registered with the Township Clerk shall be
notified of any site plan amendment(s)
proposed to occur within the boundaries of the
association of said development, whether it
encompasses a subdivision, planned unit
development, condominium or site
condominium development.
Minor changes to the approved final site plan
may be approved by the Planning and Zoning
Department without requiring a resubmittal to
the Site Plan Review Committee, Planning
Commission or Township Board, as applicable,
provided that the applicant or property owner
notifies the Planning and Zoning Department of
any proposed amendment to such approved
site plan prior to making said change on the
site and the Planning and Zoning Department
determines the proposed revision does not
alter the basic design, compliance with the
standards of approval, nor any specified
conditions of the approved site plan. For
purposes of interpretation, the following shall
be considered minor changes:
A. The size of approved principal or accessory
structures may be reduced, or increased by
up to five percent (5%) provided the overall
density of units does not increase. One
accessory structure may be added,
provided that it is no greater than 864 sq.
ft. in area.
B. Movement of a building or buildings by no
more than ten (10) feet which does not
significantly alter other aspects of the site.
C. Plantings approved in the landscape plan
may be replaced by similar types and sizes
of landscaping which provides a similar
screening effect on a one-to-one or greater
basis.

the property is razed, or until new zoning
regulations supersede the regulations upon
which site plan approval was based, or until a
new site design is approved. Any property
owner who fails to so maintain an approved
site design shall be deemed in violation of the
use provisions of this Ordinance and shall be
subject to the same penalties appropriate for a
use violation.
With respect to condominium projects, the
Master Deed shall contain provisions
describing the responsibilities of the
condominium association, condominium

6.6 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES
1. Intent. Grand Blanc Charter Township
recognizes the direct correlation between land
use decisions and traffic operations. Traffic
impact studies assist in coordinating land use
and transportation planning by forecasting the
potential generation of new vehicular traffic;
evaluating proposed access plans and
identifying driveway-related road improvements
at the site plan review stage; and identifying off
-site road improvements needed to
accommodate future traffic patterns. The
intent of this Section is to establish warrants
for determining when traffic impact studies
should be done, as well as minimum standards
for the conduct and reporting of such studies.

2. Required Study by Type. Traffic impact studies
generally consist of three types, a Rezoning
Traffic Study (RTS), Traffic Impact Assessment
(TIA), or Traffic Impact Statement (TIS). The
content of each study type is broadly described
below, along with the warranting conditions.
A. Rezoning Traffic Study. An RTS describes
relevant existing traffic conditions and
compares the potential trip generation of a
sites use under existing and proposed
zoning classifications. An RTS is required
for any proposed change to the zoning map
that is either (1) inconsistent with the
Townships Master Plan, or (2) involves
other than residential down-zoning.
B. Traffic Impact Assessment. A TIA describes
existing and likely future traffic conditions
both with and without a site developed in
specific proposed manner. The evaluation
of traffic impacts is limited to overall trip
generation and the operation of the
proposed site access drive(s). A TIA is
required if the proposed use(s) would
generate (1) 500-749 driveway trips per
day or (2) 50-99 peak-hour, peak-direction
driveway trips.
C. Traffic Impact Statement. A TIS is similar
to a TIA but includes off-site intersections
and other critical road features more
impacted due to a proposed uses greater
amount of trip generation. It may also be
appropriate to evaluate impacts at an offsite
location due to ongoing congestion or
safety problems, or because a road
redesign is pending and should account for
potential land use changes in the area. A
TIS is required if the proposed use(s) would
generate (1) 750 or more driveway trips
per day or (2) 100 or more peak-hour, peak
-direction driveway trips.
D. Determination of Need. The Townships
Planning Director or designated consultant
will certify the type of traffic impact study
required (if any), by signing a
Determination of Need form completed by
the Applicant or Applicants traffic
consultant. The form to be used for this
purpose will be approved by the Township
Board.
3. Preparation and Submittal. All traffic impact
studies must be planned and conducted in
close cooperation with Township staff and/or
designated Township consultants.
A. Qualifications of Preparer and Reviewer.
The person responsible for preparing a
traffic impact study shall (1) have at least
three years of recent experience preparing
such studies, where that work has
comprised a major portion of the
Preparers professional experience; (2) be
an Associate (or higher) member of the
Institute of Transportation Engineers; and
(3) be a registered Professional Engineer
(P.E.) in Michigan, certified Professional
Traffic Operations Engineer (PTOE), and/or
certified community planner (AICP or PCP).
The person designated by the Township to
review a submitted study shall have the
same qualifications.
B. Approval of Scope. Using a form approved
by the Township Board, the Preparer shall
complete and submit to the Planning
Director or designated consultant a Traffic
Impact Study Worksheet. This worksheet
will (1) detail the trip generation forecast
used to determine the need for the study;
(2) identify candidate off-site intersections
(if any) based, in part, on projected site
traffic constituting 5% or more of existing
traffic; (3) propose specific growth rates
and other developments to be considered
in forecasting future background traffic (if
any); (4) describe the method to be used in
distributing site-generated traffic; and (5)
confirm an awareness of other study
methodology requirements. The Preparer
should verify that the completed worksheet
is satisfactory prior to continuing work on
the study. Studies submitted without such
verification will be not be reviewed in detail
or approved.
C. Submittal of Report. Unless waived by the
Planning Director or designated consultant,
traffic impact studies must be submitted to
the Township at least 30 days prior to the
associated rezoning or development
proposal appearing on the agenda for a
Site Plan Committee or public meeting.
This lead time is needed to ensure the
distribution of the report to the Reviewer;
study review and the preparation of review
comments; and the distribution of the
review comments to appropriate Township
officials. The Planning Director will inform
the Applicant when the traffic impact study
has been approved, at which time the
Applicant or Applicants traffic consultant
shall also submit the approved study to the
Genesee County Road Commission and/or
Michigan Department of Transportation

(MDOT), as appropriate (based on agency
jurisdiction over the road(s) abutting the
subject site). If revisions or additions to
the initial report are required, they shall be
made and approved before the report is
accepted by the Township and forwarded
to the responsible road agency(ies).
4. Traffic Impact Study Contents. All studies
should be consistent with the state of the
practice, as outlined in such publications as
Evaluating Traffic Impact Studies  A
Recommended Practice for Michigan
Communities (ETIS, sponsored by MDOT, et al.).
Required content by study type is indicated in
the table below. The composition of individual
content items is detailed in paragraphs A
through N.
A. Describe Requested Rezoning or Proposed
Use(s). When rezoning is requested, the
study shall identify a range of feasible
permitted uses under existing zoning as
well as a range of feasible permitted uses
under the proposed new zoning; justify the
use sizes assumed within each range; and
ensure that the sized uses represent a
reasonably robust range of potential trip
generation. When a site plan or plat is
proposed as opposed to a rezoning, the
study shall include (where feasible) the
conceptual site plan or plat assumed as
the basis for the study, along with the
anticipated phasing and build-out year(s)
for the development.
B. Describe Site, Surroundings, and Study
Area. At a minimum, existing abutting land
use(s) and roadway conditions shall be
described. If off-site intersections have
been identified and approved via the TIS
Worksheet (Section 6.3.3.B), the study
area inferred by those intersection
locations shall be similarly described.
Special attention should be paid to
features potentially affecting the required
provision of safe and efficient site access,
such as road alignment and sight distance
limitations; speed limits; surface type; lane
configuration and traffic control devices;
existing or approved intersections and
driveways within 300 ft of the proposed
site access points (on both sides of
abutting road(s)); and compliance or noncompliance
with established accessmanagement
standards (Section 5.1 of
this Ordinance).
C. Obtain and Evaluate Current Traffic Data.
For all three traffic study types, the
Preparer shall obtain the latest available
daily traffic counts for area roads, and
determine (where possible) the proportion
of traffic within the AM and PM peak hours
(the K-factor). For Impact Assessments
and Impact Statements, new peak-period
manual counts shall be made at all
selected off-site intersections, including
those opposite proposed site access
points, unless waived by the Planning
Director or designated consultant. Any new
counts shall be made on a Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday of a non-holiday
week unless the nature of the proposed
use requires otherwise (such as Saturday
for a major shopping center). To the extent
feasible, counts should be made during
average or higher-than-average volume
conditions. In rare situations, seasonal
adjustments may be permitted to ensure
that an adequately representative volume
condition is addressed. The locations,
days, and time periods selected for the
manual volume counts will be
predetermined and documented on the TIS
Worksheet. If any special counts (e.g., of
trucks, gaps, speeds, crashes, etc.) are
proposed or required, such will be
indicated in a separate letter.
D. Describe Anticipated Future Changes to
Area Land Uses and Roads. All traffic
studies shall document pending changes,
other than the proposed site development,
that might influence future traffic
conditions. These changes should include
but not necessarily be limited to (1) other
developments that could increase traffic at
the selected off-site intersections by 5% or
more, and (2) planned road improvements
in the study area, with those actually
approved and funded clearly distinguished
from other improvements merely discussed
or recommended.
E. Forecast Future Background Traffic
Volumes. To provide an appropriate basis
for expressing the traffic impacts of a
proposed development, current traffic
volumes shall always be projected to the
earliest subsequent year in which it would
be reasonable to expect full occupancy of
the development. This creates a so-called
background traffic scenario, wherein
recent traffic trends have continued or new
expected trends have evolved, but the
subject site hypothetically remains

undeveloped. The TIS Worksheet must be
used to predetermine and document the
general growth rate and specific
background developments to be
considered in established the background
traffic scenario.
F. Forecast Driveway Trip Generation in
Manner Recommended by Institute of
Transportation Engineers. Unless waived
by the Planning Director or designated
consultant, forecasts of driveway trip
generation must be based on data and
methodology found in the latest editions of
the following two ITE publications: Trip
Generation (rate data) and Trip Generation
Handbook  An ITE Recommended
Practice (methodology and pass-by
percentages; hereafter referred to as the
Handbook) . The Handbooks
recommended procedure for choosing
between Trip Generations average rates
and regression equations should be
followed, with the exception that no
regression with a correlation coefficient
(R2) of less than 0.75 shall be used,
regardless of sample size. Regardless of
which statistical approach is taken
(average rates or equations), it is critical
that (1) the size of the development under
analysis be within the range of ITEs
sample data (especially important when
the illustrated regression equation is nonlinear);
(2) the line representing the
weighted average rate or regression
equation lie within the cluster of data
points near the size of the development
site; and (3) a regression equation with a
non-zero intercept not be applied for small
developments (to avoid illogical results).
The Preparer should contact the Planning
Director or designated consultant if
questions arise regarding the best
forecasting method or what to do when ITE
data appear unsuitable.
G. Discount Driveway Trips as Appropriate.
For some land uses, such as those
involving shopping or dining, it may be
appropriate to reduce (1) the abovepredicted
number of trips at site access
points, due to transit usage or so-called
internal or downtown capture (i.e.,
walking trips), or (2) the number of new
driveway trips assumed to pass through off
-site intersections, due to pass-by or
diverted traffic (drivers already using area
roads en route to primary destinations
elsewhere). Driveway trips less pass-by
and diverted trips are known as new or
primary trips. The percentages of total
driveway trips assumed in each of the
above categories (if any) will be
predetermined and documented via the TIS
Worksheet. To be conservative, the passby
percentages recommended in ETIS
should be used as applicable; in no cases
shall percentages larger than the averages
found in the Handbook be used.
H. Forecast and Compare Trip Generation by
Uses Permitted within Existing and
Proposed Zoning Districts. This item is to
be completed only for Rezoning Traffic
Studies. Where site development under
existing zoning could involve more than a
single density or development size, at least
two uses representing a range of potential
trip generation must be identified and
evaluated. For the proposed new zoning,
at least one assumed development must
be forecasted to generate a quantity of
trips near the higher end of what might be
generated by all feasible uses permitted
under that new zoning (the use envisioned
by the rezoning Applicant may or may not
meet this requirement). The report must
explain in some detail the planning and
traffic engineering bases of the assumed
development scenarios. The trip
generation comparison must address the
total number of driveway trips generated by
the site, and if applicable, the number of
new (or primary) trips passing through all
off-site intersections (if less than total
driveway trips).
I. Develop Reasonable Trip Distribution
Model(s). The method(s) used to distribute
site-generated traffic among specific
movements at the site drives and various
off-site intersections evaluated should be
explained in some detail. For instance, it is
insufficient to simply state that the trip
distribution modeling is based on existing
traffic patterns; the superficial application
of this concept may result in all trips being
modeled as if they were pass-by trips.
Generally, new (primary) trips should be
modeled separately from pass-by trips,
since the former return to their origin (by
definition), as opposed to exiting in the
direction they were traveling prior to
entering. Refer to the Handbook chapter
entitled Pass-by, Primary, and Diverted
Linked Trips for more explanation. Finally,
the traffic impact study should illustrate
the assumed trip percentages throughout

the study area (including at site drives, to
facilitate a reasonableness review).
J. Assign Site-Generated Trips and Forecast
Future Total Traffic. Assign the total sitegenerated
peak-hour trips forecasted in
items 4-F and 4-G according to the model
(s) developed in item 4-I. Add the resulting
site traffic to the future background traffic
(forecasted in item 4-E) to forecast future
total peak-hour traffic. The future daily
traffic on the abutting road(s) must also be
forecasted for the sites anticipated buildout
year, generally by dividing the projected
future total peak-hour traffic volume by a K
-factor (either the value(s) determined in
item 4-C, or by value(s) based on
professional experience and judgment).
Any deviation from this approach must be
approved in advance by the Planning
Director or designated consultant.
K. Determine Minimum Warranted Access
Improvements. Prior to evaluating future
levels of service at site access points and
off-site intersections (as applicable), the
safety-based need for left- and right-turn
lanes at the proposed access points must
be determined. Warrants published by the
Michigan Department of Transportation
shall be evaluated and used as the basis
for road improvement recommendations,
on multi-lane as well as two-lane roads.
The evaluation of these warrants will
examine both peak-hour and daily volumes
at site build-out, as applicable.
L. Evaluate Peak-Hour Traffic Impacts. The
study must evaluate peak-hour levels of
service at all off-site intersections under
current, future background, and future
total (background-plus-site) traffic
conditions, as well as at all site access
points under future total traffic conditions.
Unless waived by the Planning Director or
designated consultant, all locations and
hours counted (per item 4-C) must be
evaluated using methodology consistent
with latest edition of the Highway Capacity
Manual, published by the Transportation
Research Board. Capacity analyses must
evaluate future background and future
total traffic without as well as with any
recommended mitigation, unless funding
of timely mitigation is assured or this
requirement is waived by the Planning
Director or designated consultant. Finally,
the study must (1) indicate the peak-hour
factors used in the capacity analyses; (2)
summarize in the body of the report (at a
minimum) the level of service for any
movements rated E or F as well as the level
of service by intersection approach (as
applicable); and (3) comment on the
average delay per vehicle for any
intersections, approaches, or movements
rated F.
M. Identify and Evaluate Any Needed Capacity
Mitigation. Unless waived by the Planning
Director or designated consultant, the
traffic impact study must determine what
(if anything) would have to be done to
ensure a future background and/or future
total level of service of at least D overall at
every signalized intersection evaluated. A
reasonable effort should also be made to
identify mitigation for any approaches or
movements expected to experience a level
of service of E or F, whether at signalized
or unsignalized intersections (including
driveway approaches to major roads).
Level of service analyses must be done
and fully documented for all identified
capacity mitigation.
N. Recommend Appropriate Access Design
and Off-Site Road Improvements. Based
on the studys findings and conclusions,
the final report shall recommend, at a
minimum: (1) an appropriate lane
configuration at each proposed access
point, including turn lane lengths based on
storage and/or deceleration requirements;
(2) specific clear-vision triangles
commensurate with prevailing standards
and speeds; and (3) needed capacity
mitigation at the off-site intersections
evaluated. Off-site mitigation to
accommodate new traffic generated by the
proposed development shall be clearly
distinguished from the mitigation needed
to accommodate future background traffic
growth unrelated to the development.
5. Possible Waiver of Study Requirement. The
requirement for submittal of a traffic impact
study may be waived by the Planning Director
or Planning Commission in certain cases where
recent studies of a similar nature have been
completed and no further benefit would be
achieved by completing an additional study.
Requests to waive traffic study requirements
will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

The Planning Commission shall consider the
following when reviewing a site plan application
for a manufactured housing park:
1. Whether the proposed development meets
the design standards of this Ordinance and
the Rules of the Michigan Mobile Home
Commission;
2. Whether the proposed development is
adequately served by public infrastructure
systems if available, for sanitary sewer,
and drinking water. If public systems are
not available, a private system shall be
provided meeting the requirements of the
Michigan Department of Public Health's

2. Duties of Building Department. The Building
Department shall have the power to grant
Zoning Compliance and Occupancy Permits, to
make inspections of building or premises
necessary to carry out the duties of the Building
Department in the enforcement of this
Ordinance. It shall be unlawful for the Building
Department to approve any plans or issue any
permits or certificates of occupancy for any
excavation or construction until he has
inspected such plans in detail and found them
to conform with this Ordinance.
The Building Department shall record all
nonconforming uses existing at the effective
date of this Ordinance for the purpose of
carrying out the provisions of Section 7.2.3,
Nonconforming Uses of Land. Under no
circumstances is the Building Department
permitted to make changes to this Ordinance
nor to vary the terms of this Ordinance in
carrying out the duties of the Building
Department. The Building Department shall
not refuse to issue a permit when conditions
imposed by this Ordinance are complied with by
the applicant despite violations of contracts,
such as covenants or private agreements which
may occur upon the granting of said permit.
The Building Department shall order
discontinuance of illegal uses of land, buildings
or structures, removal of illegal buildings or
structures, discontinuance of any illegal
construction, or shall take any other lawful
action authorized by this Ordinance to ensure
compliance with, or prevent violations of its
provisions.
3. Plot Plan. The Building Department shall
require that all applications for Building Permits
shall be accompanied by plans and
specifications including a Plot Plan, in triplicate,
drawn to scale, which illustrate the following:
A. The actual shape, location and dimensions
of the lot;
B. The shape, size and location of all
buildings or other structures to be erected,
altered, or moved and of any building or
other structures already on the lot;
C. The existing and intended use of the lot
and of all such structures upon it,
including, in residential areas, the number
of dwelling units the building is intended to
accommodate; and
D. Such other information concerning the lot
or adjoining lots as may be essential for
determining whether the provisions of this
Ordinance are being observed.
4. Permits. The following shall apply in the
issuance of any permit:
A. Special land use permits. A special land
use permit shall not be issued by the
Building Department until the use has
been approved by the Planning
Commission and a site plan which
illustrates compliance with any conditions
has been approved. No building or
occupancy permit shall be issued for a use
which requires a special land use permit
until the special land use permit has been
approved.
B. Permits not to be issued. No Building
Permit shall be issued for the erection,
alteration or use of any building or
structure or part thereof, or for the use of
any land, which is not in accordance with
all provisions of this Ordinance.
C. Permits for new use of land. No land
heretofore vacant shall hereafter be used
or an existing use of land be hereafter
changed to a use of a different class or
type unless a certificate of occupancy is
first obtained for the new or different use.
D. Permits for new use of buildings. No
building or structure, or part thereof, shall
be changed to or occupied by a use of a
different class or type unless a certificate
of occupancy is first obtained for the new
or different use.
E. Permits required. No building or structure,
or part thereof, shall be hereafter erected,
altered, moved or repaired unless a
Building Permit has been issued for such
work. The terms "altered" and "repaired"
shall include any changes in structural
parts, stairways, type of construction, type,
class or kind of occupancy, light or
ventilation, means of egress and ingress,
or other changes regulated by the
Township of Grand Blanc, Building Code,
Housing Law, or this Ordinance, except for
minor repairs or changes not involving any

for such use. The following shall apply in the
issuance of any certificate:
A. Certificates not to be issued. No
certificates of occupancy shall be issued
for any building, structure or part thereof,
or for the use of any land, which is not in
accordance with all the provisions of this
Ordinance.
B. Certificates required. No building or
structure, or part thereof, which is
hereafter erected or altered, shall be
occupied or used or the same caused to be
done, unless and until a certificate of

C. Certificates including zoning. Certificates of
occupancy as required by the Township
Building Code for new buildings or
structures, or parts thereof, or for
alterations to or changes of use of existing
buildings or structures, shall also
constitute certificates of occupancy as
required by this Ordinance.
D. Certificates for existing buildings.
Certificates of occupancy shall be issued
for existing buildings, structures or parts
thereof, or existing use of land if, after,
inspection, it is found that such buildings,
structures, or parts thereof, or such use of
land, are in conformity with the provisions
of this Ordinance.
E. Record of certificates. A record of all
certificates issued shall be kept on file in
the office of the Building Department, and
copies shall be furnished upon request to
any person having a propriety or tenancy
interest in the property involved.
F. Certificates for existing buildings. Buildings
or structures accessory to dwelling shall
not require separate certificates of
occupancy but may be included in the
certificate of occupancy for the dwelling
when shown on the Plot Plan and when
completed at the same time as such
dwellings.
G. Application for certificates. Application for
certificates of occupancy shall be made in
writing to the Building Department on
forms furnished by that department. Such
certificates shall be issued within five (5)
days after receipt of such application if it is
found that the building or structure, or part
thereof, or the use of land is in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. If
such certificate is refused for cause, the
applicant therefore shall be notified of
such refusal and cause thereof, within the
aforesaid five (5) day period.
6. Final Inspection. The holder of every Building
Permit for the construction, erection, alteration,
repair, or moving of any building, structure or
part thereof, shall notify the Building
Department immediately upon the completion
of the work authorized by such permit, for a
final inspection.
7. Fees. Fees for inspection and the issuance of
permits or certificates or copies thereof
required or issued under the provisions of this
Ordinance may be collected by the Building
Department in advance of issuance. The
amount of such fees shall be established by
resolution of the Township Board and shall
cover the cost of inspection and supervision
resulting from enforcement of this Ordinance.
8. Violations and Penalties.
A. Violation a Nuisance. Any building erected,
altered, moved, razed, or converted, or any
use of land or premises carried on in
violation of any provision of this Ordinance
is declared to be a nuisance per se, and
may be abated by order of any court of
competent jurisdiction.
B. Inspection of Violation. The Building
Department shall inspect each alleged
violation and shall order correction, in
writing, of all conditions found to be in
violation of this Ordinance. The order to
correct a violation shall be issued by
serving personally, or by sending, by
registered mail, return receipt requested,
such order to the last known address of the
owner of the property upon which the
violation occurs, or when applicable, the
violator. A party who has failed to accept
such registered mail shall be deemed to
have been served.
C. Correction Period. All violations shall be
corrected within a period of ten (10) days
after the order to correct is served unless,
in the opinion of the Building Department,
a lesser time period is required because of
imminent danger to the health, safety or
welfare of the inhabitants of the Township.
A violation not corrected within the
required time period shall be reported to
the Township Attorney, who shall initiate
prosecution procedures. Legal proceedings
may be stayed during any period that such

refuses to comply with any provision of this
Ordinance or any permit, license or exception
granted here under, or any lawful order of the
Building Department, Board of Appeals or

civil infraction. The owner of record or tenant
of any building, structure premises, or part
thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor,
agent or person who commits, participates in,
assists in, or responsibly maintains such
violation may each be found of a separate
offense. Each day during which a violation

provisions of this Ordinance.
10. Remedies.

the Township Board, the Planning
Commission, the Board of Zoning Appeals
or the Township Attorney, or any interested
party, may institute injunction, mandamus,

following receipt thereof by the court of
jurisdiction. All fines collected shall belong
to the township and shall be deposited in
the general fund.
7.2 STANDARDS FOR NONCONFORMING
SITUATIONS
Nonconforming lots, nonconforming uses of land,
nonconforming structures, and nonconforming uses
of structures and premises.
1. Intent.
A. Legal nonconformities. Certain existing
lots, buildings, structures and uses of land
were lawful prior to adoption of the zoning
ordinance, but have become
nonconforming under the terms of this
Ordinance and its amendments. Such
n o n c o n f o r m i t i e s , p a r t i c u l a r l y
nonconforming uses which are more
intense than the uses permitted within the
zoning district, are declared by this
Ordinance to be incompatible with
permitted uses and in conflict with the
purposes of this Ordinance. An intent of
this Ordinance is to permit such legal
nonconforming lots, buildings, structures or
uses to remain until they are discontinued
or removed, but not to encourage their
survival, or where discontinuance or
removal is not considered feasible, to
gradually upgrade such nonconformities to
a more conforming status. A
nonconforming use, building, structure or
combination thereof, shall not be
extended, enlarged, expanded or replaced,
except as provided herein, and shall not be
used as grounds for adding other
nonconforming uses, buildings or
structures.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this
Ordinance shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction or
designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun
prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance and upon
which actual building construction has
been diligently carried on. Actual
construction is hereby defined to include
the placing of construction materials in
permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner; except that where
demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun
preparatory to rebuilding such demolition
or removal shall be deemed to be actual
construction, provided that work shall be
diligently carried on until completion of the
building involved.

B. Illegal nonconformities. Any lot, use,
building, structure or any combination
thereof that was not lawful at the date of
adoption of this Ordinance or any
amendments shall be classified as a illegal
nonconformity and shall not receive any of
the rights, privileges or protection
conferred by this Section (7.2). Such illegal
nonconformity shall be in violation of this
Ordinance and shall be terminated and
removed.
2. Nonconforming Lots of Record. A permitted
principal building and uses, and permitted
accessory structures and uses, may be erected
or placed on a lot of record which existed at the
date of adoption or amendment of this
Ordinance, provided such lot shall have been in
separate ownership and not contiguous with
other lots in the same ownership. This provision
shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area, or width, or both,
that are applicable in the district, provided that
minimum setback dimensions and other
requirements shall conform to the regulations
for the district. A reduction of minimum setback
requirements shall only be permitted upon
granting of a variance by the Zoning Board of
Appeals, based on the standards of Section
7.4.5, Variances.
3. Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where, at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of
this Ordinance, lawful use of land exists that is
made no longer permissible under the terms of
this Ordinance as enacted or amended such
use may be continued, so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
A. The nonconforming use shall not be
enlarged, expanded or extended to occupy
a greater area of land than was occupied
at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance;
B. No accessory use, building or structure
shall be established;
C. The nonconforming use shall not be moved
in whole or in part to any other portion of
the lot or parcel occupied by such use at
the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance;
D. If such nonconforming use of land ceases
for any reason for a period of more than
three hundred sixty five (365) days, such
use shall not be re-established.
Subsequent use of such land shall conform
to the regulations specified by this
Ordinance for the district in which such
land is located.
4. Nonconforming Buildings and Structures.
Where a lawful building or structure exists at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this Ordinance that could not be built under the
terms of this Ordinance by reason of
restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards,
landscape buffer, off-street parking, loading
space, minimum setback, or other
characteristics of the structure or its location
on the lot, such building or structure may be
continued provided it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
A. Permitted expansions. No such structure
may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity, unless a
variance is granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals. Nonconforming buildings and
structures may be enlarged or altered in a
way which decreases its nonconformity or
which does not increase its nonconformity
provided the costs of alteration or
expansion does not exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the replacement cost of the
building at the time of alteration or
expansion. (Example, if the side yard
setback is nonconforming, the building
may be extended on the other side, rear or
front yard provided that those setbacks
remain conforming).
B. Repair or Replacement of nonconforming
single family dwellings. A nonconforming
single family dwelling and its accessory
structures may be continued, replaced,
repaired or remodeled if damaged by flood,
fire, tornado or other natural events,
accidents or vandalism, subject to approval
of a permit issued by the Building
Department. Such approval requires a
finding that the resulting building footprint
will be the same size or larger than that of
the building before such change.
Replacement of such nonconforming single
family building shall commence within one
(1) year of the date of damage and work
shall be diligently pursued toward
completion. Failure to complete
replacement or diligently work toward
completion shall result in the loss of legal,
nonconforming status unless good cause
for the delay is accepted at a hearing
before the Zoning Board of Appeals.
C. Damaged nonconforming, buildings and
structures. Except as noted in item 2
above, a nonconforming building or

structure, which is damaged by flood, fire,
tornado or other natural events, accidents
or vandalism to an extent of more than sixty
percent (60%) of its replacement costs,
exclusive of the foundation, shall be
reconstructed only in conformity with the
provisions of this Ordinance, unless the lot
is a nonconforming lot of record, in which
case the provisions of Section 7.2.2,
Nonconforming Lots of Record, also apply.
Such nonconforming building may be
replaced provided replacement is
commenced within one (1) year of the date
of damage and is being diligently pursued
toward completion. Failure to complete
replacement shall result in the loss of legal,
nonconforming status unless good cause for
the delay is accepted at a hearing before
the Zoning Board of Appeals.
D. Relocation of a nonconforming building or
structure. Should any nonconforming
building or structure be relocated or moved
for any reason for any distance, it shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which it is located after it is
relocated or moved.
5. Nonconforming Uses of Structures and Land. If
a lawful use of a structure, or of structure and
land in combination, exists at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance,
that would not be permitted in the district
under the terms of this Ordinance, the lawful
use may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
A. In a commercial or industrial district a
nonconforming single family residential
building may be expanded to occupy the
floor area necessary for living purposes
subject to approval by the Zoning Board of
Appeals. In addition, an accessory structure
to a nonconforming residential use may be
constructed or expanded in a nonresidential
zoning district subject to
approval by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
B. Replacements or repair of a nonconforming
residential use and building in a
nonresidential district damaged by flood,
fire or vandalism shall be permitted upon
approval by the Zoning Board of Appeals, in
accordance with Section 7.2.4,
Nonconforming Buildings and Structures.
C. No existing structure devoted to a use not
permitted by this Ordinance in the district in
which it is located, except single family
dwellings as permitted above, shall be
enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved or structurally
altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district
in which it is located.
D. Any nonconforming use may be extended
throughout any parts of a building which
were manifestly arranged or designed for
such use, and which existed at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance,
but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
E. If no structural alterations are made, any
nonconforming use of a structure, or
structure and land in combination, may be
changed to another nonconforming use of
the same or a more restricted classification
provided that the Zoning Board of Appeals,
either by general rule or by making findings
in the specific case, shall find that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or
more appropriate to the district than the
existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such change, the Zoning Board of Appeals
may require conditions and safeguards in
accord with the purpose and intent of this
Ordinance. Where a nonconforming use of
a structure, land, or structure and land in
combination is hereafter changed to a
more conforming use, it shall not thereafter
be changed to a less conforming use.
F. Any structure, or structure and land in
combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a
permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which
such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use shall not thereafter be
resumed.
G. When a nonconforming use of a structure,
or structures and land in combination, is
discontinued or ceases to exist for twelve
(12) consecutive months or for eighteen
(18) months during any three (3) year
period, the structure, or structure and land
in combination, shall not thereafter be
used except in conformance with the
regulations of the district in which it is
located. Structures occupied by seasonal
uses shall be excepted from this provision.
H. Where nonconformity use status applies to
a structure and land in combination,
removal, demolition or destruction of the
st ructure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.

6. Repairs and Maintenance
A. On any building devoted in whole or in part
to any nonconforming use, work may be
done in any period of twelve (12)
consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or
on repair or replacement of nonbearing
walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an
extent not exceeding fifty (50) percent of
the assessed value of the building,
provided that the cubic content of the
building as it existed at the time of passage
or amendment of this Ordinance shall not
be increased (see also Section 7.2.4,
Nonconforming Building and Structures).
B. A nonconforming structure or any structure
containing a nonconforming use that has
structurally deteriorated to an extent that it
has been condemned by a duly authorized
official, and the cost of repair to meet
standards for occupancy exceeds fifty
(50%) percent of the structure's
replacement cost, shall not thereafter be
restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in
conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
C. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed
to prevent the strengthening or restoring to
a safe condition of any building or part
thereof declared to be unsafe by any
official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.
7. Uses Under Exception Provision Not
Nonconforming Uses. Any use for which a
special exception is permitted as provided in
this Ordinance shall not be deemed a
nonconforming use, but shall, without further
action, be deemed a conforming use in such
district.
8. Change of Tenancy or Ownership. There may
be a change of tenancy, ownership, or
management of any existing nonconforming
uses of land, structures and land in
combination.
7.3 ORDINANCE AMENDMENTS

3. Amendment Procedure; Public Hearing and
Notice.
A. A mandatory Pre-application conference
with Township staff, consultants and
Planning Commission officials is required
prior to the formal submission of a
request for a conditional rezoning. The
conference provides an opportunity to
informally discuss the rezoning and
voluntary conditions proposed as well as
other applicable Township development
procedures such as site plan review,
special land use review and variances.
The pre-application conference will allow
the applicant and the Township to identify
key issues associated with the request at
the earliest possible stage.
B. Upon initiation of an amendment, a work
session and public hearing to consider
the proposed amendment shall be
scheduled before the Planning
Commission. Notice of the hearing shall
be given by one (1) publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in the
Township. Notice shall also be given by
mail to each electric, gas, and pipeline
public ut i lity company, each
telecommunication service provider, and
each railroad operating within the district
affected, that registers its name and

seq.) and shall describe the nature of the
proposed amendment, state the time and
place of the public hearing, and indicate
when and where written comments will be
received. For rezoning requests of an
individual property or of ten (10) or fewer
adjacent properties, notice shall also be
given by mail or personal delivery to the
owners of property for which approval is
being considered, to all persons whom real
property is assessed within 300 feet of the
subject property, and to the occupants of
all structures within 300 feet of the subject
property regardless of whether the property
or occupant is located within Grand Blanc
Township. The notice shall indicate the
property that is subject of the request
including a listing of all existing street
addresses within the subject property.
C. Whenever an application for rezoning is
made, it shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to prepare and erect a sign
announcing the rezoning request. The sign
shall comply with the following regulations:
i. One (1) sign shall be placed on the
property proposed for rezoning and in
full public view along all abutting street
or road frontages. The sign(s) must be
located along, not in, the right-of-way
nearest to the midpoint of the property
width, without obstructing the vision of
motorists or pedestrians.
ii. If the property proposed for rezoning
does not abut a street, the sign(s) shall
be placed on any contiguous land
owned by the petitioner(s) or owner(s)
which does abut a street.
iii. If no contiguous property abutting a
street is owned by the petitioner(s) or
owner(s) of the property proposed for
rezoning, the sign(s) shall be placed in
such location(s) on the property that
the Zoning Administrator deems will
best inform the public of the proposed
rezoning. If the Zoning Administrator
determines that there is no location
where a sign could be placed that
would be visible to the public, the
Zoning Administrator may waive the
requirement of posting.

geological, hydrological and other
environmental features with the host of
uses permitted in the proposed zoning
district.

reasonable return on investment through
developing the property with one (1) of the
uses permitted under the current zoning.

land suitability, impacts on the
environment, density, nature of use, traffic
impacts, aesthetics, infrastructure and
potential influence on property values.
E. The capacity of Township utilities and
services sufficient to accommodate the
uses permitted in the requested district
without compromising the "health, safety
and welfare" of the Township.

F. The capability of the street system to
safely and efficiently accommodate the
expected traffic generated by uses
permitted in the requested zoning district.
A rezoning traffic study prepared in
accordance with the requirements of
Section 6.6 shall be required for any
proposed change to the zoning that is
either (1) inconsistent with the
Townships Master Plan, or (2) involves a
request other than residential downzoning.

uses permitted in the requested zoning
district in the Township in relation to the
amount of land in the Township currently
zoned and available to accommodate the

district are reasonable in relationship to
surroundings and construction on the site
will be able to meet the dimensional
regulations for the zoning district listed in
the Schedule of Regulations.
I. If a rezoning is appropriate, the requested
zoning district considered to be more
appropriate from the township's
perspective than another zoning district.
J. If the request is for a specific use, is
rezoning the land more appropriate than
amending the list of permitted or special
land uses in the current zoning district to
allow the use?
K. The requested rezoning will not create an
isolated and unplanned spot zone.
L. The request has not previously been
submitted within the past one (1) year,
unless conditions have changed or new
information has been provided.

Planning Commission and Township
Board.
6. Criteria for Amendments to Zoning Ordinance

environmental requirements and similar
technical items.
H. Other criteria as determined by the
Planning Commission or Township Board
which would protect the health and safety
of the public, protect public and private
investment in the Township, promote
implementation of the goals and policies of
the Master Plan and Sub-Area Plans, and

the place and time when a copy of the
amendment may be purchased or
inspected.
B. The Zoning Text and or Map shall be
amended to reflect the new zoning
classification or language. Map
amendments for conditional rezonings
should include a designation identifying
that the property is subject to a Statement
of Conditions.
C. Conditional rezonings shall require the
submittal of a formal written Statement of
Conditions which shall be incorporated by
attachment as an inseparable part of the
ordinance adopted by the Township Board.
The Statement of Conditions shall:
i. Be in a form recordable with the
Genesee County Register of Deeds and
include a statement acknowledging
that it is recorded.
ii. Contain a legal description of the land
to which it pertains.
iii. Acknowledge that upon the rezoning
taking effect, the use and development
of the land shall conform thereafter to
all of the requirements regulating use
and development within the new
zoning district as modified by the
Statement of Conditions.
iv. Contain a provision acknowledging
that the Statement of Conditions runs
with the land and is binding upon
successor owners of the land. Any
person who establishes a development
or commences a use upon such land
shall continuously operate and
maintain the development or use in
compliance with all of the conditions
set forth in the Statement of
Conditions.
v. Incorporate by attachment or
reference any diagram, plans or other

documents are incorporated by
reference, the reference shall specify
where the document may be
examined.
vi. Specify that failure to comply with any
of the conditions set forth in the
Statement of Conditions shall
constitute a violation of this Zoning
Ordinance and shall be punishable
accordingly.

of the owners of the subject land
preceded by a statement attesting to
the fact that they voluntarily offer and
consent to the provisions contained
within the document.
D. The approved Statement of Conditions
shall be filed by the Township Clerk with
the Genesee County Register of Deeds.
The Township Board shall have the ability
to waive this requirement if it determines
that, given the nature of the conditions
and/or the time frame within which the
conditions are to be satisfied, the recording
of such a document would be of no
material benefit to the Township or to any
subsequent owner of the land.
8. Effect of Conditional Rezoning. The following
provisions shall apply to approved conditional
rezonings:
A. Time Period for Establishing Development
or Use. Unless another time period is
specified in the Ordinance rezoning the
subject land, the approved development
and / or use of land pursuant to building
and other required permits must be
commenced upon the land within 18
months after the rezoning took effect and
thereafter proceed diligently to completion.
This time limitation may upon written
request be extended by the Township
Board if (1) it is demonstrated to the
Township Boards reasonable satisfaction
that there is a strong likelihood that the
development and or use of will commence
within the period of extension and proceed
diligently thereafter to completion and (2)
the Township Board finds that there has
not been a change in circumstances that
would render the current zoning with
Statement of Conditions incompatible with
other zones and uses in the surrounding
area or otherwise inconsistent with sound
zoning policy.
B. Reversion of Zoning. If approved
development and / or use of the rezoned
land does not occur within the time frame
specified under Section 7.3.8.A above,
then the land shall revert to its former
zoning classification as set forth in Section
405(2) of the Michigan Zoning Enabling
Act, P.A. 110 of 2006, as amended. The
reversion process shall be initiated by the

Township Board requesting that the
Planning Commission proceed with
consideration of the rezoning of the land
to its former zoning classification. The
procedure for considering and making
this reversionary rezoning shall thereafter
be the same as applies to all other zoning
requests.
C. Subsequent Rezoning of Land. When land
that is rezoned with a Statement of
Conditions is thereafter rezoned to a
different zoning classification or to the
same zoning classification but with a
different or no Statement of Conditions,
whether as a result of a reversion of
zoning pursuant to Section 7.3.8.B above
or otherwise, the Statement of Conditions
imposed under the former zoning
classification shall cease to be in effect.
Upon the owners written request, the
Township Clerk shall record with the
Genesee County Register of Deeds a
notice that the Statement of Conditions is
no longer in effect.
D. Amendment of Conditions.
i. During the time period for
commencement of an approved
development or use specified
pursuant to Section 7.3.8.A above or
during any extension thereof granted
by the Township Board, the Township
shall not add to or alter the
conditions in the Statement of
Conditions.
ii. The Statement of Conditions may be
amended thereafter in the same
manner as set forth in Section
7.3.3.E of this Ordinance.
E. Township Right to Rezone. Nothing in the
Statement of Conditions nor in the
provisions of this Section shall be
deemed to prohibit the Township from
rezoning all or any portion of land that is
subject to a Statement of Conditions to
another zoning classification. Any
rezoning shall be conducted in
compliance with this ordinance and the
Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, P.A. 110 of
2006, as amended, (M.C.L. 125.3101 et
seq.).
7.4 ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
1. Creation and Membership. There is hereby
established a Zoning Board of Appeals,
hereinafter in this Section (7.4) called the
"Board", which shall perform its duties and
exercise its powers as provided in the Michigan
Zoning Enabling Act, P.A. 110 of 2006, as
amended, (M.C.L. 125.3101 et seq.), and in
such a way that the objectives of this
Ordinance shall be observed, public safety and
welfare secured and substantial justice done.
The Board shall be composed of five members
as follows:
A. The first member shall be a member of the
Township Planning Commission. If this
member's participation on the Planning
Commission ends, a new member from the
Planning Commission shall be appointed
by the Township Board.
B. The second member shall be a member of
the Township Board appointed by the
Township Board for a period of his or her
office. This member shall serve only while
serving as a member of the Township
Board, and shall not serve as Chairperson
of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
C. The remaining members shall be
appointed by the Township Board from
among the electors residing in the
township. The initial term for the third
member shall be three (3) years, the initial
term for the fourth and fifth members shall
be two (2) years. The terms of these
members shall be for three (3) years upon
reappointment. For members serving at
the time this Ordinance was adopted in
1994, the terms of office established
under the prior Zoning Ordinance shall
remain valid. If a member's term expires,
that member shall continue to serve,
unless replaced by an alternate, until a
new member is appointed by the Township
Board. A successor shall be appointed not
more than one (1) month after the term of
the preceding member has expired.
Vacancies for unexpired terms shall be
filled for the remainder of the term.
D. The Township Board may appoint one (1)
or two (2) alternates to the Zoning Board of
Appeals to serve during the absence of a
regular member; in the interim, if a
member resigns; or when a regular
member is excused from an item due to an
announced "conflict of interest." The
alternates shall serve for a three (3) year
term.

nonfeasance in office, upon filing of written
charges and after public hearing before the

disqualify himself or herself from a vote in
which the member has a conflict of
interest. Failure of a member to disqualify
himself or herself from a vote in which the
member has a conflict of interest
constitutes malfeasance in office.

Appeals shall adopt, and may amend, its
own rules of procedures or bylaws as may
be necessary to conduct its meetings
properly.

are present. All hearings conducted by
said Board shall be open to the public. The
Board shall have the power to subpoena

other evidence pertinent to the matters
before it.

proceedings showing the vote of each
member upon each question, or if absent,
or failing to vote, indicating such fact; and
shall also keep records of its hearings and
other official action.
D. Majority vote. The concurring vote of a
majority of the members of the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of the Building Department
or the Planning Commission; or to approve
any variance; or for any other approval.
E. Public Hearing. Upon a written request
seeking an interpretation of the Zoning
Ordinance, an appeal of an administrative
decision, or a variance, the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall select a reasonable time and
place for a hearing of the request. Notice
of the hearing shall be given by one (1)
publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Township. The notice
shall be given not less than fifteen (15)
days before the public hearing date, in
accordance with the Michigan Zoning
Enabling Act, P.A. 110 of 2006, as
amended, (M.C.L. 125.3101 et seq.). For
requests for a variance or an interpretation
or appeal of an administrative decision
which involves a specific parcel, written
notice shall also be given by mail or
personal delivery to the applicant and
owners of the subject property, to all
persons whom real property is assessed
within 300 feet of the subject property, and
to the occupants of all structures within
300 feet of the subject property regardless
of whether the property or occupant is
located within Grand Blanc Township. The
notice shall describe the nature of the
proposed request, state the time and place
of the public hearing, indicate when and
where written comments will be received,
and indicate the property that is subject of
the request including a listing of all existing
street addresses within the subject
property.

dimensional variances as permitted under
the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act, P.A. 110
of 2006, as amended, (M.C.L. 125.3101 et
seq.). Any approval shall be subject to
such conditions as the Board may require
to preserve and promote the character of
the zoning district in question and
otherwise promote the purpose of this
Ordinance and the Township Master Plan.
B. Limits on authority. The Zoning Board of
Appeals shall not have the power to

business days of the applicants receipt of
official notice of the decision which is
being applied.
C. Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay
all proceedings in furtherance of the
action appealed unless the Building
Department certifies to the Zoning Board
of Appeals that, for reasons stated in the
certificate, a stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property, in which case the
proceeding shall not be stayed other than
by a restraining order, which may be
granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals or
a court of record.
D. Processing the appeal materials. The
Building Department shall transmit to the
Zoning Board of Appeals all of the papers
constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken. The
Zoning Board of Appeals shall render a

part of the record available to the
administrative person or body when the
decision being appealed was made; no

Appeals shall find immediate effect is
necessary to preserve a substantial
property right and shall so certify in the
record.
I. Final authority. Decisions of the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall be final. Appeals of
a Zoning Board of Appeals decision shall
be to a court of law.
5. Variances (See also Section 7.4.6, Recording
of Variance and Appeal Decisions)
A. General variances. The Zoning Board of
Appeals may authorize a variance from the
strict application of the area or
dimensional standard of this Ordinance
when the applicant demonstrates all of the
following conditions "a - e" or condition f
applies.
i. Practical difficulty. A practical difficulty
exists on the subject site (such as
exceptional narrowness, shallowness,
shape or area; presence of floodplain;
exceptional topographic conditions)
and strict compliance with the zoning
ordinance standards would
unreasonably prevent the owner from
using of the subject site for a
permitted use or would render
conformity unnecessarily burdensome.
Demonstration of a practical difficulty

3 Districts Use

5 Standards Development
6 Procedures Admin and
7 Enforcement 7-16 i
Charter Township of Grand Blanc
©clearzoning
shall have a bearing on the subject site
or use of the subject site, and not to
the applicant personally. Economic
hardship or optimum profit potential
are not considerations for practical
difficulty.
ii. Unique situation. The demonstrated
practical difficult results from
exceptional or extraordinary
circumstances or conditions applying
to the subject site at the time the
Ordinance was adopted or amended
which are different than typical
properties in the same zoning district
or the vicinity.
iii. Not self created. The applicants
problem is not self created.
iv. Substantial justice. The variance
would provide substantial justice by
granting the property rights similar to
those enjoyed by the majority of other
properties in the vicinity, and other
properties in the same zoning district.
The decision shall not bestow upon the
property special development rights
not enjoyed by other properties in the
same district, or which might result in
substantial adverse impacts on
properties in the vicinity (such as the
supply of light and air, significant
increases in traffic, increased odors,
an increase in the danger of fire, or
other activities which may endanger
the public safety, comfort, morals or
welfare).
v. Minimum variance necessary. The
variance shall be the minimum
necessary to grant relief created by the
practical difficulty.
vi. Compliance with other laws. The
variance is the minimum necessary to
comply with state or federal laws, such
as farming activities protected by the
"Right to Farm Act" or accessory
facilities to meet the needs of
handicapped individuals protected
under the Americans with Disabilities
Act.
B. Variance from access management and
private road standards. The Zoning Board
of Appeals may grant a variance only when
the applicant demonstrates all of the
following conditions exist.
i. There are exceptional or extraordinary
circumstances or conditions to the
property different than typical
properties in the same zoning district
such as topographic features, quality
mature trees, limited sight distance or
wetlands.
ii. Strict compliance with this Ordinance
standards would unreasonably prevent
the owner from using of their property
for a permitted use or would result in
unnecessary loss of important natural
features.
iii. Granting the variance would benefit
the public in terms of traffic operations
and safety.
C. Variance from wetland setback. The
Zoning Board of Appeals may permit a
variance from the required ten (10) feet
setback from a wetland regulated by the
Michigan Department of Natural Resources
if the applicant demonstrates all of the
following conditions exist.
i. The setback is not necessary to
preserve the ecological and aesthetic
value of the wetland.
ii. The natural drainage pattern to the

1. Intent. These regulations establish rules and standards for the construction, location, maintenance
and removal of privately-owned signs. Directional, emergency, or traffic-related signs owned by

A. General. Ensure that signs are located, designed, constructed, installed and maintained in a way
that protects life, health, morals, property and the public welfare;
B. Public Safety. Protect public safety by prohibiting signs that are structurally unsafe or poorly
maintained; that cause unsafe traffic conditions through distraction of motorists, confusion with
traffic signs, or hindrance of vision; and that impede safe movement of pedestrians or safe
ingress and egress from buildings or sites;
C. Protect Aesthetic Quality of Districts and Neighborhoods. Prevent blight and protect aesthetic
qualities by preventing visual clutter and protecting views; preventing intrusion of commercial
messages into non-commercial areas; and eliminating signs and sign structures on unused
commercial properties. Also, to avoid glare, light trespass, and skyglow through selection of
fixture type and location, lighting technology, and control of light levels;
D. Free Speech. Ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech is protected and to
allow signs as a means of communication;
E. Reduce Conflict. Reduce conflict among signs and light and between public and private
information systems;
F. Business Identification. Allow for adequate and effective signage for business identification and
other commercial speech, non-commercial speech, and dissemination of public information,
including but not limited to, public safety information and notification as may be required by law;
G. Foster Economic Development. Ensure that signs are located in a manner that does not cause
visual clutter, blight, and distraction, but rather promotes identification and communication
necessary for sustaining and expanding economic development in the Township; and,
H. Recognize Unique Areas. Acknowledge the unique character of certain districts, and establish
special time, place and manner regulations that reflect the unique aesthetic, historical, and/or
cultural characteristics of these areas.
