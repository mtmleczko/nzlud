PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Clinton, North Carolina of a general and permanent nature. The Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as supplemented through December 31, 1984, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 3 is numbered 3-1 and the fourth section of Chapter 6 is 6-4. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-2 and 3-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-2.1, 3-2.2 and 3-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Jan N. Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Robert A. Leeper, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Elizabeth W. Fortner, City Clerk, Miles B. Fowler, City Attorney, and Tommy M. Combs, City Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are the same as those of ordinances adopted prior to the adoption of this Code and included in this Code, shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments. 
(Code 1975, § 1-3) 
Sec. 1-4. - Catchlines, history notes and references. 
(a)  The catchlines of the several sections of this Code are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted.

Sec. 1-7. - Amendments to Code.

When subsequent ordinances repeal any chapter, section or subsection or any portion thereof, such repealed portions shall be excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages.

(Code 1975, § 1-8) 
Sec. 1-9. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared on an annual basis. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _______ to _______" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
Sec. 1-10. - General penalty; enforcement of ordinances; continuing violations. 
(a)  Unless otherwise specifically provided, violation of any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance shall be a misdemeanor, as provided by section 14-4 of the general statutes. 
(b)  Violation of any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance shall subject the offender to a civil penalty to be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of debt if the offender does not pay the penalty within a period of time prescribed by the court after he has been cited for such violation. 
(c)  Any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance may be enforced by an appropriate equitable remedy issuing from a court of competent jurisdiction. In such case, the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders as may be appropriate, and it shall not be a defense to the application of the city for equitable relief that there is an adequate remedy at law. 
(d)  Any provision of this Code or any other city ordinance that makes unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction and order of abatement, and the general court of justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. When a violation of such a provision occurs, the city may apply to the appropriate division of the general court of justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil proceedings, including the "Rules of Civil Procedure" of the general statutes in general and Rule 65 in particular. 
(e)  In addition to an injunction, the court may enter an order of abatement as a part of the judgment in the cause. An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be closed, demolished, or removed; that fixtures, furniture or other movable property be removed from buildings on the property; that grass and weeds be cut; that improvements or repairs be made; or that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with this Code or such ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the city may execute the order of abatement. The city shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the clerk of superior court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in conjunction therewith. 
(f)  The provisions of this Code and any other city ordinance may be enforced by any one, all or a combination of the remedies authorized and prescribed by this section. 
(g)  Except as otherwise specifically provided, each day's continuing violation of any provisions of this Code or any other city ordinance shall be a separate and distinct offense.

The city specifically reserves the right to (i) grant at any time such additional franchises for a cable communication system, on similar terms and conditions, as it deems appropriate, and/or (ii) build, operate, and own such cable communications system or systems as it deems appropriate, in accordance with applicable federal or state laws and the terms of this article as it may be amended. 
(i)  Time is of the essence to this agreement. Whenever the agreement shall set forth any time for any act to be performed by or on behalf of the grantee, such time shall be deemed of the essence and any material failure of the grantee or city to perform within the time allotted shall always be sufficient ground for: (1) the city to invoke an appropriate penalty including possible revocation of the franchise or where grantee's failure of performance is caused by city's action. 
(j)  Governing law. The provisions of this franchise shall be subject to applicable federal statutes, rules, and regulations, including but not limited, to the Communications Act of 1934 as amended. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this franchise and such federal law, the letter shall prevail. In all other matters, this franchise shall be governed according to the laws of the State of North Carolina. 
(k)  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this article or the franchise is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, or by a federal, state, or local statute or regulation, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
(l)  Transfer of ownership or control. 
(1)  Transfer of franchise. Any franchise granted hereunder cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed or including but not limited to, by force or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership or other means without the prior consent of the city, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and then only under such conditions as the city may establish. This shall not apply to an intra-company transfer. A transfer to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with grantee shall not be deemed a transfer for purposes of this provision. 
(2)  The grantee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any party of, control of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the disposal by the grantee, directly or indirectly by gift, assignment, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of ten (10) percent or more at one time of the ownership or controlling interest in the system, or fifteen (15) percent cumulatively over the term of the franchise of such interest to a corporation, partnership, limited partnership trust or association of person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already own or control such percentage interest. 
(3)  If the grantee decides to sell, transfer, lease, assign, or dispose of the franchise by any means or method or change the control of the grantee, it shall first give written notice to the city of the proposed change, transfer, or acquisition, including the name and address of the prospective transferee or controlling party and shall furnish such additional information as the city may reasonably request regarding the legal, financial, character, technical, and other public interest qualifications of such party. 
(4)  Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless the city shall have consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the city in any such inquiry. Failure to provide all material information reasonably requested by the city as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the proposed change, transfer or acquisition of control. 
(5)  Assumption of control. The City agrees that any financial institution having a pledge of the franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the city that it or its designees satisfactory to the city will take control and operate the cable television system. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will insure continued service and compliance with all franchise obligations during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the city at its discretion, and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee. If the city finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, the financial, character, technical and other public interest qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the city will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchises as is in the public interest. The consent of the city to such transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(6)  The consent or approval of the city to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise. 
(7)  Any approval by the city of transfer of ownership or control shall be contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a signatory to the franchise. 
(8)  Buy back. If grantee proposes to sell, transfer, lease, assign or dispose of the system facilities or any portion (but not all) of grantee's cable television division or North Carolina region which includes the system (herein referred to as the "Property"), the city shall have the right to acquire the system subject to the following conditions: 
a.  Upon receipt of a bona fide written offer from a third party ("third party") to acquire the property, grantee shall notify the city of such offer and the city shall have thirty (30) days within which to respond in writing to such offer. If the city agrees in writing to match the material terms of such offer insofar as it applies to the system (subject to paragraph 2, below), including but not limited to the purchase price, grantee shall accept the city's offer. 
b.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to the contrary, any offer by the city to acquire the system shall, at a minimum, include any North Carolina communities (in addition to the city) where grantee operates a cable system or systems, and which are served by the headend from which the City of Clinton is served. 
c.  Should grantee negotiate to sell the property to another party which results in grantee receiving minority tax certificates or other favorable tax treatment that the city is legally unable to duplicate as a part of its offer, the value of the tax benefits will be determined by an independent CPA selected by both parties. If the city's bona fide cash offer exceeds the negotiated cash price from the other party by at least the value of the tax benefits determined by the independent CPA, (and assuming all other conditions are met) the property will be sold to the city. 
(m)  Franchise renewal. 
(1)  Renewal discretionary. The city may in its sole discretion grant or deny renewal of the franchise of the grantee in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act. The grantee shall retain ownership of system facilities but shall remove as provided upon the completion of the franchise term. 
(n)  Police powers. 
(1)  In accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its rights hereunder are subject to the police power of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it agrees to comply with all laws and ordinances of general applicability enacted by the city pursuant to such power. 
(2)  Any conflict between the provisions of this article or the franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the city's police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to grantee or cable communications systems which contains provisions inconsistent with this article shall prevail only if, upon such exercise, the city finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property or general welfare and such exercise is mandated by law. 
(o)  Franchise fees. 
(1)  Because the city finds that: 
a.  The streets of the county, state, and city to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the county, state, and city at great expense to its taxpayers, and 
b.  The grant to the grantee relating to the said streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and 
c.  The administration of this Ordinance and the franchise imposes upon the city additional regulatory responsibility and expense. 
d.  The grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the city a franchise fee in an amount as designated in the franchise, but in no event less than five (5) percent of the gross annual revenue, or upon notification by grantor the maximum amount permitted under applicable federal, state, or local law. This annual franchise payment shall commence as of the effective date of the franchise and paid quarterly. The city shall be furnished a statement of said payment by a certified public accountant, reflecting the total amounts of annual gross revenue and the above charges and computations for the period covered by the payment. 
(2)  This payment shall be made in addition to any other tax or payment, of general applicability, owed to the city or other taxing jurisdiction by the grantee. Payment of the franchise fee made by grantee to the city shall be in addition to any and all taxes which are now or may be required hereafter to be paid by any federal, state, or local law. 
(3)  Acceptance by the city. No acceptance of any payment by the city shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sum payable as a franchise fee under this article or for the performance of any other obligation of the grantee. 
(4)  Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified herein, grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the primary depository bank during the period that such amount is owed. 
(5)  The franchise fee and other costs or damages assessed shall be payable quarterly to the City of Clinton. The grantee shall file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross revenue within the city during the period for which said quarterly payment is made, and said payment shall be made to the city not later than forty-five (45) days after the expiration of each calendar quarter. Quarterly computation dates are the last day in the months of March, June, September, and December. 
(6)  The city shall have the right to inspect the grantee's income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this article. Audits may be conducted no more than once a year and shall be at the expense of the grantor. In the event the auditor finds errors or omissions, the grantee shall bear the expense of the audit. Any additional amount due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the grantee by the city, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. 
(p)  Forfeiture or revocation. 
(1)  Grounds for revocation. Following procedures set forth in subsection 7.5-24(p)(4) below, the city reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach under the ordinances and the franchise grant: 
a.  If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of the material obligations under this article or under such documents, contracts and other terms and provisions entered into by and between the city and the grantee. 
b.  If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and effect the liability and indemnification coverage as required herein. 
c.  If the grantee shall violate any orders or rulings of any regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to this ordinance or the franchise and, after notice thereof, shall continue the violation and not commence a resolution of the same within thirty (30) days. 
d.  If the grantee knowingly attempts to evade any of the provisions of this article of the franchise or knowingly practices any fraud or deceit upon the city or cable subscribers. 
e.  The grantee's construction schedule is delayed later than the schedule contained in the franchise or beyond any extended date set by the city. 
f.  The grantee becomes insolvent, unable or unwilling to pay its debts or is adjudged bankrupt. 
g.  Failure to restore service on any or all channels after forty-eight (48) consecutive hours of interrupted service, except when approval of such interruption is obtained from the city. 
h.  Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or negotiation of the franchise or any extension or renewal thereof. 
i.  If the grantee completely ceases to provide services for any reason within the control of the grantee over the communications system. 
j.  Material failure to provide the subscribers or users with adequate service as provided in the franchise. 
(2)  Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee. The grantee shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this article in any case, in which performance of any such provision is prevented for reasons beyond the grantee's control. A fault shall not be deemed to be beyond the grantee's control if committed by a corporation or other business entity in which the grantee holds a controlling interest whether held directly or indirectly, or any of the grantee's subcontractors. 
(3)  Except where court or regulatory body overrides, pending litigation or appeal to any regulatory body or court having jurisdiction over the grantee shall not excuse the grantee from the performance of its obligations under this article. Failure of the grantee to perform such obligations because of pending litigation or petition may result in forfeiture or revocation pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(4)  Procedure prior to revocation. 
a.  The city shall make written demand that the grantee comply with any such retirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues without just cause for a period of ten (10) days following such written demand, the city shall place its request for termination of the franchise upon a regular council meeting agenda. The city shall cause to be served upon such grantee at least seven (7) days prior to the date of such council meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by the city clerk at least once, seven (7) days before such meeting in a newspaper or general circulation within the city. 
b.  The council shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall determine in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause. 
c.  If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause, as reasonably defined by the city, the council shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon terms and conditions as are reasonable. 
d.  If the council shall determine such failure, refusal, or neglect by the grantee was without just cause, then the council shall, by resolution, declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be terminated unless there be compliance by the grantee within ninety (90) days. 
(5)  Disposition of facilities. In the event a franchise expires, is revoked or otherwise terminated, and is not renewed, the city may, in its sole discretion, do any of the following: 
a.  Purchase the system under the procedures set forth in subsection 7.5-24(u); 
b.  Effect a transfer of ownership of the system to another party; 
c.  Order the removal of the system facilities from the city within a reasonable period of time as determined by the city or require the original grantee to maintain and operate its system for a period of twelve (12) months or until such further time as mutually agree upon. 
(6)  Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures, and equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good a condition or better than that prevailing prior to grantee's removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting the electrical or telephone cable wires or attachments. The city shall inspect and approve the condition of the public ways and public places, and cables, wires, attachments and poles after removal. The liability, indemnity, insurance and performance bond as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this paragraph, this article and the franchise. 
(7)  Restoration by city; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a failure by the grantee to complete any work required by subsections 7.5-24(c), (e) and/or (f) above, or any other work required by city law or ordinance within the time as may be established and to the satisfaction of the city, the city may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall reimburse the city the cost thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the city may recover such costs through the performance bond provided by grantee. The city shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section. 
(8)  Extended operation. Upon either the expiration or revocation of a franchise, and absent franchise renewal, the city may require the grantee to continue to operate the system for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of such expiration or revocation, or until such time as is mutually agreed upon. The grantee shall continue to operate the cable communications system under the terms and condition of this article and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at the time. The city shall be permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section. 
(q)  Receivership and foreclosure. 
(1)  Termination by Insolvency. The franchise granted hereunder shall, at the option of the city, cease and terminate one hundred twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take over and conduct the business of the grantee whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred twenty (120) days, or unless: 
a.  Such receivers or trustees shall have, within one hundred twenty (120) days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this article and the franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receiver or trustees within said one hundred twenty (120) days shall have remedied all defaults under the franchise; and 
b.  Such receivers, or trustees shall, within said one hundred twenty (120) days, execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction of the premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise herein granted. 
(2)  Termination by judicial action. In case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee or any part hereof, including or excluding the franchise, the city may serve notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee granted hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty (30) days after service of such notice, unless: 
a.  The city shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, in the manner this article provides, and 
b.  Such successful bidder shall have covenant and agree with the city to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise. 
(r)  Equal opportunity policy. 
(1)  Equal opportunity employment shall be afforded by all operators of communication systems to all qualified persons, and no person shall be discriminated against in employment because of race, color, religion, age, national origin, sex, or physical handicap. Grantee shall comply with all equal opportunity provisions enacted by federal, state, local authorities, as well as, such provisions contained in this article and the franchise. 
(2)  Local employment and procurement practices. Whenever reasonably possible, services, personnel, hardware and supplies for the construction, maintenance and operation of the system shall be procured locally. 
(s)  Notices. All notices from grantee to the city pursuant to this article and the franchise shall be to the city manager or his/her designee. Grantee shall maintain with the city throughout the term of the franchise, an address for service of notices by mail. Grantee shall also maintain with the city a local office and telephone number for the conduct of matters related to the franchise during normal business hours. The grantee shall be required to advise the city of such address(es) and telephone numbers and any change thereof. 
(t)  Failure to city to enforce this franchise, no waiver of the terms thereof. The grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of the terms and conditions of this ordinance or the franchise by any failure of the city upon any more occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with any such terms or conditions. 
(u)  Rights reserved to the grantor. 
(1)  Right to purchase of the system by the city. 
a.  Right to purchase. In the event the grantee defaults under this article or the franchise and the city terminates the franchise pursuant to provisions of this article, or upon the normal expiration of the franchise term absent a franchise renewal, or in the event that the city elects to exercise its right to purchase the system pursuant to the provisions of subsection 7.5-24(l), then the city shall have the right, directly or through an intermediary, to purchase the franchised cable communications system. The purchase price shall be based upon the fair market value of the system and, when applicable, the value of the franchise as determined pursuant to this section. 
b.  Date of valuation. The date of valuation shall be no earlier than the day following the date of expiration or termination and no later than the date the city makes a fair and reasonable offer for the system or the date of transfer of ownership, whichever occurs first. 
c.  System valuation. Except in connection with a purchase pursuant to subsection 7.5-24(l), the value of the cable system shall be determined by a qualified appraiser appointed by the city. The appraiser shall determine the fair market value. Under no circumstances shall the value under this subsection be less than the book value of the assets less book basis accumulated depreciation. If the franchise is terminated or not renewed, no value shall be assigned to either the franchise or any right, privilege or expectancy arising to the grantee out of the right to transact business under the franchise, and particularly no value shall be allowed for any increase in value arising out of any expectation or cable communications system's revenues beyond the forfeiture and termination date or expiration date, whichever is sooner. 
d.  Intent to purchase. Except in connection with a purchase pursuant to subsection 7.5-24(l), upon receipt of notice of the city's intent to purchase the system at the value established above, the grantee shall have thirty (30) days within which to accept that valuation as the purchase price of the system. In the event that purchase price is not acceptable, the parties shall have one hundred twenty (120) days in which to negotiate an acceptable purchase price. 
e.  Transfer to city. Upon exercise of this option, and the payment of the agreed upon sum by the city and its service of official notice of such action upon the grantee, the grantee shall immediately transfer to the city possession and title to all facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable communications system, free from all liens and encumbrances not agreed to be assumed by the city in lieu of some portion of the purchase price set forth above; and the grantee shall execute such warranty, deeds or other instruments of conveyance to the city as shall be necessary for this purpose. 
f.  Arbitration. In the event the city and grantee are unable to agree upon the value of the cable communications system within the time limits set forth above, either party may require by written notice to the other that the value of cable communications system be submitted to arbitration in the following manner: 
1.  The city and the grantee shall each within fifteen (15) days after such written notice select an arbitrator who shall be a disinterested person with reasonable knowledge and experience relative to the subject to be arbitrated. The two (2) arbitrators thus selected shall immediately thereafter select a third arbitrator who shall likewise be a disinterested person having reasonable knowledge and experience relative to the subject to be arbitrated. 
2.  Within thirty (30) days after appointment of all arbitrators and upon ten (10) days written notice to the parties, the panel of arbitrators shall commence a hearing on the issue of valuation and shall receive all relevant information from the parties. 
3.  The hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the request of either party. All hearing proceedings, debate and deliberations shall be open to the public and at such times and places as contained in the notice or as thereafter publicly stated, except that if two (2) arbitrators agree, debate and deliberations may be held in closed session. 
4.  The value of the system as determined by the arbitration panel shall be the fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern. In the case of a transfer, the value of the system as determined by the arbitration panel shall be the fair market value. Under no circumstances shall the value established by the arbitration panel be less than the net book value of the assets nor in the case of a terminated or revoked franchise greater than the current replacement costs of the system as determined by the appraiser appointed under subsection 7.5-24(u)(1)c. 
5.  Within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing, the panel of arbitrators shall prepare findings and reach a decision agreed upon by a majority of the panel which shall be filed with the city and served by mail upon the grantee. The decision of the panel regarding the value of the system shall be final and binding upon the parties. Should there be no majority decision, the proceedings shall become null and void and shall be started anew, unless the parties extend by mutual agreement the time which the panel of arbitrators has to make a decision. 
6.  Either party may seek judicial relief in the following circumstances: 
(i)  A party fails to select an arbitrator; 
(ii)  The arbitrators fail to select a third arbitrator; 
(iii)  One or more arbitrators is unqualified; 
(iv)  Designated time limits have been exceeded; 
(v)  The panel has not proceeded expeditiously; 
(vi)  The decision was procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; 
(vii)  There was evident partiality on the part of one or more of the arbitrators; 
(viii)  The arbitrator panel exceeded its authority hereunder; 
(ix)  Based upon the record, the panel abused its discretion. 
7.  In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines that judicial relief is appropriate to the circumstances set forth above, the court in its discretion may order the arbitration procedure repeated and issue findings, orders and directions. 
8.  The expenses of the arbitrators shall be borne by the parties, and the expenses of the third arbitrator and those expenses incurred by the panel as a whole shall be borne equally by the parties. 
g.  Notification. Upon receipt of the decision of the arbitration panel, the city shall have thirty (30) days in which to notify the grantee of its intent to exercise its option to purchase the system. The purchase price shall be the value of the system as determined by the arbitration panel. 
(2)  Right of inspection of records. The city shall have the right to inspect all books, records, reports, maps, plans, financial statements, other like materials of the grantee, at any time during normal business hours. Grantee shall provide such information in such form as may be reasonably required by the city of said records. 
(3)  Right of inspection of construction. The city shall have the right to inspect all construction or installation work performed subject to the provisions of the franchise and to make such tests as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this article and other pertinent provisions of the law. 
(4)  Right of inspection of property. At all reasonable times, grantee shall permit examination by any duly authorized representative of the city, of system facilities, together with any appurtenant property of grantee situated within or without the city. 
(5)  Right of intervention. The city shall have the right of intervention in any suit or proceeding to which the grantee is party, and the grantee shall not oppose such intervention by the city. 
(6)  Right to require removal of property. Upon denial of renewal of this article or the franchise, or upon its revocation or expiration, as provided for herein, the city shall have the right to require the grantee to remove, at its own expense, all portions of the communications system required by public necessity from all streets and public ways within the city. 
(7)  Expense reimbursement to city. On request of the city and consistent with federal law, the grantee shall pay the city a sum of money which will reimburse all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with preparation of this article, the franchise agreements with the granting, extending, or renewing a franchise, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees, publication fees, and other direct costs, all, as may be specified in franchise agreement provided, however, that the city shall submit a detailed schedule of all such costs. Such payment shall be made within thirty (30) days after the city furnishes the grantee with a written statement of such expenses. 
(v)  No recourse against the grantor. The grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the city or its officials, boards, commissions, agents, or employees for any loss costs, expenses or damage arising out of any provision or requirements of the franchise or because of the legal enforcement of this ordinance or the franchise.

Sec. 7.5-25. - Regulations of franchise. 
(a)  Regulatory authority. 
(1)  The city shall exercise appropriate regulatory authority under the provisions of this article and applicable law. This authority shall be vested in the city council and administered through the city manager or his designee in order to provide day-to-day administration and enforcement of the provisions of this article and any franchise granted hereunder, and to carry out the city's responsibilities with regard to communications. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article to the contrary, the grantee shall at all times comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the local, state and federal government. In the event that any actions of the state or federal government or any agency thereof, or any court of competent jurisdiction upon final adjudication, substantially reduce in any way the power or authority of the city under this article or the franchise, or if in compliance with any local, state or federal regulation, the grantee finds conflict with the terms of the article, the franchise, or any law or regulation of the city then within a reasonable amount of time following knowledge thereof, the grantee shall notify the city of the point of conflict believed to exist between such law or regulation and the laws or regulations of the city, this article and the franchise. The city, at its option, may notify the grantee that it wishes to negotiate those provisions which are affected in any way by such modification in regulations or statutory authority. Thereafter, the grantee shall negotiate in good faith with the city in attempting to develop alternate provisions which shall fairly restore the city to the maximum level of authority and power permitted by law. 
(3)  The city reserves the right to exercise the maximum plenary authority, as may at any time be lawfully permissible, to regulate the communications system, the franchise and the grantee. Should applicable legislative, judicial or regulatory authorities at any time permit regulation not presently permitted to the city, the city may, following good faith negotiation and agreement with the grantee, engage in any such additional regulation as may then be permissible, whether or not contemplated by this article or the franchise fees, taxes, programming, rates charged to subscribers and users, consumer protection, or any other similar or dissimilar matter.

g.  Monitor grantee's process for handling citizen complaints and periodically inspect and analyze the records related to such complaints. 
h.  Receive applications for rate increases if applicable and provide staff assistance in the analysis and recommendations thereto. 
i.  Monitor grantee's adherence to operational standards, service requirements and line extension policies.

(c)  Rates and charges. 
(1)  Grantee shall file with the city schedules which shall describe all services offered, all rates and charges of any kind, and all terms and conditions relating thereto. No rates or charges shall be effective except as they appear on a schedule so filed. Grantee shall notify subscribers in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the implementation of any change in services offered, rates, charges, or terms and conditions related thereto. The city is to be notified of such changes at least forty-five (45) days prior. 
(2)  Grantee shall establish rates that are nondiscriminatory with the same general class of subscribers which must be applied fairly and uniformly to all subscribers in the franchise area for all services with the exception of bona fide credit risks.

Sec. 7.5-26. - Bonds, insurance, and indemnifications. 
(a)  Faithful performance bond and construction bond. 
(1)  Faithful performance bond. The franchisee shall, concurrently with its acceptance of this franchise, file with the city manager and at all times thereafter maintain in full force and effect for the term of this franchise or any renewal thereof, at franchisee's sole expense, a corporate surety bond in a responsible company licensed to do business in North Carolina and approved by the city, in the full amount set forth in the franchise renewable annually, and conditioned upon the faithful performance of the franchisee, and in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance and upon the further condition that in the event franchisee, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, shall fail to comply with any one or more of the material provisions of the franchise, there shall be recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety of such bond any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result thereof, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the franchisee as prescribed hereby, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond, said condition to be a continuing obligation for the duration of the franchise and any renewal thereof and thereafter until the franchisee has liquidated all of its obligations with the city that may have risen from the acceptance of this franchise or renewal by the franchisee or from its exercise of any privileges or rights herein granted. The bond shall provide that at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of intention not to renew, or of cancellation, or material change be given to the city by filing the same with the city manager. Notwithstanding the above provisions of this subsection, the city council may in its sole discretion waive the said bond or reduce the required amount thereof after six and one-half (61/2) years of operation of a system under the franchise, by the franchisee, its successors or assigns, which in the sole opinion of the city council, has been satisfactory. The waiving of the bond for any particular year shall not prevent the city council from reimposing the bond requirement up to the amount authorized in the franchise prior to the annual renewal thereof. Failure to keep a performance bond in force at all times as herein provided and to file with the city manager all renewals thereof shall constitute an event of default. 
(2)  Deposit in lieu of bond. In lieu of the performance bond by a surety company as herein provided, the franchisee may file and deposit with the city a performance bond without a corporate surety but secured by a certificate of deposit in some bank or savings and loan association in the City of Clinton, North Carolina, in the same amount as the bond conditioned in the same manner as the performance bond of a surety company hereinbefore described. The income from such deposit shall be payable to the franchisee. As an alternative, the franchisee may provide such other security as may be approved by the city council, but absent such approval it shall provide a bond deposit in lieu thereof as above provided. 
(3)  Construction performance bond. Franchisee shall maintain a construction performance bond in a form approved by the city in the amount provided in the franchise to insure the city that franchisee will faithfully complete all construction plans required by the franchise agreement. 
The franchisee shall file with the city manager and at all times thereafter maintain in full force and effect for the periods set forth in the franchise, at franchisee's sole expense, a corporate surety bond in a responsible company licensed to do business in North Carolina and approved by the city, in the full amount set forth in the franchise and conditioned upon the faithful performance of its construction obligations by the franchisee, and in accordance with provisions of this article and upon the further condition that in the event franchisee, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, shall fail to comply with any one or more of the material construction provisions of the franchise, there shall be recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety of such bond any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result thereof, including the cost of completion of the construction as prescribed hereby, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees and costs up to the full amount of the bond, said condition to be a continuing obligation for the duration of the construction period and thereafter until the franchisee has completed all of its obligations that may have arisen from said construction provisions under the franchise agreement. The bond shall provide that at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of intention not to renew, or of cancellation, or material change, be given to the city by filing the same with the city manager. Failure to keep a construction bond in force at all times as herein and in the franchise agreement provided, and to file with the city manager all renewals thereof, shall constitute an event of default. 
(4)  Conditions. The performance shall provide the following conditions: 
a.  There shall be recoverable by the city jointly and severally from the principal and surety, and all fines and liquidated damages due to the city and any and all damages, losses, costs, and expenses suffered or incurred by the city resulting from the failure of the grantee to: faithfully comply with the material provisions of this article and the franchise; comply with all orders, permits, and directives of any city agency or body having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults; pay fees due to the city; pay any claims, liens or taxes due to the city which arise by reason of the construction, operation, maintenance or repair of the cable system. Such losses, costs and expenses shall include, but not be limited to, reasonable attorney's fees and other associated expenses. 
b.  The total amount of the bond shall be forfeited in favor of the city in the event: 
1.  The grantee abandons the cable system at any time during the term of the franchise or any extension thereto; or 
2.  The grantee assigns the franchise without the express written consent of the city; or 
3.  The grantee fails to renew the performance bond or construction bond as required herein and in accordance with the terms of the franchise. 
(5)  Reduction of bond. Subject to the provisions of subsection 7.5-26(a)(1), upon written application by the grantee, the city may, at its sole option, permit the amount of the bond to be reduced or waive the requirements for a performance bond. Reductions granted or denied upon application by the grantee shall be without prejudice to the grantee's subsequent applications or to the city's right to require the full bond at any time thereafter. However, no application shall be made by the grantee within one (1) year of any prior application. 
(6)  Use of performance bond. Prior to filing a claim upon the performance bond for the purposes described in this section, the city shall demand that the grantee perform its obligations, and the grantee shall have ten (10) days from receipt of such written notice to make full and complete payment. If the grantee does not make-the payment within ten (10) days, the city may claim the amount thereof, with interest and penalties, from the performance bond. 
(7)  Replenishment of performance bond. No later than thirty (30) days after any reduction of any amount of the performance bond, the grantee shall replenish the performance bond in an amount equal to the amount withdrawn. Failure to make timely replenishment of such amount to the performance bond shall constitute a substantial violation of this article. 
(8)  Non-Renewal, alteration or cancellation of performance bond. The performance bond required herein shall be in a form satisfactory to the city and shall require thirty (30) days written notice of any non-renewal, alteration or cancellation to both the city and the grantee.

(9)  To offset the effects of inflation, the amount of the bonds provided for herein are subject to reasonable increases at the end of the three (3) year period of the franchise, applicable to the next three year period, upon the determination of the city. 
(b)  Insurance.

Failure to furnish said certificates of insurance in a timely manner shall constitute a violation of this article. 
(2)  Grantee shall furnish the city with a certificate as the evidence of insurance coverage required by these provisions. The certificate shall include a thirty (30) day notification to the city in the event of cancellation, exhaustion of policy aggregates, non-renewal or reduction of coverage of policy limits. Language on the certificate that relieves the insurance company and its agents from liability for failure to provide such notice shall be deleted. The endorsement required by subsection 7.5-26(4) of these provisions shall be attached to the certificate. 
The city reserves the right to require a complete, certified copy of the required insurance policy, at any time. Grantee shall provide certificates annually after renewal of coverages.

The purpose of this section is to protect juveniles from victimization and exposure to criminal activity by establishing a curfew for persons under the age of eighteen (18) years in the City of Clinton. The Youth Protection Ordinance is intended to promote the health, safety and welfare of both juveniles and adults by creating an environment providing better protection and security for all concerned. The purpose is also to define the duties of parents or guardians and operators of business establishments and protect minors from improper influences and criminal activity that occurs after the curfew hour. 
(Ord. No. 4.2.02, § (a), 4-2-2002; Ord. No. 08.02.01, 2-6-2008)

    Except as provided by section 16-24, the following offenses constitute a violation of this section: 
(1)  A person under the age of eighteen (18) years shall be in violation of this section if he or she shall remain at anytime in a group of four (4) or more individuals in or upon any public place or establishment within the city.

(4)  A parent or guardian of a juvenile shall be in violation of this section if he knowingly permits, and/or by inadequate supervision, allows the juvenile to remain on the premises of any establishment or in any public place within the city during the restricted hours. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a juvenile in that parent's legal custody. This requirement is intended to hold a neglectful or carless parent up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such juvenile. 
(5)  It shall be a violation of this section for a parent or guardian of a juvenile to refuse to take custody of the juvenile during the restricted hours. 
(6)  The owners, operator, or any employee of an establishment shall be in violation to this section if he knowingly allows a juvenile to remain upon the premises of the establishment during the restricted hours.

(c)  Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide that the police officer may deliver to a parent or guardian thereof a juvenile under appropriate circumstances; for example, a juvenile of tender age, near home, whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or are known. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, when: (1) a juvenile has received one (1) previous written warning for violation of this article; or (2) a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the juvenile has engaged in delinquent conduct, the procedure shall then be to take the juvenile to the police station where a parent or guardian shall immediately be notified to come for the juvenile whereupon the parent or guardian and the juvenile shall be questioned. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the person designated there and then on duty for an accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus, making available experienced personnel and access to information and records. 
(e)  When a parent or guardian, immediately called, has come to take charge of the juvenile, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the juvenile shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the juvenile, then the juvenile shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the juvenile may temporarily be entrusted to an adult, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent or guardian assume the responsibility of caring for a juvenile pending the availability or arrival of a parent or guardian.

(a)  A juvenile who violates any provision of this section is subject to being adjudicated delinquent. The court may, in its discretion, impose any dispositional alternative(s) that are provided in the North Carolina Juvenile Code for any juvenile who is delinquent. 
(b)  Any person other than a juvenile who violates any provision of this section may be guilty of a misdemeanor and may be subject to a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the first offense, and for each subsequent offense the fine shall be increased by an additional one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). For example, for the second offense the fine shall be two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), for the third offense four hundred dollars ($400.00), and imprisonment in the discretion of the court in accordance with G.S. 14-4.

(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges into the municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants and wastewater discharges into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into any waters of the state or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
(3)  To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludges from the municipal system; 
(4)  To protect both municipal personnel who may be affected by sewage, sludge, and effluent in the course of their employment as well as protecting the general public; 
(5)  To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the municipal wastewater system; and 
(6)  To ensure that the municipality complies with its NPDES or non-discharge permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other federal or state laws to which the municipal wastewater system is subject. 
    This article provides for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the municipal wastewater system, through the issuance of permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user reporting and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. 
    This article shall apply to all users of the municipal wastewater system, as authorized by G.S. 160A-312 and/or 153A-275. The city shall designate an administrator of the publicly owned treatment works or POTW and pretreatment program hereafter referred to as the POTW director. Except as otherwise provided herein, the POTW director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. Any powers granted to or imposed upon the POTW director may be delegated by the POTW director to other city personnel. 
    By discharging wastewater into the City of Clinton municipal wastewater system, industrial users located outside the city limits agree to comply with the terms and conditions established in this article, as well as any permits, enforcement actions, or orders issued hereunder.

Users found to be in violation of the one hundred (100) mg/L discharge limit will be notified within thirty (30) days of receipt of data, and are subject to the enforcement provisions [of] division 8 of this article and the City of Clinton Enforcement Response Plan. 
(3)  [ Maintenance. ] Regularly scheduled maintenance of grease-handling facilities and equipment is required to ensure adequate operation. 
a.  All maintenance and cleaning of interceptors is performed at the expense of the user. 
b.  The exclusive use of enzymes, emulsifiers, etc., is not considered an acceptable grease interceptor maintenance practice. 
c.  On-site grease interceptor cleaning may only be performed by a user if the user or the user's contract service provider is permitted by the North Carolina Division of Waste Management as a septage management firm or service provider. 
d.  In the maintaining of these interceptors, the user shall be ultimately responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured materials. Any removal and hauling of collected materials shall be performed according to applicable state, federal and local regulations. 
e.  All outdoor grease interceptors are required to be completely pumped out and cleaned at a minimum frequency of once per sixty (60) calendar days, except that users may be required to perform maintenance on a more frequent basis should inspection or discharge analysis per subsection (2) above reveal violations, or in any case in which the 60-day interval is not sufficient to prevent sanitary sewer overflows or blockages due to contribution of FOG into the collection system. 
f.  All under the sink grease interceptors are required to be completely cleaned out at a minimum frequency of once per thirty (30) calendar days, except that users may be required to perform maintenance on a more frequent basis should inspection or discharge analysis per subsection (2) above reveal violations, or in any case in which the 30-day interval is not sufficient to prevent sanitary sewer overflows or blockages due to contribution of FOG into the collection system. 
g.  Unless a pretreatment permit is issued specifically for a FOG generating facility under section 22-122, records shall be maintained on site where the grease interceptor is located for a period of at least three (3) years. All such records will be available for inspection by the city upon request. These records shall include, at a minimum: 
1.  User name and physical location. 
2.  Date and time of grease interceptor service. 
3.  Name and signature of grease interceptor service company agent performing said service. 
4.  Number and size of each grease interceptor serviced at physical location.

h.  The user shall be responsible for ensuring that no waste or wastewater pumped from the grease interceptor is reintroduced back into the device. 
i.  Any user whose operations cause or allow excessive grease to discharge or accumulate in the City of Clinton collection system may be liable to the City of Clinton for costs related to line blockages, line cleanings, line and pump repairs, etc., including all labor, materials and equipment. Users that fail to pay the related charges will be subject to enforcement provisions in the City of Clinton Enforcement Response Plan. 
j.  Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials, such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle into this solids blanket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the grease interceptor. 
(4)  Standards for new FOG generating facilities. 
a.  Unless otherwise approved by the POTW director, all new FOG generating facilities shall be required to install an adequately sized grease interceptor which will ensure a minimum hydraulic retention time of twenty-four (24) minutes at actual peak flow between the influent and effluent baffles, with twenty-five (25) percent of the total volume of the grease interceptor being allowed for any solids to settle or accumulate and floatable grease-derived materials to rise and accumulate. 
b.  No new FOG generating establishment will be allowed to discharge wastewater to the city's collection system until an adequately sized grease interceptor is installed and approved by the POTW director. 
c.  All grease interceptors must have each chamber directly accessible from the surface for servicing and maintaining the interceptor.

DIVISION 3. - FEES 

Sec. 22-111. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the recovery of costs from users of the wastewater disposal system of the city for the implementation of the program established herein. The applicable charges or fees shall be set forth in a schedule of sewer use charges and fees by the POTW director and approved by the city council. A copy of these charges and fees will be made available from the POTW director. 
(Ord. No. 2013.03.07, 3-5-2013) 
Sec. 22-112. - User charges. 
    A user charge shall be levied on all users, including, but not limited to, persons, firms, corporations or governmental entities that discharge, cause or permit the discharge of sewage into the POTW. 
(1)  Authority. Pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 92-500 Section 240 (b) and subsequent amendments to it, the city, having received EPA financial assistance for the construction of treatment works, shall adopt a system of charges to assure each user pays a share of the cost of debt service, operation and maintenance (including replacement) of the POTW, and annual administration. 
(2)  Intent. The intent of such user charges is to equitably distribute the cost of administration, operation, and maintenance of the POTW to each user proportional to the amount of wastewater treatment service each user receives; and to promote self-sufficiency of the POTW with respect to administration, operation, and maintenance costs. 
(3)  User class. Each user shall be charged a share of the treatment works operation and maintenance cost based on the measured proportional contribution to the treatment works loading. Generally, the user charge will be dependent upon the volume of flow insofar as BOD, COD, TSS and other pollutant contributions discharged by all users are approximately equal. Where such pollutants exceed the range of concentration of these pollutants in normal domestic sewage, a surcharge will be added to the base charge as stipulated in section 22-113. The models used in calculating the user charge are defined in subsection 22-113(d). 
(4)  User charge criteria. The user charge system shall be approved by the regional administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and shall be maintained by the city in accordance with the following requirements: 
a.  The user charge system must result in the distribution of the cost of operation and maintenance of treatment works within the city jurisdiction to each user (or user class) in proportion to such user's contribution to the total wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the basis for the user's contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs to each user (or user class). 
b.  The user charge system must generate sufficient revenue to offset the cost of all treatment works operation and maintenance provided by the city. 
(5)  [ Annual review. ] The city manager shall review annually the sewage contributions of users, the total costs of debt service, operation and maintenance of the POTW and will make recommendations to the city council for adjustments in the schedule of charges and fees as necessary. 
(6)  [ Distribution of charges. ] Charges for flow to the POTW not directly attributable to the users shall be distributed among all users of the POTW based upon the volume of flow of the users. 
(Ord. No. 2013.03.07, 3-5-2013) 
Sec. 22-113. - Surcharges. 
    The amount of the surcharges will be based upon the volume of flow and the character and concentration of the constituents of the wastewater: 
(1)  The volume of flow used in determining the total discharge of wastewater for payment of user charges and surcharges shall be based on the following: 
a.  Metered water consumption as shown in the records of meter readings maintained by the city; or 
b.  If required by the city or at the individual dischargers option, other flow monitoring devices which measure the actual volume of wastewater discharged to the sewer. Such devices shall be accessible and safely located, and the measuring system shall be installed in accordance with plans approved by the city. The metering system shall be installed and maintained at the user's expense according to arrangements that may be made with the city. 
c.  Where any user procures all or part of his water supply from sources other than the city, the user shall install and maintain, at user expense, a flow measuring device of a type approved by the city. 
(2)  The character and concentration of the constituents of the wastewater used in determining surcharges shall be determined by samples collected and analyzed by the city or POTW director approved industrial user utilizing a state certified laboratory. Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the actual discharge and shall be analyzed using procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 136. 
(3)  The determination of the character and concentration of the constituents of the wastewater discharge by the director or his duly appointed representatives shall be binding as a basis for charges. 
(4)  The Model User Charge System adopted by the city shall result in the equitable distribution of annual treatment works administration, operation, and maintenance costs to each user (or user class) in approximate proportion to each user's (or user class') contribution towards the total wastewater loading of the treatment works. The following user charge models shall be used for this purpose. The symbols used in the models are as defined below: 
C f = Total fixed operation and maintenance (O&M) costs per unit of time. C t = Total variable operation and maintenance (O&M) costs per unit of time. C u = A user's charge for O&M per unit of time. C s = A surcharge for wastewaters of excessive strength. V u = Volume contribution from a user per unit of time. V t = Total volume contribution from all users per unit of time. B c = O&M cost for treatment of a unit of biological oxygen demand (BOD). B = Contribution of BOD from a user above a base level. S c = O&M cost for treatment of a unit of suspended solids (SS). S = Contribution of SS from a user above a base level. N c = O&M cost for treatment of a unit of ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 N). N = Contribution of NH 3 N from a user above a base level. P c = O&M cost for treatment of a unit of any pollutant having identifiable contributions to overall treatment costs. P = Concentration of a pollutant from a user above a base level.  
a.  Model No. 1: Whereas the treatment works is primarily flow dependent as the BOD, SS, and other pollutant concentrations discharged by the majority of users are approximately equal; therefore, the user charge will be developed on a volume basis in accordance with the model below: 

b.  Model No. 2: When determined by the city that BOD, COD, TSS, NH 3 N and any other appropriate pollutant concentrations from a user exceeds the range of concentration of these pollutants typically found in normal domestic sewage, a surcharge shall be levied in addition to the base sewer use charge. The surcharge shall be computed by the model below: 

(5)  Baseline pollutant concentrations shall be BOD - 250 mg/L, TSS - 250 mg/L, and NH3N - 25 mg/L or as established by the director and held as a standard for the city. 
(6)  Model No. 1 shall include all costs for operation and maintenance associated with extraneous flows not attributable to any one (1) user or user class, thereby distributing these costs to all users. 
(7)  User charges may be established bases on a percentage of the charge for water usage. However, the unit rate sewer charge for the largest volume users must be as great as or greater than the unit cost of operation and maintenance (excluding debt service). In any event, a surcharge shall still be levied in accordance with the provisions of Model No. 2 above. The system of user charges for the wastewater treatment system shall be based on total annual system costs, including operation and maintenance expenses. 
(8)  Each user shall be notified no less often than annually of the rates for user charges. Such notification shall be done in conjunction with a regular bill, and, if the regular bill also includes charges for other services, shall clearly identify the portion of the bill attributable to wastewater user charges. 
(9)  The user charge system shall take precedence over any terms or conditions of any contracts or agreements that are inconsistent with section 204(b)(1)(a) of the Clean Water Act ("the Act" as defined by this article). 
(Ord. No. 2013.03.07, 3-5-2013) 
Sec. 22-114. - Pretreatment program administration charges. 
    The POTW director has reserved the authority to establish a schedule of charges and fees for the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating and administering the required local pretreatment program in conjunction with 40 CFR 403. The schedule of charges and fees adopted by the city may include charges and fees for: 
(1)  Reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the pretreatment program; 
(2)  Monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures; 
(3)  Reviewing slug control plans, including accidental and/or slug load discharge procedures and construction plans and specifications; 
(4)  Permitting; 
(5)  Labor and material used for enforcement actions; 
(6)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements of the pretreatment program.

Sec. 22-139. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
    The city prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification to and approval by the POTW director. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days before the discharge commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written approval from the city. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 22-135 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 22-131, 22-132 and 22-134 of this article. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW director, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued hereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

Sec. 22-141. - Grab and composite sample collection. 
(a)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facilities in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(b)  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and any other pollutants as required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the number of grabs necessary to be representative of the user's discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) for additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90-day compliance reports. Additionally, the POTW director may allow the collection of multiple grabs during a 24-hour period which are composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136. 
(c)  Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a minimum of hourly aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW director. When authorizing time-proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented.

DIVISION 8. - ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 22-161. - Administrative remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW director finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this article, wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained therein or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW director may serve upon such a person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within thirty (30) days from the date of this notice, an explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The city manager is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection (d), below. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The city manager may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge, has violated this article or is in noncompliance with a wastewater discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the event the city manager determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
    The city manager shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and determine whether the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. 
    A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil penalty under section 22-162 nor is any action or inaction taken by the city manager under this section subject to an administrative appeal under division 10 of this article. 
(d)  Administrative orders. When the city manager finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article, permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement the city manager may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(2)  Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set forth in the order; 
(3)  Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation; 
(4)  Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated within a specified time period. 
(e)  Emergency suspensions. The city manager may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit. 
    Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within fifteen (15) days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager shall reinstate the wastewater permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the city manager prior to the date of the above-described hearing. 
(f)  Termination of permit or permission to discharge. The city manager may revoke a wastewater discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons: 
(1)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
(2)  Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
(3)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or 
(4)  Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to discharge, conditions of this article, or any applicable state and federal regulations.

ARTICLE VI. - WATER SHORTAGE RESPONSE PLAN[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2010.12.01, adopted Dec. 7, 2010, amended Art. VI in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. VI, §§ 22-201-22-205, pertained to the same subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 04.01.05, adopted Jan. 6, 2004 and Ord. No. 2009.06.10, adopted June 23, 2009. 

Sec. 22-201. - Introduction. 
    The procedures herein are written to reduce potable water demand and supplement existing drinking water supplies whenever existing water supply sources are inadequate to meet current demands for potable water. 
(Ord. No. 2010.12.01, 12-7-2010) 
Sec. 22-202. - Authorization. 
    The Clinton City Manager shall enact the following water shortage response provisions whenever the trigger conditions outlined in section 22-205 are met. In his absence, the public works director will assume this role. 
(Ord. No. 2010.12.01, 12-7-2010) 
Sec. 22-203. - Notification. 
    The following notification methods will be used to inform water system employees and customers of a water shortage declaration: employee e-mail announcements, notices at municipal buildings, notices in water bills. Required water shortage response measures will be communicated through a newspaper with general circulation in Clinton, PSA announcements on local radio and cable stations and the city's website (http://www.cityofclintonnc.us). Declaration of emergency water restrictions or water rationing will be communicated to all customers by telephone. 
(Ord. No. 2010.12.01, 12-7-2010) 
Sec. 22-204. - Levels of response. 
    Five (5) levels of water shortage response are outlined in the table below. The five (5) levels of water shortage response are: voluntary reductions, mandatory reductions I and II, emergency reductions and water rationing. A detailed description of each response level and corresponding water reduction measures follow below: 
Stage Response Description 1 Voluntary 
Reductions Water users are encouraged to reduce their water use and improve water use efficiency; however, no penalties apply for noncompliance. Water supply conditions indicate a potential for shortage. 2 Mandatory 
Reductions I Water users must abide required water use reduction and efficiency measures; penalties apply for noncompliance. Water supply conditions are significantly lower than the seasonal norm and water shortage conditions are expected to persist. 3 Mandatory 
Reductions II Same as in Stage 2 4 Emergency 
Reductions Water supply conditions are substantially diminished and pose an imminent threat to human health or environmental integrity. 5 Water 
Rationing Water supply conditions are substantially diminished and remaining supplies must be allocated to preserve human health and environmental integrity.  
    In Stage 1, Voluntary Reductions, all water users will be asked to reduce their normal water use by five (5) percent. Customer education and outreach programs will encourage water conservation and efficiency measures including: irrigating landscapes a maximum of one (1) inch per week; preventing water waste, runoff and watering impervious surfaces; watering plants deeply to encourage root growth; washing only full loads in clothes and dishwashers; using spring-loaded nozzles on garden hoses; and identifying and repairing all water leaks. 
    In Stage 2, Mandatory Reductions I, all customers are expected to reduce their water use by ten (10) percent in comparison to their previous month's water bill. In addition to continuing to encourage all voluntary reduction actions, the following restrictions apply: irrigation is limited to a half-inch (1/2) per week between 8:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.; outdoor use of drinking water for washing impervious surfaces is prohibited; and all testing and training purposes requiring drinking water (e.g. fire protection) will be limited. 
    In Stage 3, Mandatory Reductions II, customers must continue actions from all previous stages and further reduce water use by twenty (20) percent compared to their previous month's water bill. All nonessential uses of drinking water are banned and garden and landscape irrigation must be reduced to the minimum amount necessary for survival. Additionally, in Stage 3, a drought surcharge of one and five-tenths (1.5) times the normal water rate may be applied. 
    In Stage 4, Emergency Reductions, customers must continue all actions from previous stages and further reduce their water use by twenty-five (25) percent compared to their previous month's water bill. A ban on all use of drinking water except to protect public health and safety is implemented and drought surcharges of two (2) times the normal water rate may be applied. 
    In Stage 5, Water Rationing, is to provide drinking water to protect public health (e.g. residences, residential health care facilities and correctional facilities). In Stage 5, all customers are only permitted to use water at the minimum required for public health protection. Firefighting is the only allowable outdoor water use and pickup locations for distributing potable water will be announced according to Clinton's Emergency Response Plan. Drought surcharges of five (5) times the normal water rate may be applied. 
(Ord. No. 2010.12.01, 12-7-2010) 
Sec. 22-205. - Triggers. 
    Clinton's water source is groundwater. The following measurements of well pumping times and well levels in relationship to pump intake levels trigger entry into corresponding water restriction stages: 
Stage Well Operating Conditions 1 Pumping time >10 hrs 
Twenty (20) percent reduction in seasonal normal distance from static water level and pump intake 
Twenty (20) percent increase pumping time for same output 2 Pumping time >12 hrs 
Forty (40) percent reduction in distance from static water level and pump intake 
Forty (40) percent increase pumping time for same output 3 Pumping time >14 hrs 
Sixty (60) percent reduction in distance from static water level and pump intake 
Sixty (60) percent increase pumping time for same output 4 Pumping time >20 hrs 
Eighty (80) percent reduction in distance from static water level and pump intake 5 Water level at pump intake elevation  
  
(Ord. No. 2010.12.01, 12-7-2010) 
Sec. 22-206. - Return to normal. 
    When water shortage conditions have abated and the situation is returning to normal, water conservation measures employed during each phase should be decreased in reverse order of implementation. Permanent measures directed toward long-term monitoring and conservation should be implemented or continued so that the community will be in a better position to prevent shortages and respond to recurring water shortage conditions. 
(Ord. No. 2010.12.01, 12-7-2010) 
Sec. 22-207. - Enforcement. 
    The provisions of the water shortage response plan will be enforced by City of Clinton personnel and local law enforcement. Violators may be reported to the city's phone line. Citations are assessed according to the following schedule depending on the number of prior violations and current level of water shortage: 
Water Shortage Level First Violation Second Violation Third Violation Voluntary reductions N/A N/A N/A Mandatory reductions 
(Stages 2 and 3) Warning $250.00 Discontinuation of 
service Emergency reductions $250.00 Discontinuation of 
service Discontinuation of 
service Water rationing $500.00 Discontinuation of 
service Discontinuation of 
service  
    Drought surcharge rates are effective in Stages 3, 4 and 5. 
(Ord. No. 2010.12.01, 12-7-2010) 
Sec. 22-208. - Public comment. 
    Customers will have multiple opportunities to comment on the provisions of the water shortage response plan. First, a draft plan will be available at city hall for customers to view. A notice will be included in customers' water bills notifying them of such. All subsequent revisions to the draft plan will be published at least thirty (30) days prior to an adoption vote by Clinton's City Council. 
(Ord. No. 2010.12.01, 12-7-2010) 
Sec. 22-209. - Variance protocols. 
    Applications for water use variance requests are available from the city hall. All applications must be submitted to the city hall for review by the city manager or his designee. A decision to approve or deny individual variance requests will be determined within two (2) weeks of submittal after careful consideration of the following criteria: impact on water demand, expected duration, alternative source options, social and economic importance, purpose (i.e. necessary use of drinking water) and the prevention of structural damage. 
(Ord. No. 2010.12.01, 12-7-2010) 
Sec. 22-210. - Effectiveness. 
    The effectiveness of the Clinton Water Shortage Response Plan will be determined by comparing the stated water conservation goals with observed water use reduction data. Other factors to be considered include frequency of plan activation, any problem periods without activation, total number of violation citations, desired reductions attained and evaluation of demand reductions compared to the previous year's seasonal data. 
(Ord. No. 2010.12.01, 12-7-2010) 
Sec. 22-211. - Revision. 
    The water shortage response plan will be reviewed and revised as needed to adapt to new circumstances affecting water supply and demand, following implementation of emergency restrictions, and at a minimum of every five (5) years in conjunction with the updating of our local water supply plan. Further, a water shortage response planning work group will review procedures following each emergency or rationing stage to recommend any necessary improvements to the plan to Clinton's City Council. The City of Clinton Public Works Director is responsible for initiating all subsequent revisions.

ARTICLE VII. - CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2018.04, adopted Apr. 3, 2018, repealed and replaced art. VII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. VII pertained to the same subject matter, consisted of §§ 22-231-22-242, and derived from Ord. No. 2017.03.01, adopted Mar. 7, 2017. 

Sec. 22-231. - Introduction. 
(a)  The purpose of this cross connection control article is to define the authority of the city as the water purveyor in the elimination of all cross connections within its public potable water supply. 
(b)  This article shall apply to all users connected to the city's public potable water supply regardless of whether the user is located within the city limits or outside of the city limits. 
(c)  This article will comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act (PL 93-523), the North Carolina State Administrative Code (15A NCAC 18A and 15A NCAC 18C), and the North Carolina State Building Code (Volume II) as they pertain to cross connections with the public water supply. 
(Ord. No. 2018.04, 4-3-18) 
Sec. 22-232. - Objectives of article. 
    The specific objectives of this cross connection control article for the city are as follows: 
(1)  To protect the public potable water supply of the city against actual or potential contamination by isolating within the consumer's water system contaminants or pollutants which could, under adverse conditions, backflow through uncontrolled cross connections into the public water system. 
(2)  To eliminate or control existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the consumer's potable water system and non-potable or industrial piping systems. 
(3)  To administer a continuing inspection and testing program of cross connection control and back flow prevention which will systematically and effectively control all actual or potential cross connections which may occur in the future. 
(Ord. No. 2018.04, 4-3-18) 
Sec. 22-233. - Responsibilities. 
(a)  Health agency. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) and the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) have the responsibility for promulgating and enforcing laws, rules, regulations, and policies to be followed in carrying out an effective cross connection control program. The NCDEQ and NCDHHS also have the primary responsibility of ensuring that the water purveyor operates the public potable water system free of actual or potential sanitary hazards, including unprotected cross connections, ensuring that the water purveyor provides an approved water supply at the service connection to the consumer's water system and, further, that he requires the installation, testing, and maintenance of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the service connection when required. 
(b)  Water purveyor. Except as otherwise provided in this article, the water purveyor's (the city) responsibility to ensure a safe water supply begins at the source and includes all of the public water distribution system, including the service connection, and ends at the point of delivery to the consumer's water system. In addition, the water purveyor shall exercise reasonable vigilance to ensure that the consumer has taken the proper steps to protect the public potable water system. To ensure that the proper precautions are taken, the city is required to determine the degree of hazard or potential hazard to the public potable water system; to determine the degree of protection required; and to ensure proper containment protection through an on-going inspection program. When it is determined that a backflow prevention assembly is required for the protection of the public system, the city shall require the consumer, at the consumer's expense, to install an approved backflow prevention assembly at each service connection, to test immediately upon installation and thereafter at a frequency as determined by the city, to properly repair and maintain such assembly or assemblies, to keep adequate records of each test and subsequent maintenance and repair, including materials and/or replacement parts, and to submit such records to the city's public works and utilities department within the prescribed time period. 
(c)  Plumbing inspection. The plumbing inspection departments of the city and/or the county have the responsibility to not only review building plans and inspect plumbing as it is installed; but they have the explicit responsibility of preventing cross connections from being designed and built into the plumbing system within its jurisdiction. Where the review of building plans suggests or detects the potential for cross connections being made an integral part of the plumbing system, the plumbing inspector has the responsibility, under the state building code, for requiring that such cross connections be either eliminated or provided with backflow prevention equipment approved by the state building code and the city's ordinance. The plumbing inspector's responsibility begins at the point of delivery, downstream of the first installed backflow prevention assembly, and continues throughout the entire length of the consumer's water system. The plan inspector should inquire about the intended use of water at any point where it is suspected that a cross connection might be made or where one is actually called for by the plans. When such is discovered it shall be mandatory that a suitable, approved backflow prevention assembly approved by the state building code and the city ordinance be required by the plans and be properly installed. The primary protection assembly for containment purposes only shall have approval from the city, and the state building code, and shall also adhere to the administrative codes of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. 
(d)  Consumer. The consumer has the primary responsibility of preventing pollutants and contaminants from entering his potable water system or the public potable water system. The consumer's responsibility starts at the point of delivery from the public potable water system and includes all of his water system. The consumer, at his own expense, shall ensure installation, operation, testing, and maintenance of approved backflow prevention assemblies as directed by the city. The consumer shall maintain accurate records of tests and repairs made to backflow prevention assemblies and shall maintain such records for a minimum period of three (3) years. The records shall be on forms approved by the city and shall include the list of materials or replacement parts used. Following any installation, repair, overhaul, repiping or relocation of an assembly, the consumer shall have it tested to ensure that it is in good operating condition and will prevent backflow. Tests, maintenance and repairs of backflow prevention assemblies shall be made by a state certified backflow prevention assembly tester, state certified plumber or utility contractor as listed in section 22-237. The consumer has the responsibility of ensuring that all records of installation, testing and maintenance shall be provided to the city's public works and utilities department by the certified backflow prevention assembly tester within the prescribed time period. 
(e)  Installer. Installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly shall be made by the appropriate installer, per section 22-237. When installing a backflow prevention device, the installer must document the installation on forms approved by the city. A copy of all installation forms shall be provided to the consumer and to the city's public works and utilities department. Refer to section 22-232 for further installation requirements. 
(f)  Certified backflow prevention assembly testers. Must hold a current certification from an approved backflow prevention assembly certification program. All certified backflow prevention assembly testers must become re-certified every two (2) years through an approved backflow prevention assembly certification program. When employed by the consumer to test, repair, overhaul, or maintain backflow prevention assemblies, a backflow prevention assembly tester will have the following responsibilities: The tester will be responsible for making competent inspections and for repairing or overhauling backflow prevention assemblies and making reports of such repair to the consumer and responsible authorities on forms approved by the city. The tester shall include the list of materials or replacement parts used. The tester shall be equipped with and be competent to use all the necessary tools, gauges, manometers and other equipment necessary to properly test, repair, and maintain backflow prevention assemblies. It will be the tester's responsibility to ensure that original manufactured parts are used in the repair of or replacement of parts in a backflow prevention assembly. It will be the tester's further responsibility not to change the design, material or operational characteristics of an assembly during repair or maintenance without prior approval of the city. A certified tester shall perform the work and be responsible for the competency and accuracy of all tests and reports. A certified tester shall provide a copy of all test and repair reports to the consumer and to the city's public works and utilities department within ten (10) business days of any completed test or repair work. A certified tester shall maintain such records for a minimum period of three (3) years. All certified backflow prevention assembly testers must obtain and employ backflow prevention assembly test equipment which has been evaluated and/or approved by the city. All test equipment used for assembly testing shall be documented on forms approved by the city. All test equipment shall be checked for accuracy annually, at a minimum, calibrated, if necessary, and certified to the city as to such calibration, employing an accuracy/calibration method acceptable to the city.

    Hazard-Degree of. The term "degree of hazard" is derived from the evaluation of conditions within a system which can be classified as either a "pollutional" (non-health) or a "contamination" (health) hazard. 
    Hazard-Health. The term "health hazard" means an actual or potential threat of contamination of a physical, hazardous or toxic nature to the public or consumer's potable water system to such a degree or intensity that there would be a danger to health. 
    Hazard-Non-health. The term "non-health hazard" means an actual or potential threat to the quality of the public or the consumer's potable water system. A non-health hazard is one that, if introduced into the public water supply system, could be a nuisance to water customers, but would not adversely affect human health. 
    Hazard-Pollutional. The term "pollutional hazard" means an actual or potential threat to the quality or the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system but which would not constitute a health or a system hazard, as defined.

    Health agency means the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality and the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services 
    Industrial fluids means any fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically, or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health or non-health hazard if introduced into a public or consumer potable water system. Such fluids may include, but are not limited to: Process waters; chemicals in fluid form; acids and alkalis; oils, gases; etc. 
    Industrial piping system-Consumer's. The term "consumer's industrial piping system" means any system used by the consumer for transmission of or to confine or store any fluid, solid or gaseous substance other than an approved water supply. Such a system would include all pipes, conduits, tanks, receptacles, fixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to produce, convey, or store substances which are or may be polluted or contaminated. 
    Isolation means the act of confining a localized hazard within a consumer's water system by installing approved backflow prevention assemblies.

The customer shall be responsible for all water piping and control devices located on the customer's side of the point of delivery. 
    Pollution means an impairment of the quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect the aesthetic qualities of such waters for domestic use. 
    Potable water means water from any source which has been investigated by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality and which has been approved for human consumption. 
    Public potable water system means any publicly or privately-owned water system operated as a public utility, under a current North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality permit, to supply water for public consumption or use. This system will include all sources, facilities, and appurtenances between the source and the point of delivery such as valves, pumps, pipes, conduits, tanks, receptacles, fixtures, equipment, and appurtenances used to produce, convey, treat, or store potable water for public consumption or use. 
    Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly means an assembly containing within its structure a minimum of two (2) independently acting, approved check valves, together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, pressure differential relief valve located between the check valves and at the same time below the first check valve. The first check valve reduces the supply pressure a predetermined amount so that during normal flow and at cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the checks is less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the pressure differential relief valve, by discharge to atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure between the checks less than the supply pressure. The unit shall include tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and each assembly shall be fitted with properly located test cocks. The assembly is designed to protect against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant). 
    Reduced pressure principle detector assembly (RPDA) means a specially designed assembly composed of a line-size approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly with a specific bypass water meter and a meter-sized approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly. The meter shall register, in U.S. gallons/cubit feet, accurately for only very low rates of flow and shall show a registration for all rates of flow. This assembly shall be used to protect against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant). 
    Service connections means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system, i.e., where the city loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the consumer's water system. 
    Vacuum breaker-Atmospheric type. The term "atmospheric vacuum breaker," also known as the "non-pressure type vacuum breaker," means a device containing a float-check, a check seat, and an air inlet port. The flow of water into the body causes the float to close the air inlet port. When the flow of water stops, the float falls and forms a check valve against back-siphonage and at the same time opens the air inlet port to allow air to enter and satisfy the vacuum. A shutoff valve immediately upstream may be an integral part of the device. An atmospheric vacuum breaker is designed to protect against a non-health hazard, isolation protection only, under a backsiphonage condition only. 
    Vacuum breaker-Pressure type. The term "pressure vacuum breaker" means an assembly containing an independently operating internally loaded check valve and an independently operating loaded air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve. The assembly is to be equipped with properly located test cocks and tightly closing shutoff valves attached at each end of the assembly. This assembly is designed to protect against a health hazard (i.e., contaminant) under a backsiphonage condition only. 
    Water purveyor means the owner or operator of a public potable water system, providing an approved water supply to the public. 
    Water supply-Approved. The term "approved water supply" means any public potable water supply which has been investigated and approved by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. The system must be operating under a valid North Carolina permit. In determining what constitutes an approved water supply, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality has reserved the final judgment as to its safety and potability. 
    Water supply-Auxiliary. The term "auxiliary water supply" means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source such as a well, spring, river, stream, etc., "used water", or industrial fluids. These waters may be polluted, contaminated, or objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control. 
    Water supply-Unapproved. The term "unapproved water supply" means a water supply which has not been approved for human consumption by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. 
    Water-Used. The term "used water" means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the control of the water purveyor. 
    This article is gender neutral and the masculine gender shall include the feminine and vice versa. Shall is mandatory, may is permissive and discretionary. The use of the singular shall be construed to include the plural and the plural shall include the singular as indicated by the context of its use.

CHAPTER 2: GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 2.1 Applicability of General Provisions
A. The following provisions shall apply throughout the jurisdiction of this Ordinance, regardless
of the underlying regulating district.
B. Subject to Chapter 13 Nonconformities, no person may use, occupy, or sell any land or
buildings or authorize or permit the use, occupancy, or sale of land or buildings under his/her

and everything that is done to, on, or in that building or land.
Section 2.2 Uses Not Expressly Permitted by Right or Conditionally
A. Uses designated as "permitted uses" and uses permitted with special requirements are
allowed in a district as a matter of right if other applicable regulations of this Ordinance are
met.
B. Uses classified as conditional uses are permitted upon approval of a Conditional Use
Permit and development plan by the City Council.

Section 3.1 Interpretation
3.1.1 District Interpretation
Each zoning district has uses permitted by right, uses permitted with special requirements, and
conditional uses. A detailed permitted uses table showing the uses allowed in each district. The
following describes the processes of each of the three categories that the uses are subject to:
A. Permitted by Right: Administrative review and approval subject to district provisions and
other applicable requirements only.
B. Permitted with Special Requirements: Administrative review and approval subject to
district provisions, other applicable requirements, and special requirements outlined in
Chapter 4.
C. Conditional Uses: City Council approval of Conditional Use Permit subject to district
provisions, other applicable requirements, and conditions of approval. Some Conditional
Uses may also be subject to special requirements outlined in Chapter 4.
3.1.2 Zoning Map Interpretation
The map entitled City of Clinton Zoning Map, as adopted by the Clinton City Council establishes
the official zoning districts and overlay districts. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries
of any district shown on the Official Zoning Map, the Administrator shall employ the following
rules of interpretation.
A. Centerline: Where a boundary line lies within and follows a street or alley right-of-way, a
railroad right-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary shall be construed to be in the center
of such street or alley right-of-right, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement forming the
boundary between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from dedication,
the district boundaries shall be construed as following the centerline of the abandoned or
vacated road bed or utility easement.
B. Edge Line: Where a boundary line follows the edge of a street or alley right-of-way, a
railroad right-of-way, or utility easement, the boundary shall be construed to be on the edge
of such street or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement. If such a street
or alley right-of-way, railroad right-of-way, or utility easement forming the boundary
between two separate zoning districts is abandoned or removed from dedication, the district
boundaries shall be construed as following the edge of the abandoned or vacated road bed or
utility easement.
C. Lot Line: Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines shall be construed as
following such lot lines. In the event that a district boundary line divides a lot or tract, each
part of the lot or tract so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations established
by this Ordinance for the district in which said part is located.
D. City Limits: Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits or extraterritorial
boundary lines shall be construed as following the town limits or extraterritorial boundary
lines.
3-3
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
E. Watercourses: Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streams,
rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines.
F. Extensions: Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of street or alley rights-ofway,
utility easements, lot lines, city limits, county lines, or extraterritorial boundaries shall
be so construed.
G. Scaling: In a case where a district boundary does not coincide with any boundary lines as
above and no distances are described by specific ordinance; the boundary shall be
determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map.
H. Where the Administrator determines that physical features existing on the ground, or actual
property lines or other man-made boundary lines used to depict zoning district boundaries,
are different than those shown on the Official Zoning Map, the Board of Adjustment shall
have the authority to interpret zoning district boundaries.
Section 3.2 Zoning Districts
Zoning districts are created to provide comprehensive land use regulations throughout the City of
Clinton. There are 13 zoning districts that provide for a variety of uses that are appropriate to the
character of the areas in which they are located. For the purpose of this Ordinance, the City of
Clinton is hereby divided into the following base zoning districts. These districts shall comply
with all of the general and specific requirements of this Ordinance. The uses permitted in each
of these districts are listed in Section 3.3. The dimensional requirements for each of these
districts are listed in Section 3.4. (TA-7-16-1)
 PC Public Conservation District
 RA-20 Residential/Agricultural District
 R-20 Very Low Density Residential District
 R-15 Low Density Residential District
 R-8 Medium Density Residential District
 R-6 High Density Residential District
 NS Neighborhood Shopping District
 OI Office & Institutional District
 CB Central Business District
 HC Highway Commercial District
 I-1 Light Industrial District
 I-2 Heavy Industrial District
 PI Planned Industrial District
 PRD Planned Residential District (Conditional Zoning District only)
 MU Mixed Use District (Conditional Zoning District only)
3.2.1 Public Conservation (PC) District
The PC district is created to encourage the protection and preservation of environmentally
sensitive areas including swamps or wetlands, areas subject to occasional flooding, and/or unique
or unspoiled vegetation and/or animal habitats from incompatible forms of development.
3-4
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
3.2.2 Residential/Agricultural (RA-20) District
The RA-20 district is established for very low-density residential uses, as well as agricultural and
horticultural uses. The regulations of the district are designed for use in areas with a minimum
of public services.
3.2.3 Very Low Density Residential (R-20) District
The R-20 district is established for low-density residential uses. The regulations of the district
are designed for use in areas with a minimum of public services.
3.2.4 Low Density Residential (R-15) District
The R-15 district is established for low density residential uses. The regulations for this district
are designed to stabilize and encourage a suitable environment for family life.
3.2.5 Medium Density Residential (R-8) District
The R-8 District is established for medium density residential uses consisting of single-family,
two-family, and multi-family dwellings, and public, community uses. The district shall be
applied in areas currently or proposed to be served by public water and sewer facilities.
3.2.6 High Density Residential (R-6) District
The R-6 District is established for high density residential uses consisting of single-family, twofamily,
and multi-family dwellings. The district shall be applied in areas currently or proposed
to be served by public water and sewer facilities.
3.2.7 Neighborhood Service (NS) District
The NS district is established for those areas of the community where the principal use of land is
to provide for the retailing of goods and services to surrounding residential neighborhoods. The
regulations of the district are designed to reduce traffic and parking congestion to a minimum in
order to protect the surrounding residential area. A lesser intensity of development is achieved
through setback, height, and minimum lot size requirements that are more restrictive than those
applicable in the CB zoning district. The types of uses permissible in this zone are generally
similar to the types permissible in the CB zoning district, except that additional automobileoriented
businesses (e.g., drive-in banks and restaurants) not allowed in the CB district are
permissible in this zoning district. The NS district may provide a transition in some areas
between a CB district and a residential zoning district, or may provide for a smaller scale
shopping center that primarily serves one neighborhood or area of the City (as opposed to a
regional shopping center). The dimensional restrictions in the zoning district are also designed
in appropriate areas to encourage the renovation for commercial purposes of buildings that
formerly were single-family residences.
3.2.8 Office & Institutional (OI) District
The OI District is established to provide an area in which the principal uses are office and
institutions. It is intended that this zoning classification be applied primarily in areas that are no
longer viable as single-family residential areas because of high traffic volumes on adjacent
streets or because of other market factors but remain viable as location for single-, two-, and
multi-family residential developments or offices. Such areas will also be generally constitute
3-5
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
transition or buffer zones between major arterials or more intensely developed commercial areas
and residential districts.
3.2.9 Central Business (CB) District
The CB District is established to provide retailing, personal services, and office space for local
and regional commercial activities (particularly those that are pedestrian-oriented) that will result
in the most intensive and attractive use of the Citys Central Business district. The regulations
are designed to permit a concentrated development of permitted facilities and to protect the
district itself from over intensive development and congestion.
3.2.10 Highway Commercial (HC) District
The HC district is designed to accommodate the widest range of commercial activities, and is
established to accommodate commercial activities that draw business primarily from, and
provide services to, major thoroughfares within the Citys planning jurisdiction, as well as
industrial areas.
3.2.11 Light Industrial (I-1) District
The I-1 District is designed as an area primarily for industrial assembly, fabrication, and storage
located on planned sites with access to major highways and with adequate utility facilities.
Specific performance standards place limitations on the characteristics of uses located in this
district.
3.2.12 Heavy Industrial (I-2) District
The I-2 district is designed to promote and protect existing industrial activities and potential sites
that are considered suitable for future industrial use; to prohibit uses that would substantially
interfere with the continuation of uses permitted in the district; and to promote the operation of
well-planned and maintained industrial facilities. Specific performance standards place
limitations on the characteristics of uses located in this district.
3.2.13 Planned Industrial (PI) District
The PI district is designed to provide for low-intensity industrial sites that prevent congestion
and create an aesthetically pleasing area for industrial development while planning for further
growth of the area. Specific performance standards place limitations on the characteristics of
uses located in this district.
3.2.14 Planned Residential (PRD) District (Conditional District only  See Section 3.6)
The PR district is established to allow for design flexibility of development and is intended to
encourage efficient use of the land and public services and to promote high quality design that
will provide a variety of dwelling types as well as support services and open space for the
residents of the development. These regulations are intended to permit integration with adjacent
non-residential uses and to promote compatibility with existing and emerging patterns of
development.
3.2.15 Mixed Use (MU) District (Conditional District only  See Section 3.6)
The MU district is intended to provide for the coordinated development of office, commercial,
and residential uses and their necessary support functions. They are intended to encourage
3-6
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
design and emphasizes livable, people-oriented environments within compatible and visually
appealing developments. Mixed use districts are intended to provide areas where moderate scale
missed use centers can locate with an emphasis on development of a balance of residential, office
and commercial uses, and public spaces. It is further intended that mixed use districts shall
encourage development within which mutually supporting residential, commercial and office
uses are scaled, balanced and located to reduce general traffic congestion by providing housing
close to principal destinations, and convenient pedestrian circulation systems and mass transit to
further reduce the need for automobile usage. Mixed use districts are intended to encourage
development that allows multiple destinations to be achieved with a single trip. When such
districts adjoin residential development or residential zoning districts, it is intended that
arrangement of buildings, uses, open space and vehicular or pedestrian access shall be such as to
provide appropriate transition and reduce potentially adverse effects.
Section 3.3 Permitted Uses Table
3.3.1 Permitted Uses and Specific Exclusions
A. If a use is not listed in the Permitted Uses Table, the Administrator shall make the
determination if a use not mentioned can reasonably be interpreted to fit into a use category
where similar uses are described, using the North American Industry Classification (NAICS)
Manual. Uses not listed as permitted or conditional shall be presumed to be prohibited from
the applicable zoning district.
B. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provision, the following uses are specifically
prohibited in all districts:
1. Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale, distribution, or storage of any
highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the Citys fire prevention code;
2. Stockyards;
3. Use of a travel trailer as a permanent residence. Situations that do not comply with this
Section on the effective date of this Ordinance are required to conform within one year;
4. Use of a motor vehicle, trailer, recreational vehicle, cargo container, or manufactured
home parked on a lot as a structure in which, out of which, or from which any goods are
sold or stored, any services are performed, or other business is conducted. Situations that
do not comply with this Section on the effective date of this Ordinance are required to
conform within 30 days.
3.3.2 Accessory Uses
A. The Permitted Uses Table classifies different principal uses according to their different
impacts. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use
in the Permitted Uses Table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the
former use:
1. constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on
a lot, or
2. is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it,
then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on
underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use. For example, a swimming
3-7
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
pool/tennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a
residential subdivision or multi-family development and would be regarded as accessory to
such principal uses, even though such facilities, if developed apart from a residential
development, would require a Conditional Use Permit.
B. For purposes of interpreting Subsection (A):
1. A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in
and of itself or in relation to the principal use,
2. To be commonly associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use
to be connected with such principal use more times than not, but only that the association
of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that
there is common acceptance of their relatedness.
C. Without limiting the generality of Subsections (A) and (B), the following activities are
specifically regarded as accessory uses to residential principal uses as long as they satisfy the
general criteria set forth above:
1. Yard sales or garage sales of personal property on the residential premises owned or
rented for residential purpose by the seller, so long as such sales are not conducted on the
same lot for more than four (4) days (consecutive or not) during any one (1) year period.
2. Towers and antennas, as long as:
a. Such towers, 50 feet tall or less, intended for the personal and noncommercial use of
the residents of the property where located; and
b. Such towers and antennas comply with the district setback requirements and are
installed only in rear or side yards; and
c. No more than one (1) such tower or antenna may be regarded as an accessory use on
a single lot; and
d. The owner must be able to demonstrate compliance with Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) regulations, 47 CFR Part 97, Subpart 97.15, Sections (a) through
(e), inclusive.
3. Child day care arrangements for one (1) or two (2) children, as well as other child day
care arrangements, such as arrangements operated in the home of any child receiving care
if all the children in care are related to each other, or no more than two (2) additional
children are in care, and cooperative arrangements among parents to provide care for
their own children as a convenience rather than for employment.
D. Without limiting the generality of Subsections (A) and (B), the following activities shall not
be regarded as accessory to a residential principal use and are prohibited in residential
districts:
1. Storage outside of a substantially enclosed structure of any motor vehicle that is neither
licensed nor operational.
2. Parking outside a substantially enclosed structure of more than 4 motor vehicles between
the front building line of the principal building and the street on any lot used for purposes
of single-family and two-family use, or homes emphasizing special services, treatment, or
supervision.
3-8
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
E. Without limiting the generality of Subsections (A) and (B), the use of a manufactured home
as a storage building shall not be regarded as accessory to a principal use and are prohibited
in all districts.
F. No accessory use shall be established on any lot prior to the time of construction or
establishment of the principal structure or use to which it is accessory.
3.3.3 Permitted Uses Not Requiring Permits
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, no Zoning or Conditional Use Permit is
necessary for the following uses:
A. Streets;
B. Electric power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, gas, water and sewer lines, wires or
pipes, together with supporting poles or structures, located within a public right-of-way;
C. Neighborhood utility facilities located within a public right-of-way with the permission of the
owner (State or City) of the right-of-way;
3.3.4 Change in Use
A. A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of
the activity conducted on a lot changes. This occurs whenever:
1. The change involves a change from one principal use category to another;
2. If the original use is a combination use, the relative proportion of space devoted to the
individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes to such an extent
that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered;
3. If the original use is a combination use, the mixture of the types of individual principal
uses that comprise the combination use changes;
4. If there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot (regardless of whether the
business or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or combination use), that
business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in (even though
the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or
combination use category as the previous type of business). For example, if there is only
one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out
and is replaced by a clothing store, that constitutes a change in use even though both
tenants fall within the same principal use classification. However, if the florist shop
were replaced with another florist shop, that would not constitute a change in use since
the type of business or enterprise would not have changed. Moreover, if the florist shop
moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store
that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on the lot
and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot (shopping centercombination
use) has not changed.
B. A mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not
constitute a change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by
comparing the two (2) active uses of the property without regard to any intervening time
3-9
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless the property has
remained unoccupied for more than 180 days or has been abandoned.
C. A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in name shall not be
regarded as a change in use.
3.3.5 Combination Uses
When a combination use comprises two (2) or more principal uses that require different types of
permits (Zoning or Conditional Use), then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be:
A. A Conditional Use Permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a Conditional Use
Permit;
B. A Zoning Permit in all other cases.
3.3.6 More Specific Controls
Whenever a development could fall within more than one use classification in the Permitted Uses
Table, the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the development
controls.
3.3.7 Table Key
A. The Permitted Uses Table contains a listing of uses which may be permitted in one or more
of the various zoning districts. Uses are listed in alphabetical order within seven (7)
categories as follows:
1. Residential
2. Civic , Government, & Institutional
3. Office & Service
4. Retail & Wholesale
5. Recreation & Entertainment
6. Industrial, Warehousing, & Transportation
7. Other
B. The following is a list of the meanings of table entries:
1. P indicates that the use is permitted by right in the zoning district with a Zoning Permit
issued by Administrator
2. C indicates that the use is permitted with a Conditional Use Permit in the zoning
district
3. A section number listed in the SR column indicates that the use has special
requirements for the zoning district in which it is permitted. The section number refers to
the regulations in Chapter 4.

CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
Section 3.4 Dimensional Requirements
3.4.1 General Provisions (TA-4-14-1)
A. No lot may be created that is so narrow or otherwise so irregularly shaped that it would be
impracticable to construct on it a building that:
1. Could be used for purposes that are permissible in that zoning district, and
2. Could satisfy any applicable setback requirements for that district.
B. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing standard, the Dimensional Table indicates
minimum lot widths that are required and that are deemed presumptively to satisfy the
standard set forth in Subsection (A) above. The lot width shall be measured at the horizontal
distance between the side lot lines measured at the front setback line.
C. The creation of flag lots is prohibited, unless a variance is granted by the Board of
Adjustment.
D. In all residential districts, the front and/or widest portion of the principal building shall
extend parallel to the street on which it fronts. In cases where the lot does not front on a
street, the building shall face parallel to the property line that is parallel to the closest street.
The requirements of this Section shall not be effective on corner lots.
E. No portion of any building may be located on any lot closer to any lot line or to the street
right-of-way line, than is authorized in the Dimensional Table unless a Variance has been
granted by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 15.7 of this Ordinance.
F. If the street right-of-way line is readily determinable (by reference to a recorded plat, set
irons, or other means), the setback shall be measured from such right-of-way line.
G. Setback distances shall be measured from the property line or street right-of-way line to a
point on the lot that is directly below the nearest extension of any part of the building that is
a part of the building itself and not a mere appendage to it (such as a flagpole, etc.).
H. As used in this Section, the term lot boundary line refers to lot boundaries other than those
that abut streets.
I. As used in this Section, the term building includes any structure that by the nature of its
size, scale, dimensions, bulk, or use tends to constitute a visual obstruction or generate
activity similar to that usually associated with a building. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the following structures shall be deemed to fall within this description:
1. Gas pumps and overhead canopies or roofs;
2. Fences, running along lot boundaries adjacent to public street rights-of-way, if such fence
exceeds 6 feet in height and is opaque.

City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
A. Minimum lot size may be reduced for Conservation Developments in accordance with
Section 4.2.4.
B. Balconies, open porches, overhangs, cantilevers, canopies, awnings, open stairways, bay
windows, chimneys, and heating units may encroach into the setback up to three (3) feet.
C. Except as specifically noted in the Dimensional Table, whenever a lot in a non-residential
district has a common boundary line with a lot in a residential district, and the property line
setback requirement applicable to the residential lot is greater than that applicable to the nonresidential
lot, then the lot in the non-residential district shall be required to observe the
property line setback requirement applicable to the adjoining residential lot.
D. The following features are exempt from the district height limitations set forth in the
Dimensional Table, so long as such features do not make up more than 1/3rd of the total roof
area:
1. Chimneys, church spires, elevator shafts, tanks and similar structural appendages
required to be placed above the roof level not intended as places of occupancy; (TA-1-13-1)
2. Flagpoles and similar devices;
3. Heating and air conditioning equipment, solar collectors, and similar equipment, fixtures,
and devices. This equipment must be set back from the edge of the roof a minimum
distance of one (1) foot for every foot by which such features extend above the roof
surface of the principal building to which they are attached. The permit issuing authority
may authorize or require that parapet walls be constructed (up to a height not exceeding
that of the features screened) to shield these features.
E. The vertical distance from the ground to a point of access to a roof surface of any nonresidential
building or any multi-family residential building containing 4 or more dwelling
units may not exceed 40 feet unless the Fire Chief certifies to the permit issuing authority
that such building is designed to provide adequate access for fire-fighting personnel, or the
Building Inspector certifies that the building is otherwise designed or equipped to provide
adequate protection against the dangers of fire.
F. Towers and antennas are allowed in all zoning districts to the extent authorized in the
Permitted Uses Table.
G. Within the Airport Height Overlay (AH-O) District, no structure or use shall be erected,
constructed, established or maintained at a height of 50 feet or greater, without initial review
and approval of the Federal Aviation Association (FAA).
3.4.4 Density on Lots Where Portion Dedicated to City
A. Subject to the other provisions of this Section, if (i) any portion of a tract lies within an area
designated on any officially adopted City plan as part of a proposed public park, greenway,
or bikeway, and (ii) before the tract is developed, the owner of the tract, with concurrence of
the City, dedicates to the City that portion of the tract so designated, then, when the
remainder of the tract is developed for residential purposes, the permissible density at which
3-18
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
the remainder may be developed shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of this
Section.
B. If the proposed use of the remainder is a single-family detached residential subdivision, then
the lots in such subdivision may be reduced in accordance with the provisions of Section
3.4.4 above except that the developer need not set aside usable open space to the extent that
an equivalent amount of land has previously been dedicated to the City in accordance with
Subsection (A).
C. If the proposed use of the remainder is a two-family or multi-family project, then the
permissible density at which the remainder may be developed shall be calculated by
regarding the dedicated portion of the original lot as if it were still part of the lot proposed for
development.
D. If the portion of the tract that remains after dedication as provided in Subsection (A) is
divided in such a way that the resultant parcels are intended for future subdivision or
development, then each of the resultant parcels shall be entitled to its pro rata share of the
density bonus provided for in Subsections (B) and (C).
Section 3.5 Overlay Districts
The following overlay zoning districts are hereby established: MHA-O, MHB-O AH-O, and HPO.

3.5.2 Airport Height Overlay (AH-O)
3.5.2.1 Purpose
The AH-O District is hereby established as a district that is overlaid upon other districts in
the vicinity of the Clinton-Sampson County Airport. All uses permitted in the underlying
district, whether by right or as a conditional use, shall be permitted. It is declared that:
A. The creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential of being a public
nuisance and may impact the utility of the Clinton-Sampson County Airport and the
public investment therein;
B. It is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that
the creation or establishment of obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be
prevented, and;
C. The prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the extent legally
permissible, by the exercise of the authority invested in the City of Clinton.
D. The prevention of the creation or establishment of hazards to air navigation, the
elimination, removal, alteration or mitigation of hazards to air navigation, or the marking
and lighting of obstructions are in the public interest for which a political subdivision
may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land.
3.5.2.2 Airport Height Zones & Height Limitations
In order to carry out the provisions of this overlay, there are hereby created and established
certain zones which include all of the land lying within the instrument approach zones, noninstrument
approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zones, and conical zone. Such areas
and zones are shown as the Clinton-Sampson County Airport Height Restriction Overlay
Map, which is incorporated by reference and made a part hereof. The various zones are
established and defined as follows:
A. Primary Surface Zone - A rectangular surface longitudinally centered on a runway. The
elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest
point on the runway centerline. Runway 6-24: 1,000 feet wide and extends 200 feet
beyond each runway end.
B. Approach Surface Zones  A trapezoidal inclined plane symmetrically centered along the
extended runway centerline, longitudinally extending outward and upward from the end
3-21
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
of the primary surface. The perimeter of the approach surface coincides with the
perimeter of the approach zone, extending per a boundary and slope defined below, and
as shown on the Clinton-Sampson County Airport Height Restriction Overlay Map.
Runway End Inner Width/Length/Outer Width (Slope)
Runway 6 approach surface zone: 1,000 x 50,000 x 16,000
(0 to 10,000 @ 50:1)
(10,001 to 50,000 @ 40:1)
Runway 24 approach surface zone: 1,000 x 10,000 x 4,000
(0 to 10,000 @ 34:1)
C. Horizontal Surface Zone - A plane, elliptical in shape, with a height one hundred and
fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation and having a specified radius from
the center of the primary surface for each runway end. The perimeter of the horizontal
surface coincides with the perimeter of the horizontal zone as indicated on the Clinton-
Sampson County Airport Height Restriction Overlay Map. Runway 6-24 horizontal
radius: 10,000
D. Conical Surface Zone  A surface, elliptical in shape, extending radially outward and
upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface zone at a slope of 20:1 for a
horizontal distance of 4,000 feet and vertical elevation of 200 feet above the horizontal
surface. The conical surface zone is shown on the Clinton-Sampson County Airport
Height Restriction Overlay Map.
E. Transitional Surface Zones  Inclined planes with a slope of 7:1 measured upward and
outward in a vertical plane at right angles to the centerline of the runway and approach
surfaces. The transitional surface zones, located on either side of the runway and
symmetrically parallel to and level with the runway centerline, extend upward and
outward from the primary surface and approach surface elevation to a point intersecting
the horizontal or conical surface (150 feet above the airport elevation). Where the
precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are
established height limits sloping 7:1 measured upward and outward beginning at the sides
of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance
of 5,000 feet measured at 90 degree angles to the extended runway centerline. The
transitional surface zones are shown on the Clinton-Sampson County Airport Height
Restriction Overlay Map. Nothing in this overlay shall be construed as prohibiting the
construction or maintenance of any structure, or growth of any tree, to a height of 50 feet
above the surface of the land.
3.5.2.3 Use Restrictions
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Overlay, no use may be made of land or water
within any approach surface zone, horizontal surface zone, conical surface zone or
transitional surface zone, in such manner as to create electrical interference with navigational
signals or radio communication between the Airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers
to distinguish between Airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the
3-22
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the Airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise
endanger the landing, taking-off or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the Clinton-
Sampson County Airport.
3.5.2.4 Nonconforming Structures
A. The regulations prescribed by this Overlay shall not be construed to require the removal,
lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the
regulations as of the effective date of this Overlay, or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in
the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration
of which was begun prior to the effective date of this overlay, and is diligently
prosecuted.
B. Except as specifically provided in this section, it is not permissible for any person to
engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a
nonconforming situation. Physical alteration of structures or the placement of new
structures on open land is unlawful if they result in:
1. an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming structure , or
2. greater nonconformity with respect to height limitation.
C. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed - Whenever the Administrator determines
that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn
down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow
such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the
overlay regulations.
D. Marking and Lighting - Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this overlay, the
owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the
installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be
deemed necessary by the Administrator to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the
vicinity of the Airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights
shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the Airport.
Notwithstanding any preceding provision of this overlay, if, by a determination of the NC
Division of Aviation or Federal Aviation Administration, the encroachment of any
structure or tree into regulated airspace is such that providing markers and lights is
insufficient to protect the life and property of the flying public, the Authority shall
institute steps to have such structures or trees mitigated at the expense of the Authority. If
unsuccessful in obtaining the cooperation of the parties involved, the City shall institute
the appropriate legal action, as reasonably necessary, to insure the safety of the flying
public in airspace regulated by this overlay.
3.5.2.5 Permits
A. All applications for zoning permits for new or altered structures in the AH-O shall be
accompanied by a completed Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration, FAA Form
7460-1.
3-23
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
B. Future Uses - Except as specifically provided in (1) and (2) hereunder, no material
change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise
established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit
therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall
indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit
it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall
be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this overlay, as
depicted on the Clinton-Sampson County Airport Height Restriction Overlay Map, shall
be granted unless a variance has been approved.
1. In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit
shall be required for any tree or structure less than 50 feet of vertical height above the
ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such
tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
2. In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the
horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 50 feet
of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of
terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limits
prescribed for such transition zones.
The preceding paragraphs (1) and (2) corresponds with permit areas (Zones 2, 3, and 4)
identified on the Clinton-Sampson County Airport Height Restriction Overlay Map.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or
intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree
in excess of any of the height limits established by this overlay except as set forth in
Sections 3.5.2.2 and Section 3.5.2.3.
C. Existing Uses - No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation
of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater
hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this overlay or any
amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as
indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
3.5.3 Historic Preservation Overlay (HP-O) District
The HP-O District is established as an overlay district that may be applied over all other zoning
districts. All uses permitted in the underlying district, whether by right or as a conditional use,
shall be permitted. However, the HP-O district shall not be applied to an area unless the area is
deemed to be of special significance in terms of its historical, pre-historical, architectural, or
cultural importance. Such areas shall possess integrity of design, setting, workmanship,
materials, feeling, and/or association.
3.5.3.1 Historic Districts
A. Historic districts are hereby established as districts, which overlap with other zoning
districts. All uses permitted in any such district, whether by right or as a special use,
shall be permitted in the historic district.
3-24
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
B. Historic districts, as provided for in this section, may from time to time be designated,
amended or repealed, provided however that no district shall be recommended for
designation unless it is deemed to be of special significance in terms of its historical,
prehistorical, architectural or cultural importance. Such district must also possess
integrity of design, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling and/or association. No
district shall be designated, amended or repealed until the following procedures have
been carried out:
1. An investigation and report describing the significance of the buildings, structures,
features, sites or surroundings included in any such proposed district, and a
description of the boundaries of such district has been prepared; and
2. The Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State Historic Preservation
Officer or his or her designee, shall have made an analysis of and recommendations
concerning such report and description of proposed boundaries. Failure of the
Department to submit its written analysis and recommendations to the Clinton City
Council within 30 calendar days after a written request for such analysis has been
received by the Department of Cultural Resources shall relieve the City Council of
any responsibility for awaiting such analysis, and the City Council may at any time
thereafter take any necessary action to adopt or amend its zoning ordinance.
C. The City Council may also, in its discretion, refer the report and the proposed boundaries
to any other interested body for its recommendations prior to taking action to amend the
zoning ordinance.
D. With respect to any changes in the boundaries of such district subsequent to its initial
establishment, or the creation of additional districts within the Citys jurisdiction, the
investigative studies and reports shall be prepared by the Historic Preservation
Commission and shall be referred to the Planning Board for its review and comment
according to the procedures set forth in the zoning ordinance. Changes in the boundaries
of an initial district or proposal for additional districts shall be submitted to the
Department of Cultural Resources.
E. Upon receipt of these reports and recommendations, the City Council may proceed in the
same manner as would otherwise be required for the adoption or amendment of any
appropriate zoning ordinance provisions.
3.5.3.2 Historic Landmarks
A. Upon complying with the required landmark designation procedures set forth herein, the
City Council may adopt and from time to time amend or repeal an ordinance designating
one or more historic landmarks. No property shall be recommended for designation as a
landmark unless it is deemed and found by the Historic Preservation Commission to be of
special significance in terms of its historical, pre-historical, architectural or cultural
importance and to possess integrity of design, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling
and/or association.
3-25
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
B. The ordinance shall describe each property designated in the ordinance, the name or
names of the owner or owners of the property, those elements of the property that are
integral to its historical, architectural or pre-historical value, including the land area of
the property so designated and any other information the governing board deems
necessary. For each building, structure, site, area or object so designated as a landmark,
the ordinance shall require that the waiting period set forth in this ordinance be observed
prior to its demolition. A suitable sign for each property designated as a landmark may
be placed on the property at the owners consent; otherwise the sign may be placed on a
nearby public right-of-way.
C. No property shall be designated as a landmark until the following steps have been taken:
1. As a guide for the identification and evaluation of landmarks, the Historic
Preservation Commission shall, at the earliest possible time and consistent with the
resources available to it, undertake an inventory of properties of historical,
architectural, pre-historical and cultural significance within the City of Clinton and its
extraterritorial jurisdiction;
2. The Historic Preservation Commission shall make or cause to be made an
investigation and report on the historic, architectural, pre-historical, educational or
cultural significance of each building, structure, site, area or object proposed for
designation or acquisition. Such report shall be forwarded to the Division of
Archives and History, North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources;
3. The Department of Cultural Resources, acting through the State Historic Preservation
Officer, or his or her designee, shall either upon request of the Department or at the
initiative of the Historic Preservation Commission be given an opportunity to review
and comment upon the substance and effect of the designation of any landmark. All
comments will be provided in writing. If the Department does not submit its
comments to the Historic Preservation Commission within 30 days following receipt
by the Department of the report, the Historic Preservation Commission and the City
Council shall be relieved of any responsibility to consider such comments;
4. The Historic Preservation Commission and the City Council shall hold a joint public
hearing (or separate public hearings) on the proposed ordinance. Reasonable notice

the grantor and grantee indexes in the Register of Deeds office and the Historic
Preservation Commission shall pay a reasonable fee for filing and indexing. A
second copy of the ordinance and all amendments thereto shall be kept on file in the
office of the Clinton City Clerk and be made available for public inspection at any
reasonable time. A third copy of the ordinance and all amendments thereto shall be
given to the building inspector. The fact that a building, structure, site area or object
3-26
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
has been designated a landmark shall be clearly indicated on all tax maps maintained
by Sampson County for such period as the designation remains in effect; and
7. Upon the adoption of the landmark ordinance or any amendments thereto, it is the
duty of the Historic Preservation Commission to give notice thereof to the tax
collector of Sampson County. The designation and any recorded restrictions upon the
property limiting its use for preservation purposes shall be considered by the tax
collector in appraising it for tax purposes.
3.5.3.3 Certificate of Appropriateness Required
A. From and after the designation of a landmark or a historic district, no exterior portion of
any building or other structure (including masonry walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and
pavement or other appurtenant features), nor any above-ground utility structure nor any
type of outdoor advertising sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished
on such landmark or within the historic district until after an application for a certificate
of appropriateness as to exterior features has been submitted to and approved by the
Historic Preservation Commission. Such a certificate is required to be issued by the
Historic Preservation Commission prior to the issuance of a building permit or other
permit granted for the purposes of constructing, altering, moving or demolishing
structures, which certificate may be issued subject to reasonable conditions necessary to
carry out the purposes of this ordinance. A certificate of appropriateness shall be
required whether or not a building or other permit is required.
B. For purposes of this ordinance, exterior features shall include the architectural style,
general design and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure,
including the kind and texture of the building material, the size and scale of the building,

features. Exterior features may also include historic signs, color, and significant
landscape, archaeological and natural features of the area. In the case of outdoor
advertising signs, exterior features shall be construed to mean the style, material, size
and location of all such signs.
C. The State of North Carolina (including its agencies, political subdivisions and
instrumentalities), the City of Clinton and all public utilities shall be required to obtain a
certificate of appropriateness for construction, alteration, moving or demolition within the
historic district or on designated landmarks.

A. Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be obtained from and when
completed, filed with the administrator. The application shall be filed not less than 21
calendar days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Historic Preservation
Commission. Each application shall be accompanied by sketches, drawings,
photographs, specifications, descriptions and other information of sufficient detail to
clearly show the proposed exterior alterations, additions, changes or new construction.

include the aforementioned information will be accepted.
B. It shall be the policy of the Historic Preservation Commission, in regard to applications
involving new construction or extensive alterations and/or additions to existing
structures, that a sub-committee of the Historic Preservation Commission shall be
available to meet with persons involved in planned or pending applications in order to
advise them informally at an early stage in the development process concerning the
Historic Preservation Commissions guidelines, the nature of the area where the proposed
project will take place and other relevant factors. The members of the sub-committee,
collectively and individually, shall refrain from any indication of approval or disapproval.
Advice or opinions given by any member of the sub-committee at such an informal
meeting shall not be considered official or binding upon the Historic Preservation
Commission.
3.5.3.5 Application for Certificate of Appropriateness
A. The secretary of the Historic Preservation Commission shall, by a mailing that is sent not
less than seven (7) days prior to the meeting at which the matter is to be heard,

B. Applications for certificates of appropriateness shall be acted upon within 90 days after
filing, otherwise the application shall be deemed to be approved and certificate shall be
issued. An extension of time may be granted by mutual consent of the Historic
Preservation Commission and the applicant. As part of the review procedures the
Historic Preservation Commission may view the premises and seek the advice of the
Department of Cultural Resources or other such expert advice as it may deem necessary
under the circumstances.
C. The Historic Preservation Commission may hold a public hearing on any application
when deemed necessary. The action on an application shall be approval, approval with
conditions, or denial, and the decision of the Historic Preservation Commission must be
supported by specific findings-of-fact indicating the extent to which the application is or
is not congruous with the special character of the historic district or landmark.
D. Once issued, a certificate of appropriateness is valid for one (1) year. If after
commencement of work authorized by the certificate the work is not completed within
one year the certificate shall expire.
3.5.3.6 Hearings for Certificate of Appropriateness
A. Prior to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness, the applicant and other
property owners likely to be materially affected by the application shall be given an
opportunity to be heard. All meetings of the Historic Preservation Commission shall be
open to the public in accordance with the North Carolina Open Meetings Law, G.S. 143,
Article 33C.
3-28
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
B. The Historic Preservation Commission shall have no jurisdiction over interior
arrangement, except as provided below, and shall take no action under this ordinance
except to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, moving or
demolition of buildings, structures, appurtenant features, outdoor advertising signs or
other significant features which would be incongruous with the special character of the
historic district or landmark.
C. The jurisdiction of the Historic Preservation Commission over interior spaces shall be
limited to specific interior features of architectural, artistic or historical significance in
publicly owned landmarks; and of privately owned landmarks for which consent for
interior review has been given by the owners. Said consent of an owner for interior
review shall bind future owners and/or successors in title, provided such consent has been
filed in the Register of Deeds office and indexed according to the name of the owner of
the property in the grantor and grantee indexes. The landmark designation shall specify
the interior features to be reviewed and the specific nature of the Historic Preservation
Commissions jurisdiction over the interior.
D. In any action granting or denying a certificate of appropriateness, an appeal by an
aggrieved party may be taken to the Board of Adjustment. This hearing shall be
conducted using the record of the Historic Preservation Commission with no new
evidence being heard or considered when the Board of Adjustment makes decision on
appeal. (TA-9-14-1)
E. Written notice of the intent to appeal must be sent to the Historic Preservation
Commission, postmarked within 30 days following the decision. Appeals shall be in the
nature of certiorari. Appeals of decisions of the Board of Adjustment shall be heard by
the Superior Court of Sampson County.
F. The State of North Carolina shall have a right of appeal to the North Carolina Historical
Historic Preservation Commission, which shall render its decision within 30 days from
the date that a notice of appeal by the state is received by the Historic Preservation
Commission. The decision of the Historic Preservation Commission shall be final and
binding upon both the State and the Historic Preservation Commission.
3.5.3.7 Administrative Approval of Minor Works
A. Notwithstanding the subsection above (Action on Certificates of Appropriateness), upon
receipt of a completed application the Zoning Administrator may issue a certificate of
appropriateness for minor works that are consistent with the provisions of the review
criteria set forth in this chapter and the Design Principles and Guidelines adopted by the
Historic Preservation Commission. If the Zoning Administrator determines that an
applicant seeks a certificate of appropriateness for a minor work as defined herein, he
may waive the requirement that the application be submitted 21 days prior to the next
Historic Preservation Commission meeting and the requirement that the application
contain the names and addresses of nearby property owners.
3-29
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
B. Minor works are defined as those exterior changes that do not involve a change to the
visual character of the property but do not involve substantial alterations, additions or
removals that could impair the integrity of the property and/or district as a whole. The
Zoning Administrator shall make the determination as to whether the application involves
a minor work as defined herein.
C. The Zoning Administrator may approve but may not deny an application for a certificate
of appropriateness for minor works. If the Zoning Administrator decides not to issue a
certificate of appropriateness for a minor work, the application shall be referred to the
Historic Preservation Commission for action.
D. A decision by the Zoning Administrator to issue a certificate of appropriateness for minor
works may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in the same manner as other
decisions by the Zoning Administrator.
3.5.3.8 Review Criteria
A. No certificate of appropriateness shall be granted unless the Historic Preservation
Commission finds that the application complies with the principles and guidelines
adopted by the Historic Preservation Commission for review of changes. It is the intent
of these regulations to insure insofar as possible that construction, reconstruction,
alteration, restoration, moving or demolition of buildings, structures, appurtenant fixtures,
outdoor advertising signs or other significant features in the district or of landmarks shall
be congruous with the special character of the district or landmark. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Historic Preservation Commission may apply the above-mentioned
principles and guidelines in a manner that is consistent with their spirit, rather than
literally, when it concludes that the benefit derived from strict adherence to the principles
and guidelines is outweighed by the practical or financial hardships imposed on an
applicant by such literal application on non-contributing structures.
B. In addition to the principles and guidelines, the following features or elements of design
shall be considered in reviewing applications for certificates of appropriateness:
1. Lot coverage, defined as the percentage of the lot area covered by primary structures;
2. Setback, defined as the distance from the lot lines to the building;
3. Building height.
4. Spacing of buildings, defined as the distance between adjacent buildings;
5. Proportion, shape, positioning, location, pattern, sizes and style of all elements of
fenestration and entry doors;
6. Surface materials and textures;
7. Roof shapes, forms and materials;
8. Use of regional or local architectural traditions;
9. General form and proportion of buildings and structures and the relationship of
additions to the main structure;
10. Expression of architectural traditions;
11. Orientation of the building to the street;
12. Scale, determined by the size of the units of construction and architectural details in
relation to the human scale and also by the relationship of the building mass to
3-30
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
adjoining open space and nearby buildings and structures, maintenance of pedestrian
scale;
13. Proportion of width to height of the total building façade;
14. Archaeological sites and resources associated with standing structures;
15. Effect of trees and other landscape elements;
16. Major landscaping which would impact known archaeological sites;
17. Style, material, size and location of all outdoor advertising signs;
18. Appurtenant features and fixtures, such as lighting;
19. Structural condition and soundness;
20. Walls  physical ingredients, such as brick, stone or wood walls, wrought iron fences,
evergreen landscape masses;
21. Ground cover or paving; and
22. Significant landscape, archaeological and natural features.
C. The Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings shall be the sole principles of and guidelines used in
reviewing applications of the State of North Carolina for certificates of appropriateness.
3.5.3.9 Certain Changes Not Prohibited
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of
any exterior architectural feature in a historic district or of a landmark which does not
involve a change in design, materials or outer appearance thereof; the ordinary maintenance
or repair of streets, sidewalks, pavement markings, street signs or traffic signs; the
construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration or demolition of any such feature which
the Building Inspector shall certify is required for the public safety because of an unsafe or
dangerous condition. None of the foregoing work shall require a certificate of
appropriateness. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent (a) the maintenance or (b) in
the event of an emergency, the immediate restoration of the existing above-ground utility
structure without approval by the Historic Preservation Commission.
3.5.3.9 Delay in Demolition
A. An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition, removal or
destruction of a designated landmark or a building, structure or site within a historic
district may not be denied except as provided in subsection (C) below. However, the
effective date of such a certificate may be delayed for up to 365 days from the date of
approval. The period of delay shall be reduced by the Historic Preservation Commission
if it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all
beneficial use or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During the delay
period the Historic Preservation Commission shall negotiate with the owner in an effort
to find a means of preserving the building, structure or site. If the Historic Preservation
Commission finds that a building, structure or site has no special significance or value
toward maintaining the character of a district, it shall waive all or part of such period of
delay and authorize earlier demolition or removal.
B. If the Historic Preservation Commission has voted to recommend the designation of a
landmark or the designation of an area as a historic district and final designation has not
3-31
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
been made by the City Council, the demolition or destruction of any building, structure or
site in the proposed district or on the property of the designated landmark may be delayed
by the Historic Preservation Commission for up to 180 days or until the City Council
takes final action on the designation, whichever occurs first.
C. The City Council may enact an ordinance to prevent the demolition by neglect of any
designated landmark or any structure or building within the established historic district.
Such ordinance shall provide appropriate safeguards to protect property owners from
undue hardship.
D. An application for a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the demolition of a
building, structure or site determined by the State Historic Preservation Officer as having
statewide significance as defined in the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places
may be denied except where the Historic Preservation Commission finds that the owner
would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use or return
by virtue of the denial.
3.5.3.10 Demolition by Neglect
A. The exterior features of any building or structure, including walls, fences, light
fixtures, steps, pavement, paths, or any other appurtenant feature, or any type of
outdoor advertising sign, either designated as a historic landmark or located within a
local historic district shall be preserved by the owner or such other person who may
have legal possession, custody, and control thereof against decay and deterioration
and kept free from structural defects.
B. The owner, or other person having such legal possession, custody, and control, shall
upon written request by the City repair such exterior features if they are found to be
deteriorating, or if their condition is contributing to deterioration, including but not
limited to any of the following defects:
1. Deterioration of exterior walls, foundations or other vertical support that causes
leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling.
2. Deterioration of flooring or floor supports, roofs, or other horizontal members
that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling.
3. Deterioration of external chimneys that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing,
or buckling.

coverings, including lack of paint, or weathering due to lack of paint or other
protective covering.
7. Rotting, holes, and other forms of decay.

3-32
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
10. Deterioration of fences, gates, and accessory structures.
11. Deterioration that has a detrimental effect upon the special character of the
district as a whole or the unique attributes and character of the historic landmark.
12. Deterioration of any exterior feature so as to create or permit the creation of any
hazardous or unsafe conditions to life, health, or other property.
C. The Historic Preservation Commission or any other interested party may file a
petition listing specific defects with the Zoning Administrator requesting that he act
under the following procedures to require the correction of deterioration or making of
repairs to any historic landmark or significant structure located within the local
historic district so that such structure shall be preserved and protected in accordance
with the purposes of this chapter.
1. Whenever a petition is filed with the Zoning Administrator charging that a
structure is undergoing demolition by neglect, the Zoning Administrator, or a
designated agent, shall, if preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such
charges, within seven days issue and cause to be served upon the owner and/or
such other person who may have legal possession, custody, and control thereof,
as such person may be determined by reasonable diligence, a complaint stating
the charges in that respect and containing a notice that a hearing will be held
before the Zoning Administrator at a place within the city in which the property
is located therein fixed not less than 30 nor more than 45 days after the serving
of such complaint; that the owner and/or parties in interest shall be given a right
to answer and to give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint; that
the Historic Preservation Commission shall also be given notice of the hearing;
and that the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be
controlling in hearings before the Zoning Administrator. The purpose of the
hearing is to receive evidence concerning the charge of deterioration and to
ascertain whether the owner and/or parties in interest wishes to petition the
Historic Preservation Commission for a claim of undue economic hardship.
2. If after such notice and hearing, the Zoning Administrator determines that the
structure is undergoing demolition by neglect because it is deteriorating, or if its
condition is contributing to deterioration, according the standards of the previous
section of this ordinance, the Zoning Administrator shall state in writing the
findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be
served upon the owner and/or other parties in interest therein an order to repair
within the time specified those elements of the structure that are deteriorating,
contributing to deterioration, or deteriorated. In the event that the owner and/or
other parties in interest wish to petition for a claim of undue economic hardship,
the Zoning Administrators order shall be stayed until after the Historic
Preservation Commissions determination. Findings made by the Zoning
Administrator or Historic Preservation Commission may be appealed to the
board of adjustment.
3. If after receipt of the findings of fact and order to repair, the property owner does
not comply within the time specified, upon direction by City Council the Zoning
Administrator may institute, perform and complete the necessary repairs to
prevent deterioration and/or demolition by neglect and the expenses incurred by
3-33
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
the City for such work, labor, and materials shall be a lien against the property,
and draw interest at the legal rate, the amount to be amortized over a period of
ten years subject to a public sale if there is a default in payment.
3.5.3.11 Enforcement & Remedies
A. Compliance with the terms of the certificate of appropriateness shall be enforced by the
Zoning Administrator. Failure to comply with the certificate shall be a violation of the
Land Development Code and is punishable according to established procedures and
penalties for such violations in Chapter 15 of this Ordinance.
B. In case any building, structure, site, area or object designated as a landmark or within a
historic district is about to be demolished, whether as a result of deliberate neglect or
otherwise materially altered, remodeled, removed or destroyed except in compliance with
this ordinance, the City Council, the Historic Preservation Commission, or other party
aggrieved by such action may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to prevent
such unlawful demolition, destruction, material alteration, remodeling or removal to
restrain, correct or abate such violation or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with
respect to such a building or structure.
Section 3.6 Conditional Zoning Districts
3.6.1 Purpose
A. Conditional Zoning districts are created to correspond to each of the base zoning districts
created in Section 3.2. Conditional Zoning (CZ) Districts allow specific uses to be
established in accordance with prescribed conditions pertaining to an individual project.
B. The purpose is to provide a voluntary alternative procedure for the rezoning of a property for
a specific use. A broad range of uses are permitted in the base district. However, there are
instances where a base zoning district designation is clearly inappropriate for a property, but
a specific use or uses permitted under this district and subject to development requirements
would be consistent with the spirit and intent of this Ordinance. Conditional Zoning
districts, herein established, are intended to accommodate such situations. This voluntary
procedure is intended for firm development proposals, and is neither intended nor suited for
securing early zoning for tentative uses which may not be undertaken for a long period of
time.
C. There are 13 base zoning districts, there are 13 corresponding Conditional Zoning Districts.
An additional two (2) districts are only available for use as Conditional Zoning Districts,
PRD and MU
 CZ PC Conditional Zoning Public Conservation District
 CZ RA-20 Conditional Zoning Residential/Agricultural District
 CZ R-20 Conditional Zoning Very Low Density Residential District
 CZ R-15 Conditional Zoning Low Density Residential District
 CZ R-8 Conditional Zoning Medium Density Residential District
 CZ R-6 Conditional Zoning High Density Residential District
 CZ NS Conditional Zoning Neighborhood Shopping District
3-34
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
 CZ OI Conditional Zoning Office & Institutional District
 CZ CB Conditional Zoning Central Business District
 CZ HC Conditional Zoning Highway Commercial District
 CZ I-1 Conditional Zoning Light Industrial District
 CZ I-2 Conditional Zoning Heavy Industrial District
 CZ PI Conditional Zoning Planned Industrial District
 CZ PRD Conditional Zoning Planned Residential District (CZ only)
 CZ MU Conditional Zoning Mixed Use District (CZ only)
3.6.2 Applicability
A. Property may be placed in a Conditional Zoning District only in response to a petition by the
owners of all the property to be included.
B. Specific conditions applicable to these districts may be proposed by the petitioner or the City
or its agencies, but only those conditions mutually approved by the City and the petitioner
may be incorporated into the requirements of the district. Conditions and site-specific
standards imposed in a Conditional Zoning District shall be limited to those that address the
conformance of the development and use of the site to the Citys ordinances and to any
officially adopted comprehensive or other plan and those that address the impacts reasonably
expected to be generated by the development or use of the site.
C. Conditional Zoning Districts allows specific standards for a particular use after review and
comment from the public. A petition to rezone a property to a Conditional Zoning District
shall be accompanied by a site specific plan.
D. Within a CZ district, only those uses authorized as either permitted or conditional uses in the
base zoning district with which the CZ district corresponds shall be permitted, and all other
requirements of the corresponding district shall be met as minimum standards.
E. In approving a CZ district, the City Council may impose such additional reasonable and
appropriate safeguards upon such permit as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose
and intent of this Ordinance are served, public welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
F. If for any reason any condition imposed pursuant to these regulations is found to be illegal or
invalid or if the applicant should fail to accept any condition, it is the intent of this Ordinance
that the authorization of such CZ district shall be null and void and of no effect, and that
proceedings shall be instituted to rezone the property to its previous zoning classification.
G. Conditional Zoning districts shall be approved through the map amendment approval process
outlined in Chapter 14.
3.6.3 Planned Residential District Standards
A. A Planned Residential District shall only be considered as a Conditional Zoning District.
3-35
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 3: ZONING DISTRICTS
B. Residential Uses; Variety of Housing. The Planned Unit Development is designed to allow
a variety of dwelling types and to provide for creative approaches to the development of
land. The following list and definitions is an example of some of the housing, uses and
structures allowed in a Planned Unit Development.
1. Zero Lot-Line House: A single-family detached unit, which instead of being centered
on the lot, is placed against one of the side lot lines. Any wall constructed on the side
lot line shall be a solid wall with the exception of a few windows located on the ground
floor for cross ventilation and lighting.
2. Townhouse: A single-family attached dwelling in which units share common side
walls and are often designed in rows. Yard areas are small and privacy requires careful
protection. The minimum number of townhouse units attached to each other shall be
two (2) and the maximum number shall be eight (8).
3. Proposed dimensional standard that differ from the standards set forth in Section 3.4.2
may be considered if submitted as part of the Conditional Zoning District request.
Additional dimensional standard for lots in Planned Residential Developments shall be
as follows:
a. Zero Lot-Line House. Side Yard Setback: Shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet if
not utilizing the zero lot line provision. The minimum side yard when constructing
a zero lot-line development shall be 16 feet on the side yard opposite of the zero lotline
construction.
b. A five foot maintenance easement and a maximum eave encroachment of 32 inches
within the maintenance shall be established in the deed and covenants of the
adjoining lot. This will provide ready access to the lot line wall at reasonable
periods of the day for normal maintenance.
c. Townhouse. Side Yard Setback: Shall be a minimum of 15 feet from the side
property line opposite of the shared common wall.

4.2.4 Conservation Developments
The purpose of Conservation Development design is to preserve agricultural and forestry lands,
natural and cultural features, and rural character that would be likely lost through conventional
development approaches. Lot sizes in residential districts may be reduced subject to the
following requirements:
A. The development density shall not exceed the overall density permitted in the zoning district
in which the development is located. A Yield Plan shall be provided at the pre-application
conference. The purpose of the Yield Plan is to determine the maximum permissible density
of the subject property. Permissible density shall be calculated using the underlying zoning
district(s). Yield Plans shall be conceptual in nature and are not intended to involve
significant engineering costs, they shall be realistic and not show development in areas that
would not ordinarily be legally permitted in a conventional layout (i.e. the location of streets
or residential lots in wetland areas).
B. A minimum of 50 percent of the total area of the development shall be set aside in Common
Open Space and shall meet the open space requirements of Chapter 7.
C. Public water and sewer shall serve the site.
D. Each Conditional Use Permit site plan for a Conservation Development shall follow a fourstep
design process as described below. When the conceptual site plan is submitted,
applicants shall be prepared to demonstrate to the City that these four design steps were
followed by their site designers in determining the layout of their proposed streets, house lots
and open space.
1. During the first step all potential Conservation Areas (both Primary and Secondary) shall
be identified, using an Existing Conditions Survey as outlined in Section 7.1.2. Primary
Conservation Areas shall consist of wetlands and other environmentally protected areas.
Secondary Conservation Areas shall include the most sensitive and noteworthy natural,
scenic and cultural resources.
2. During the second step, potential house sites are tentatively located. Because the
proposed location of the houses within each lot represents a significant decision with
potential impacts on the ability of the development to meet the Subdivision applicants
shall identify tentative house sites on the conceptual Sketch Plan. House sites should
generally be located not closer than 50 feet to Primary Conservation Areas.
3. The third step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each
house in the most reasonable and economical way. When lots and access streets are laid
out, they shall be located in a way that avoids, or at least minimizes, adverse impacts on
both the Primary and Secondary Conservation Areas. Wetland crossings shall be
avoided. Street connections shall be provided to minimize the number of cul-de-sacs and

CHAPTER 4: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
to facilitate easy access to and from homes in different parts of the property (and on

CHAPTER 6: SIGNS
Section 6.1 Permit Required for Signs
A. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, no sign may be constructed, erected, moved,
enlarged, illuminated or substantially altered except in accordance with the provisions of this
Article. Mere repainting or changing the message of a sign shall not, in and of itself be
considered a substantial alteration.
B. If plans submitted for a Zoning or Conditional Use Permit include sign plans in sufficient
detail that the permit issuing authority can determine whether the proposed sign or signs
comply with the provisions of this Ordinance, then issuance of the requested Zoning or
Conditional Use Permit shall constitute approval of the proposed sign or signs.
C. Signs not approved as provided in Subsection (B), or exempted under the provisions
referenced in Subsection (A), may be constructed, erected, moved, enlarged, illuminated, or
substantially altered, only in accordance with a Sign Permit issued by the Administrator.
1. Sign Permit applications and Sign Permits shall be governed by the same provisions of
this Ordinance applicable to Zoning Permits.
2. In the case of a lot occupied or intended to be occupied by multiple business enterprises
(e.g., a shopping center), Sign Permits shall be issued in the name of the lot owner or
his/her agent, rather than in the name of the individual business enterprise requesting a
particular sign. The City may assist the owner by suggesting a formula whereby the
maximum square footage of sign area allowed on the lot may be allocated equitably
among all tenants, but the City shall be responsible for enforcing only the provisions of
this Ordinance, and not the provisions of any allocation formula, lease, or other private
restriction.
D. Signs for which a Sign Permit has been issued may be relocated in conformance with the
regulations of this Chapter upon notification to the Administrator. Signs that are
nonconforming shall be subject to Section 13.2.
Section 6.2 General Provisions
6.2.1 Determining the Number of Signs
A. For the purpose of determining the number of signs, a sign shall be considered to be a single
display surface or display device containing elements organized, related, and composed to
form a unit. Where matter is displayed in a random manner without organized relationship of
elements, each element shall be considered a single sign.
B. A two (2) sided or multi-sided sign shall be regarded as one sign so long as:
1. With respect to a V-type sign, the two (2) sides are at no point separated by a distance
that exceeds five (5) feet, and
2. With respect to double-faced (back-to-back) signs, the distance between the backs of
each face of the sign does not exceed three (3) feet.
6-3
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 6: SIGNS
6.2.2 Computation of Sign Area
A. The surface of a sign shall be computed by including the entire unit within a single,
continuous, rectilinear perimeter forming 90o angles, enclosing the extreme limits of the
writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming
an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the
backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework
or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself, except as defined in Subsection (B).
B. With respect to three-dimensional or multi-sided signs (excluding double-face signs), the
total sign surface area of all sides shall not exceed twice the maximum sign surface area as
provided herein.
C. With respect to decorative base or pylon mounted sign displays, the base or pylon shall not
be utilized in the calculation of sign display area, provided the total area of such base or
pylon does not exceed 50 percent of the total sign display surface area. In cases where the
base or pylon area exceeds 50 percent of the total sign display area, such base or pylon shall
be deemed to constitute a sign as defined herein and shall be utilized in the calculation of
total sign area.
6.2.3 General Sign Location
A. As provided in the Permitted Uses Table, no off-premises signs (except those exempted from
regulation or permit requirements under Sections 6.3 or 6.4) may be located in any district
other than an industrial district.
B. No sign may be located so that it substantially interferes with the view necessary for
motorists to proceed safely through intersections or to enter onto or exit from public streets
or private roads.
C. No sign may be erected so that by its location, color, size, shape, nature, or message, it would
tend to obstruct the view of, or be confused with, official traffic signs or other signs erected
by governmental agencies.
D. Freestanding signs shall be securely fastened to the ground or to some other substantial
supportive structure so that there is virtually no danger that either the sign or the supportive
structure may be moved by the wind or other forces of nature and cause injury to persons or
property.
E. No sign shall be erected, maintained, painted or drawn on any tree, rock, natural feature or
utility pole. Utility pole shall include, but not be limited to, any traffic control, lighting,
power, telephone or other similar utility pole.
F. No sign or supporting structure may be located in or over the traveled portion of any public
right-of-way unless the sign is attached to a structural element of a building and an
encroachment permit has been obtained from the City or the State Department of
Transportation. In such cases, the sign must be at least eight (8) feet above ground level, and
no larger than six (6) square feet in area.

City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 6: SIGNS
Section 6.3 Exempt Signs
The following signs shall not require a Sign Permit under this Chapter, provided however, any

agency and fully conform to all safety provisions established by the Ordinance. For the
purposes of this section, official signs shall include any sign erected by the City of Clinton.
D. On-premise flags and balloons, insignia shall be allowed subject to all of the following
requirements:

ground attachment point to the right-of-way line or to all ground points determined by
a 90o vertical line extending from the closest overhead utility transmission and/or
distribution line as projected upon the ground, whichever is closer. The purpose of
this requirement is to provide a 25-foot clear fall zone in the event of the balloons

B. Except as authorized by Subsection (C), no lot or development may have more than one
freestanding sign. However, If a lot development is located on a corner and has at least 150
feet of frontage on each of the two (2) intersecting public streets, then the lot or development
may have not more than one freestanding sign along each side of the lot or development
bordered by such streets.
C. If a lot or development has 300 or more feet of frontage on a public street, then the lot or
development may have not more than two (2) freestanding signs along such street, provided
such signs are spaced not less than 100 feet apart as measured from the center of the sign.
6-12
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 6: SIGNS
D. For purposes of this Section, a side of a freestanding sign is any plane or flat surface included
in the calculation of the total sign surface area as provided in Section 6.2. For example, wall
signs typically have one (1) side. Freestanding signs typically have two (2) sides (back-toback),
although four-sided and other multi-sided signs are also common.
E. Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter or Chapter 4 (Special Requirements), a single side
of a freestanding sign may not exceed ½ square foot in surface area for every linear foot of
frontage along the street toward which the sign is primarily oriented, except that an
additional ½ square foot in sign surface area may be permitted for every linear foot of
setback of the primary building beyond the minimum front setback. However, in no case
may a single side of a freestanding sign exceed 125 square feet in surface area. (TA-12-10-1)
F. With respect to freestanding signs that have no discernable sides, such as spheres or other
shapes not composed of flat planes, no such freestanding sign may exceed one square foot in
total surface area for every linear foot of lot frontage along the street toward which each sign
is primarily oriented. However, in no case may such sign exceed 200 square feet in surface
area.
G. For purposes of this Section, a single side of a double-face freestanding sign shall be
considered as the total display surface for the calculation of sign area, provided such sides are
separated no more than three (3) feet at any point.
6.6.2 Wall Signs & Permanent Window Signs
A. No wall sign may extend above any parapet walls or above rooflines of buildings without
parapet walls. No wall sign shall extend above the lower eave line of a building with a
pitched roof, except if the roof is a mansard-type, in which case the sign may be attached flat
against, but not extend above said roof.
B. No sign attached to a building may project more than 12 inches from the building wall.
C. Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter or Chapter 4 (Special Requirements) the maximum
sign surface area permitted for any residential use shall be three (3) square feet.
D. Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter or Chapter 4 (Special Requirements), wall signs
including permanent window signs for walls with one hundred (100) feet or less in linear
footage, shall have a total sign surface area in square feet no greater than two times the linear
frontage in feet of the wall of the building to in which the sign is attached, but in no case
greater than two hundred (200) square feet. Wall signs for walls, which exceed one hundred
(100) feet in length, may have a total sign surface area in square feet equal to one (1) foot per
each linear foot of wall or two hundred (200) square feet, whichever is greater.
E. The display area of wall signs painted on, affixed to, or otherwise displayed on or through a
façade window shall not exceed 25 percent of the window area.
F. If a lot has frontage on more than one (1) street, then the total sign surface area permitted on
that lot shall be the sum of the sign surface area allotments related to each street on which the
6-13
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 6: SIGNS
lot has frontage. However, the total sign surface area that is oriented toward a particular
street may not exceed the portion of the lots total sign surface area allocation that is derived
from frontage on that street.
G. Whenever a lot is situated such that it has no street frontage on any lot boundary and an
applicant desires to install on such a lot a sign that is oriented toward a street, then the total
sign surface area permitted on that lot shall be the sign surface area that would be allowed if
the lot boundary closest to the street toward which such sign is to be oriented fronted on such
street. The applicant shall be restricted to using only one street and the closest lot boundary
to this street for determining the total permitted sign surface area. However, the applicant
shall be given the opportunity to determine the one street used in the calculations.
6.6.3 Special Provisions for Certain Signs
A. Subdivision Entrance and Multi-family Development Entrance Signs. At any entrance to
a residential subdivision or multi-family development, there may be not more than two (2)
sign. A single side of any such sign may not exceed 50 square feet in surface area. No such
signs shall exceed a height of 10 feet above the property grade. In cases where such signs are
mounted on decorative functional or nonfunctional walls, the wall area shall not be used to
calculate total sign surface area.

Section 7.1 Environmental Assessment & Suitability of Land
7.1.1 Preservation of Trees & Natural Features Encouraged
A. Significant forest stands, natural vegetation, specimen trees, severe natural topography,
drainage features and water courses are encouraged to be preserved to the extent that is
reasonable and practical while otherwise not reasonably prohibiting development.
B. Forested and vegetated areas whose physical site conditions render them unsuitable for
development should be set aside as conservation areas or as open space. Wooded sites
should be developed with careful consideration of the natural characteristics of the site.
When portions of forested stands must be developed, careful consideration should be given
to preserving wooded perimeters or the most desirable natural features in order to retain the
aesthetic or visual character of the site. Isolated pockets of existing trees or specimen trees
should be protected as a valuable asset of the property.
7.1.2 Existing Conditions Survey
Existing Conditions Surveys are required at the Preliminary Plat stage for all Major Subdivisions
and for all multi-family residential development. Identification of existing tree stands, known
endangered species, wetlands, streams and creeks, floodplains, and topographical features on a
site prior to the advanced preparation of development plans enables the reasonable and practical
planned preservation of existing vegetation while considering unique site conditions.

CHAPTER 7: OPEN SPACE & RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
B. Access from a street shall be provided to all designated open space with a minimum 15 foot
wide access to the open space area. Lakes or ponds within the subdivision used as open
space shall provide adequate community access.
C. Open space shall be contiguous wherever possible.
D. City and County plans, particularly park and open space plans, shall be considered when
evaluating proposals for dedication. If a properly located future greenway in the City of
Clinton Comprehensive Pedestrian Plan, then the greenway open space type in Section 7.2.4
shall be used to meet minimum open space standards.
E. Open space shall consist of land no more than 25 percent of which lies within a floodplain or
floodway.
7.2.4 Types of Open Space
All required open space shall be classified in accordance with this Section. Dedicated open
space shall fit into one or more of the following categories and be classified as private common
area open space or public open space. The Existing Conditions Survey should be used as a guide
to determine the most appropriate open space type and location.
A. Playground-Playgrounds are for active recreational use and provide sunny and shaded play
equipment and play areas for children as well as open shelter with benches. Playgrounds
may be part of other types of open space, such as parks, or may stand alone.
Minimum Size: 10,000 square feet
Maximum Size: 20,000 square feet
B. Square-Squares are areas for passive recreational use. Squares shall be bounded by streets on
a minimum of 50 percent of their perimeter. Squares are encouraged to be entirely bounded
by streets and/or lanes. Squares shall be planted parallel to all streets and shall contain
canopy trees along street frontages.
Minimum size: 2,000 square feet
Maximum size: 1 acre
7-5
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 7: OPEN SPACE&RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
C. Park-Parks may be designed for passive and/or active recreational use. Parks shall be
bounded by streets on a minimum of 10 percent of their perimeter. Large parks should create
a central open space which services an entire neighborhood or group of neighborhoods; or
incorporates physical features which are an asset to the community (i.e. lake or river
frontage, high ground, significant stands of trees). Undergrowth should be limited and
landscaping shall be installed in a manner that promotes attractiveness and safety. Parks may
be combined with greenways and greenbelts and may include golf courses and community
gardens.
Minimum size: 1 acre
D. Green- The green is an open space which is more natural. Like the square, it is small and
surrounded by buildings. Unlike the square, it is informally planted and may have irregular
topography. Greens are usually landscaped with trees at the edges and open lawns at the
center. Greens should contain no structures other than benches, pavilions, and memorials;
paths are optional.
Minimum size: 20,000 square feet
7-6
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 7: OPEN SPACE & RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
E. Greenway-Greenways are large, irregular open spaces designed to incorporate natural
settings such as creeks and significant stands of trees within and between neighborhoods.
Greenways are typically more natural and may contain irregular topography. Greenways
shall be used for certain active recreational uses including, at a minimum, trails for walking,
jogging, and biking. Greenways shall connect points of interest in the community such as
schools, parks, and other civic uses. This open space type shall be used for any development
that is shown along a designated greenway corridor within the City of Clinton
Comprehensive Pedestrian Plan.
F. Greenbelt-Greenbelts run along the perimeter of a neighborhood, and serve to buffer a
neighborhood from surrounding non-compatible uses such as a highway corridor or industrial

CHAPTER 7: OPEN SPACE&RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
district, or a developed area from agricultural areas or adjacent municipalities. Greenbelts
differ from the other types of open spaces in that they are left natural, and are not intended
for recreational use.
G. Agricultural Preserve-Open spaces designated as Agricultural Preserves shall be used for
active farming in the form of crop cultivation, the keeping of livestock, or equestrian
facilities. Agricultural Preserves are encouraged to protect areas of agricultural and rural
heritage and promote compatible active agricultural operations.
Minimum size: 5 acres
H. Nature Preserve-Open spaces designated as Nature Preserves shall be left largely
undisturbed except for the optional clearing of underbrush for the provision of a walking trail
(mulch or other natural material only). Nature Preserve areas are encouraged to protect large
stands of trees, wildlife, and natural water features. Nature Preserves are the preferred form
of open space for steep slopes in excess of 25 percent grade.
Minimum size: 3 acres

CHAPTER 7: OPEN SPACE & RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
Section 7.3 Open Space Ownership & Maintenance
A. Open space may be owned or administered by one or a combination of the following
methods:
 Fee simple ownership by a unit of government or private non-profit land conservancy;
 Common ownership by Homeowners Association;
 Split deeded ownership by individual property owners within the subdivision;
 By individual private ownership such as a farmer, developer or other private entity that
maintains the open space in accordance with the purposes of this Chapter (i.e. farming,
equestrian facility, etc. excluding confined livestock operations).
 Deed restricted open space easements on individual private properties.
B. The City Council shall have the authority to accept or reject land dedications made as a
requirement of this Section. They shall also have authority to sell land accepted pursuant to
this section with the proceeds of such sale used only for the acquisition, expansion or
improvement of recreation, park, or open space sites.
C. The owner of dedicated open space shall be responsible for the continuing upkeep and proper
maintenance of the same.
D. In the case of common ownership by a Homeowners Association, the restrictive covenants
shall provide that, in the event the Homeowners Association fails to maintain the open space
according to the standards of this Ordinance, the City may, following reasonable notice,
demand that deficiency of maintenance be corrected, or enter the open space to maintain it.
The cost of such maintenance shall be charged to the Homeowners Association.
E. The developer shall place in a conspicuous manner upon the Final Plat of the subdivision a
notation concerning control of open space.
F. The developer will provide proof of registration of the Articles of Incorporation with the
appropriate state agency for the formation of the Homeowners Association to the
Subdivision Administrator.
G. Homeowners' Associations or similar legal entities that are responsible for the maintenance
and control of open space areas and common areas shall be established by the developer who
shall record in the Register of Deeds a declaration of covenants and restrictions that will
govern the association or similar legal entity. A copy of the recorded document shall be
provided to the Administrator and such document shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
1. Provision for the establishment of the association or similar entity is required before any
lot in the development is sold or any building occupied and membership shall be
mandatory for each homeowner and any successive buyer.
7-9
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 7: OPEN SPACE&RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
2. The association or similar legal entity has clear legal authority to maintain and exercise
control over such common open space areas.
3. The association or similar legal entity has the power to compel contributions from
residents of the development to cover their proportionate shares of the costs associated
with the maintenance and upkeep of such common areas. Further, assessments levied can
become a lien on the property if allowed in the master deed establishing the homeowners
association or similar legal entity.
4. The open space restrictions must be permanent, not just for a period of years.
5. The association or similar legal entity must be responsible for liability insurance,
applicable taxes and the maintenance open space and other facilities under their control.
6. The association or similar legal entity must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changing needs.
7. The association shall be responsible for maintaining all public storm water drainage
systems and easements within the subdivision not being maintained by the City, County,
State or other approved entity.
8. It shall be expressly stated within the restrictive covenants/homeowners association
documents that it will be the responsibility of the developer or successors or assigns to
enforce such covenants or restrictions until such time as control has been transferred to
the Homeowners Association Board of Directors. It shall be the sole responsibility of the
developer, successor or assigns to correct any deficiencies prior to transfer of control
over to the Homeowners Association Board of Directors.
Section 7.4 Payment-in-Lieu of Dedication
A. If open space within a development is physically impractical due to unusual conditions then
the City may accept a fee paid in lieu of dedication.
B. Fees collected in lieu of dedications and any proceeds from such transactions or sales shall
be accounted for by the City, and the funds shall be used by the City for the purposes of
acquiring and developing recreation, greenway and open space areas as shown on the land
development plan or in the parks and recreation and greenway/bikeway master plans and for
no other purposes. The depository for such funds may be the same as permitted other funds
of the City, pending their expenditure in accordance with the terms of this code; such funds
may be invested as other funds of the City. The City may, at its discretion, add additional
monies to the fund for the purposes of purchasing open space and recreational land to be
used for recreational purposes.
C. Refunds shall not be granted to the developer should the project not be constructed after
recording of Final Plat or if a reduction in density occurs.
7-10
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 7: OPEN SPACE & RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
D. Such payment in lieu of dedication shall be the product of the current assessed market value
of the land to be subdivided (as established in subsection E below) multiplied by the number
of acres to be dedicated.
E. The current assessed market value of the gross land area of the development or subdivision
at the time of submission of the required plan and/or plat shall be used to determine the land
value. The current assessed market value shall be the appropriate value as determined by and
maintained on file in the Sampson County Tax Office. The average value per gross acres
shall be calculated from this total tax value and applied to the required recreational land area
in order to determine the land value.
TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF UNDEVELOPED PROPERTY X ACRES OF REQUIRED OPEN SPACE= PAYMENT
TOTAL ACRES OF UNDEVELOPED PROPERTY
Section 7.5 Flexibility in Administration Authorized
A. The requirements set forth in this Chapter concerning the amount, size, location, and nature
of recreational facilities and open space to be provided in connection with residential
developments are established by the City Council as standards that presumptively will result
in the provision of that amount of recreational facilities and open space that is consistent with
officially adopted City plans. The Council recognizes, however, that due to the particular
nature of a tract of land, or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation, or other
factors, the underlying objectives of this Chapter may be achieved even though the standards
are not adhered to with mathematical precision. Therefore, the permit-issuing authority is
authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that: (i)
the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them; and
(ii) because of peculiarities in the developers tract of land or the facilities proposed it would
be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards.
B. Whenever the permit-issuing authority authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth
in this Chapter pursuant to Subsection (A), the official record of action taken on the
development application shall contain a statement of the reasons for allowing the deviation.

for development, including 15 feet beyond the furthest rear portion of the construction site
when the entire parcel is not being developed.
B. Although not required, planting of trees and other live vegetation to provide a more pleasing
view from the travel ways and to provide a continuity of vegetation throughout the City is
preferred.
8.1.2 Incentives for Additional Green Space and Landscaping
In addition to the 15 percent minimum green space requirement, incentives are available for
creating additional green space and/or landscaping on the site. For every five (5) percent
increase in green space, 10 percent can be reduced from the total parking requirement. Where 30
percent or more area is provided or reserved as green space, a 30 percent reduction in the
required total parking spaces will be allowed. If trees are planted or preserved, parking spaces
may also be reduced. For every three (3) large trees, or for every eight (8) ornamental trees,
planted/preserved per acre, five (5) parking spaces may be reduced from the total spaces
required. At least five (5) large shade trees shall be planted/preserved and/or at least 10
ornamental trees planted/preserved per acre to qualify for a 30 percent reduction in total parking
spaces required.

B. Small ornamental trees shall be a minimum of one inch caliper, have a minimum height of
six (6) feet from the ground surface, and not be located within a right-of-way.
8.1.5 Exceptions to Green Space and Landscaping Requirements
It is the intent of this Chapter that existing development shall not be required to comply with the
regulations contained in this Chapter unless such development is expanded or is substantially
altered.
Section 8.2 Buffers
A. Buffer strips shall be required where any use permitted in the NS (Neighborhood Shopping),
HC (Highway Commercial), I-1 (Light Industrial), I-2 (Heavy Industrial), and PI (Planned
Industrial) districts abuts land zoned for residential use.
B. Unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this Ordinance, buffer strips shall be composed of
evergreen plantings and shall be no less than six (6) feet in height and fifteen (15) feet in
width at the time of planting.
C. The applicant may choose to install a fence with evergreen plants to satisfy the buffer
requirements of Section 8.2 with the approval of the permit issuing authority. Any fence
used to meet the requirements of this section shall be a minimum six (6) feet in height,
opaque, constructed of vinyl or composite wood and constructed so the finished side of the
fence faces the residential use. The use of a fence allows for a 50 percent reduction in the
evergreen buffer requirements of this section. All fences must remain free from mold and
any areas of the fence that are broken or damaged must be replaced.
D. The buffering requirements may be waived by the City Council upon recommendation of the
Planning Board along a boundary that is naturally screened by evergreen plan materials or
8-5

CHAPTER 8: LANDSCAPING &BUFFERING
topography. The buffer requirement may be deferred by the City Council in isolated areas.
In residential PRDs (Planned Residential Developments), buffering may be waived in lieu of
a fence as approved by the City Council.
Section 8.3 Flexibility in Administration Required
A. The City Council recognizes that, due to the particularities of any given development, the
inflexible application of the landscaping standards set forth in this Chapter, may result in a
development either with inadequate landscaping or landscaping far in excess of its needs.
Therefore, the permit issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive
requirements of Sections 8.1 & 8.2, and may require more landscaping or allow landscaping,
whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in
Sections 8.1 & 8.2.
B. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit issuing authority may allow
deviations from the requirements set forth in Sections 8.1 & 8.2, when it finds that:
1. Existing development is situated in such a manner to prevent full compliance; or
2. Existing landscaping satisfies the requirements.
C. Whenever the permit issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive
requirements set forth in Sections 8.1 & 8.2, it shall enter on the face of the permit the
requirement that it imposes, and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation.

CHAPTER 9: PARKING
Section 9.1 Number of Parking Spaces Required
A. All developments in all zoning districts other than the CB District shall provide a sufficient
number of parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely to
be attracted to the development in question.
B. The presumptions established by this Chapter are that: (i) a development must comply with
the parking standards set forth in Subsection (E) to satisfy the requirement stated in
Subsection (A), and (ii) any development that does not meet these standards is not in
compliance. However, the Parking Requirements Table is only intended to establish a
presumption and should be flexibly administered, as provided in Section 9.10 (Flexibility in
Administration Required).
C. When determination of the number of parking spaces required by the Parking Requirements
Table results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of ½ or less may be
disregarded, while a fraction in excess of ½ shall be counted as one parking space.
D. The City Council recognizes that the Parking Requirements Table set forth in Section 9.2
cannot and does not cover every possible situation that may arise. Therefore, in cases not
specifically covered, the permit-issuing authority is authorized to determine the parking
requirements using the Table as a guide.
E. See the Parking Requirements Table in Section 9.2 below for minimum and maximum
parking space requirements.
F. The minimum number of handicap accessible spaces shall be provided as follows:

CHAPTER 9: PARKING
Section 9.3 Parking Area Dimensions
A. Subject to Subsections (B), and (C), each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at
least 19 feet long and nine (9) feet wide. Lines demarcating parking spaces may be drawn at
various angles in relation to curbs or aisles, so long as the parking spaces so created contain
within them the rectangular area required by this Section.
B. In parking areas containing 10 or more parking spaces, up to 20 percent of the parking spaces
may contain a rectangular area of 7½ feet in width by 15 feet in length. If such spaces are
provided, they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved for small or compact cars only.
C. Wherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel parking, the dimensions of
such parking shall be no less than 22 feet by nine (9) feet.
D. Parking area aisle widths shall conform to the following Table that varies the width
requirements according to the angle of parking.
Parking Angle
Aisle Width 0 Degrees 30 Degrees 45 Degrees 60 Degrees 90 Degrees
One-Way
Traffic
13 11 13 18 24
Two-Way
Traffic
19 20 21 23 24
E. Driveways shall not be less than 10 feet in width for one-way traffic and 18 feet in width for
two-way traffic, except that 10-foot wide driveways are permissible for two-way traffic
when:
1. the driveway is no longer than 50 feet,
2. it provides access to not more than 6 spaces, and
3. sufficient turning space is provided so that vehicles need not back into a public street.
Section 9.4 General Design Requirements
A. Unless no other practicable alternative is available, parking lots shall be designed so that,
vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street. This requirement does not
apply to parking areas consisting of driveways that serve one (1) or two (2) dwelling units,
although backing onto arterial streets is discouraged.
B. Parking lots of all developments shall be designed so that sanitation, emergency, and other
public service vehicles can serve such developments without the necessity of backing
unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or hazardous turning movements.
C. Every parking lot shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend beyond the perimeter of
such area onto adjacent properties or public rights-of-way. Such areas shall also be designed
so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any wall,
vegetation, or other obstruction.
9-8
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 9: PARKING
D. Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a
danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas.
Section 9.5 Parking Lot Surfaces
A. This shall not apply to single-family or two-family residences or other uses that are required
to have only one or two (2) parking spaces.
B. All parking spaces shall be paved with asphalt, concrete, or similar paving material except
that required parking may be constructed with gravel or other comparable all-weather surface
for:
1. Parking facilities used on an irregular basis by religious assembly uses, or other
similar non-profit organizations.
2. Parking areas for agricultural uses.
3. Parking areas in the I-2 Heavy Industrial District, I-1 Light Industrial District and
Planned Industrial District. (ZA-11-17-2)
4. Parking areas for tracked heavy construction equipment, skid-mounted equipment and
similar equipment.
5. Parking areas for uses which will require 8 or fewer parking spaces as set forth in
Section 9.2
C. When parking areas constructed with a gravel or other comparable all-weather surface, such
parking areas shall be required to provide a buffer which shall meet the buffer dimensional
requirements set forth in Section 8.2.B.
D. All paved parking areas must be of sufficient thickness and consistency to support
anticipated traffic volumes and weights. Spaces in paved parking areas shall be appropriately
demarcated with painted lines or other markings.
E. Access drives must be paved and maintained from the curb line to a point at least 10 feet
beyond the public right of way line for all parking and loading facilities, whether paved or
unpaved.
Section 9.6 Joint Use of Required Parking Spaces
A. One parking area may contain required spaces for several different uses, but except as
otherwise provided in this Section, the required space assigned to one use may not be
credited to any other use.
B. To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces
operate at different times, the same spaces may be credited to both uses. For example, if a
parking lot is used in connection with an office building Monday through Friday, but is
generally 90 percent vacant on weekends, another development that operates only on
weekends could be credited with 90 percent of the space on that lot. Or, if a church parking
9-9
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 9: PARKING
lot is generally occupied only to 50 percent of capacity on days other than Sunday, another
development could make use of 50 percent of the church lots spaces on those other days.
C. If the joint use of the same parking spaces by two (2) or more principal uses involves satellite
parking spaces, then the provisions of Section 9.7 (Satellite Parking) are also applicable.
Section 9.7 Satellite Parking
A. If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this Ordinance cannot reasonably be
provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with these parking spaces is
located, then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the
provisions of this Section. These off-site spaces are referred to in this Section as satellite
parking spaces.
B. All such satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee use) must be located
within 400 feet of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use associated with
such parking, or within 400 feet of the lot on which the use associated with such parking is
located if the use is not housed within any principal building. Satellite parking spaces
intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable distance.
C. The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this Section must present
satisfactory written evidence that he/she has the permission of the owner or other person in
charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The developer must also sign an
acknowledgement that the continuing validity of his/her permit depends upon his/her
continuing ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces.
D. Persons who obtain satellite parking spaces in accordance with this Section shall not be held
accountable for ensuring that the satellite parking areas from which they obtain their spaces
satisfy the design requirements of this Chapter.
Section 9.8 Special Provisions for Lots with Existing Buildings
A. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, whenever
1. there exists a lot with one or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of
this Ordinance, and
2. a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such
lot, and
3. the parking requirements of Section 9.1 (Number of Parking Spaces Required) that would
be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because
there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking,
then the developer need only comply with the requirements of Section 9.1 to the extent
that
a. parking space is practicably available on the lot where the development is located,
and
9-10
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 9: PARKING
b. satellite parking space is reasonably available as provided in Section 9.6 (Joint Use of
Required Parking Spaces).
B. However, if satellite parking subsequently becomes reasonably available, then it shall be a
continuing condition of the permit authorizing development on such lot that the developer
obtain satellite parking when it does become available.
Section 9.9 Loading and Unloading Areas
A. Subject to Subsection (E), whenever the normal operation of any development requires that
goods, merchandise, or equipment be routinely delivered to or shipped from that
development, a sufficient off-street loading and unloading area must be provided in
accordance with this Section to accommodate the delivery or shipment operations in a safe
and convenient manner.
B. The loading and unloading area must be of sufficient size to accommodate the numbers and
types of vehicles that are likely to use this area, given the nature of the development in
question. The following Table indicates the number and size of spaces that, presumptively,
satisfy the standard set forth in this Section. However, the permit issuing authority may
require more or less loading and unloading area if reasonably necessary to satisfy the
foregoing standard.
Gross Leasable Area of Building Number of Spaces1
1,000  19,999 1
20,000  79,999 2

256,000  319,999 6
320,000  391,999 7
Plus one space for each additional 72,000 square feet or fraction thereof.
1Minimum dimensions of 12 feet X 55 feet and overhead clearance of 14 feet from street grade required.
C. Loading and unloading areas shall be so located and designed so that the vehicles intended to
use them can
1. maneuver safely and conveniently to and from a public right-of-way, and
2. complete the loading and unloading operations without obstructing or interfering with
any public right-of-way or any parking space or parking lot aisle.
D. No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to satisfy the area
requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of any off-street parking area be
used to satisfy the area requirements for loading and unloading facilities.
E. Whenever
1. there exists a lot with one or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of
this Ordinance, and
9-11
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 9: PARKING
2. a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such
lot, and
3. the loading area requirements of this Section cannot be satisfied because there is not
sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for loading and unloading,
then the developer need only comply with this Section to the extent reasonably possible.
Section 9.10 Flexibility in Administration Required
A. The City Council recognizes that, due to the particularities of any given development, the
inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in Sections 9.1 & 9.2, may result in a
development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs.
The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as
well as unauthorized parking on nearby private lots. The latter situation wastes money as
well as space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally
useful open space. Therefore, as suggested in Sections 9.1 & 9.2, the permit issuing
authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of Sections 9.1 & 9.2,
and may require more parking, or allow less parking, whenever it finds that such deviations
are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 9.1.
B. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit issuing authority may allow
deviations from the parking requirements set forth in Sections 9.1 & 9.2, when it finds that:
1. A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly;
2. A business is primarily oriented to walk-in trade.
C. Whenever the permit issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive
parking requirements set forth in Sections 9.1 & 9.2, it shall enter on the face of the permit
the parking requirement that it imposes, and the reasons for allowing or requiring the
deviation.
D. If the permit issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the
consideration of a specific development proposal, that the presumption established by
Sections 9.1 & 9.2, for a particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request
for an amendment to the Parking Requirements Table in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Chapter 14.

CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
Section 10.1 Street and Sidewalk Standards
10.1.1 Access
A. Every lot shall have access to it that is sufficient to afford a reasonable means of ingress and
egress for emergency vehicles as well as for all those likely to need or desire access to the
property in its intended use.
B. Whenever a major development that involves the creation of one (1) or more new streets
borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, no direct driveway access may
be provided from the lots within this development onto this street.
C. All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets within the Citys planning jurisdiction
shall be constructed so that:
1. Vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any substantial danger
to themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles traveling in abutting streets, and
2. Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets
is minimized.
D. Specifications for driveway entrances shall meet minimum North Carolina Department of
Transportation (NCDOT) requirements. If driveway entrances and other openings onto
streets are constructed in accordance with the foregoing specifications and requirements, this
shall be deemed prima facie evidence of compliance with the standards set forth in
Subsection (C).
E. For purposes of this Section, the term prima facie evidence means that the permit-issuing
authority may (but is not required to) conclude from this evidence alone that the proposed
development complies with Subsection (C).
10.1.2 Coordination with Surrounding Streets
A. The street system of a development shall be coordinated with existing, proposed, and
anticipated streets outside the development or outside the portion of a single tract that is
being divided into lots (hereinafter, surrounding streets) as provided in this Section.
B. Collector streets shall intersect with surrounding collector or arterial streets at safe and
convenient locations.
C. Sub-collector, local, and minor residential streets shall connect with surrounding streets
where necessary to permit the convenient movement of traffic between residential
neighborhoods or to facilitate access to neighborhoods by emergency vehicles or for other
sufficient reasons, but connections shall not be permitted where the effect would be to
encourage the use of such streets by substantial through traffic.
D. In an effort to improve and promote overall street connectivity, public streets constructed
within the Clinton City Limits shall provide connections to existing adjacent public streets.
When no off-site street stubs are present, the following connections shall be provided to
undeveloped properties at the appropriate rate indicated below:
10-3
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
1. All new commercial developments are required to provide at least one stub-out to extend
and connect with future streets. In the event that adjacent land is already developed with
tub-outs present, the developer shall build streets to connect to the existing stub-out(s).
2. Residential developments containing 10 or more dwelling units shall include street
connections or stubs to adjacent undeveloped properties. In the event adjacent land is
already developed with streets, the developer shall connect to the existing sub-out(s).
3. Non-residential developments shall provide one stub to each adjoining parcel where,
considering topography, land use compatibility and future development or redevelopment
potential, it is deemed feasible and appropriate.
10.1.3 Relationship of Streets to Topography
A. Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. In particular, streets shall be
designed to facilitate the drainage and storm water runoff objectives set forth in Section 10.3,
and street grades shall conform as practicable to the original topography.
B. Proposed streets shall conform to grade standards adopted by the North Carolina Department
of Transportation. The maximum grade at any point on a private road shall be six (6)
percent.
10.1.4 Street Width, Sidewalk, and Drainage Requirements in Developments
A. Street rights-of-way are designed and developed to serve several functions: (i) to carry motor
vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-street parking; (ii) to provide a safe and
convenient passageway for pedestrian traffic; and (iii) to serve as an important link in the
Citys drainage system.
B. Right-of-way widths, measured from lot line to lot line, shall be as wide as existing streets
extended, but in no case shall said widths be less than the following:
Street Type Minimum Required Right-of-Way Width (in Feet)
Arterial 100
Collector 70
Subcollector 50
Local 50
Minor 44
Additional street right-of-way may be required in cases where underground public utilities,
sidewalks, and drainage facilities cannot be located within the minimum stated above.
C. The latest edition of the NCDOT Division of Highways Traditional Neighborhood
Development Guidelines may be followed for developments that utilize a more traditional
design. In the absence of TND specific design guidelines, the criteria of the NCDOT
Development Roads Minimum Construction Standards shall be followed. Additionally, the
City of Clinton Pedestrian Plan shall be consulted for applicable street cross sections.
10-4
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
D. Sidewalks shall be provided along both sides of all new streets within developments located
within the City Limits or that would connect to existing sidewalk networks, and shall be
provided along any existing public street directly accessed by the proposed development as
follows:
1. The sidewalk shall extend the length of the property adjacent to the roadway on the
same side of the development.
2. The developer shall provide any necessary additional right-of-way needed for the
sidewalk to either the City or the North Carolina Department of Transportation as
appropriate.
3. When the adjacent roadway is a North Carolina Department of Transportation
facility, the sidewalk will be built to North Carolina Department of Transportation
standards.
4. When sidewalks are to be located within the corporate limits, sidewalks required by
this Section shall be at least five (5) feet in width and constructed according to the
following specifications:
a. Compacted sub-grade to 100 percent American Association of State Highway
Officials (AAASHO) T99.
b. Four (4) inches thick increasing to six (6) inches at driveway entrances.
c. Expansion joints provided every 30 feet, with false joints every 10 feet,
E. Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is
necessary from the development to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other streets or
facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the
streets, the developer may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least 10
feet in width to provide access.
10.1.5 General Layout of Streets
A. Sub-collector, local, and minor residential streets shall be curved whenever practicable to the
extent necessary to avoid conformity of lot appearance.
B. Cul-de-sacs and loop streets are encouraged so that through traffic on residential streets is
minimized. Similarly, to the extent practicable, driveway access to collector streets shall be
minimized to facilitate the free flow of traffic and avoid traffic hazards.
C. All permanent dead-end streets shall be developed as cul-de-sacs in accordance with the
standards set forth in Subsection (D). Except where no other practicable alternative is
available, such streets may not extend more than 800 feet in length, as measured to the center
of the turnaround.
D. The right-of-way of a cul-de-sac shall have a radius of 50 feet. The radius of the paved
portion of the turnaround (measured to the outer edge of the pavement) shall be 35 feet, and
the pavement width shall be 12 feet without curb and gutter or 18 feet with curb and gutter.
E. Half streets (i.e., streets of less than the full required right-of-way and pavement width) shall
not be permitted except where such streets, when combined with a similar street (developed
10-5
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
previously or simultaneously) on property adjacent to the development, creates or comprises
a street that meets the right-of-way and pavement requirements of this Chapter.
F. Streets shall be laid out so that residential blocks do not exceed 1,000 feet in length, unless
no other practicable alternative is available.
10.1.6 Street Intersections
A. Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no two (2) streets may
intersect at less than 60o. Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point,
unless the permit-issuing authority certifies that such an intersection can be constructed with
no extraordinary danger to public safety.
B. Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street shall coincide with
existing or proposed intersections on the opposite side of such street. In any event, where a
centerline offset (jog) occurs at an intersection, the distance between centerlines of the
intersecting streets shall be not less than 150 feet.
C. Except when no other alternative is practicable or legally possible, no two (2) streets may
intersect with any other street on the same side at a distance of less than 400 feet measured
from centerline to centerline of the intersecting street. When the intersected street is an
arterial, the distance between intersecting streets shall be at least 1,000 feet.
D. The following shall apply to sight distances at street intersections:
1. At no-stop intersections, the intersection shall be constructed so that a person standing at
a location on the centerline of any street 90 feet from the intersection of the street has an
unobstructed view to a point located on the centerline of the intersecting street 90 feet (in
either direction) from the intersection of the street centerlines.
2. Subject to (3) below, at stop intersections, the intersection shall be constructed so that a
person standing 10 feet back of the intersection of right-of-way lines on the stop street
has an unobstructed view to a point on the right-of-way line of the intersecting through
street located 70 feet from the intersection of the right-of-way lines.
3. At stop intersections where a residential street intersects with a State maintained primary
road, the intersection shall be constructed so that a person standing 30 feet back of the
intersection of right-of-way lines on the stop street has an unobstructed view to a point on
the centerline of the through street located 150 feet from the intersection of the street
right-of-way lines.
4. There shall be no obstruction to vision between a height of two (2) feet and 10 feet above
the average center line grade of each street, as applied in (1), (2), and (3) above.
10.1.7 Construction Standards and Specifications
All new streets shall be dedicated to the public and constructed to the standards of this Ordinance
and all other applicable construction standards of the North Carolina Department of
Transportation. Public streets in developments within the corporate limits shall be submitted for
acceptance by the City of Clinton. Public streets in developments outside of the corporate limits
10-6
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
shall be approved and accepted by the North Carolina Department of Transportation. Private
roads shall be constructed to public street standards.
10.1.8 Public Streets in Developments
All lots created after the effective date of this Section shall abut a public street at least to the
extent necessary to comply with the access requirement set forth in Section 10.1.1. For purposes
of this Section, the term public street includes a pre-existing public street as well as a street
created by the subdivider that meets the public street standards of this Ordinance and is dedicated
for public use. The recording of a plat showing a public street shall constitute an offer of
dedication of such street.
10.1.9 Road and Sidewalk Requirements in Un-subdivided Developments
A. Within unsubdivided developments, private roads and access ways may be allowed and shall
be designed and constructed to facilitate the safe and convenient movement of motor vehicle
and pedestrian traffic. To the extent not otherwise covered by parking and drainage
requirements, and to the extent that the requirements set forth in this Chapter for
development streets may be relevant to the roads in un-subdivided developments, the
requirements of this Chapter may be applied to satisfy the standard set forth in the first
sentence of this Subsection.
B. Whenever a road in an un-subdivided development connects two (2) or more sub-collector,
collector, or arterial streets in such a manner that any substantial volume of through traffic is
likely to make use of this road, such road shall be constructed in accordance with the
standards applicable to development streets and shall be dedicated. In other cases when
roads in un-subdivided developments within the City are constructed in accordance with the
specifications for development streets, the City may accept an offer of dedication of such
streets.
C. In all un-subdivided residential development, sidewalks shall be provided linking dwelling
units with other dwelling units, the public street, and on-site activity centers such as parking
areas, laundry facilities, and recreational areas and facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
sidewalks shall not be required where pedestrians have access to a road that serves not more
than nine (9) dwelling units.
D. Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is necessary
from an un-subdivided development to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other roads or
facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the
roads, the developer may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least 10 feet
to provide such access.
E. The sidewalks required by this Section shall be at least four (4) feet wide and constructed
according to the following specifications:
1. Compacted sub-grade to 100 percent American Association of State Highway Officials
(AAASHO) T99.
2. 4 inches thick increasing to six (6) inches at driveway entrances.

10-7
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
except that the permit-issuing authority may permit the installation of walkways constructed
with other suitable materials when it concludes that:
a. Such walkways would serve the residents of the development as adequately as concrete
sidewalks; and
b. Such walkways would be more environmentally desirable or more in keeping with the
overall design of the development.
10.1.10 Street Names and House Numbers
A. Street names shall be assigned by the developer subject to the approval of the permit-issuing
authority. Proposed streets that are obviously in alignment with existing streets shall be
given the same name. Newly created streets shall be given names that neither duplicate nor
are phonetically similar to existing streets within the Citys planning jurisdiction, regardless
of the use of different suffixes (such as those set forth in Subsection (B)).
B. Street names shall include a suffix such as the following:
1. Circle. A short street that returns to itself.
2. Court or Place. A cul-de-sac or dead-end street.
3. Loop. A street that begins at the intersection with one street and circles back to end at
another intersection with the same street.
4. Street. All public streets not designated by another suffix.
C. Building numbers shall be assigned by the City.
10.1.11 Bridges
All bridges shall be constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications of the North
Carolina Department of Transportation, except that bridges on roads not intended for public
dedication may be approved if designed by a licensed architect or engineer.
Section 10.2 Utility Standards
10.2.1 Utility Extension Policy
A. The Utility Extension Policy is intended to define how extensions of the Citys utility
systems will be made and establish procedures for installing new utility infrastructure and the
financial obligations thereto.
B. The Citys primary objective is to provide reliable and affordable utility service to its existing
customers. New customers to the system are therefore expected to share in a majority of the
expense for their new services. The specific objectives of this Policy are to:
1. Define how requests for new services shall be submitted to the City
2. Define the facilities necessary to provide new services
3. Define the construction responsibilities for these new facilities
4. Define the financial responsibilities for these new facilities
5. Establish funding mechanisms for private contributions to publicly funded utility
extensions
10-8
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
10.2.1.1 Petition
A. Any interested party may request water and/or sewer service from the City. If the service
is to be provided within the corporate limits and adequate public water and sewer mains
are available to the adjacent property, service will be provided upon payment of the
applicable fees. If the service is to be provided outside the corporate limits or requires
extension of a main, a formal petition for service shall be submitted to the City Council
for consideration.
B. The City shall require all petitioners requesting water and sewer service shall file a
petition for annexation to the City. The City will generally consider annexation and
extension of utilities to the areas within the current ETJ. Failure to file a petition for
voluntary annexation or satellite annexation on notice from the City shall result in
immediate termination of water service. The City has the right to deny any petition for
annexation, if it is not in the best interest of the City.
10.2.1.2 City Response
A. Upon receipt of a petition to extend a water and sewer main, the City Council has the
following four options for response. The criteria under which an option will be chosen
are generally defined herein; however, the City Council may act to any aforementioned
option, which it feels is in the best interest of the City.
1. Install the extension at the Citys expense
2. Approve and allow the petitioner to install the extension at this expense
3. Jointly finance the extension in cooperation with the petitioner and have the petitioner
install the extension
4. Deny the request
5. Jointly financed and City install
B. The City Council may also extend water and /or sanitary sewer mains on their own
volition without receipt of a petition and assess the cost or collect utility fees as described
herein, from those who connect to the main.
10.2.1.3 Service Connections
A. New service connections to existing mains will generally be installed by the City and
paid for by the new customer. Where new service connections are to be installed in
conjunction with the extension of water and sewer lines, the customer may, at the Citys
discretion, install service connections, and pay applicable fees.
B. No new service shall be commissioned until construction and state and federal required
testing are completed, all applicable fees have been paid and the state has commissioned
the facilities for public use.
10.2.1.4 Minor Facilities
A. Extensions funded entirely by the petitioner will be designed and constructed by the
petitioner in accordance with the City standards and applicable State and Federal
regulations after review by the City.
10-9
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
B. Privately funded extension projects constructed by the petitioner shall be reviewed and
approved by the City prior to the petitioner submitting the plans to any other state review
agency. Upon final approval of the plans the City will issue written notification to the
petitioner who shall then secure all additional approvals and permits and construct the
facilities. The petitioner will be responsible to pay for any and all permits. The
petitioner shall commence construction within 18 months of the final approval and
complete the installation and make service connections within 36 months. Failure to
comply with the approval plan or time schedule will automatically terminate the approval
for service.
10.2.1.5 Major Facilities
A. Major facilities shall be funded, designed and constructed by the City. In the event where
a major facility project benefits one area, those benefitting from the improvement shall
help fund the project by an assessment according to state laws. These facilities shall be
constructed in order of priority as adopted in the Citys Capital Improvement Plan.
Projects will only be undertaken as adequate capital funds are available. Projects to
improve existing services will generally be funded by Availability Fees and sales
revenue.
B. Petitioners wishing to expedite a major utility extension project may be asked by the City
Council to prepay System Development Charges, make a contribution to the project cost
or both such that accelerating the project does not adversely impact existing customers or
the orderly expansion of the utility system.
10.2.1.6 Permits & Responsibility of Maintenance
A. The petitioner will be responsible for obtaining all required permits prior to any work is
to be done, either by the city or the petitioner.
B. The petitioner will perform any and all maintenance for one year on any utility extension
project that they install, after the lines have been put into use. Once the year has passed,
the City will assume all maintenance responsibilities within the right-of-way only, after
an inspection is performed and the utilities are found to be in good repair. The petitioner
will also be required to turn over all maintenance records.
10.2.1.7 Fees and Charges
A. Tap fees will be collected from each new customer prior to initiating service. The fees
are established by the City Council, and amended from time to time, to reflect the cost to
the City for the installation of the taps and meter set. Where new service connections are
installed as part of a new development, the fee reflects the cost of the meter set only.
B. Payment of the tap & meter set fees shall be made prior to the installation of any meter or
commissioning any new service connection.
C. Impact fees are calculated to recover a portion of the capital cost of providing water and
sewer systems that have adequate capacity. Impact fees will be collected in conjunction
10-10
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
with the tap and meter set fees prior to the initiation of any service. Impact fees will be
established by City Council and amended from time to time as needed.
10.2.2 Utility Ownership and Easement Rights
In any case in which a developer installs or causes the installation of water, sewer, electrical
power, telephone, or cable television facilities and intends that such facilities shall be owned,
operated, or maintained by a public utility or any entity other than the developer, the developer
shall transfer to such utility or entity the necessary ownership or easement rights to enable the
utility or entity to operate and maintain such facilities.
10.2.3 Water Supply and Sanitary Sewer Systems in Floodways and Floodplains
Whenever any portion of a proposed development is located within a floodway or floodplain, the
agency or agencies responsible for certifying to the City the adequacy of the water supply and
sewage disposal systems for the development shall be informed by the developer that a specified
area within the development lies within a floodway or floodplain. Therefore, approval of the
proposed system by that agency shall constitute a certification that:
A. Such water supply system is designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into it.
B. Such sanitary sewer system is designed to eliminate infiltration of flood waters into it and
discharges from it into floodwaters.
C. Any on-site sewage disposal system is located to avoid impairment to or contamination from
it during flooding.
10.2.4 Lots Served by Governmentally Owned Water and Sewer Lines
A. Whenever it is legally possible and practicable in terms of topography to connect a lot with a
City water or sewer line by running a connecting line not more than 200 feet from the lot to
such line, then no use requiring water or sewage disposal service may be made of such lot
unless connection is made to such line.
B. Connection to such water or sewer line is not legally possible if, in order to make connection
with such line by a connecting line that does not exceed 200 feet in length, it is necessary to
run the connecting line over property not owned by the owner of the property to be served by
the connection and, after diligent effort, the easement necessary to run the connecting line
cannot be reasonably obtained.
C. For purposes of this Chapter, a lot is served by a City-owned water or sewer line if
connection is required by this Section.
10.2.5 Sewage Disposal Facilities Required
A. Every principal use and every lot within a development shall be served by a sewage disposal
system that is adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use of development lot
and that complies with all applicable health regulations.
10-11
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
B. Primary responsibility for determining whether a proposed development will comply with the
standard set forth in this Section often lies with an agency other than the City, and the
developer must comply with the detailed standards and specifications of such other agency.
The relevant agencies are listed in Subsection (C). Whenever any such agency requires
detailed construction or design drawings before giving its official approval to the proposed
sewage disposal system, the authority issuing a permit under this Ordinance rely upon a
preliminary review by such agency of the basic design elements of the proposed sewage
disposal system to determine compliance with this Section. However, construction of such
system may not be commenced until the detailed plans and specifications have been
reviewed and any appropriate permits issued by such agency.

system that is adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use or development lot
and that complies with all applicable health regulations.
B. Primary responsibility for determining whether a proposed development will comply with the
standard set forth in this Section often lies with an agency other than the City, and the
developer must comply with the detailed standards and specifications of such other agency.
The relevant agencies are listed in Subsection (C). Whenever any such agency requires
detailed construction or design drawings before giving its official approval to the proposed
water supply system, the authority issuing a permit under this Ordinance may rely upon a
preliminary review by such agency of the basic design elements of the proposed water supply
system to determine compliance with this Section. However, construction of such system
may not be commenced until the detailed plans and specifications have been reviewed and
any appropriate permits issued by such agency.

foot-candle in Appendix A.
10.2.8 Electric Power
Every principal use and every lot within a development shall have available to it a source of
electric power adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use and every lot within
such development. Compliance with this requirement shall be determined as follows:
A. If the use is not a subdivision and is located on a lot that is served by an existing power
line and the use can be served by a simple connection to such power line (as opposed to a
10-16
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
more complex distribution system, such as would be required in an apartment complex or
shopping center), then no further certification is needed.
B. If the use is a subdivision or is not located on a lot served by an existing power line or a
substantial internal distribution system will be necessary, then the electric utility service
provider must review the proposed plans and certify to the City that it can provide service
that is adequate to meet the needs of the proposed use and every lot within the proposed
development.
10.2.9 Telephone Service

and cable television lines installed to serve the development that are located on the
development site outside of a previously existing public street right-of-way shall be placed
underground in accordance with the specifications and policies of the respective utility
service providers.
10.2.11 Utilities to be Consistent with Internal and External Development
A. Whenever it can reasonably be anticipated that utility facilities constructed in one
development will be extended to serve other adjacent or nearby developments, such utility
facilities (e.g., water or sewer lines) shall be located and constructed so that extensions can
be made conveniently and without undue burden or expense, or unnecessary duplication of
service.
10-17
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance

occupying the development site, neighboring properties, or public rights-of-way; and
2. Constructed according to specifications established by the Public Works Director to
allow for collection without damage to the development site or the collection vehicle.
B. All such dumpsters shall be screened if and to the extent that, in the absence of screening,
they would be clearly visible to:
1. Persons located within any dwelling unit on residential property other than that where the
dumpster is located.
2. Occupants, customers, or other invitees located within any building on nonresidential
property other than that where the dumpster is located, unless such other property is used
primarily for purposes permitted exclusively in an I-1 or I-2 zoning district.
3. Persons traveling on any public street, sidewalk, or other public way.
C. When dumpster screening is required under this Section, such screening shall be constructed,
installed, and located to prevent or remedy the conditions requiring the screening.
Section 10.3 Drainage, StormWater Management, & Erosion Control Standards
10.3.1 Natural Drainage System Utilized to Extent Feasible
A. To the extent practicable, all development shall conform to the natural contours of the land
and natural and pre-existing man-made drainage ways shall remain undisturbed.
B. To the extent practicable, lot boundaries shall be made to coincide with natural and preexisting
man-made drainage ways within subdivisions to avoid the creation of lots that can be
10-18
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
built upon only by altering such drainage ways.
10.3.2 Developments Must Drain Properly
A. All developments shall be provided with a drainage system that is adequate to prevent the
undue retention of surface water on the development site. Surface water shall not be
regarded as unduly retained if:
1. The retention results from a technique, practice or device deliberately installed as part of
an approved sedimentation or storm water runoff control plan; or
2. The retention is not substantially different in location or degree than that experienced by
the development site in its predevelopment stage, unless such retention presents a danger
to health or safety.
B. No surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer.
C. Whenever practicable, the drainage system of a development shall coordinate with and
connect to the drainage systems or drainage ways on surrounding properties or streets.
D. Roads and access-ways within un-subdivided developments shall utilize curb and gutter and
storm drains to provide adequate drainage if the grade of such roads or access ways is too
steep to provide drainage in another manner or if other sufficient reasons exist to require such
construction.
10.3.3 Storm Water Management
All developments shall be constructed and maintained so that adjacent properties are not
unreasonably burdened with surface waters as a result of such developments. More specifically:
A. No development may be constructed or maintained so that such development unreasonably
impedes the natural flow of water from higher adjacent properties across such development,
thereby unreasonably causing substantial damage to such higher adjacent properties; and
B. No development may be constructed or maintained so that surface waters from such
development are unreasonably collected and channeled onto lower adjacent properties at
such locations or at such volumes as to cause substantial damage to such lower adjacent
properties.
10.3.4 Sedimentation and Erosion Control
A. No Zoning or Conditional Use Permit may be issued and Final Plat approval for subdivisions
may not be given with respect to any development that would cause land disturbing activity
subject to the jurisdiction of the North Carolina Sedimentation Control Commission under
G.S. 113A-57(4) unless the Commission has certified to the City, either that:
1. An erosion control plan has been submitted to and approved by the Commission; or
2. The Commission has examined the preliminary plans for the development and it
reasonably appears that an erosion control plan can be approved upon submission by the
developer of more detailed construction or design drawings. However, in this case,
construction of the development may not begin (and no building permits may be issued)
until the Commission approves the erosion control plan.
10-19
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 10: INFRASTRUCTURE
B. For purposes of this Section, land disturbing activity means any use of the land by any
person in residential, industrial, educational, institutional or commercial development, and
highway and road construction and maintenance that results in a change in the natural cover
or topography and that may cause or contribute to sedimentation except activities that are
exempt under G.S. 113A-52(6). Sedimentation occurs whenever solid particulate matter,
mineral or organic, is transported by water, air, gravity, or ice from the site of its origin.

Section 11.1 Purpose and Applicability
11.1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Chapter is to establish an orderly process to develop land within the City of
Clinton. It is also the intent of this Chapter to provide a clear and comprehensive development
process that is fair and equitable to all interests including the applicants, affected neighbors, City
staff, related agencies, the Planning & Zoning Board, and the City Council. Approved plans
shall be the guiding documents for final approval and permitting.
11.1.2 Applicability
A. The development review process applies to all new development and alterations of existing
development within the City of Clinton.
B. The Administrator or designee may waive the required development review for a change in
principal use, where such change would not result in a change in lot coverage, parking, or
other site characteristics. The development review may also be waived if the Administrator
determines that the submission of a development plan in accordance with this Chapter would
serve no useful purpose.

Section 11.2 Zoning Permits
11.2.1 Zoning Permit Required
A. The use made of property may not be substantially changed, and buildings or other
substantial structures may not be constructed, erected, moved, or substantially altered except
in accordance with and pursuant to the issuance of a Zoning Permit.
B. Substantial clearing, grading, or excavation may not be commenced without the issuance of a
Zoning Permit, except in accordance with an approved Preliminary Plat for Major
Subdivisions.
C. Zoning Permits are issued under this Ordinance only when a review of the application
submitted, including the plans contained therein, indicates that the development will comply
with the provisions of this Ordinance if completed as proposed. Such plans and applications
as are finally approved are incorporated into any permit issued, and all development shall
occur strictly in accordance with such approved plans and applications.
D. A Zoning Permit shall be issued in the name of the applicant (except that applications
submitted by an agent shall be issued in the name of the principal), shall identify the property
involved and the proposed use, shall incorporate by reference the plans submitted, and shall
contain any special conditions or requirements lawfully imposed by the permit-issuing
authority.
11.2.2 Zoning Permit Not Required
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, no zoning permit is necessary for the
following uses:

E. Interior alterations and renovations which do not alter the footprint, elevation, height, or use
of an otherwise conforming use and/or structure.
11.2.3 Application Procedures
A. Applications for a Zoning Permit will be accepted only from persons having the legal
authority to take action in accordance with the permit. By way of illustration, in general this
means that applications should be made by the owners of property, or their agents, or persons
who have contracted to purchase property contingent upon their ability to acquire the
necessary permits under this ordinance, or the agents of such persons (who may make
application in the name of such owners, lessees, or contract vendees). The Administrator
11-4
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 11: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
may require an applicant to submit evidence of his/her authority to submit the application
whenever there appears to be a reasonable basis for questioning this authority.
B. All applications for Zoning Permits must be complete before the permit-issuing authority is
required to consider the application. An application is complete when it contains all the
information necessary for the permit-issuing authority to decide whether or not the
development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all of the requirements of this
Ordinance.
C. A completed application form for a Zoning Permit shall be submitted to the Administrator by
filing a copy of the application with the Administrator in the Planning Department. A fee, set
by the City Council, shall be charged for the processing of such application. The adopted fee
schedule shall be available at City Hall.
D. For single-family residential structures, a plot plan and the following information shall be
submitted to the Administrator with the Zoning Permit application and fee:
1. The shape and dimensions of the lot on which the proposed building or use is to be
erected or conducted;
2. The location of said lot with respect to adjacent rights-of-way;
3. The shape, dimensions, and location of all buildings, existing and proposed, on said lot;
4. The nature of the proposed use of the building or land, including the extent and location
of the use, on said lot;
5. The location and dimensions off-street parking and driveways;
6. The proposed impervious area including all buildings, driveways, sidewalks, and patios;
7. Building elevations of the front facade; and
8. Any other information which the Administrator may deem necessary for consideration in
enforcing the provisions of this Ordinance.
E. For all other developments requiring a Zoning Permit, a Site Plan shall be submitted in
accordance with the development plan requirements of Chapter 12 and follow the approval
process as outlined in Section 11.3 prior to Zoning Permit issuance by the Administrator.
Any development project requiring a Conditional Use Permit, shall follow the approval
process outlined in Section 11.4 prior to Zoning Permit issuance by the Administrator.
11.2.4 Zoning Permit Approval, Effect of Approval, & Compliance
A. The Administrator shall issue the Zoning Permit unless he/she finds, after reviewing the
application and consulting with the applicant that:
1. The requested permit is not within his/her jurisdiction according to the Permitted Uses
Table, or
2. The application is incomplete, or
3. If completed as proposed in the application, the development will not comply with one or
more requirements of this Ordinance (not including those requirements concerning which
a variance has been granted or those the applicant is not required to comply with under
the circumstances specified in Chapter 13 Nonconformities.
11-5
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 11: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
B. No Zoning Permit shall be issued to any person who has failed, after notice, to remedy
defective work or otherwise comply with the Code of the City of Clinton, this Ordinance, or
the laws of the State of North Carolina.
C. Issuance of a Zoning Permit, authorizes the recipient to commence the activity resulting in a
change in use of the land or (subject to obtaining a building permit) to commence work
designed to construct, erect, move, or substantially alter buildings or other substantial
structures. However, the intended use may not be commenced, no building may be occupied
until all of the requirements of this Ordinance, and all additional requirements imposed
pursuant to the issuance of a Zoning Permit, have been complied with. In cases when,
because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the Zoning Permit
recipient (exclusive of financial hardship), it would be unreasonable to require the Zoning
Permit recipient to comply with all of the requirements of this Ordinance prior to
commencing the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings, the Administrator
may authorize the commencement of the intended use or the occupancy of buildings (insofar
as the requirements of this Ordinance are concerned) if the permit recipient provides a
performance bond or other security satisfactory to the Administrator to ensure that all of the
requirements of this Ordinance will be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed 12
months) determined by the Administrator.
11.2.5 Right of Appeal
If a Zoning Permit is denied, then the applicant may appeal the action of the Administrator to the
Board of Adjustment in accordance with Section 15.7; and that from the decision of the Board of
Adjustment, recourse shall be had to courts as provided by law. Such appeal shall be made
within 30 days of such permit denial.
11.2.6 Expiration of Permits
A. Zoning permits shall expire automatically if, within six (6) months after the issuance of such
permits:
1. The use authorized by such permits has not commenced, in circumstances where no
substantial construction, erection, alteration, excavation, demolition, or similar work is
necessary before commencement of such use, or
2. Less than 10 percent of the total cost of all construction, erection, alteration, excavation,
demolition, or similar work on any development authorized by such permits has been
completed on the site. With respect to phased development, this requirement shall apply
only to the first phase.
B. If, after some physical alteration to land or structures begins, and such work is discontinued
for a period of six (6) months, then the permit authorizing such work shall immediately
expire.
C. The permit-issuing authority may extend for a period up to six (6) months the date when a
permit would otherwise expire pursuant to Subsections (A) or (B) if it concludes that (i) the
permit has not yet expired, (ii) the permit recipient has proceeded with due diligence and in
good faith, and (iii) conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new
application. Successive extensions may be granted for periods up to six (6) months upon the
same findings. All such extensions may be granted without resort to the formal processes
and fees required for a new permit.
11-6
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 11: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
D. For purposes of this Section, a Zoning Permit is issued when the earlier of the following
takes place:
1. A copy of the fully executed permit is delivered to the permit recipient, and delivery is
accomplished when the permit is hand delivered or mailed to the permit applicant; or
2. The Administrator notifies the permit applicant that the application has been approved
and that all that remains before a fully executed permit can be delivered is for the
applicant to take certain specified actions.
E. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Chapter 13 Nonconformities, this Section shall be
applicable to permits issued prior to the date this Section becomes effective.
11.2.7 Effect of Permit on Successors and Assigns
Zoning Permits authorize the permittee to make use of land and structures in a particular way.
Such permits are transferable. However, so long as the land or structures or any portion covered
under a permit continues to be used for the purposes for which the permit was granted, then:
A. No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the permit) may make
use of the land or structures covered under such permit for the purposes authorized in the
permit except in accordance with all the terms and requirements of that permit, and
B. The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land or structures
covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having an interest in the
property at the time the permit was obtained, but also with respect to persons who
subsequently obtain any interest in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it for or
in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was originally issued, so
long as the persons who subsequently obtain an interest in the property had actual or record
notice.

adequate notice to potentially interested persons of the matter that will appear on the
Boards agenda at a specified date and time. Such notice(s) shall be posted at least six (6)
days prior to the meeting at which the matter is to be considered.
2. The Administrator shall also send written notices to adjoining property owners. Such
notice shall be mailed no less than 10 days prior to the meeting at which the matter is to
be considered.
B. The Planning & Zoning Board shall take action on the application solely on its findings as to
compliance with applicable regulations of this Ordinance and shall:
1. Recommend approval of the application;
2. Recommend approval subject to changes and/or conditions; or
3. Recommend denial of the application.
C. If the Planning & Zoning Board fails to take action within two (2) regularly scheduled
meetings, or extensions thereof, the application shall be forwarded to the City Council with
the Planning & Zoning Board minutes and the Administrators recommendation, if any.
D. If the Planning & Zoning Board recommends approval of the application subject to changes
or conditions, then the applicant may amend his/her application to conform to all or some of
the conditions, provided the Administrator reviews the amended application for compliance
with applicable regulations and certifies that the amendments conform to the conditions of
the Planning & Zoning Board recommendation. In such cases, the Administrator may amend
his/her report to conform to any or all of the Planning & Zoning Boards recommendations.
The Administrator shall then forward his/her report and the Planning & Zoning Boards
recommendation to the City Council at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
Step 5. Public Notice
A. For Conditional Use Permits, notice shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal,
application, or request is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the
subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; and to the owners of all
parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing. In the absence of
evidence to the contrary, the City may rely on the county tax listing to determine owners of
property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least 10 days,
but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within the same time period, the
City shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site that is the subject of the
hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-of-way.
B. The City Council may continue the hearing until a subsequent meeting and may keep the
hearing open to take additional information up to the point a final decision is made. No
11-13
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 11: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
further notice of a continued hearing need be published unless a period of six (6) weeks or
more elapses between hearing dates.
Step 6. City Council Public Hearing & Consideration
A. Before making a decision on an application, the City Council shall hold a public hearing. A
quasi-judicial public hearing shall be held for issuance or revocation of Conditional Use
Permits.
B. The following shall apply to hearings for Conditional Use Permits.
1. All persons who present evidence or speak to the permit-issuing Board, rather than
arguments only shall be sworn. All findings and conclusions necessary to the issuance or
denial of the requested permit or appeal (crucial findings) shall be based upon reliable
evidence. Competent evidence (evidence admissible in a court of law) shall be preferred
whenever reasonably available, but in no case may crucial findings be based solely upon
incompetent evidence unless competent evidence is not reasonably available, the
evidence in question is determined to be reliable, and the matter at issue is not seriously
disputed. The City Council may place reasonable and equitable limitations on the
presentation of evidence and arguments and the cross examination of witnesses so that
the matter at issue may be heard and decided without undue delay.
2. The City Council shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the request following
the public hearing. In granting a Conditional Use Permit the City Council shall make
written findings that the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located are
fulfilled. With due regard to the nature and state of all adjacent structures and uses, the
district within which same is located, and official plans for future development, the City
Council shall also make written findings that the following provisions are fulfilled:
a. If completed as proposed, the development will comply with all of the requirements
of this Ordinance;
b. The use will not materially endanger the public health or safety; and
c. The use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property; and
d. The use will be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located; and
e. The use will be in general conformity with the Land Development Plan, thoroughfare
plan, or other plan officially adopted by the Council.
3. The Council shall determine contested facts and make its decision within a reasonable
time. Quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent, material, and substantial
evidence in the record.
4. Quasi-judicial decision shall be reduced to writing and reflect the Boards determination
of contested facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written decision
shall be signed by the Mayor or other duly authorized member of the Council. A quasijudicial
decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the clerk to the Council
or such other office or official as the ordinance specifies. The decision of the Council
shall be delivered by personal deliver, electronic mail, or by first-class mail to the
applicant, property owner, and to any person who has submitted a written request for a
copy, prior to the date the decision becomes effective. The person required to provide
notice shall certify that proper notice has been made.
5. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to review by the superior court by
proceedings in the nature of certiorari pursuant to NCGS 160A-393. A petition for
11-14
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 11: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
review shall be filed with the clerk of superior court by the later of 30 days after the
decision is effective or after a written copy thereof is given in accordance with this
Section. When first-class mail is used to deliver notice, three (3) days shall be added to
the time to file the petition.
6. The Clerk to the Council or any member acting as chair is authorized to administer oats
to witnesses for any Conditional Use Permit coming before the Council. Any person
who, while under oath during a proceeding before the Council, willfully swears falsely is
guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
7. The Council may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. To request
issuance of a subpoena, persons with standing under NCGS 160A-393(d) may make a
written request to the chair explaining why it is necessary for certain witnesses or
evidence to be compelled. The chair shall issue requested subpoenas he or she
determines to be relevant, reasonable in nature and cope, and not oppressive. The chair
shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas
made by the chair may be appealed to the full Council. If a person fails or refuses to
obey a subpoena issued pursuant to this subsection, the Council or the party seeing the
subpoena may apply to the General Court of Justice for an order requiring that its
subpoena be obeyed, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue these orders after
notice to all proper parties.
8. City Council members shall not participate in or vote on any Conditional Use Permit
matter in a manner that would violate affected persons constitutional rights to an
impartial decision maker. Impermissible violations of due process include, but are not
limited to, a member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is not
susceptible to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close familial, business, or
other associational relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the
outcome of the matter. If an objection is raised to a members participation and that
member does not recuse himself or herself, the remaining members shall by majority vote
rule on the objection
9. In considering whether to approve an application for a Conditional Use Permit, the
Council shall proceed according to the following format:
a. The Council shall consider whether the application is complete. If no member moves
that the application be found incomplete (specifying either the particular type of
information lacking or the particular requirement with respect to which the
application is incomplete), then this shall be taken as an affirmative finding by the
Council that that application is complete.
b. The Council shall consider whether the application complies with all of the applicable
requirements of this Ordinance. If a motion to this effect passes, the Council need not
make further findings concerning such requirements. If such a motion fails or is not
made, then a motion shall be made that the application be found not in compliance
with one or more of the requirements of this Ordinance. Such a motion shall specify
the particular requirements the application fails to meet. Separate votes may be taken
with respect to each requirement not met by the application. It shall be conclusively
presumed that the application complies with all requirements not found by the
Council to be unsatisfied through this process.
c. If the Council concludes that the application fails to comply with one or more
requirements of this Ordinance, the application shall be denied.
11-15
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 11: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
10. No Conditional Use Permit shall be issued to any person who has failed, after notice, to
remedy defective work or otherwise comply with the Code of the City of Clinton, this
Ordinance, or the laws of the State of North Carolina.
11. The Council may not attach additional conditions that modify or alter the specific
requirements set forth in this Ordinance unless the development in question presents
extraordinary circumstances that justify the variation from the specified requirements.
12. Without limiting the foregoing, the Council may attach to a Conditional Use Permit a
condition limiting the permit to a specified duration.
13. All additional conditions or requirements shall be entered on the permit. All additional
conditions or requirements authorized by this Section are enforceable in the same manner
and to the same extent as any other applicable requirement of this Ordinance.
C. In response to questions or comments by persons appearing at the hearing or to suggestions
or recommendations by the City Council, the applicant may agree to modify his/her
application, including the plans and specifications submitted. Unless such modifications are
so substantial or extensive that the hearing board cannot reasonably be expected to perceive
the nature and impact of the proposed changes without revised plans before it the hearing
board may approve the application with the stipulation that the permit will not be issued until
plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to the Administrator.
Step 7. Additional Approvals as Required
Approval of a Conditional Use Permit by the City Council does not necessarily constitute final
approval of the development plan. Development plans that have received a Conditional Use
Permit may still be subject to additional approval processes depending on the size and type of
development that is proposed.
11.4.2 Amendments to and Modifications of Permits
A. Insignificant deviations from the permit (including approved plans) issued by the City
Council or the Administrator are permissible and the Administrator may authorize such
insignificant deviations. A deviation is insignificant if it has no discernible impact on
neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed
development.
B. Minor design modifications or changes in permits (including approved plans) are permissible
with the approval of the permit-issuing authority. Such permission may be obtained without
a formal application, public hearing, or payment of any additional fee. For purposes of this
Section, minor design modifications or changes are those that have no substantial impact on
neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed
development.
C. All other requests for changes in approved plans will be processed as new applications. If
such requests are required to be acted upon by the City Council, new conditions may be
imposed, but the applicant retains the right to reject such additional conditions by
withdrawing his/her request for an amendment and may then proceed in accordance with the
previously issued permit.
11-16
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 11: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
D. A developer requesting approval of changes shall submit a written request for such approval
to the Administrator, and that request shall identify the changes. Approval of all changes
must be given in writing.
Section 11.5 Subdivision Provisions
11.5.1 Exemptions, Minor & Major Subdivisions Defined
All plats and proposed subdivisions shall be reviewed by the Administrator for initial
determination as to whether the proposed subdivision is to be classified as a Minor subdivision, a
Major subdivision, or exempt from the subdivision provisions of this Ordinance.
A. If the Administrator determines that a division of land does not meet the definition of a
subdivision as set forth by NCGS 160A-376 (see Appendix A Definitions), then the division
shall be considered a subdivision exemption and shall not be subject to the entire
development review process. The Administrator shall ensure that resultant lots comply with
the dimensional, frontage, and access requirements of the zoning district in which the
property is located. Where a public street is to be created, dedicated, and platted as part of
the division, the division shall not be exempt from the provisions of this Ordinance
regardless of any other factors. If the Administrator determines that the proposed division is
exempt from the subdivision provisions of this Ordinance, the plat shall be endorsed with the
following certificate, signed and dated by all record property owner(s) with direct interest in
the property, and the Administrator:
Certificate of No Approval Required
This division of land does not meet the definition of a subdivision as set forth by North
Carolina General Statute 160A-376 and is not subject to the subdivision standards or
development review process of the City of Clinton. The minimum lot requirements for
the subject zoning district have been met.

land in any 10-year period;
2. Dedicate or improve any new public or private streets or roads, other than widening an
existing public street or road;
3. Extend public water and/or sanitary sewerage systems other than laterals to serve
individual lots;
4. Necessitate the installation of drainage improvements that would require easements
through one or more lots to serve other lots;

Clinton and submission by the City of Clinton to the financial institution of a

discretion, may expend such portion of said funds as it deems necessary to complete

subdivision plat has not been approved or recorded at the time of the contract, that
no governmental body will incur any obligation to the prospective buyer or lessee
with respect to the approval of the final subdivision plat, that changes between the
Preliminary and Final Plats are possible, and that the contract or lease may be
terminated without breach by the buyer or lessee if the final approved and
recorded plat differs in any material respect from the approved Preliminary Plat.
3. Provides that if the approved and approved and recorded Final Plat does not differ
in any material respect from the plat referred to in the contract, the buyer or lessee
may not be required by the seller or lessor to close any earlier than 5 days after

a Final Plat has not been properly approved under this Ordinance or recorded with the
Office of the Sampson County Register of Deeds where the buyer or lessee is any person
who has contracted to acquire or lease the land for the purpose of engaging in the
business of construction of residential, commercial, or industrial buildings on the land, or
for the purpose of resale or lease of the land to persons engaged in that kind of business,
provided that no conveyance of that land may occur and no contract to lease it may
become effective until after the Final Plat has been properly approved under the
requirements of this Ordinance and recorded in the Office of the Sampson County
Register of Deeds.
11.5.4 Completing Developments in Phases
A. For phased developments, the developer shall submit plans that clearly show the various
phases or stages of the proposed development and the requirements of this Ordinance will be
satisfied with respect to each phase or stage.
B. If a development that is to be built in phases or stages includes common area improvements
that are designed to relate to, benefit, or be used by the entire development (such as a
swimming pool or tennis courts in a residential development) then, as part of his/her
application for development approval, the developer shall submit a proposed schedule for
completion of such common area improvements. The schedule shall relate completion of
such common area improvements to completion of one or more phases or stages of the entire
development. Once a schedule of improvements has been approved and made part of the
permit by the permit-issuing authority, no land may be used or no buildings may be
occupied, and no subdivision lots may be sold except in accordance with the schedule
approved as part of the permit.
11.5.5 Preliminary Plat Validity
E. Upon approval of the Preliminary Plat by the City Council, the developer may proceed with
the preparation of the Final Plat, and the installation of or arrangement for required
improvements in accordance with the approved Preliminary Plat and the requirements of this
Ordinance.
F. The applicant shall submit an amended application for review as an original application if
he/she proposes to substantially amend or modify his/her application after the City Council
has approved the Preliminary Plat. This shall not apply to minor changes. A change may be
considered a minor change if it does not involve any of the following:
1. any substantive change in a condition of approval;
2. an increase in the number of building lots proposed;
3. any substantial change in the location of, or any decrease in, the amount of open space,
buffers, or areas reserved for recreational use;
4. any substantial change in pedestrian and/or vehicular access or circulation including road
classification;
5. any change in the provision of services such as water supply and wastewater disposal;
11-26
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 11: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
6. any substantial change in the location of utilities or other easements.
G. The approval of a Preliminary Plat shall be effective for two (2) years from the date of
approval by the City Council. By the end of that time period, approval of the Final Plat must
have been obtained from the Administrator or his/her designee, although the plat need not
have been recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds. Any plat or portion thereof not
receiving final approval within the time period set forth herein shall be null and void except
under the following conditions:
1. The subdivision is built in sections or phases, and a Phasing Plan was approved as part of
the Preliminary Plat;
2. The period between the approval date of the Preliminary Plat and the approval date of the
Final Plat for the first phase does not exceed two (2) years; and
3. The period between the approval date of the Final Plat of the first phase and the approval
date(s) of the Final Plat(s) of any subsequent phase(s) does not exceed the time limits
specified in the Phasing Plan of the Preliminary Plat. If no Phasing Plan is indicated,
then the period between Final Plat approvals shall not exceed 6 months.
H. Where a Phasing Plan for construction of the subdivision is approved, construction may not
begin until required utilities and/or other facilities are available to serve the development
(e.g., adequate public facilities).
I. The Administrator or his/her designee may upon expiration of a Preliminary Plat re-approve
the expired Preliminary Plat or portions thereof, as long as the subdivision design and
conditions of approval are in compliance with this Ordinance, and any other applicable City
ordinances and/or plans in effect at the time of application for re-approval, and changes to the
original design or conditions of approval are considered minor.
J. Only one administrative re-approval may be approved for any subdivision. If a re-approved
Preliminary Plat expires, the developer shall be required to resubmit a new Preliminary Plat
for the tract or portion thereof for which approval has expired. The new plat shall be subject
to all applicable regulations in existence at the time of re-submittal. Provided, however, the
development Phasing Plan approved as part of the Preliminary Plat (hereafter the Phasing
Plan) may be amended by the City Council upon application by the subdivider. In
determining whether to approve an amended Phasing Plan, the City Council shall consider:
1. whether or not approval of other diligently pursued regulatory requirements can be
obtained before the expiration of the time periods established in the Phasing Plan; and
2. the quality and length of time of the experience of the subdivider in managing
development projects; and
3. whether factors other than market conditions and beyond the control of the subdivider
caused a delay in meeting the Phasing Plan; and
4. whether the development project, if completed consistent with the approved Preliminary
Plat, will tend to aid or meet an important public policy goal established by the City
Council; and
5. whether the application for an amended Phasing Plan was submitted before the
previously approved time limit(s) has lapsed; and
11-27
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 11: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
6. the possibility of and practicality of the subdivider and developer completing the
development project consistent with City of Clinton regulations applicable if the Phasing
Plan amendment is not granted; and
7. whether the time by which improvements must be completed or installed would not be
extended by the revised Phasing Plan.
After consideration of the evidence submitted by the applicant concerning each of the factors
listed above, the City Council may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, grant the
amendment to the Phasing Plan unless it concludes that to do so would not maintain or
promote, in some specific manner, the general public health, safety, and welfare. If the City
Council approves an amendment to the Phasing Plan, it may require reasonable additional
conditions of approval of the unapproved Final Plat(s).
11.5.6 Appeal of Final Plat Denial
The applicant may, if the Final Plat is denied, submit a revised plat for review and approval or,
within 30 days of the date of the Administrators decision on the Final Plat, appeal the decision
to the City Council. Ten (10) copies of the Final Plat shall be submitted along with the written
appeal. The City Council shall have final approval authority and, where applicable, the Final
Plat shall contain information and/or conditions approved by the City Council.
11.5.7 Plat Approval Not Acceptance of Dedication Offers
Approval of a plat does not constitute acceptance by the City of the offer of dedication of any
streets, sidewalks, parks, or other public facilities shown on a plat. However, the City may
accept any such offer of dedication by resolution of the Council or by actually exercising control
over and maintaining such facilities.
11.5.8 Protection Against Defects
A. Whenever occupancy, use or sale is allowed before the completion of all facilities or
improvements intended for dedication, then the performance bond or the surety that is posted
shall guarantee that any defects in such improvements or facilities that appear within one
year after the dedication of such facilities or improvements is accepted shall be corrected by
the developer.
B. Whenever all public facilities or improvements intended for dedication are installed before
occupancy, use, or sale is authorized, then the developer shall post a performance bond or
other sufficient surety to guarantee that he/she will correct all defects in such facilities or
improvements that occur within one year after the offer of dedication of such facilities or
improvements is accepted.
C. An architect or engineer retained by the developer shall certify to the City that all facilities
and improvements to be dedicated to the City have been constructed in accordance with the
requirements of this Ordinance. This certification shall be a condition precedent to
acceptance by the City of the offer of dedication of such facilities or improvements.
D. For purposes of this Section, the term defects refers to any condition in publicly dedicated
facilities or improvements that requires the City to make repairs in such facilities over and
11-28
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 11: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS
above the normal amount of maintenance that they would require. If such defects appear, the
guaranty may be enforced regardless of whether the facilities or improvements were
constructed in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance.
11.5.9 Maintenance of Dedicated Areas Until Acceptance
All facilities and improvements with respect to which the owner makes an offer of dedication to
public use shall be maintained by the owner until such offer of dedication is accepted by the
appropriate public authority.

CHAPTER 13: NONCONFORMITIES
Section 13.1 Purpose and Applicability
The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate and limit the continued existence of uses and structures
established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance (or any amendment subsequent thereto)
that do not conform to this Ordinance. Any nonconformity created by a change in the
classification of property or the text of these regulations shall be regulated by the provisions of
this Chapter. Many nonconformities may continue, but the provisions of this Chapter are
designed to minimize substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring about eventual
elimination and/or lessen their impact upon surrounding conforming properties in order to
preserve the integrity of the area in which it is located and the intent of this Ordinance.
Section 13.2 Continuation of Nonconforming Situations
A. Unless otherwise provided in this Ordinance and subject to the restrictions and qualifications
set forth in Sections 13.3 through 13.8, nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful
on the effective date of this Ordinance may be continued.
B. In the Airport Height Overlay (AH-O) District, the owner of any existing nonconforming
structure or tree shall be required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance
thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Administrator to
indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the Clinton-Sampson County Airport the
presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated,
and maintained at the expense of the Airport. If, by a determination of the North Carolina
Division of Aviation or Federal Aviation Administration, the encroachment of any structure
or tree into regulated airspace is such that providing markers and lights is insufficient to
protect the life and property of the flying public, the applicable authority shall institute steps
to have such structures or trees mitigated at the expense of the applicable authority. If
unsuccessful in obtaining the cooperation of the parties involved, the City shall institute the
appropriate legal action, as reasonably necessary, to insure the safety of the flying public in
airspace regulated by this Ordinance.
Section 13.3 Nonconforming Lots
A. When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to
the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimum for the zoning
district, then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no use
(e.g., a two-family dwelling) that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot
size for a particular zoning district is permissible on a nonconforming lot.
B. If a nonconforming lot fails to meet lot area or width requirements, or both, in a district
where single-family residences are permitted, such lot may be used as the location of a
single-family dwelling with related accessory buildings. The Board of Adjustment may
allow a 20 percent reduction in the applicable setback requirements if it finds that:
13-3
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 13: NONCONFORMITIES
1. The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such
deviations,
2. These deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot, and
3. The property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on
surrounding properties or the public health and safety.
C. For purposes of Subsection (B), mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for
finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.
D. This Section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has
no substantial structures upon it. A change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be
accomplished in accordance with Section 13.6.
E. If two (2) or more adjoining and vacant lots of record are in single ownership at any time
after the adoption of this Ordinance, and such lots individually have less frontage or area than
the minimum requirement of the district in which such lots are located, such lots shall be
considered as a single zoning lot of several lots which meet the minimum requirements of
this Ordinance for the district in which such lots are located.
Section 13.4 Extension or Enlargement of Nonconformities
A. Except as specifically provided in this Section, no person may engage in any activity that
causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. In
particular, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is
unlawful if such activity results in:
1. An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use, or
2. Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback
requirements, height limitations, or density requirements, or other requirements such as
parking requirements.
B. Subject to Subsection (D), a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of
a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this Ordinance, was
manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, subject to Section
13.7, a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the
original building.
C. Subject to Section 13.7, a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover
more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a use
that involves the removal of natural material from the lot (e.g., a sand pit) may be expanded
to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became
nonconforming if 10 percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the
effective date of this Ordinance.
D. The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation
exists may be increased, and the equipment or processes used at a location where a
13-4
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 13: NONCONFORMITIES
nonconforming situation exists may be changed, if these or similar changes amount only to
changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind, and no violations of other
Subsections of this Section occur.
E. Notwithstanding Subsection (A), any structure used for single-family residential purposes
and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure
of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new
nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such
matters as setback and parking requirements (e.g., where allowed, a single-wide
manufactured home may be replaced with a double-wide manufactured home). This
Subsection is subject to the limitations stated in Section 13.7.
F. Notwithstanding Subsection (A), whenever: (i) there exists a lot with one or more structures
on it, and (ii) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed
for such lot, and (iii) the parking or loading requirements of Chapter 18 (Parking) that would
be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there
is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading,
then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or
enlargement of a nonconforming situation. However, the applicant shall be required to
comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without
acquiring additional land, and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance
with Chapter 9 (Parking) if: (i) parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with
respect to which the permit is required, and (ii) such satellite parking is reasonably available.
If such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the Zoning or Conditional Use
Permit is granted, then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does
become reasonably available. This requirement shall be a continuing condition of the Permit.
Section 13.5 Repairs, Maintenance and Reconstruction
A. Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist
are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation (i.e., work estimated to cost more than 50
percent of its replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
the structure, as the case may be) may be done only in accordance with a Zoning Permit
pursuant to this Section.
B. If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent
that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed 50 percent of its replacement cost at the
time of destruction, then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in
accordance with a Zoning Permit issued pursuant to this Section. This Subsection does not
apply to structures used for single-family residential purposes (including manufactured
homes), which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a Zoning Permit just as they may
be enlarged or replaced as provided in Subsection (E) of Section 13.3.
C. For purposes of Subsections (A) and (B):
13-5
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 13: NONCONFORMITIES
1. The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the current fair market value
of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair, or
replacement.
2. The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such
intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of Subsections (A) or (B) by
doing such work incrementally.
3. The Administrator may require the applicant to provide an appraisal to establish the cost.
D. The Administrator shall issue a Zoning Permit authorized by this Section if he/she finds that,
in completing the renovation, repair, or replacement work:
1. No violation of Section 13.3 (Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations)
will occur, and
2. The permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this
Ordinance applicable to the existing use (except that the permittee shall not lose his/her
right to continue a nonconforming use).
Section 13.6 Change in Use of Property Where Nonconformity Exists
A. A change in use of property that is sufficiently substantial to require a new Zoning Permit or
Conditional Use Permit may not be made except in accordance with Subsections (B) through
(D). However, this requirement shall not apply if only a Sign Permit is needed.
B. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the
property is located, and all of the other requirements of this Ordinance applicable to that use
can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner
as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this Ordinance is
achieved, the property may not revert to its nonconforming status.
C. If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the
property is located, but all of the requirements of this Ordinance applicable to that use cannot
reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this
Ordinance to issue a permit for that particular use (the Administrator, or City Council) issues
a permit authorizing the change. This permit may be issued if the permit-issuing authority
finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by this Ordinance, that:
1. The intended change will not result in a violation of Section 13.3 (Extension and
Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations); and
2. All of the applicable requirements of this Section that can reasonably be complied with
will be complied with.
D. Compliance with a requirement of this Ordinance is not reasonably possible if compliance
cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming
situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation.
Mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking
does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. And in no
case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this Subsection to construct a
13-6
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 13: NONCONFORMITIES
building, or to add to an existing building, if additional nonconformities would thereby be
created.
E. If the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming, then the
change is permissible if the entity authorized by this Ordinance to issue a permit for that
particular use (Administrator or City Council) issues a permit authorizing the change. The
permit-issuing authority may issue the permit if it finds, in addition to other findings that may
be required by this Ordinance, that:
1. The use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a Zoning
or Conditional Use Permit, and
2. All of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in Subsection (C) of this Section
are satisfied, and
3. The proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by
it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in
operation at the time the permit is applied for.
Section 13.7 Abandonment & Discontinuance of Nonconformities
A. Except as provided in Subsection (E), when a nonconforming use is (i) discontinued for a
consecutive period of 180 days, or (ii) discontinued for any period of time without a present
intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the property involved may thereafter be used
only for conforming purposes.
B. If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a
nonconforming use exists is (i) discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days, or (ii)
discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then
that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable
to the preexisting use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use
issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the
nonconforming situations. This permit may be issued if the permit-issuing authority finds
that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be
accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is
maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation). The permit
shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected.
C. For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost
pursuant to this Section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are
generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one (1) apartment in a
nonconforming apartment building, or one space in a nonconforming manufactured home
park, for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space
thereafter so long as the apartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is
continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a
conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall
terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. And so, if a manufactured home is used as a
nonconforming use on a residential lot where a conforming residential structure also is
located, removal of that manufactured home for 180 days determines the right to replace it.
13-7
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 13: NONCONFORMITIES
D. When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this Ordinance is vacant or
discontinued at the effective date of this Ordinance, the 180 day period for purposes of this
Section begins to run on the effective date of this Ordinance.
E. In the Airport Height Overlay (AH-O) District, whenever the Administrator determines that a
nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down,
physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such
structure or tree to exceed 49 feet in height otherwise deviate from Ordinance regulations
applicable within the Airport Height Overlay (AH-O) District.
Section 13.8 Completion of Nonconforming Projects
A. All nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before the
effective date of this Ordinance, as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least 10%
completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this
Ordinance, may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as their
permits were validly issued and remain un-revoked and un-expired. If a development is
designed to be completed in stages, this Section shall apply only to the particular phase under
construction.
B. Except as provided in Subsection (A), all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on
the effective date of this Ordinance, and all permits previously issued for work on
nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a Zoning,
Conditional Use, or Sign Permit issued in accordance with this Ordinance by the individual
or board authorized by this Ordinance to issue permits for the type of development proposed.
The permit-issuing authority shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has, in
good faith, made substantial expenditures, or incurred substantial binding obligations, or
otherwise changed his/her position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land
use law as it existed before the date of this Ordinance, and project as proposed. In
considering whether these findings may be made, the permit-issuing authority shall be guided
by the following, as well as other relevant considerations:
1. All expenditures made to obtain, or pursuant to, a validly issued and un-revoked
Building, Zoning, Sign, or Conditional Use Permit shall be considered as evidence of
reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this Ordinance became
effective;
2. Except as provided in Subsection (B)(1), no expenditures made more than 180 days
before the effective date of this Ordinance may be considered as evidence of reasonable
reliance on the land use law that existed before this Ordinance became effective. An
expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that
expenditure;
3. To the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort, a party shall not
be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures. For example, a party shall
not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential
development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new
13-8
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 13: NONCONFORMITIES
classification as it was under the old, for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of
the property;
4. To the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming, and that
expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of
a conforming project, a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such
expenditures;
5. An expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount
and in terms of (i) the total estimated cost of the proposed project, and (ii) the ordinary
business practices of the developer;
6. A person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a
proposed change in land use law affecting the proposed development site could not be
attributed to him/her;
7. Even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law
affecting a development site, the permit-issuing authority may still find that he/she acted
in good faith if he/she did not proceed with his/her plans in a deliberate attempt to
circumvent the effects of the proposed Ordinance. The permit-issuing authority may find
that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed Ordinance if
it determines that (i) at the time the expenditures were made, either there was
considerable doubt about whether any Ordinance would ultimately be passed, or it was
not clear that the proposed Ordinance would prohibit the intended development, and (ii)
the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures.
C. When it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or
reasonably could be completed in phases, stages, segments, or other discrete units, the
developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which
the developer can make the showing under Subsection (B). In addition to the matters and
subject to the guidelines set forth in (1) through (6) of Subsection (B), the permit-issuing
authority shall, in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not
allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project, consider the following
in addition to other relevant factors:
1. Whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute
conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying,
architectural, or engineering work;
2. Whether any improvements, such as streets or utilities, have been installed in phases not
yet completed;
3. Whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed
in such a manner or location, or such a scale in anticipation of connection to or
interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases that the investment in such
utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but uncompleted phases
are constructed in conformity with existing regulations.
D. The permit-issuing authority shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by
Subsection (B) that is submitted more than 60 days after the effective date of this Ordinance.
The permit-issuing authority may waive this requirement for good cause shown, but in no
case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year.
13-9
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 13: NONCONFORMITIES
E. The permit-issuing authority shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications for
permits under this Section. These applications shall be heard, whenever possible, before the
effective date of this Ordinance, so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted.
Section 13.9 Authorization of Nonconforming Projects
Whenever an amendment to this Ordinance becomes effective after an application for a
development permit is submitted, but before the permit is issued, and the effect of the
amendment is to render the proposed development nonconforming in some respect, then the
permit-issuing authority may nevertheless issue the permit even though the project is
nonconforming, if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or
incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his/her position in some
substantial way in reasonable reliance on this Ordinance as it existed prior to the amendment and
thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if required to comply with this Ordinance as so
amended.
Section 13.10 Vested Rights Based Upon Site-Specific Development Plan
A. The City Council determines that a Conditional Use Permit shall be regarded as a sitespecific
development plan under the provisions of GS 160A-385.1. Therefore, once a
Conditional Use Permit has been issued, the permit recipient shall have a vested right to
complete the development authorized by such permit in accordance with its terms,
irrespective of subsequent amendments to this Ordinance, to the extent provided in GS 160A-
385.1.
B. The City Council further determines that recipients of Zoning Permits should be entitled to
the same protections as recipients of Conditional Use Permits. Therefore, once a permit has
been issued, the permit recipient shall have a vested right to complete the development
authorized by such permit in accordance with its terms, irrespective of subsequent
amendments to this Ordinance, to the same extent provided in NCGS 160A-385.1 for
developments authorized by the approval of site specific development plans.
C. A vested right under this Section commences upon the issuance of the permit in question.
1. A zoning right that has been vested as provided in this Ordinance shall remain vested for
a period of two (2) years. This vesting shall not be extended by any amendments or
modifications to a site-specific development plan, unless expressly provided by the
approval authority at the time the amendment or modification is approved;
2. As provided in GS 160A-385.1(d)(6), a right that has been vested in accordance with this
Section shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting period with respect to
buildings and uses for which no valid Building Permit applications have been filed.
D. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit the revocation of a permit pursuant to Section 15.8, and
the vesting of rights provided for under this Section shall be terminated upon such
revocation.
13-10
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 13: NONCONFORMITIES
E. The effect of this Section is to ensure that, during the period of vesting, the developer is
protected from subsequent changes in this Ordinance to a greater extent than is authorized
under Section 13.11 (Vested Rights Upon Issuance of Building Permits) (which provides for
a vesting of rights only after a Building Permit has been obtained), or Section 13.8
(Completion of Nonconforming Projects) (which generally provides for a vesting of rights
only after the developer has made substantial expenditures in good faith reliance upon this
Ordinance).
Section 13.11 Vested Rights Upon Issuance of Building Permits
As provided in GS 160A-385, amendments, modifications, supplements, repeal or other changes
in the zoning regulations set forth in this Ordinance or zoning district boundaries shall not be
applicable or enforceable without consent of the owner with respect to buildings and uses for
which a Building Permit has been issued pursuant to GS 160A-417 prior to the enactment of the
ordinance making the change or changes, so long as the permit remains valid and un-expired
pursuant to GS 160A-418, and un-revoked pursuant to GS 160A-422.
Section 13.12 Nonconforming Signs
A. Subject to the remaining restrictions of this Section, nonconforming signs that were
otherwise lawful on the effective date of this Chapter may be continued until they are
required to be removed.
B. No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity
of a nonconforming sign. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered in such a manner as to aggravate the
nonconforming condition, nor may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign.
C. A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete
conformity with this Ordinance. Notwithstanding any provisions of Section 13.12, if any
existing (at the time this ordinance was adopted) non-conforming sign is required to be
moved due to a roadway expansion or some other form of eminent domain, the sign may be
moved and reused on the property where it is located as long as the sign is not enlarged or
altered in such a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition.
D. If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not thereafter be repaired,
reconstructed, or replaced except in conformity with all of the provisions of this Ordinance,
and the remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land. For purposes of
this Subsection, a nonconforming sign is destroyed if damage to an extent that the cost of
repairing the sign to its former stature or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or
exceeds the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of the sign so damaged.
E. The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create any
new nonconformity (for example, by creating an off-premises sign under circumstances
where such a sign would not be allowed).
13-11
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 13: NONCONFORMITIES
F. Subject to the other provisions of this Section, nonconforming signs may be repaired and
renovated so long as the cost of such work does not exceed, within any 12-month period, 50
percent of the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of such sign.
G. If a nonconforming sign other than a billboard advertises a business, service, commodity,
accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being
offered or conducted, that sign shall be considered abandoned and shall be removed within
30 days after such abandonment by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is
located, or other party having control over such sign.
H. If a nonconforming billboard remains blank for a continuous period of 180 days, that
billboard shall be deemed abandoned and shall, within 30 days after such abandonment, be
altered to comply with this Section or be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property
where the sign is located, or other person having control over such sign. For purposes of this
Subsection, a sign is blank if:
1. It advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other
enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted, or
2. The advertising message it displays becomes illegible in whole or substantial part, or
3. The advertising copy paid for by a party other than the sign owner, or promoting an
interest other than the rental of the sign, has been removed.
Section 13.13 Nonconforming Manufactured Home Parks
A. All manufactured home parks existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance are
hereby deemed nonconforming uses. No person shall make any addition or alteration to a
manufactured home park that either alters the number of sites for manufactured homes within
the park or affects the facilities required.
B. Each nonconforming manufactured home park shall have received Conditional Use Permit
under the previous Zoning Ordinance. Failure to maintain adherence to the design and
operating standards in this Section may result in revocation of the Permit. Upon failure to
maintain standards staff may, after written notification, recommend a hearing before the City
Council to consider revocation of the permit.
C. No zoning compliance permits shall be issued for individual manufactured home setups or
replacements within parks which have violations of the design and operation standards of this
Section.
D. If the owner of a nonconforming manufactured home park wishes to continue operation
indefinitely, the following design standards shall be maintained:
1. No more than one (1) manufactured home may be parked on any manufactured home
space.
2. The supports of all manufactured homes parked within an authorized park shall rest upon
footings which meet the North Carolina Regulations for manufactured homes.
13-12
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 13: NONCONFORMITIES
3. No manufactured home stand shall be located less than 40 feet from a public street rightof-
way. No manufactured home stand shall be located less than 25 feet from a private
drive or from an exterior park boundary or less than thirty feet from another
manufactured home stand, a manufactured home addition or any other structure.
4. A driveway and parking space sufficient to accommodate at least two (2) automobiles
shall be constructed within each manufactured home space and shall be paved or covered
with crushed stone or other suitable material.
5. Each manufactured home stand and the manufactured home space shall be graded to
provide adequate storm drainage away from the mobile and such that there will exist no
more than two feet difference between the chassis of the manufactured home and the
finished grade of the manufactured home stand along the entire perimeter of the
manufactured home proper.
6. The manufactured home park shall have all-weather surfaced roads and streets, lighted at
night, abut all manufactured home spaces.
7. No manufactured home space shall have direct vehicular access to a public street.
8. Area to provide proper drainage ditches, and a three to one back slope shall be provided
where determined necessary by the Planning Board or Zoning Administrator.
9. Closed ends of dead-end streets shall be provided with a turning circle at least 60 feet in
diameter or a turning Y with an angle of at least 90 degrees.
10. Each manufactured home stand shall have adequate access, for both the manufactured
home and autos, with a minimum access width of twenty feet unless more is deemed

accordance with the provisions of this Article.
Section 14.2 Initiation of Amendments
A. Whenever a request to amend this Ordinance or the Official Zoning Map is initiated by the
City Council or the Planning & Zoning Board, then the Administrator shall draft an
appropriate ordinance and present that ordinance to the City Council so that a date for a
public hearing may be set. Requests for Conditional Zoning Map Amendments shall only be
filed by the property owner of the subject or agent of the property owner.

Zoning Map. The petition shall be filed with the Administrator and shall include, among the

amendment is for a Conditional Zoning district.
14-3
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 14: MAP AND TEXT AMENDMENTS
Section 14.3 Amendment Approval Process
14.3.1 Administrator Action
Upon receipt of a complete petition, the Administrator shall forward the request to the Planning
& Zoning Board with a written report at the Boards next regularly scheduled meeting.
14.3.2 Planning & Zoning Board Consideration of Proposed Amendments
A. The Planning & Zoning Board shall advise and comment on whether the proposed
amendment is consistent with any comprehensive plan that has been adopted and any other
officially adopted plan that is applicable. The Planning & Zoning Board shall provide a
written recommendation to the City Council that addresses plan consistency and other
matters as deemed appropriate by the Planning & Zoning Board; however, a comment by the
Planning & Zoning Board that a proposed amendment is inconsistent with the comprehensive
plan or other adopted plan(s) shall not preclude consideration or approval of the proposed
amendment by the City Council.
B. If no written report is received from the Planning & Zoning Board within 30 days of referral
of the amendment to the Board, the City Council may proceed in its consideration of the
amendment without the Planning & Zoning Boards report. The City Council is not bound
by the recommendation, if any, of the Planning & Zoning Board.
C. No Planning & Zoning Board member shall vote on recommendations regarding any zoning
map or text amendment where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably
likely to have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the matter.
14.3.3 Public Hearing & Notice
A. No ordinance that amends any of the provisions of this Ordinance may be adopted until a
public hearing has been held on such ordinance.
B. The Administrator shall publish a notice of the public hearing on any ordinance that amends
the provisions of this Ordinance once a week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper of
general circulation in the area. The notice shall be published for the first time not less than
10 days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the hearing. In computing this
period, the date of publication shall not be counted, but the date of the hearing shall be.
C. The Administrator shall mail written notice of the public hearing via first class mail to the
record owners for tax purposes of all properties whose zoning classification is changed by the
proposed amendment, any portion of which is within 100 feet of the property rezoned by the
amendment. The notice shall be deposited in the mail at least 10 but not more than 25 days
prior to the date of the public hearing. The Administrator shall certify to the City Council
that fact, and such certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud.
D. The first class mail notice required by Subsection (C) shall not be required if the rezoning
directly affects more than 50 properties, owned by a total of at least 50 different property
owners, and the City elects to use the expanded published notice in a newspaper of general
14-4
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 14: MAP AND TEXT AMENDMENTS
circulation within the area where the rezoning is proposed. The expanded published notice
shall consist of an advertisement of the public hearing that is no less than ½ of the newspaper
page in size. The Administrator shall publish the notice once a week for two (2) successive
weeks. The notice shall be published for the first time not less than 10 days nor more than 25
days before the date fixed for the hearing. In computing this period, the date of publication
shall not be counted, but the date of the hearing shall be. The advertisement shall only be
effective for property owners who reside in the area of general circulation of the newspaper
that publishes the notice. Property owners who reside outside of the newspaper circulation
area, according to the address listed on the most recent property tax listing for the affected
property, shall be notified by first class mailed notice, as prescribed in Subsection (C).
E. For map amendments initiated by a third party, property owner(s) who are not signatories of
the application for zoning map amendment must be notified through personal delivery or
registered, certified, or delivery receipt mail. Such notice shall state the existing zoning
classification and the classification requested by the third party and the date, time, and
location of the public hearing. The notice shall be written by the Administrator, yet the
burden for making this actual notice is on the third party requesting the rezoning, the proof of
which shall be provided to the Administrator prior to the public hearing. This requirement
shall not apply if a map amendment is initiated by the City.
F. The Administrator shall also post notices of the public hearing on the property being rezoned
by the proposed amendment or on an adjacent public street or highway right-of-way. When
multiple parcels are involved, a posting on each individual parcel is not required, but the City
shall post sufficient notices to provide reasonable notice to interested persons. The
Administrator may elect to take any other action deemed to be useful or appropriate to give
notice of the public hearing on any proposed amendment. The notice(s) shall be posted no
less than 10 days prior to date of the public hearing.
G. The notices required or authorized by this Section shall:
1. State the date, time, and place of the public hearing,
2. Summarize the nature and character of the proposed change,
3. If the proposed amendment involves a change in zoning district classification, reasonably
identify the property whose classification would be affected by the amendment,
4. State that the full text of the amendment can be obtained from the City Clerk, and
5. State that substantial changes in the proposed amendment may be made following the
public hearing.
H. The posted notice shall only be required to state the property is subject to a rezoning request,
that a public hearing will be held on the matter, and give contact information on where to
obtain information on the request and the date and time of the hearing.
I. The Administrator shall make every reasonable effort to comply with the notice provisions
set forth in this Section. However, it is the City Councils intention that no failure to comply
with any of the notice provisions (except those set forth in Subsection (B)) shall render any
amendment invalid.
14-5
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 14: MAP AND TEXT AMENDMENTS
14.3.4 City Council Action on Amendments
A. At the conclusion of the public hearing on a proposed amendment, the City Council may
proceed to vote on the proposed ordinance, refer it to a committee for further study, or take
any other action consistent with its rules of procedure.
B. The City Council is not required to take final action on a proposed amendment within any
specific period of time, but it should proceed as expeditiously as practicable on petitions for
amendments since inordinate delays can result in the petitioner incurring unnecessary costs.
C. Voting on amendments to this Ordinance shall proceed in the same manner as other
ordinances, subject to Section 14.5 (Protest Petitions).
D. Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the City Council shall adopt a
statement describing whether its action is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan or
other officially adopted plan, and explaining why the Council considers the action taken to be
reasonable and in the public interest. That statement is not subject to judicial review.
E. A City Council member shall not vote on any zoning map or text amendment where the
outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct, substantial, and
readily identifiable financial impact on the member.
F. In deciding whether to adopt a proposed amendment to this Ordinance, the central issue
before the City Council is whether the proposed amendment advances the public health,
safety, or welfare. All other issues are irrelevant, and all information related to other issues
at the public hearing may be declared irrelevant by the Mayor and excluded. In particular,
when considering proposed minor map amendments:
1. The City Council shall not consider any representations made by the petitioner that if the
change is granted the rezoned property will be used for only one of the possible range of
uses permitted in the requested classification. Rather, the City Council shall consider
whether the entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more
appropriate than the range of uses in the existing classification.
2. The City Council shall not regard as controlling any advantages or disadvantages to the
individual requesting the change, but shall consider the impact of the proposed change on
the public at large.
3. The City Council shall consider whether or not its action is consistent with an adopted
comprehensive plan or other officially adopted plan, and if the action taken is reasonable
and in the public interest.
14.3.5 Special Provisions for Conditional Zoning Map Amendments
A. The Conditional Zoning (CZ) approval process is established to address those situations
when a particular use may be acceptable but the general zoning district(s) that would allow
that use would not be acceptable. Rezoning of property to any CZ district is a voluntary
procedure on the part of the property owner and is intended for firm development proposals.
It is not intended or suited for securing early zoning for a tentative proposal that may be
undertaken at some unknown time in the future.
14-6
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 14: MAP AND TEXT AMENDMENTS
B. The applicant initiating a CZ rezoning shall provide at a minimum the drawings and
information required for a Sketch Plan as outlined in Chapter 12.
C. When considering a petition for a rezoning to a CZ District, the Planning & Zoning Board
and the City Council shall evaluate the petition based on specific proposal for the use or
development of the affected property and the petitioner shall provide materials and
descriptions of the proposed use and development.
D. Any use permitted under this process must also, as a minimum, conform to the development
regulations for the corresponding underlying general zoning district.
E. In approving a CZ rezoning, the City Council may impose such additional restrictions and
requirements upon approval as it may deem necessary in order that the purpose and intent of
this Ordinance are served, public welfare secured and substantial justice done.
F. If a petition for a CZ rezoning is approved as provided for herein, the district that is
established and all conditions which may have been attached to the approval are binding on
the property as an amendment to the Zoning Map. Subsequent development on the
property(ies) in question shall be in accordance with the standards for the approved CZ
district and any conditions attached to the approval. Except as herein provided for minor
changes, changes to the approved petition or to the conditions attached to the approval shall
be treated the same as an amendment to the Zoning Map. Minor changes in the detail of the
approved application may be made with the approval of the Administrator. The following
criteria qualify as a minor change:
1. The proposed change(s) will not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development
to adjacent property; and
2. The proposed change(s) will not alter the uses permitted; and
3. The proposed change(s) will not increase the height of any structure to the extent that
additional usable floor space will be added; and
4. The proposed change(s) will not increase the gross floor area of any non-residential use
by the smaller of 10 percent or 10,000 square feet. Such limitations shall be cumulative
and shall be based on the gross floor area specified in the CZ district as originally
approved; and
5. The proposed change(s) will not result in an increase in the number of dwelling units
constructed for any residential use; and
6. The proposed change(s) will not decrease the off-street parking below the minimum
number of parking spaces required by this Ordinance.
G. It is intended that property be rezoned to a CZ District only in light of firm plans to develop
the property. Therefore, after the date of approval of the CZ District, if a building permit has
not been secured or final plat recorded at the end of two (2) years following the date of the
approval of the CZ District, the Administrator shall notify the applicant of such a finding.
The Administrator shall then have the Planning & Zoning Board to make a recommendation
to the City Council regarding the rescission of the Conditional Zoning District and the
zoning of the property revert to the zoning district in effect prior to the initial approval.
14-7
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 14: MAP AND TEXT AMENDMENTS
Section 14.4 Effect of Denial or Withdrawal on Subsequent Applications
When the City Council shall have denied an application for an amendment, or the application
shall have been withdrawn by the applicant by written notice after the first public hearing
required, the Administrator shall not accept another application for the same or similar
amendment affecting the same property or portion thereof, until the expiration of a one-year
period extending from the date of denial or withdrawal as appropriate. Nothing in this Section,
however, shall prohibit the City Council or Planning & Zoning Board from initiating an
amendment for any property at any time.
Section 14.5 Statute of Limitations on Challenges
Pursuant to NCGS 1-54.1, an action contesting the validity of the adoption of, or any amendment
to, a zoning ordinance adopted under Chapter 160A of the General Statutes or other applicable
law shall be taken within 2 months of the adoption of the ordinance or amendment.
Section 14.6 Notice to NCDOT
Pursuant to NCGS 136-153 (Zoning Changes), all zoning authorities shall give written notice to
the Department of Transportation of the establishment or revision of any industrial zone within
660 feet of interstate or primary highways. Notice shall be by registered mail sent to the offices
of the Department of Transportation in Raleigh, North Carolina, within 15 days after the
effective date of the zoning change or establishment.

Section 15.7 Appeals, Variances & Interpretations (TA-9-14-6)
15.7.1 Appeals
The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals from decisions of administrative officials
charged with enforcement of this Ordinance and may hear appeals arising out of any other
ordinance that regulates land use or development, pursuant to all of the following:
A. Any person who has standing under NCGS 160A-393(d) or the City may appeal a decision to
the Board of Adjustment. An appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal with the
Administrator and City clerk. The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for the appeal.
B. The official who made the decision shall give written notice to the owner of the property that
is the subject of the decision and to the party who sought the decision, if different from the
owner. The written notice shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, or by
first-class mail.
C. The owner or other party shall have 30 days from receipt of the written notice within which
to file an appeal. Any other person with standing to appeal shall have 30 days from receipt
from any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an
appeal.
D. The official who made the decision shall transmit to the Board all documents and exhibits
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken. The official shall also
provide a copy of the record to the appellant and to the owner of the property that is subject
of the appeal if the appellant is not the owner.
E. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time.
F. The official who made the decision shall be present at the hearing as a witness. The
appellant shall not be limited at the hearing to matters stated in the notice of appeal. If any
party or the City would be unduly prejudiced by the presentation of matters not presented in
the notice of appeal, the Board shall continue the hearing. The Board of Adjustment may
reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make
any order, requirement, decision, or determination that ought to be made. The Board shall
have all the powers of the official who made the decision.
G. When hearing an appeal pursuant to NCGS 160A-400.9 or any other appeal in the nature of
certiorari, the hearing shall be based on the record below and the scope of review shall be as
provided in NCGS 160A-393(k).
15-10
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 15: ADMINISTRATION &ENFORCEMENT
H. An appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action
from unless the official who made the decision certifies to the Board of Adjustment after
notice of appeal has been filed that because of the facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would
cause imminent peril to life or property or because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay
would seriously interfere with the enforcement of the ordinance. In that case, enforcement
proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a
court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the official a
request for any expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment shall meet to
hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise affirming that a proposed use of property
is consistent with the ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application or permits
or permissions to use such property; in these situations the appellant may request and the
Board may grant a stay of a final decision of permit applications or building permits affected
by the issued being appealed.
I. The parties to an appeal that has been made under this subsection may agree to mediation or
other forms of alternative dispute resolution.
15.7.2 Variances
A. An application for a variance shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by filing a copy
of the application with the Administrator in the Planning Department.
B. When presented to the Board of Adjustment at the hearing, that application for a variance
shall be accompanied by a report setting forth the Planning Staffs proposed findings
concerning the applications compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance, as well as
any Staff recommendations for additional requirements to be imposed by the Board of
Adjustment. If the Staff proposes a finding or conclusion that the application fails to comply
with any requirement of this Ordinance, it shall identify the requirement in question and
specifically state supporting reasons for the proposed findings or conclusions.
C. When unnecessary hardships would result from carrying out the strict letter of a zoning
ordinance, the Board of Adjustment shall vary any of the provisions of the ordinance upon a
showing of all of the following:
1. Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of the ordinance. It
shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no
reasonable use can be made of the property.
2. The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as
location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances,
as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the
neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.
3. The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property
owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist
that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created
hardship.
15-11
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 15: ADMINISTRATION &ENFORCEMENT
4. The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the
ordinance such that public safety is secured and substantial justice is achieved.
D. No change in permitted uses may be imposed on any variance, provided that the
conditions are reasonably related to the variance. Any other ordinance that regulates land
use or development may provide for variances consistent with the provisions of the
subsection.
E. A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration.
F. The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the
Zoning Permit, or the Zoning Permit may simply note the issuance of the variance and refer
to the written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions are
enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this Ordinance.
15.7.3 Interpretations
A. The Board of Adjustment is authorized to interpret the Official Zoning Map and to pass upon
disputed questions of lot lines or district boundary lines and similar questions.
B. An application for a map interpretation shall be submitted to the Board of Adjustment by
filing a copy of the application with the Administrator in the Planning Department. The
application shall contain sufficient information to enable the Board to make the necessary
interpretation.
C. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning
Map, the following rules shall apply:
1. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of alleys, streets,
highways, streams, or railroads shall be construed to follow such centerlines,
2. Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, city limits, or extraterritorial
boundary lines, shall be construed as following such lines, limits, or boundaries,
3. Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines,
and in the event of change in the shoreline, shall be construed as following such
shorelines,
4. Where a district boundary divides a lot or where distances are not specifically indicated
on the Official Zoning Map, the boundary shall be determined by measurement, using the
scale of the Official Zoning Map,
5. Where any street or alley is hereafter officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations
applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall apply to that portion of such street or
alley added thereto by virtue of such vacation or abandonment.
15.7.4 Hearing Procedures
A. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide all appeals, variance requests, and requests
for interpretations as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the need to follow regularly
established agenda procedures, provide notice and obtain the necessary information to make
sound decisions.
15-12
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 15: ADMINISTRATION &ENFORCEMENT
B. Notice of Board of Adjustment hearings shall be mailed to the person or entity whose appeal,
application, or request is the subject of the hearing; to the owner of the property that is the
subject of the hearing if the owner did not initiate the hearing; and to the owners of all
parcels of land abutting the parcel of land that is the subject of the hearing. In the absence of
evidence to the contrary, the City may rely on the county tax listing to determine owners of
property entitled to mailed notice. The notice must be deposited in the mail at least 10 days,
but not more than 25 days, prior to the date of the hearing. Within that same time period, the
City shall also prominently post a notice of the hearing on the site that is the subject of the
hearing or on an adjacent street or highway right-of-way.
C. The Board shall determine contested facts and make its decision within a reasonable time.
Every quasi-judicial decision shall be based upon competent, material, and substantial
evidence in the record.
D. Each quasi-judicial decision shall be reduced to writing and reflect the Boards determination
of contested facts and their application to the applicable standards. The written decision shall
be signed by the chair or other duly authorized member of the Board. A quasi-judicial
decision is effective upon filing the written decision with the clerk to the Board or such other
office or official as the ordinance specifies. The decision of the Board shall be delivered by
personal delivery, electronic mail, or by first-class mail to the applicant, property owner, and
to any person who has submitted a written request for a copy, prior to the date the decision
becomes effective. The person required to provide notice shall certify that proper notice has
been made.
E. The chair of the Board or any member acting as chair and the clerk to the Board are
authorized to administer oaths to witnesses in any matter coming before the Board. Any
person who, while under oath during a proceeding before the Board of Adjustment, willfully
swears falsely is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
F. The Board of Adjustment through the chair, or in the chairs absence anyone acting as chair,
may subpoena witnesses and compel the production of evidence. To request issuance of a
subpoena, persons with standing under NCGS 160A-393(d) may make a written request to
the chair explaining why it is necessary for certain witnesses or evidence to be compelled.
The chair shall issue requested subpoenas he or she determines to be relevant, reasonable in
nature and cope, and not oppressive. The chair shall rule on any motion to quash or modify a
subpoena. Decisions regarding subpoenas made by the chair may be appealed to the full
Board of Adjustment. If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena issued pursuant to this
subsection, the Board of Adjustment or the party seeking the subpoena may apply to the
General Court of Justice for an order requiring that its subpoena be obeyed, and the court
shall have jurisdiction to issue these orders after notice to all proper parties.
G. Board of Adjustment members shall not participate in or vote on any quasi-judicial matter in
a manner that would violate affected persons constitutional rights to an impartial decision
maker. Impermissible violations of due process include, but are not limited to, a member
having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible to change,
undisclosed ex parte communications, a close familial, business, or other associational
15-13
City of Clinton Land Development Ordinance
CHAPTER 15: ADMINISTRATION &ENFORCEMENT
relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the outcome of the matter. If an
objection is raised to a members participation and the member does not recuse himself or
herself, the remaining members shall by majority vote rule on the objection.
H. Every quasi-judicial decision shall be subject to review by the superior court by proceedings
in the nature of certiorari pursuant to NCGS 160A-393. A petition for review shall be filed
with the clerk of superior court by the later of 30 days after the decision is effective or after a
written copy thereof is given in accordance with this Section. When first class mail is used to
deliver notice, three (3) days shall be added to the time to file the petition.
15.7.5 Modification of Application to Hearing
A. When an appeal is taken to the Board of Adjustment, the Administrator shall have the initial
burden of presenting to the Board sufficient evidence and argument to justify the order or
decision appealed from. The burden of presenting evidence and argument to the contrary
then shifts to the appellant, who shall have the burden of persuasion.
B. The burden of presenting evidence sufficient to allow the Board of Adjustment to reach the
conclusions regarding findings-of-fact, as well as the burden of persuasion on those issues,
remains with the applicant seeing the variance.
15.7.6 Record
A. A tape recording shall be made of all hearings and such recordings shall be kept for at least
two (2) years. Accurate minutes shall also be kept of all such proceedings, but a transcript
need not be made.
B. Whenever practicable, all documentary evidence presented at a hearing as well as all other
types of physical evidence shall be made a part of the record of the proceedings and shall be
kept by the City for at least two (2) years.
Section 15.8 Enforcement & Judicial Review
15.8.1 Complaints Regarding Violations
Whenever the Administrator receives a written, signed complaint alleging a violation of this
Ordinance, he/she shall investigate the complaint, take whatever action is warranted, and inform
the complainant in writing what actions have been or will be taken.
15.8.2 Persons Liable
The owner, tenant, or occupant of any building, or land, or part thereof, and any architect,

be appealed to the Board of Adjustment if the offender was sent a final notice of violation
and did not take an appeal to the Board of Adjustment within the prescribed time.
C. This Ordinance may also be enforced by any appropriate equitable action.
D. Each day that any violation continues after notification by the Administrator that such
violation exists shall be considered a separate offense for purposes of the penalties and
