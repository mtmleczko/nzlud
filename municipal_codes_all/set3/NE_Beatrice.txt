PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Beatrice, Nebraska, of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1971 Code, as supplemented through July 15, 1985, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the city Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 7 is numbered 7-1 and the eighth section of Chapter 5 is 5-8. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 5-4 and 5-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 5-4.1, 5-4.2 and 5-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 4 and 5, it will be designated as Chapter 4.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Ms. Rhonda L. Haney, City Attorney, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-106. - Same-Procedure.

(c)  Suspension. The police or fire chief shall have the authority to immediately suspend, with pay, an employee against whom such written accusation has been filed, pending the confirmation of the suspension, or a decision of the city administrator to reinstate the employee, remove, demote, discharge, or suspend the employee, with or without pay. 
(d)  Investigation. Prior to the decision of the city administrator to reinstate the employee or remove, demote, discharge, or suspend the employee, with or without pay, the police or fire chief shall within a reasonable period of time investigate the alleged misconduct, charges, or grounds against the employee and explain the basis of the employer's evidence against the employee and provide the employee an opportunity to present his or her version of the circumstances which resulted in the filing of the written accusation. If the chief's investigation reveals other misconduct, charges or grounds the chief shall amend the written accusation to include the other misconduct, charges, or grounds by filing an amendment to the written accusations with the secretary of the commission who shall cause a copy of such amended accusation to be delivered within forty-eight (48) hours after the filing (1) to the police or fire chief, (2) to the city administrator and (3) to the employee personally or by certified mail, addressed to the employee at the residence address of the employee shown in the personnel records. The secretary of the commission shall cause a return showing such delivery or mailing to be executed and filed in the secretary's office.

Upon completion of this procedure within a reasonable period of time, the police or fire chief shall recommend in writing to the city administrator that the alleged misconduct, charges, or grounds set forth in the written accusation be deemed: (1) To be without merit, (2) to not warrant disciplinary action, (3) to warrant disciplinary action less severe than removal, demotion, discharge, or suspension, with or without pay, such as oral or written reprimand, or (4) to warrant removal, demotion, discharge, or suspension, with or without pay. 
(f)  Decision by administrator. Within five (5) calendar days after receiving the written recommendation of the police or fire chief, the city administrator shall decide to accept the recommendation of the police or fire chief, or shall decide that the alleged misconduct, charges, or grounds for investigation against the employee set forth in the written accusation be deemed: (1) To be without merit, (2) to not warrant disciplinary action, (3) to warrant disciplinary action less severe than removal, demotion, discharge, or suspension, with or without pay, such as an oral or written reprimand, or (4) to warrant removal, demotion, discharge, or suspension, with or without pay.

Any employee so removed, suspended, demoted or discharged may, within ten (10) calendar days after receiving written notice of the city administrator's decision, file a written demand for an investigation and public hearing by the civil service commission. The employee shall file the request for the hearing with the secretary of the commission and simultaneously send a copy of the request to the city administrator. The failure to file such a request with the secretary of the commission within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of notice of the action by the city administrator shall constitute a waiver of the employee's right to review by the civil service commission and the city administrator's decision shall become final. 
(h)  Notice by administrator. Within four (4) calendar days of receipt of the employee's notice of appeal, the city administrator shall cause to be mailed or delivered the following notice to the employee and secretary of the civil service commission:

(2)  The names of the witnesses who will be called on behalf of the employee and a general statement of the nature of their testimony; and

The investigation shall consist solely of a review of the written submissions of the city administrator and employee to determine whether any individuals or documents should be subpoenaed by the commission for the subsequent public hearing before the commission ultimately to determine whether the city administrator acted in good faith for cause. Good faith for cause shall mean that the action was not arbitrary or capricious and was not made for political or religious reasons. 
(k)  Notice-Hearing.

(m)  Decision of commission. 
(1)  The commission may affirm the action taken by the city administrator if such action is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. If the commission finds that the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge was made for political or religious reasons or was not made in good faith for cause, it shall order the immediate reinstatement or reemployment of such employee in the position or employment from which such employee was removed, suspended, demoted, or discharged, which reinstatement shall, if the commission in its discretion so provides, be retroactive and entitle such person to compensation and restoration of benefits and privileges from the time of such removal, suspension, demotion, or discharge. 
(2)  After the hearing, in lieu of affirming the removal, suspension, demotion, or discharge, the commission may modify the order of removal, suspension, demotion, or discharge by directing a suspension, with or without pay, for a given period and the subsequent restoration to duty or demotion in position or pay. No later than ten (10) calendar days after the hearing the commission shall certify its findings in writing to the employee and the city administrator who shall enforce them.

Sec. 7-13. - Storm water management. 
(a)  Design. 
(1)  All improved parcels of real estate shall have a storm water pollution prevention plan approved by the city. 
(2)  The design of the storm water management plan shall consist of a storm water pollution prevention plan and on-site retention of storm water for all developments unless the site is served by a storm sewer, channel or natural drainageway having an adequate outlet capacity from the development to a major drainage outfall such as, but not limited to, a storm drain or natural watercourse approved by the city engineer as a safe place to deposit such waters. Design shall be based on environmentally sound site planning and engineering techniques. 
(3)  To maximum degree possible, drainage from improved parcels of real estate shall conform to the natural contours of land and not disturb pre-existing drainageways. 
(4)  Adjacent properties shall not be unduly burdened with surface water from the subdivision. Specifically: 
a.  There may be no unreasonable impediment of water from higher adjacent properties across subdivision, causing damage to lower properties. 
b.  No action shall unreasonably collect and channel storm water onto lower properties. 
(5)  Design of on-site retention shall use the best available technology to compute difference of water volumes between the historic and developed flows resulting from a twenty-five year frequency storm. The tributary areas used in the computation shall be the area of the subdivision or the development site, unless another jurisdiction has more stringent requirements. The requirement for on-site retention may be waived by the city engineer if he determines that the retention is impractical because of, but not limited to steep terrain, poor percolation, or incompatibility with existing or surrounding improvements. The city engineer may require additional drainage studies or reports in such cases to determine if a critical drainage problem will be created on adjacent or downstream properties, encourage natural infiltration, simulate natural drainage, and minimize discharge of pollutants. Best available technology may also include swales, porous paving, and terracing. 
(6)  No surface water may be channeled into a sanitary sewer system. 
(7)  Where possible, an improved parcel of real estate drainage plan shall coordinate with that of surrounding properties or streets. 
(8)  The preliminary plat submission must include the preliminary drainage plan. All final plats shall include a certification from a registered professional engineer that the storm water management plan of the subdivision is designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
(b)  Definition. 
    On-site retention: The retention of storm water volume that falls on the site for a given design frequency storm, the site being exclusive of public streets, alleys or other land dedicated for public use.

b.  Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in this chapter, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway. 
(3)  Red indication. 
a.  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such line then before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no crosswalk then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as provided in paragraphs 3b. and 3c. of this section.

Sec. 17-8. - Restitution. 
(a)  A sentencing court may order the defendant to make restitution for the actual physical injury or property damage or loss sustained by the victim as a direct result of the offense for which the defendant has been convicted. Whenever the court believes that restitution may be a proper sentence or the victim of any offense or the city attorney requests, the court shall order that the presentence investigation report include documentation regarding the nature and amount of the actual damages sustained by the victim. 
(b)  To determine the amount of restitution, the court may hold a hearing at the time of sentencing. The amount of restitution shall be based on the actual damages sustained by the victim and shall be supported by evidence which shall become a part of the court record. The court shall consider the defendant's earning ability, employment status, financial resources, and family or other legal obligations and shall balance such considerations against the obligation to the victim. A person may not be granted or denied probation either solely or primarily due to his or her financial resources or ability or inability to pay restitution. The court may order that restitution be made immediately, in specified installments, or within a specified period of time, not to exceed five (5) years after the date of judgment or defendant's final release date from imprisonment, whichever is later. 
(c)  In determining restitution, if the offense results in damage, destruction, or loss of property, the court may require: (1) Return of the property to the victim, if possible; (2) payment of the reasonable value of repairing the property, including property returned by the defendant; or (3) payment of the reasonable replacement value of the property, if return or repair is impossible, impractical, or inadequate. If the offense results in bodily injury, the court may require payment of necessary medical care, including, but not limited to, physical or psychological treatment and therapy, and payment for income lost due to such bodily injury. 
(Ord. No. 91-41, § 3, 9-16-91) 
Sec. 17-9. - Restitution; collateral payment; probation; revocation; adjustments. 
(a)  The court shall not impose restitution for a loss for which the victim has received compensation, except that the court may order payment by the defendant to any person who has compensated the victim to the extent that such compensation has been provided. Any amount paid to a victim pursuant to an order of restitution shall be set off against any amount later recovered as compensatory damages in a civil action. 
(b)  If the defendant is placed on probation, the court may revoke probation, if the defendant fails to comply with the restitution order. In determining whether to revoke probation, the court shall consider the defendant's earning ability and financial resources, the willfulness of the defendant's failure to pay, and any special circumstances affecting the defendant's ability to pay. Probation may not be revoked unless noncompliance with the restitution order is attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order or a failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the order. 
(c)  A defendant, victim, or the personal representative of the victim's estate may petition the sentencing court to adjust or otherwise waive payment or performance of any ordered restitution or any unpaid or unperformed portion thereof. The court may schedule a hearing and give the parties notice of the hearing date, place, and time and inform the parties that he or she will have opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the circumstances upon which it based the imposition or amount and method of payment or other restitution ordered no longer exist or that it otherwise would be unjust to require payment or other restitution as imposed, the court may adjust or waive payment of the unpaid portion thereof or other restitution or modify the time or method of making restitution.

(b)  If restitution is imposed on an organization, it shall be the duty of any person authorized to order the disbursement of assets of the organization, and his or her superiors, to pay the restitution from assets of the organization under his or her control. Failure to do so shall render a person subject to an order to show cause why he or she should not be held in contempt of court.

The word "deceive" does not include falsity as to matters having no pecuniary significance, or statements unlikely to deceive ordinary persons in the group addressed. 
(Code 1971, § 23-37) 
Sec. 17-72. - Theft by extortion.

(Code 1971, § 23-37) 
Sec. 17-73. - Theft of property lost, mislaid or delivered by mistake. 
    A person who comes into control of property of another that he knows to have been lost, mislaid or delivered under a mistake as to the nature or amount of the property or the identity of the recipient commits theft if, with intent to deprive the owner thereof, he fails to take reasonable measures to restore the property to a person entitled to have it.

Services include labor, professional service, telephone service, electric service or other public service, accommodation in hotels, restaurants or elsewhere, admission to exhibitions and use of vehicles or other movable property. Where compensation for service is ordinarily paid immediately upon the rendering of such service, as in the case of hotels and restaurants, refusal to pay or absconding without payment or offer to pay gives rise to a presumption that the service was obtained by deception as to intention to pay. 
(b)  A person commits theft if, having control over the disposition of services of others, to which he or she is not entitled, he or she diverts such services to his or her own benefit or to the benefit of another not entitled thereto.

(b)  "Propelled vehicle" shall mean an automobile, airplane, motorcycle, motorboat or other motor-propelled vehicle.

ARTICLE III. - EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL 

Sec. 27-40. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose and intent of this article is to control or eliminate soil erosion and sedimentation within the jurisdictional limits of the city. It establishes standards and specifications for conservation practices and planning activities, which minimize soil erosion and sedimentation during the construction process to safeguard persons protect property and prevent damage to the environment. This article will also promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any best management practices (BMPs) used when development activities disturb or break the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the city. 
    During the construction process, soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. Eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing and grading during construction cause the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat. Following the completion of construction activities, dust, dirt and erosion will continue to affect the stormwater facilities and receiving streams unless post construction practices are put in place during the construction and maintained there after, until fully stabilized. 
    The article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels. 
(2)  Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development, which would otherwise degrade local water quality. 
(3)  Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff, which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable. 
(4)  Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non-point source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety. 
(Ord. No. 08-01, § 1, 1-21-08) 
Sec. 27-41. - Applicability. 
    This article shall apply to all land disturbance or land filling activities or soil storage where the total of volume of disturbed area that meets or exceeds one (1) acre. Land disturbance less than one (1) acre apply if the land disturbance is part of a larger development that disturbed one (1) acre or more. 
    Activities that do not require approved plans or permits must still provide BMPs as necessary to control water quality. Any surface intended for vehicular traffic shall provide vehicle sediment tracking control (VSTC). Areas with the possibility of sediment runoff will require protective measures at the request of the city, in order to minimize possible pollution to the storm sewer system. Minimum requirements for other activities may be obtained by written request to the city planning and building inspections department, accompanied by an adequate description of proposed work.

TABLE 41: PURPOSES OF ZONING DISTRICTS
Symbol Title Purpose
AG Agricultural The AG District provides for the agricultural and rural
use of land, while accommodating very low density
residential development in close proximity to developed
urban areas. The district is designed to provide for the
orderly transition of land use from agricultural to urban
uses where appropriate.
RR Rural Residential This district provides for very low density residential
environments, accommodating developments that merge
urban with rural life and institutions which require a
residential environment. The district's regulations assure
that density is consistent with the carrying capacity of
infrastructure.
R-1 Single-Family Residential This district is intended to provide for low-density
(Large Lot) residential neighborhoods, characterized by
single-family dwellings on large lots with supporting
community facilities. Its regulations are intended to
minimize traffic congestion and to assure that density is
consistent with the carrying capacity of infrastructure.
R-2 Single-Family Residential This district is intended to provide for medium-density
(Small Lot) residential neighborhoods, characterized by singlefamily
dwellings on small to moderately-sized lots with
supporting community facilities. It provides special
regulations to encourage innovative forms of housing
development. Its regulations are intended to minimize
traffic congestion and to assure that density is consistent
with the carrying capacity of infrastructure.
R-3 Urban Family Residential This district is intended to provide for medium-density
residential neighborhoods, with single-family
characteristics, while permitting latitude in the physical
design of housing. It adapts to both established and
developing neighborhoods, as well as transitional areas
between single-family and multi-family neighborhoods.
Its regulations are intended to minimize traffic
congestion and to assure that density is consistent with
the carrying capacity of infrastructure.
R-4 Multiple-Family This district is intended to provide locations for a variety
Residential of housing types, including multiple-family housing,
with supporting and appropriate community facilities.
The district integrates some appropriate non-residential
uses in order to develop fully urban neighborhoods. In
addition, the district provides a special permit process
4-6
for the approval of mobile home developments based on
standards for good quality development.
RC Residential-Commercial This district is intended to address the special needs of
mixed use neighborhoods that combine residential areas
with nearby or adjacent office and commercial
development. It permits uses that are mutually
compatible. These districts are generally adjacent to
major community arterials. In addition, the district
provides a special permit process for the approval of
mobile home developments based on standards for good
quality development.
O Office This district reserves appropriately located area for
office development and distinguishes office uses from
other, more intensive commercial activities and to
provide suitable office environments in the city. The
office district is also designed to permit a mixture of
uses that are compatible with office development and to
facilitate planning for traffic generation.
LC Limited Commercial This district provides for neighborhood shopping
facilities which serve the needs of residents of
surrounding residential communities. The commercial
and office uses permitted are generally compatible with
nearby residential areas. Development regulations are
designed to ensure compatibility in size, scale, and
landscaping with nearby residences.
GC General Commercial This district provides for a variety of commercial, office,
and service uses and is adapted to Beatrice's largest
commercial districts outside of Downtown. Uses and
developments in the GC District may develop substantial
traffic, creating potential land use conflict with adjacent
residential neighborhoods. This district is most
appropriate along arterials or in areas that can be well
buffered from residential districts.
CBD Central Business This district is intended to provide appropriate
development regulations for Downtown Beatrice. Mixed
uses are encouraged within the CBD District. The
grouping of uses is designed to strengthen Downtown's
role as a center for trade, service, and civic life.
CS Highway Service This district is intended for application in rural or urban
fringe areas along major highways, to provide limited
uses appropriate to the needs of highway users.
LI Light Industrial This district is intended to reserve sites appropriate for
the location of industrial uses with relatively limited
environmental effects. The district is designed to provide
appropriate space and regulations to encourage good
quality industrial development, while assuring that
4-7
facilities are served with adequate parking and loading
facilities.
GI General Industrial This district is intended to accommodate a wide variety
of industrial uses, some of which may have significant
external effects. These uses may have operating
characteristics that create conflicts with lower-intensity
surrounding land uses. The district provides the
reservation of land for these activities and includes
buffering requirements to reduce incompatibility.
FW Floodway This district applies to lands within the select floodways
of rivers and streams in the Beatrice jurisdiction. It is
intended to assure the free flowing of flood waters and
minimize potential damage to property by allowing only
light development and open space that is compatible
with the flood-prone nature of these lands. The locations
of FW Floodway Districts are defined by the Flood
Insurance Rate Maps and other documents issued by the
Federal Emergency Management Administration.

ARTICLE FIVE 
SPECIAL AND OVERLAY DISTRICTS
CHAPTER 1  STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT & PURPOSE
501 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The Legislature of the State of Nebraska has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. The Legislature,
in Sections 31-1001 to 31-1022, R.R.S. 1943 (as amended), has further assigned the responsibility to adopt,
administer, and enforce floodplain management regulations to the county, city or village with zoning
jurisdiction over the flood-prone area.
502 FINDINGS OF FACT
(a) Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation
The flood hazard areas of the City of Beatrice, Nebraska, are subject to inundation which results in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b) General Causes of the Flood Losses
These flood losses are caused by: (1) The cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing
increases in flood heights and velocities, (2) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable
to floods or hazardous to others, which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood
damages.
(c) Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards
This article uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of
interrelated steps.
1. Selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a
consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated,
and the depth of inundation. The base flood is selected for this article. It is representative of large
floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular
streams subject to this article. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have
a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one year, as delineated on the Federal Insurance
Administration's Flood Insurance Study, and illustrative materials dated June 18, 2010 as
amended.
2. Calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of
the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood.
5-3
3. Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more
than 1 foot at any point.
4. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which
would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile.
5. Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment lines, but which
still is subject to inundation by the base flood.
503 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize
those losses described in Section 502 (a) by applying the provisions of this article to:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flooding or
cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities.
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be provided
with flood protection at the time of initial construction.
(c) Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood
hazard.
(d) Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood
insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.
CHAPTER 2  DEFINITIONS
505 Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give
them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application:
a. "Appeal" means a request for a review of the Chief Building Inspector's interpretation of any
provision of this article or a request for a variance.
b. Appurtenant/Accessory Structure means a structure on the same parcel of property as the principal
structure, the use of which is incidental to the use of the principle structure.
c. "Area of Shallow Flooding" means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average
depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel is unpredictable and where velocity flow
may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
d. "Base Flood" means the flood having one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any
given year.
e. "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all
sides.
5-4
f. "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but
not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or
drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
g. "Existing Construction" means (for the purposes of determining rates) structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975,
for FIRM's effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing
structures."
h. "Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision" means a manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured
homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is complete before the effective
date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
i. Expansion to an Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision means the preparation of
additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured
homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either
final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
j. "Flood" or "Flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
(1) The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
(2) The usual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
k. "Flood Fringe" is that area of the floodplain, outside of the floodway, that on the average is likely to
be flooded once every 100 years (i.e., that has a one percent chance of flood occurrence in any one
year).
l. "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means an official map of a community, on which the Flood
Insurance Study has delineated the Flood Hazard Boundaries and the zones establishing insurance
rates applicable to the community.
m. "Flood Insurance Study" is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the Flood Boundary Floodway Map and the

definition of "flooding").
o. "Floodway" or "Regulatory Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
p. "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of
floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could
contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
5-5
conditions, such as wave action, clogged bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization
of the watershed.
q. "Highest Adjacent Grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to
construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
r. "Historic Structure" means any structure that is: (a) Listed individually in the National Register of
Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the
Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;
(b) Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the
historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the
Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; (c) Individually listed on a state inventory of
historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or (d) Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: (1) By an approved
state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or (2) Directly by the Secretary of the
Interior in states without approved programs.
s. "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An
unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided
that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation
design requirements of this article.
t. "Manufactured Home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to
the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
u. "Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided
into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
v. "New Construction" For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for
which the "start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of the floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
w. "New Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision
for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to

underlying zoning district(s). The original zoning district designation does not change.
y. "Principally Above Ground" means that at least 51 percent of the actual cash value of the structure is
above ground.
5-6
z. "Recreational Vehicle" means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) 400 square feet or
less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or
permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
aa. "Special Flood Hazard Area" is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to one percent
or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
bb. "Start of Construction" [for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the
coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)] includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond
the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation
on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not
part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not the
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
cc. "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, as well as a
manufactured home, and a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
dd. "Substantial Damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
ee. "Substantial Improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement
of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred
"substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or
local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or (2) any
alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a "historic structure."
ff. "Variances" is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article which permits
construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would result
in unnecessary hardship.
gg. Violation means a failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the
communitys floodplain management regulations.

CHAPTER 3  GENERAL PROVISIONS
507 LANDS TO WHICH ARTICLE APPLIES
This article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Beatrice, Nebraska identified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated June 18, 2010, as numbered and unnumbered A Zones (including
AE, AO and AH Zones) and within the Zoning Districts FW and FF established in this article. In all areas
covered by this article no development shall be permitted except upon the issuance of a floodplain permit to
develop, granted by the City Engineer and Chief Building Inspector under such safeguards and restrictions
as the City Council may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare,
health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in this Article.
508 THE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER
The Chief Building Inspector or City Engineer of the community is hereby designated as the community's
duly designated Enforcement Officer under this Article.
509 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
The boundaries of the floodway and flood fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances
on the official zoning map or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map or Floodway Map. Where interpretation is
needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map, as for
example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the
Enforcement Officer shall make the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is
contested, the City Administrator, Mayor and Chairman of Planning and Zoning will resolve the dispute.
The regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district
boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to present his case to the City Administrator, Mayor and Chairman of Planning and
Zoning and to submit his own technical evidence, if he so desires.
510 COMPLIANCE
Within identified special flood hazard areas of this community, no development shall be located, extended,
converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable
regulations.
511 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS
It is not intended by this article to repeal, abrogate or impair any existent easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this article imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this article shall
prevail. All other articles inconsistent with this article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency
only.
512 INTERPRETATION
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum
requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
5-8
513 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the
flood height may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside floodway and flood fringe district
boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage. This
article shall not create liability on the part of the City of Beatrice, Nebraska or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
514 SEVERABILITY
If any section, clause, provision or portion of this article is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court
of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this article shall not be affected thereby.
515 APPEAL
Where a request for a permit to develop or a variance is denied by the Chief Building Inspector the
applicant may apply for such permit or variance directly to the City Administrator, Mayor and Chairman of
Planning and Zoning.
516-519 RESERVED
CHAPTER 4  DEVELOPMENT PERMIT
520 PERMIT REQUIRED
No person, firm or corporation shall initiate any floodplain development or substantial improvement or
cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate permit for development as defined in Section
505.
521 ADMINISTRATION
a. The Chief Building Inspector is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this
article.
b. Duties of the Chief Building Inspector shall include, but not be limited to:
(1) Review all development permit applications to assure that sites are reasonably safe from flooding

CHAPTER 5  ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS
525 Along watercourses where a floodway has been established, the mapped floodplain areas are hereby divided
into the two following districts: A floodway overlay district (FW) and a flood fringe overlay district (FF) as
identified in the Flood Insurance Study [and accompanying map(s)]. Within these districts all uses not
meeting the standards of this article and those standards of the underlying zoning district shall be
prohibited.
526-529 RESERVED
5-10
CHAPTER 6  STANDARDS FOR FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT
530 No permit for development shall be granted for new construction, substantial improvements and other
development(s) including the placement of manufactured homes within all numbered and unnumbered A
zones (including AE, AO, and AH zones) unless the conditions of this Chapter are satisfied.
531 All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation of the base flood;
however, the water surface elevation was not provided. The unnumbered A zones shall be subject to all
development provisions of Chapter 7. If Flood Insurance Study data is not available, the community shall
utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State or other sources.
532 Until a floodway has been designated, no development or substantial improvement may be permitted within
special flood hazard areas unless the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed development or
substantial improvement, when combined with all other existing and reasonably anticipated developments
or substantial improvements, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
(1) foot at any location as shown on the Flood Insurance Study.
533 New construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvements, prefabricated buildings, placement of
manufactured homes and other developments shall require:
a. Design or anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
b. New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters,
and on-site waste disposal systems be located so as to avoid impairment or contamination.
c. Construction with materials resistant to flood damage, utilizing methods and practices that minimize
flood damages, and with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and
other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
d. All utility and sanitary facilities be elevated or floodproofed up to the regulatory flood protection
elevation.
534 Storage of Material and Equipment
a. The storage or processing of materials that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or
could be injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited.
b. Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods
and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or if readily removable from the area within the time
available after flood warning.
535 Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or
subdivisions, be required to assure that (a) all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage, (b) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located,
elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, (c) adequate drainage is provided so as to
reduce exposure to flood hazards, and (d) proposals for development (including proposals for manufactured
5-11
home parks and subdivision) of five (5) acres or fifty (50) lots, whichever is lesser, include within such
proposals the base flood elevation.

on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing items (b -e below) have been fully considered. As the
lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
b. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that
the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the

floodway profile during the base flood discharge would result.
d. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
e. Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that
failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a
determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats
to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or articles.
5-16
f. The applicant shall be given a written notice over the signature of a community official that (1) the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100 of insurance coverage
and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such
notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required by this article.

ARTICLE NINE 
OFF-STREET PARKING
901 Purpose
The Off-Street Parking Regulations require that developments provide parking in proportion to the need
created by each use. These regulations further establish standards for the functional design of parking
facilities. These regulations are intended to accommodate vehicles in a functionally satisfactory manner
and to minimize external effects on neighboring properties.
902 General Applications
A site development plan for an off-street parking facility shall be prepared and submitted to the building
official for review and approval prior to the issuance of a building permit. Before approving any offstreet
parking facility layout, the building official shall ensure that the requirements set forth in this
Article are satisfied and that the spaces provided are usable and meet standard design criteria.
Nothing in this Article shall prevent the voluntary establishment of an off-street parking facility to serve
any existing use, provided that all requirements are complied with.
Off-street parking spaces required herein shall be utilized solely for the parking of passenger
automobiles or light trucks of less than one (1) ton capacity of employees, occupants, or customers and
such spaces shall not be used for the storage or display of materials or products or the repair or
dismantling of any materials.
A. Applicability
Off-street parking shall be provided for any new building constructed, for new uses or conversions
of existing buildings, for enlargements of existing structures, or if the use of any buildings, structure
or premises is changed which will have the effect of increasing the need for parking spaces.
B. Exemptions
Any use within the Central Business District (CBD) is exempt from the off-street parking
requirements provided by Section 903. Any off-street parking facility constructed in the CBD
District after the effective date of this Ordinance must comply with the design standards set forth in
this Article.
A site development plan for off-street parking is not required for single-family dwellings.
903 Schedule of Off-Street Parking Requirements
Off-street parking for each use shall be provided in accord with the minimum requirements set forth in
Table 9-1.
9-3
A. Computation
1. When a computation of required parking results in a fraction of .5 or greater, the requirement
should be rounded up to the next whole number.
2. Unless otherwise indicated, parking requirements are based on gross floor area. Gross floor
areas for the purpose of this calculation exclude any interior space used for the parking or
loading of vehicles.
3. When parking requirements are computed on the basis of capacity, capacity shall be
determined by the building code in effect for the City of Beatrice at the time the use is
established.
B. Combination of Uses
Where there is a combination of uses for an off-street parking facility, agreements may be made
between uses which generate parking demands at different times in such a manner that the
requirements of more than one use may be met by the same space. Provided, the parking demand
for each such use involved is in fact met. Such agreements shall be approved by the building
official and kept on file. The building official shall be contacted within three business days at such
time the parking agreement is terminated or any changes to the agreement have been made. At such
time the building official shall determine if the intent of this Article has been maintained. The city
council may at any time terminate a parking agreement when it is determined that the intent of this
Article has not been met.

ZONING ORDINANCE
ARTICLE ELEVEN
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
LAST UPDATED  SEPTEMBER 2014
axuÜtá~t
11-2
ARTICLE ELEVEN 
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
1101 Purpose
The Performance Standards establish minimum standards that apply to the operations of individual use
types within zoning districts. They are intended to insure that uses control the severity of external
effects and operate in a way that is consistent with the public health, safety, and welfare.
1102 Uses in the LI Limited Industrial Zoning District
The following performance standards apply to all industrial uses permitted within an LI Limited
Industrial zoning district:
1. Physical Appearance: All operations shall be carried on within an enclosed building except that
new materials or equipment in operable condition may be stored outside. Normal daily inorganic
wastes may be stored outside in containers, provided that such containers are not visible from the
street.
2. Fire Hazard: No operation shall involve the use of highly flammable gases, acid, liquids, or other
inherent fire hazards. This prohibition shall not apply to the normal use of heating or motor fuels
and welding gases when handled in accordance with other City regulations.
3. Maximum Permitted Sound Levels Adjacent to Residential Zoning Districts: No operation in
the LI district shall generate noise in excess of the levels established in Section 1104 at the
boundary of such operation with a non-industrial use. Noise shall be measured at the property line,
using a suitable instrument. All noises shall be muffled so as not to be objectionable due to
intermittence, beat frequency, or shrillness.
4. Sewage and Wastes: No operation shall discharge into a sewer, drainage way, or the ground any
material which is radioactive, poisonous, detrimental to normal sewer plant operation, or corrosive
to sewer pipes and installations.
5. Air Contaminants
(a) Air contaminants and smoke shall be less dark than the designated Number One on the
Ringleman Chart published by the United States Bureau of Mines, except that smoke of the
density of Number One shall be permitted no more than four minutes of any 30-minute period.
(b) Except as follows, particulate matter shall not be emitted from its point of origin in excess of
0.2 grain per cubic foot as corrected to a temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Emissions are
permitted equal to or less than 0.6 grains per cubic foot for no more than four minutes of any
30-minute period.
11-3
(c) No material may be discharged into the air from any source in such quantity as to cause injury,
detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of people or to the public in
general; or to endanger the health, comfort, or safety of any considerable number of people or
to the public in general; or to damage other businesses, vegetation, or property.
(d) No material may be discharged into the air from any source in such quantity as to cause injury,
detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of people or to the public in
general; or to endanger the health, comfort, or safety of any considerable number of people or
to the public in general; or to damage other businesses, vegetation, or property.
6. Odor: The emission of odors determined by the Planning Commission to be obnoxious to most
people shall be prohibited. Such odors shall be measured at the property line of the operation
causing the odor. As a guide to classification of odors, the strong odors of putrefaction and
fermentation tend to be "obnoxious, " while odors associated with baking or the roasting of nuts or
coffee shall not normally be considered to be "obnoxious."
7. Gases: No release of noxious or poisonous gases shall be permitted except as provided in this
section. Measurements of sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, or carbon monoxide shall not exceed 5
parts per million; and nitrous fumes shall not exceed 1 part per million, taken at the property line of
the operation originating the emissions.
8. Vibration: All machines shall be mounted to minimize vibration. No measurable vibration shall
occur at the property line of the operation which exceeds a displacement of .003 inch. The use of
broad steam hammers shall not be permitted.
9. Glare and Heat: All glare, such as welding arcs and open furnaces, generated by a use shall be
shielded or directed so as not to be visible at the property line of the operation. No heat may be
generated from an operation that raises the air temperature at the property line of the operation by
more than five degrees Fahrenheit above the ambient air temperature.
1103 Uses in the GI District: Performance Standards
The following performance standards apply to all industrial uses permitted within a GI General
Industrial zoning district:
1. Physical Appearance: Salvage Services and similar uses and operations shall be screened from
view from both streets and adjacent properties as provided by Section 606(d) and Article Eight.
2. Fire Hazard: All flammable substances involved in any activity established in the district shall be
handled in conformance with the latest edition of the Fire Prevention Code published by the
American Insurance Association; and other appropriate Federal, State, and City Ordinances.
3. Maximum Permitted Sound Levels Adjacent to Residential Zoning Districts: No operation in the
GI district shall generate sound levels in excess of those specified in Section 1104 at the boundary
of a residential district. All noises shall be muffled so as not to be objectionable because of
intermittence, beat frequency, or shrillness.
11-4
4. Sewage and Wastes: No operation shall discharge into a sewer, drainage way, or the ground any
material which is radioactive, poisonous, detrimental to normal sewer plant operation, or corrosive
to sewer pipes and installations.
5. Air Contaminants
(a) Air contaminants and smoke shall be less dark than the designated Number One on the
Ringleman Chart published by the United States Bureau of Mines, except that smoke of the
density of Number Two shall be permitted no more than ten minutes of any 30-minute period.
(b) Except as follows, particulate matter shall not be emitted from its point of origin in excess of
0.2 grain per cubic foot as corrected to a temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Emissions are
permitted equal to or less than 0.6 grains per cubic foot for no more than four minutes of any
30-minute period.
(c) No material may be discharged into the air from any source in such quantity as to cause injury,
detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of people or to the public in
general; or to endanger the health, comfort, or safety of any considerable number of people or
to the public in general; or to damage other businesses, vegetation, or property.
6. Odor: Odor causing operations shall be controlled so as to minimize the escape of odors within the
limits of technology and economic feasibility.
7. Gases: No release of noxious or poisonous gases shall be permitted except as provided in this
section. Measurements of sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, or nitrous fumes shall not exceed 5
parts per million; and carbon monoxide shall not exceed 25 parts per million, with measurements
taken at the property line of the operation.
8. Vibration: All machines shall be mounted to minimize vibration. No vibration shall be permitted
which interferes with neighboring industrial operations.
1104 Maximum Permitted Sound Levels
Table 11-1 displays the maximum permitted sound levels that may be generated by uses in the LI and GI
zoning districts where adjacent to residential zoning districts. All measurements shall be taken at or
within the boundary between the originating district and the adjacent residential zoning district with a
sound level meter meeting ANSI specifications for a Type II or better general purpose sound level
meter. The A-weighted response shall be used.

compliance with the minimum lot area and lot width requirements, nor shall any division of
any parcel be made which creates lots which do not comply with such requirements.
